    Chapter 112: Warm-hearted patrol officer (1)
    16th of July.
    
    The weather was hot and stuffy.
    
    It was very stuffy, making people feel a little breathless. Those who understood knew that this was a sign of a storm coming.
    
    In the morning.
    
    Li Hao leisurely rode his bike toward the inspection Office with one hand on the horse, the other eating a bun, and the other holding the handle.
    
    It was a peaceful night.
    
    He didn’t see the red shadow, the demon hunting squad didn’t look for him, the teacher didn’t contact him, and Wang Ming didn’t harass him ...
    
    Even Heibao was very obedient last night and didn’t make a sound.
    
    Last night was a rare good night.
    
    Beside the bicycle, small cars whizzed past.
    
    Silver 7219.
    
    It was a familiar car plate number.
    
    Li Hao ate his bun and casually glanced at the food. He had the vigor and smile of a young man.
    
    He remembered that a few days ago, when the self-immolation case had been reported, this car had followed him.
    
    He hadn’t seen it for a few days, and he didn’t expect to see this car again.
    
    “Is it getting more and more urgent?”
    
    They were even monitoring him during the day, were they afraid that he would run away?
    
    Li Hao made a guess. If he suddenly ran away ... Would it be fun?
    
    Of course, if he ran now, it would be even more dangerous. He would disrupt some of Liu Long’s plans and would not be able to buy more time for his teacher.
    
    Yes, time.
    
    At this moment, Li Hao hoped to delay it.
    
    Even if his teacher had entered the warrior dimension, it would still take time for him to absorb the saber energy. The impact of the saber energy was too strong, and even his teacher might not be able to absorb too much at once.
    
    If he wanted to become stronger, he would need time.
    
    “Look at the flowers blooming and withering, making one feel tender and loving ...”
    
    Riding his bicycle and singing a song, Li Hao seemed to be in a good mood today.
    
    ……
    
    In the car.
    
    It was still a man and a woman. The car sped by, and the car window was down. Both of them heard Li Hao’s singing.
    
    It was very unpleasant to hear!
    
    After leaving Li Hao, the car continued to move.
    
    The woman in the passenger seat suddenly laughed.”Sometimes, people are really pitiful!”
    
    He was talking about Li Hao.
    
    He didn’t know that he was going to die, and that his death might be very miserable.
    
    At this moment, he was still singing a song. It was really sad.
    
    The middle-aged man who was driving also smiled faintly.”That’s normal. This is the sorrow of ordinary people!”
    
    The car slowly came to a stop.
    
    It seemed to be under repair.
    
    .
    
    The man got out of the car, and so did the woman. The car was parked by the side of the road, waiting for Li Hao.
    
    The higher-ups had given him a strict order to keep an eye on Li Hao for the next two days. Of course, Li Hao could just wait outside after entering the inspector’s office. The inspector’s office had its own arrangements.
    
    After a while.
    
    The bicycle passed by.
    
    Li Hao was still humming a tune when the tune was suddenly cut off. Li Hao stopped the car and looked at the small car parked by the roadside with an honest smile.
    
    “Do you two need any help?”
    
    Li Hao was very enthusiastic!
    
    “If there’s a problem, look for the patrol officer!”
    
    Li Hao smiled.”I’m the third rank patrol officer of the Patrol Division, Li Hao. I noticed that your car is broken. Do you need my help?”
    
    The two of them looked at each other in surprise.
    
    He was really ... Passionate!
    
    There were also some who didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. What silly children.
    
    Do you know who we are?
    
    The man glanced at Li Hao, smiled, and said softly,””Thank you, but there’s no need for that. We can fix it ourselves!”
    
    “You really don’t need to?”
    
    Li Hao stopped his bicycle and put it aside. He walked to the two of them, looked down at the bicycle, and asked,””Which part is broken? I’ve repaired cars before, and the chief patrol officer of the inspection Office is always helpful. Of course, if I can help you two repair your cars, it’d be best if you two can send a silk banner to the inspection Office ... Hahaha, I’m just joking, it’s fine if you don’t send it!”
    
    Li Hao looked embarrassed, as if he wanted it but was too embarrassed to say it.
    
    I just want a silk banner!
    
    The woman was amused. This guy in front of her who didn’t look like he had even grown all his hair could be really childish sometimes.
    
    A silk banner?
    
    “Chief patrol officer, you know how to repair cars?” the woman laughed.
    
    Li Hao smiled and couldn’t help feeling proud.””I will! Bosses, since I can afford to drive, I don’t mind ordering a silk banner ... Ahem, I’m considered a new member of the inspection Division. Bosses, you should know that a new member needs a chance to show off ... Because I’m about to be promoted to the second level inspection! I need some honor ... What do you think?”
    
    The two of them were really surprised and speechless!
    
    This guy was in a hurry to help them repair their car and even took the initiative to ask for a silk banner because he might be promoted!
    
    This, the two of them really knew.
    
    It was said that Li Hao was going to be transferred to the law-enforcement team. In that case, he would indeed have a great chance of being promoted.
    
    But now, the kid in front of him was about to lose his life. Did he really not know what was going on?
    
    Was there any use in getting promoted at this time?
    
    Even if you do, you won’t be able to enjoy it!
    
    The man smiled gently.”Then I’ll have to trouble patrol officer li. If you can fix the car, the pennant will be a must.”
    
    He now had a very mysterious feeling.
    
    If the person being followed took the initiative to strike up a conversation and offer help, perhaps ... It would be easier to complete the mission.
    
    It was very interesting!
    
    As far as he knew, Li Hao didn’t have any friends or family. He was a very reclusive person, and the higher-ups didn’t know much about Li Hao.
    
    If he had more contact with this guy, would he be able to provide better information to the higher ups?
    
    Moreover, the chief patrol officer was so friendly and it was weird for you to keep rejecting him.
    
    And Li Hao was not going to be polite.
    
    He opened the hood of the car and stuck his head in to take a look. He then touched the engine. After a while, he walked around the car and observed it. He asked curiously,”It can’t be activated? Is the engine overheating ...”


    Chapter 113: Chapter 31-warm-hearted patrol officer (2)
“I’ll try again,” the man said with a smile.”The engine just turned off, and I couldn’t start it a few times.”

“Alright, I’ve checked it and it doesn’t seem to be a big problem. The car is still new ...”

After exchanging a few words, the man got into the car and started the engine.

This time, the car was successfully ignited.

There had never been a problem. They had stopped here only to better follow Li Hao.

The woman’s face was also filled with joy at this time. She hurriedly said,””Chief patrol officer, many thanks!”

“Don ‘t, I feel like I didn’t do anything ... It’s a pity that the pennant flew away, but it’s good that the two of you are safe. It’s also the responsibility of the inspector’s office to solve the public’s problems!”

Li Hao smiled honestly!

The two of them seemed to be infected by his smile. The man got out of the car and said with a serious face,””You can’t say that. Patrol officer li is always helping others. We just arrived in the Silver City not long ago. It’s fate that we got to know patrol officer li ... How about this? let’s go and make a silk banner now and send it to the inspection Office later!”

“Don ‘t!”

Li Hao hurriedly waved his hands.”Really, don’t do this!”

She felt a little embarrassed and whispered,””That ... If that doesn’t work, I’ll pay for the banner! I don’t have many friends, otherwise I would have ... Cough, cough, you know, the chief patrol officer is also a person, it’s an honor to have an extra banner. If you two don’t mind, I can pay for it!”

The two of them were really amused.

So cute!

He was really pure and kind!

For the sake of a silk banner, he was embarrassed, but he couldn’t resist?

“Don’t worry,”the man laughed,”let’s not talk about money, chief patrol officer li. How much is a silk banner?” Wouldn’t that be like slapping my face?”

“Then ... I won’t be polite?”

Li Hao seemed to be very happy, and his smile was extremely bright. He looked at the time and said,””No, I’m going to be late! If I’m not here, go to the law enforcement team to find me. I’m about to be transferred to the law enforcement team ... In the future, I’ll be on duty outside more often. It’s good to be friends. Thank you!”

Li Hao hurriedly jumped on his bicycle, waved at the two of them, and quickly rode away.

After he left, the woman sighed.””I have to say, this kind of person is actually very interesting and very cute. He has a child’s heart and a sincere heart ... Unfortunately, you and I can no longer go back to the past!”

The man also nodded slightly.

He was infected by Li Hao’s smile.

Young people were indeed different.

Taking the initiative to help others, not everyone in the inspection Office was like this.

“Are we really going to deliver the pennant?” the woman asked again.

“Of course!”

The man laughed slyly,””Why not? There’s no problem with our identities, so it’s good for us to go in and have a look. It’s a rare opportunity to go to the inspector’s office openly!”

“With this opportunity, will anyone feel that it’s inappropriate for us to frequently appear near the inspection Office?” We can say that we’re going to find Li Hao and treat him to a meal or something ... To thank him for his help. Who would care about us?”

The woman thought about it and nodded.

That’s a good excuse!

This was really like giving a pillow when one was drowsy. He had been wondering if he would be discovered or suspected if he had been following Li Hao.

Now ... It was actually a little safer!

……

At the same time.

At the inspection Office.

Li Hao arrived with a big smile on his face.

“Lalalala, wuwuwu, today is a good day ...”

Xiao Ge started singing happily, waiting for the fish to take the bait.

He didn’t go to the interrogation room, but went straight to the law enforcement team.

Liu Yan’s office.

When Liu Yan heard the footsteps outside the door and the gradually quieted down singing, she was a little surprised. Why was this kid so happy today?

Thump thump thump!

The door was pushed open.

Li Hao was all smiles.”Sister Liu, you’re here so early?”

“En!”

Liu Yan leaned back in her chair, her long legs still resting on the table, looking extremely arrogant.

“You seem to be in a good mood today,” he said, feeling a little strange.

“Yeah!”

Li Hao smiled and said,”sister, I was thinking, am I a newbie noob?” I’ve never killed a chicken before, so I’m scared of blood. My legs are weak, and I’m afraid I’ll be scared to death when I see a big scene later. So I’ve decided to train my courage!”

What the hell?

Liu Yan was puzzled. Where could she find a place for him to train his courage?

There wasn’t enough time!

Li Hao seemed to know what she was thinking. He laughed and said,””No need to trouble boss and sister Liu, I found the target myself! Two martial masters ... Or one Martial Master and one ordinary person!”

Li Hao chuckled.”I’m looking for you to ask you to provide me with a venue. Also, I want you to give me some support. I’m a good student, and I’ve never fought before. I’m afraid of seeing blood. I’ll be scared silly!”

“……”

Liu Yan was a little stunned. She glanced at Li Hao. Today was really a little strange.”You ... Found a target yourself?” Li Hao, are you going to be bad?”

This guy, did he really take my words seriously when I said that I’m a superhuman and I can break the law?

Liu Yan’s face turned cold!

She had just said that, and her words were filled with ridicule. Did this kid not understand?

Find someone to be a target ... And see blood!

Would a good person say such things?

Liu Yan had never thought of herself as a good person, but she knew that she should not give what she did not want to others!

She had suffered the pain of being bullied and had no way to seek justice!

Chapter 114: The warm-hearted patrol officer (3)
And Li Hao seemed to be becoming such a person.

All of a sudden, his favorability fell to the negative, and he even felt some disgust!

Li Hao’s face was innocent, and his smile was bright.””Sis, the two bad guys following me are probably small characters controlled by the mastermind behind the self-immolation case! It was almost there. If he was not sure, he could try! In any case, there are no good people following me except for our team!”

Li Hao laughed happily,’didn’t I just enter the ten decapitation realm? It’s so boring to hit wooden targets every day, and they’re not useful in actual combat. I was thinking, I’ll get them to come over to my place and practice!”

“Catch people?”

Liu Yan raised her brows slightly.”Capturing someone at this time ... Isn’t it inappropriate to alert the enemy?” she asked.

Li Hao laughed,”no!” They will do it themselves! Also, sis, do you think we’re beating the grass and alerting the snake? I’m afraid that the other party already knows that we’re in the same group. It’s actually public now, but no one says it out loud!”

“That’s why they won’t care even if someone is caught or killed!”

Li Hao understood that the red shadow had known about Liu Long’s group’s existence for a long time. Why would he hide it?

He didn’t hide anything!

Apart from Yuan Shuo, the red shadow didn’t know, but Li Hao felt that Liu Long’s background had long been known.

Was there a problem with capturing two nobodies at this moment?

The other party would not care at all!

However, I’ll satisfy my craving first and practice my skills at the same time.

Liu Yan didn’t pay much attention to the latter part of his sentence. Instead, she was a little surprised.”Do it yourself?”

Do you think other people are idiots?

It’s fine if I’m following you, but you’re here by yourself?

Do you think I’m a fool?

Li Hao laughed,”really!” Those two guys are so enthusiastic. They said that they would be my target and even give me a banner ...”

Motherf * cker!

Li Hao, this little fellow, was getting more and more out of line!

Liu Yan was speechless.

Do you take me for a fool, or do you take others for fools?

‘I’m going to be your target, and then I’m going to give you a silk banner ... If you just say it directly, wouldn’t it be better if the other party gave you his head?’

“Get out!”

Liu Yan was a little impatient. The little guy was still very normal two days ago. Why did he suddenly lose his mind today? was he under too much pressure?

“It’s true ...”

“If you don’t get lost, I’ll give you a grenade!”

Li Hao felt helpless. Really!

Why wouldn’t he believe it?

At that moment, the office phone rang.

Liu Yan picked it up. It was a call from the front hall.

.

As soon as the call went through, he heard the patrol officer at the lobby Report,””Captain Liu, there are two people outside. They said they are here to give Li Hao a banner! The security room said that he’s in our law enforcement team. I asked around and heard that Li Hao went to your place. Is it convenient for you to let Li Hao come down for a while?”

Liu Yan was speechless.

Liu Yan looked at Li Hao in a daze. What was going on?

She hung up the phone, looked at Li Hao, and frowned.””Are you sure that the person who came to deliver the pennant was the one who followed you?”

“I’m 100% sure!”

Li Hao hurriedly nodded and said with a smile,””They came really quickly, just a little later than me. The efficiency of this pennant ... Tsk tsk, it’s really amazing!”

Li Hao was also happy.”Sister, I’ll go down for a while. Where do you think is the most suitable place to interrogate them?” he asked. I’ll bring them over. ”

“……”

Liu Yan was a little stunned.

‘Good fellow, you ... You’re really asking people to come to your door and stick out their heads for you to chop off?’

At this moment, she felt that the person who had been following Li Hao must have had a mental problem. Otherwise, why would he have come to Li Hao’s door to be a target?

Feeling a little strange, Liu Yan stood up.””I’ll go with you ...”

“Don ‘t!”

“Sister, just find a place!” Li Hao shook his head.

“Then ... You can take it to the basement!”

“You really don’t need me to go with you?” Liu Yan was speechless.

“There’s no need to go through so much trouble, they can just come in by themselves!”

Li Hao laughed.”Sister, you have to hold the line for me later. I’m really a little scared. This is my first time doing something like this. You know, I used to be a good student. After I became an inspector, I also worked as a civilian staff in the mechanisms room. This kind of bloody thing ... I’m really afraid that I’ll vomit and my legs will go weak!”

It was a little exaggerated, but it was the truth.

Seeing blood for the first time wasn’t the usual kind of seeing blood, but hurting and killing someone. In this case, it was common to have weak legs, guilty conscience, fear, and terror, unless one was born evil and had the tendency to kill.

And Li Hao indeed wanted to find a chance to practice before he encountered the red shadow.

He was afraid!

He was afraid that if he really saw a great battle, he would be afraid, his legs would go soft, and he would shiver.

This was human nature!

He didn’t think that he had a huge heart that could be indifferent when he saw a dead person.

When little Yuan died that day, he was already afraid and terrified. At that moment, he couldn’t even move his legs. His legs were so weak that he didn’t even have the strength to scream.

Therefore, when he passed by the two people this time, he suddenly had an idea.

“Perhaps ... I should train my cowardice.

Liu Yan’s impression of Li Hao was somewhat renewed. In her impression, Li Hao was a shy little boy with some talent, but he was just a noob who knew nothing and didn’t know anything.

In fact, she also felt that Li Hao would be a burden on the real battlefield. Whether he could survive ... Was really hard to say.

But at this moment, it was a little upended.

Li Hao, he found a target for himself to practice on and said he wanted to train his courage ... Was this still the Li Hao she knew?

She had investigated everything about Li Hao. This guy was an honest and kind person in the confidential room. He went to work early and late, cleaned the place, and served tea. He was very well-behaved.

Chapter 115: Chapter 31-warm-hearted patrol officer (4)
But now, what was he saying?

Unexpected!

He was even a little shocked. Could this guy have been invaded by supers?

“Li Hao ...”

“Sis, I’ll go down first. Can you wait for me in the basement?”

“……”

Liu Yan wanted to say something but gave up in the end. She nodded.”Be careful!”

“Don’t worry, this is the inspection Office!”

Li Hao laughed. After entering the inspection Office, would two nobodies still have the guts to do anything?

If he had the guts, he wouldn’t be a nobody following him!

……

Downstairs.

The man and woman had really brought a silk banner.

It was the first time that the two of them had entered the building of the law enforcement team. At this moment, they were looking around, and it didn’t seem strange at all. This place wasn’t open to ordinary people, but this time, they entered openly under Li Hao’s influence.

The receptionist didn’t care whether they were here to deliver the pennant to Li Hao or not ... The law-enforcement team wasn’t familiar with Li Hao. When they heard that he might be transferred here, and that he was someone from the secrets room, everyone was just a little confused. What good deed had Li Hao done to have someone deliver the pennant?

“Big Brothers and Big Sisters!”

At this moment, Li Hao came downstairs, his face full of excitement.””The two of you really came. It’s just a small matter. I thought you two were joking!”

“Patrol inspector li!”

The man stood up with a smile and greeted,”I’m not joking. Patrol li loves to help people. He saves them when they’re in danger. This morning, my wife and I almost got into a car accident. It was all thanks to patrol Li’s help ...”

He had lifted Li Hao’s leg!

Didn’t young people like this?

“Hahaha ... Big brother is too polite!”

Li Hao was also a sweet talker. He chuckled and said,””You two, don’t talk here anymore. You’re making me embarrassed. I haven’t been officially transferred yet! The two of you, come with me and have a cup of tea. The silk pennant ... I’ll take the silk pennant, I won’t be polite with you two! But since you’re here, you must have a cup of tea before leaving!”

The two of them looked at each other and smiled.

How polite!

How passionate!

Since he was already here, it would be good to experience it.

The two of them nodded and followed Li Hao. Li Hao led them to the end of the corridor on the first floor. As he walked, he said,””I’m a newbie, and there are many old people here. If I’m seen, everyone will be a little ... You know what I mean! Let’s go to the basement, there’s not many people there. Let’s have a cup of tea, it’s all thanks to your help this time!”

Li Hao led them up the stairs, his smile never stopping.

“I forgot to ask, what is big brother’s name?”

“Don’t worry about it, my name is Zhou He, my wife’s surname is Yuan. ”

“Big brother Zhou, big sister Yuan!”

Li Hao’s mouth was also super sweet!

The distance between them was shortened in an instant.

Very quickly, he brought the two of them to the first underground floor. The demon hunting squad’s headquarters was right in front. The underground room didn’t seem gloomy, but instead, it was very well lit.

“It’s just in front. There aren’t many people here. Brother Zhou and sister Yuan are obviously big bosses in business. If you need anything in the future, just let me know ... I love helping people solve their problems!”

Zhou He kept smiling. What an honest child.

The woman chimed in with Li Hao. It was rare to see such an enthusiastic chief patrol officer.

What a pity!

The next moment, Li Hao pushed open the door, and the two of them followed him into the basement, where Demon Hunter squads usually rested.

Li Hao warmly invited the two of them in and then closed the door to the basement.

This door ... Was really not ordinary!

The sound-proofing was top-notch, and the protection was top-notch. Not to mention people, even a bomb would find it difficult to blow through.

Once the door was closed, it was locked with a password and fingerprint. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to get out.

Seeing Li Hao close the door, Zhou He vaguely felt that something was wrong. Li Hao smiled as he closed the door.””Lock him up, in case others come in and think that I’m slacking off!”

Zhou He didn’t speak again.

The next moment, Zhou He’s expression changed. He looked at the decoration in the room and his eyes changed slightly.

This wasn’t a guest room, nor was it a lounge.

This place seemed to be ... A large gathering place!

Fitness equipment, guns, and ammunition. It seemed to have everything. It was more like ... An Arsenal!

Where was this place?

At this moment, Zhou He felt a little uneasy. Is this a place that an outsider like me can come to?

The woman beside him also changed her expression.

Because they saw the guns and even a small cannon.

Is this a place that ordinary people can come to?

The two of them instantly felt a strong sense of uneasiness and apprehension. They had only come to get closer to Li Hao, so why had they come here?

Li Hao had already closed the door.

I’m so happy!

These two were very cooperative and didn’t resist at all. It was comfortable.

This feeling of inviting someone into the trap was really comfortable.

Taking advantage of Zhou He’s daze, Li Hao patted Zhou He’s shoulder from behind and said with a smile,””Big brother Zhou, there’s no one here. It’s quiet ...”

The next moment, he bent his knees.

A knee strike!

Bang! Bang!

With a crisp sound, Zhou He tried his best to twist his body to avoid his vital parts, but he was still hit in the back by Li Hao’s knee. Intense pain instantly spread throughout his body!

Oh no!

At this moment, Zhou He only had one thought. I was fooled!

And he had come to her on his own initiative!

The woman’s expression changed drastically. Without saying anything, she suddenly pulled out a dagger from her leg and stabbed it at Li Hao!

……

In the depths of the basement, a few people were watching silently.

Liu Long was also there!

His eyes were a little complicated and strange.

What a good ‘close the door to beat the dog, invite the gentleman into the jar’!

This ... Was really ... A little unbelievable.

Was Li Hao really a coward?

I think he’s extremely daring!

Is this something a normal person would dare to do?

“This kid, if he survives this time ... In the future ... He’ll also be a ruthless person!”

Wu Chao, who was thin and weak, also sighed with emotion.

The chubby Chen Jian’s silly smile was a little restrained. This kid ... Bad!

Yun Yao and Liu Yan didn’t say anything today and just watched silently.

After a long time, Liu Long said softly,”they’ve really met their match ... One is in the tenth realm, and the other is a martial arts practitioner even though he hasn’t entered the tenth realm!” It looks like that side really isn’t weak. It’s just two stalkers, but they actually have ten decapitation realm existences!”

The tenth realm didn’t sound like much, but Liu Long knew that in the entire Silver City, there were less than a hundred martial masters and Starlight Masters in the tenth realm!

One in ten thousand!

And now, there was one here, just a stalker.

This was Li Hao’s first actual battle. Could he deal with these two?

Even if these two people had been tricked by him, it was obvious that they were not newbies. They were both old foxes.

At this moment, the members of the five demon hunting squads were all watching the battle.

……

On the field.

Having gained the upper hand, Li Hao didn’t say anything and continued to attack!

Tiger pounce!

His hands were clawed, and he showed no mercy. This was not a spar. Li Hao treated this as his coming of age ceremony, as a congratulatory gift and advancement gift for someone who had reached the tenth level!

The red shadow wanted to kill me...Then I can’t just lie down and wait to be killed!

I’ll kill the two on your side first. Even if they’re nobodies, I’ll make you suffer a loss!

Puchi!

He grabbed Zhou He’s arms with both hands and pulled out a large piece of flesh. Blood spurted out, but Li Hao was grimacing. At this moment, the blood in his spleen exploded. He seemed very excited, but ... He was not afraid!

I’m afraid of you?

The red shadow was in front of me, and you, uncle li, dared to be ruthless. Besides, you are also human!

“Roar!”

In the forest, the basement turned into a battlefield, where Li Hao fought for the first time.


Chapter 116: Chapter 32: victory in the first battle (1)
With a roar, it could take away one’s soul!

Zhou He’s eardrums shook and he felt that his eardrums were pierced. He was already at a disadvantage because he wasn’t prepared.

At this moment, Li Hao leaped into the air!

In battle, one feared the sky the most.

This was what Chen Jian told Li Hao on the first day.

However, Li Hao, who practiced the ape art, always liked to fly in the air.

It was also because of the lesson he had learned on the first day that Li Hao borrowed the strength of each other’s legs in the air and instantly rose to the height of the ceiling. The next moment, his legs kicked and spun down!

BOOM!

With a loud sound, Zhou He was kicked away.

Li Hao didn’t have the time to chase him. He heard an ear-piercing sound.

A dagger was instantly thrust towards his temple!

Li Hao grabbed the woman’s wrist with his backhand. A sharp force burst out from his fingers and pierced her wrist. She screamed in pain.

Li Hao’s right hand instantly grabbed the dagger that had fallen to the ground. Without a word, he took the dagger and stabbed the dagger at the woman’s wrist with his right hand.

Bang!

When the metal entered the bone, it was not silent, but a loud sound. The bones of the human body were very strong, and this dagger was not an ordinary weapon. With one stab, it directly pierced through the bone of the hand!

“Ah!”

The woman’s shrill and ear-piercing screams of pain could be heard.

Li Hao seemed to have gone deaf. He grabbed the woman’s neck with his left hand and pushed her against the wall.

BOOM!

With another loud sound, the woman’s bones broke. Li Hao pulled out his dagger and stabbed it into her palm, pinning her right hand to the wall.

“Li Hao!”

Behind them, Zhou He flew through the air and vomited blood when he landed. He let out a shrill roar when he saw the woman being pinned to the wall by Li Hao!

He was too ruthless!

This was completely different from the information he had collected.

Kind, honest, simple, sentimental, shy ...

This was a description of Li Hao from the information he had collected. He had obtained this from many people, and it wasn’t a wild guess. Some of Li Hao’s classmates had inadvertently said it, some of his neighbors had gossiped about him in the neighborhood, and some of his colleagues in the inspection Office had evaluated him.

However, no one had ever said that Li Hao was a vicious person!

……

“Tsk tsk!”

Liu Yan was also speechless at this moment. A dog that bites doesn’t bark!

Li Hao’s attack made even an experienced assassin like her feel that it was somewhat vicious. Although the woman opposite him was a little older, she was still a woman. In the end, Li Hao broke her wrist. But that wasn’t enough. He was afraid that she would escape, so he nailed her palm to the wall!

Was this a newbie who was fighting for the first time?

He was even more vicious than many old people!

The few members of the demon hunting team had gone all out when they attacked supers, but if they really encountered a woman who had not even entered the ten slashing realms, just Chen Jian and Wu Chao, they might not be able to be so ruthless.

As for Liu Long and the others, they didn’t say a word and continued to watch the battle.

This was Li Hao’s first actual battle ... Perhaps?

At this moment, Liu Long and the others were all confused. Was that true?

Was this really the first time this kid had seen blood?

Damn it, he was so ruthless. Martial masters rarely used weapons. Even if they did, they would use their own. Li Hao, on the other hand, grabbed his opponent’s dagger and stabbed him without hesitation!

After all, a dagger was sharper than a hand or a foot. With one slash, the woman’s palm was crippled.

His wrist was also broken. Even if he didn’t die in the later stage, his hand would be completely crippled.

The woman was not a ten decapitation realm expert. When she encountered an unreasonable ten decapitation realm expert like Li Hao ... She would be crushed in terms of pure strength.

……

Not to mention the thoughts of the spectators.

Li Hao didn’t really care about all this. He only remembered one thing.”If you start fighting, then no matter what, right or wrong, you have to remember one thing ... You’re the only one standing here!”

This was what Yuan Shuo had taught him.

This was what Yuan Shuo had said when he taught him the five birds technique.

People who practiced martial arts either didn’t make a move, or killed when they made a move.

Don’t say anything more. No matter if you’re right or wrong, fight first. Defeat all the enemies so that they can’t fight back. If you don’t kill the other party, then we can talk about who’s right and who’s wrong.

Otherwise, if he held back against the enemy, he would be asking for too much.

Therefore, Li Hao didn’t feel that there was anything wrong with it.

After nailing the woman to the wall, Li Hao climbed up like a monkey. Using both his hands and feet, he landed on the ground and climbed up in the blink of an eye. He instantly rushed in front of Zhou He.

Zhou He was also at the tenth realm!

In terms of strength, he might be a bit stronger than Li Hao. However, his arm was badly mangled by Li Hao, and his kidney might have been shattered by Li Hao’s sneak attack, so his strength had dropped a lot.

Zhou He was terrified when he saw Li Hao quickly climbing over.

He knew that he couldn’t get out of here, even if he won against Li Hao.

“No, I have information to tell you ...” He immediately shouted in fear.

Bang! Bang!

Without any hesitation, without any hesitation.

Li Hao’s claw struck out with the Black Tiger Steals Heart!

Zhou He was flustered and could only block in a panic. He protected his chest with his arms. Just as he extended his arms, Li Hao grabbed at him like a fierce tiger pouncing on its prey. He spread his five claws and ruthlessly clawed down!

Pfft!

His flesh and blood were torn apart again!

Zhou He’s head was covered in cold sweat. It was painful!

When he retaliated, he was a little hesitant.

Li Hao, on the other hand, surrounded him and attacked him crazily!

Chapter 117: Chapter 32: victory in the first battle (2)
“Li Hao ... Your death is near ... I have extremely important information to tell you ...”

“Roar!”

Another tiger’s roar resounded through the forest!

He was bleeding from his seven apertures!

Zhou He took a deep breath and his movements stopped.

Li Hao felt that he was very stupid.

His teacher had said that a martial artist had to train one breath!

This breath was in a spurt of energy, in the integration of Qigong!

This Qigong was about the coordination of breathing and external techniques. While Zhou He was fighting, he was still talking. He was not a strong person, just a ten slash realm. His internal and external techniques were not good enough and could be easily interrupted by others!

This was the advantage of being a top teacher!

The experience passed down by a douqian Martial Master, and Zhou He, at most, had a teacher who was over 100. Maybe he wasn’t even over 100, and maybe his teacher was only at the tenth realm.

His martial Dao had declined!

Li Hao’s roar was just right. It cut off the other party’s breath, causing Zhou He to hold his breath. He immediately suffered internal injuries and his limbs were not coordinated.

Taking this opportunity, Li Hao suddenly extended his arms.

He hugged Zhou He!

Kill!

Creak!

The sound of the bone armor being crushed and shattered instantly rang out.

Li Hao guarded against the other party’s legs and stomped down fiercely. Zhou He’s right leather shoe was smashed into pieces, and his flesh was badly mangled. The White bones of his foot pierced through his flesh. Zhou He roared madly in pain!

……

“Hu!”

Five breaths!

In the depths of the basement, the five of them were all breathing.

Chen Jian looked at Liu Long and then at Liu Yan. He was a little nervous and said in a low voice,”He ... He was just pretending to be ignorant when he sparred with us, right?”

Was this the first actual combat?

Go to hell!

This kid was really ruthless and cunning. He first crippled the woman, then dealt with Zhou He. Zhou He and he were both in the ten decapitation realm, but in the end, he didn’t cause much of a stir in the hands of a newcomer like Li Hao!

In this situation ... It could be said that there was almost no chance of turning the tables!

However, Liu Long didn’t care about this. Instead, he said with a serious expression,””The five birds technique ... Has so many killing techniques?”

Yes, it was.

Li Hao’s five birds technique, whether it was the ape technique or other five birds techniques, was deadly when used!

Heart gouging, tearing claw, killing hug, Tiger fist ...

In any case, the five birds technique he saw on Li Hao’s side was different from the others. Every move and form was extremely ruthless!

Usually, he couldn’t tell, or rather, Li Hao usually couldn’t really do anything.

Yuan Shuo’s five birds technique had been modified again?

The killing intent was too strong!

All these years, Yuan Shuo had changed the new book of five birds, and everyone thought that he had cultivated his body and temperament. Usually, his moves were slow. But now, Liu Long, a Martial Master who had broken through 100 martial masters, saw it ... And his moves were really fatal!

It focused on the enemy’s vital points!

The heart, throat, eyes, lower Yin, spleen, waist, and kidney were Li Hao’s main attacks.

Piercing eyes, scratching throats, and gouging crotches-Li Hao had no qualms about anything!

The more Liu Long looked, the more shocked he became.

In essence, a Martial master’s main focus was not to kill. Strengthening the body was also a part of a Martial master’s pursuit. In addition, with the rise of modern firearms, many of the killing moves of a Martial Master had changed.

Li Hao’s five birds technique ... Felt like it had returned to its original state!

Liu Yan was also an expert who was about to break through 100. At this moment, she frowned slightly.”Five birds technique ... It’s the instinctive hunting method of five beasts. Between beasts, it’s often a battle to the death! When hunting, if you can’t kill your prey, you’ll starve to death! It was extremely brutal! It sounds like child’s play, but in reality, it’s an extremely brutal martial art. It’s just that the ones we usually see ... Seem to be the abridged version!”

At this moment, Li Hao seemed to have returned to the beginning.

Of course, because he was a newbie, he missed many opportunities. If it was Liu Long, he might have already broken Zhou He’s throat.

However, Li Hao’s legacy came from a top-notch Martial Master. Zhou He really couldn’t compare to him!

Just as they were discussing, Li Hao raised his shoulder!

He first flung Zhou He away with both hands and then pulled him back a little. At this time, he let go and hit Zhou He’s chest with his shoulder. Crack!

Countless ribs in his chest were broken at this moment.

Bang! Bang!

Zhou He landed heavily on the ground and blood flowed out of his mouth. He was breathing more heavily than he was breathing. His internal organs might have been injured and his eyes were listless!

But Li Hao didn’t relax.

He took a glance and quickly retreated.

The next moment, he turned around and ran.

Halfway through, he leaped into the air and did a beautiful spin in the air. His right leg lashed out fiercely!

The woman, who had just removed her almost-crippled right hand from the wall, didn’t have time to Dodge. Li Hao’s whip-like leg hit her neck with a creak!

The sound of bones cracking was heard first!

The next moment, the sound of the woman being sent flying and smashing into the ground could be heard. Fresh blood instantly dyed the ground red.

At this moment, the battle ended in less than three minutes.

The two of them fell to the ground, blood splattering everywhere.

Li Hao, on the other hand, was panting heavily. He adjusted his breathing, half-knelt on the ground, and vigilantly looked at the two people on the ground.

Seeing that the two couldn’t get up, Li Hao seemed to have woken up. He looked at the blood on the ground ... And then at the people who walked out of the corner. His face suddenly turned pale.

It was as if he had just felt a lingering fear. With a face full of lingering fear, he said,”I was scared to death. These two people are so powerful and cruel. This woman almost stabbed my temple with a knife!”

Translator: 549690339
“……”

Liu Long looked at him without saying anything.

Liu Yan felt a little strange and forced out a stiff smile.”Little Hao, are you serious?”

Are you pretending?

Li Hao looked at her blankly. Of course she was serious!

It was too terrifying!

Actual combat was really too dangerous. The opponent would directly stab someone with a knife. If he was not careful, wouldn’t he be stabbed to death?

Looking at him ...

Everyone was dumbfounded!

Li Hao seemed to be serious.

But, look at the scene?

Two people were beaten by you until they bled all over the ground. Zhou He’s ribs were broken countless times, his feet were crushed, his waist was broken, and the bones in his arms were pulled out by Li Hao!

The woman was also in an extremely miserable state. Her neck had probably been broken, her palm was crippled, and a pile of bones in her body had been broken ...

In the end, you said you were scared!

Are you even human?

Liu Long didn’t say anything, nor did he care whether Li Hao was pretending or not. Instead, he said in a deep voice,””Is this your first time in actual combat?”

“Yup!”

Li Hao nodded like a chicken eating rice. Panting, he said,””Actual combat is too scary. I used to be a martial arts enthusiast. Although I learned the five birds technique, it was all for the sake of training my body. I didn’t expect that actual combat would be so dangerous!”

A martial arts aficionado ... This was his first actual combat experience!

“Then, when you did it, you didn’t hesitate at all?” Liu Long’s gaze was a little strange.

Li Hao’s decisiveness didn’t seem like it was his first actual battle!

He was too iron-blooded!

This was a quality that only old martial masters could possess, and it was a choice that only old martial masters who had experienced life and death would make. There was no need to hesitate, and he had to defeat his opponent first!

“Hesitating?”

Li Hao thought for a moment and shook his head. He really didn’t have any.

He explained,”because I know they are enemies, so I will not sympathize with them! Besides, when my teacher taught me martial arts, he said that if I really fight with someone one day, I should put them down first! The more powerful the opponent, the more ruthless he had to be! Otherwise, I’ll be the one in trouble!”

Alright!

Liu Long didn’t expect Li Hao to be so obedient.

Yuan Shuo said this because his opponents were all powerhouses, enemies that he had to kill to the death.

Li Hao, on the other hand ...

Of course, it might be a good thing now.

The result of this little guy, who he had regarded as a noob, was unexpectedly good.

A ten decapitation realm expert and a Martial Master close to ten decapitation had joined forces, but they had been caught off guard by Li Hao and ended the battle in three minutes. The two of them were seriously injured and on the verge of death, while Li Hao’s fist ... Was broken!

That’s right, he was too ruthless. He seemed to have punched Zhou He’s exposed bones just now. The skin on his fist was pierced by the bones and was now bleeding.

.

Apart from that ... There seemed to be nothing else!

This was a battle result created by a newbie who had just entered the ten slash realm!

It could be said that among all the martial masters Liu Long had met, almost no one could do this. Even he, when he first entered the tenth realm, could not do this. In his first actual battle, his opponent was also a tenth realm, and he was almost killed by the enemy!

He didn’t kill his opponent, but the other party almost killed him.

“Brother, you’re amazing!”

Chen Jian gave him a thumbs up!

He was really impressed!

This fellow looked thin and gentle. Sometimes, he would even feel embarrassed when Liu Yan teased him ... Such a shy little brother had just beaten two martial masters into a pulp in their first real battle!

“It’s a good thing that you weren’t so brutal when we were sparring earlier!”The skinny Wu Chao said with a look of lingering fear.

This kid, especially his grabbing technique, really grabbed a piece of flesh with each grab!

Chen Jian’s defense was strong.

His defense wasn’t good, and if Li Hao continued to grab him, he would have lost a few pieces of flesh!

Li Hao was a little shy and embarrassed. He hurriedly explained,””They’re the bad guys, we’re the righteous! I’m doing justice by attacking bad people! Why would you attack your own people?”

“Justice!”

Liu Long and the others were slightly stunned as they looked at him.

Liu Yan was grinning from ear to ear as she held her chest and laughed.

In front of Li Hao’s eyes, however, was nothing but white.

“Sister Liu, your shirt is unbuttoned!” He couldn’t help but remind her.

“……”

It instantly became quiet.

Liu Yan immediately stood up and looked at Li Hao in shock. She couldn’t help but point at him and curse,””Are you still a man? At this time, you’re actually reminding me that I didn’t button my shirt?”

Li Hao said innocently.

What’s wrong?

Can’t I?

Liu Long and the others looked at each other and couldn’t help but laugh.

In such a scene, the few of them were laughing out loud!

Even yunyao found it funny.”Deputy Captain Liu, it seems like ... Not everyone likes your tricks!” She said.

“Tsk, do you have one?”

Although Liu Yan was afraid of yunyao, she couldn’t help but retort,”I’m happy to do so, but do you have what it takes to do so?”

Yunyao instantly quieted down. The way she looked at Liu Yan was a little off. That look ... It was as if she was looking for an opportunity to beat Liu Yan up!

Li Hao, on the other hand, ignored them.

He glanced at the two guys who were still vomiting blood and couldn’t help but say,””Should we capture him and ask him? Let’s see if there’s any information. Sister yunyao, you’re a doctor, can you take a look at them? Don’t die, or it’ll be hard to ask questions!”

“You’re really black-hearted!”

Liu Yan scolded jokingly. This guy was still thinking about this at a time like this.

It’s really good!

Li Hao laughed drily. He stood up, exhaled, and expressed his feelings again.”Actual combat is really different, so exciting! It’s mainly because I’m nervous. I was super nervous just now! I was scared to death, especially the two of them. I was afraid that they would attack me from the front and back ... Boss, how do you usually deal with this kind of situation?”

Chapter 119: Chapter 32: victory in the first battle (4)
Liu Long looked at him and didn’t say anything.

Nonsense!

Didn’t you already deal with it just now?

He would first cripple one with his full strength, then deal with the other one. Wouldn’t that do?

How should he deal with it?

This kid asking this question felt like he was asking for a beating!

Li Hao asked sincerely,””Boss, there’s one more thing that my teacher didn’t teach me. The damage of the claw technique isn’t too strong. My hand was stained with blood, which affected my performance. It’s a bloody mess, and the blood is still sticky. Later on, when I fought, my hand slipped a little. What should I do now?”

Like a student asking his teacher, Li Hao asked sincerely,””I don’t have time to wipe my hands. Fortunately, I’m not using a weapon. Otherwise, it would be easier for my hands to slip when my weapon is stained with blood. Boss, what do you usually do?”

“……”

The entire place was silent.

This was a ... Special question. It was so special that Liu Long’s mind wandered for a moment.

Li Hao disliked the gory claw technique, not because the enemy was in pain or injured, but because it made his hands dirty and slippery. The blood would make him unable to hold his weapon.

Was this considered a doubt in actual combat?

I guess so!

But no one had ever asked this question as naturally as Li Hao did. He didn’t feel guilty at all. He really wanted to solve this problem.

Yun Yao couldn’t help but ask, Li Hao, don’t you ... Feel guilty? “It’s not that you’re guilty of doing something wrong, but under normal circumstances, even a Martial Master would feel guilty and guilty in their first real battle, especially in such a situation. Don’t you feel that way?”

Did this Li Hao have some mental problems?

Or was he Born cold-blooded?

Li Hao thought for a moment and said,”I don’t feel guilty, because I knew from the beginning that they were bad people. Bad people who wanted my life!” As for a guilty conscience ... The feeling you’re talking about, I do have a little bit of it! But ... This has nothing to do with my question, right?”

Li Hao was also depressed.

He did feel a little weak, but why were all of you looking at me like that?

These few people were all veterans, was there a need to be like this?

Liu Long and the others didn’t say anything. They didn’t feel that there was anything wrong with it. They just felt that Li Hao was simply born to fight. Perhaps ... He was hiding a bit of a cold-blooded personality.

At this moment, Liu Long no longer thought about this, but seriously explained,”You said that your claw technique will make your hands full of blood. In this case, the first thing is to wipe the enemy clean! Second, if you have the chance, rub it on the ground. It’s even better if there’s soil! “Third, try to avoid grabbing those main arteries, or you’ll be sprayed with blood! Fourth, grab the opponent and pierce through them, then wipe them clean when you pull them back! Fifth, quick, so quick that you’ll be done before the blood spurts out!”

“……”

The others once again looked at Liu Long with strange expressions.

Good fellow, one dared to ask and one dared to answer!

Liu Long even gave him five solutions in one go.

As for Li Hao, he was also listening attentively. He had always felt that he was too new and inexperienced, and it was necessary for him to learn more from these senior martial masters. For example, the fifth point mentioned by Liu Long was very good.

As fast as possible!

It was so fast that the blood hadn’t even spurted out by the time the claw reached out and retracted. That was enough!

If he was extremely fast, then he didn’t need to worry about these problems.

Thinking of this, Li Hao’s eyes were full of admiration.

Captain was the most experienced!

As for the others ... No wonder they weren’t above 100. Why were they looking at him like that? they didn’t know how to clear his doubts. It was only right that their Captain was the strongest.

Liu Long didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

He didn’t say anything else. Li Hao was really a good seedling. In the past, the old Martial Master would only take in this kind of disciple so that he could retire.

The Martial Master was old and could no longer fight. When the enemy came to seek revenge, they needed a ruthless person like Li Hao.

His methods were black, ruthless, and vicious, but he himself felt that there was no problem.

Closed door disciple!

At this moment, Liu Long vaguely understood how Yuan Shuo had managed to teach him. Two years ago, that fellow had taught Li Hao with words and actions, treating him as his last disciple. He had inadvertently revealed many of Yuan Shuo’s own ideas.

.

Li Hao’s martial Dao enlightenment had been guided by Yuan Shuo.

Thus, the growth of this fellow was still greatly influenced by Yuan Shuo.

Yuan Shuo, that old man, was also ruthless!

Otherwise, they would not have so many enemies.

“Let’s not talk about this anymore. Let’s interrogate these two guys first ... Yunyao, go stop the bleeding. Don’t let them die. Although they are just two nobodies and might not know much, they might have some unexpected gains!”

Liu Long warned. It was obviously very difficult to interrogate them now. They had to wait for the two to come back to life.

Li Hao, on the other hand, was picking up the pennant on the ground. When the two of them had brought it here, they had thrown it on the ground during the fight.

“Why are you still doing that?” Liu Yan asked.

“Go out and hang it up!”

Li Hao chuckled.”Sister, this is the first time I’ve received a silk banner! It was very memorable! Besides, these two people sent it over openly, so it’s not good if I don’t go out and hang it up. I’ll tell them that they left through the back door later, and I’ll go hang the pennant!”

There was an instant silence!

Yunyao, who was helping to stop the bleeding, saw Zhou He’s eyes widen and he looked like he was about to die. She immediately cursed in her heart. Animal!

Li Hao was an animal!

At this time, he actually wanted to go out and hang a silk banner. If she were this man, she would also be angry to death!

As for Li Hao, he didn’t know what the others were thinking, nor did he care.

He held the pennant happily, and the more he looked at it, the more satisfied he was.

“Willing to help others, big-hearted and loving, Huanhuan

Gifted to patrol inspector Li Hao of the inspection Division. ”

Li Hao read it for a while. The more he read, the more beautiful it became. It was really well-written.

Great love!

“Boss, sis, I’ll send the silk banner back to the confidential room first. I’ll bring it back when I’m transferred here from the confidential room ...”

This was the first time in his life that he had received such a banner. Li Hao was so happy that he couldn’t bear to throw it away.

Take it back to the confidential room first, and then bring it back!

“You guys take your time, I’ll be leaving first!”

After Li Hao finished speaking, he took the pennant, hummed a little song, and left happily. At this time, it was as if a new patrol inspector had received a pennant of praise from the public. That kind of pride and joy!

In the basement, the few of them looked at each other ... They were all speechless.

After a long time, Wu Chao said faintly,”everyone, isn’t this guy ... A little ... Abnormal?.”

You have to know who sent you the pennant you took!

And what happened to the person who gave the banner?

Good fellow, you really have the face to bring the pennant back, and you even want to hang it up in a grand manner!

艹!

She was speechless, but she also deeply admired Li Hao’s big heart. This ... When you hang it, don’t you think that the red silk banner looks like it’s dyed red with blood?

Liu Long wanted to speak but stopped.

After a long while, he said gloomily,”whatever!”

What else could he say?

He was speechless!

Of course, after today’s battle, Liu Long knew that the others in the team had accepted Li Hao.

He was no longer the bait in everyone’s eyes, a one-time prop, a bystander, and a burden ...

In the past, no matter who it was, including Liu Long, they all felt this way.

But Li Hao’s battle just now made everyone suddenly realize that this guy ... Was really not a passerby. If he could survive, he would definitely be more terrifying than Liu Long in the future.

At this moment, the Demon Hunters finally started to consider Li Hao as their teammate.

Li Hao might not understand all this.

Chapter 120: A kind person has good luck (1)
Li Hao entered the critical room with light steps.

He was in a good mood.

When he saw Wang Ming, his mood became even better.

“Little Ming, you’re here?”

Wang Ming was in the middle of entering files, and when he heard this special address, he stiffened a little, but he still quickly greeted her.”Brother Hao, you’re here. Did you go to the law enforcement team again today?”

“Yes.”

As Li Hao said this, he deliberately showed off the banner in his hand.

This was the glory of the new patrol officer!

Even though Li Hao was usually honest and low-key, at this moment, he couldn’t help but show off with the silk banner.

Look, someone is giving me a silk banner!

Sure enough, Wang Ming’s attention was attracted, and he asked curiously,”A silk banner? Is it for you, brother Hao?”

“Well, it’s a small matter. The main thing is that he’s too polite. He insisted on giving me a silk banner!”

Li Hao pretended to be unconcerned and then laughed.”Of course, you’ll have one sooner or later, little Ming!”

At this moment, the attention of the other people in the VIP room was also attracted. They all looked at Li Hao.

When they saw the silk banner in his hand, they began to gossip and ask what had happened.

Li Hao naturally told them the truth. He didn’t do much, but helped someone repair their car.

They were all the truth!

As for what happened after they sent the pennant ... Who would care?

……

The computer room was bustling with noise and excitement.

Li Hao hung the banner and sat down. He thought of something and asked,””Little Ming, didn’t you say that you’d be late today and that your elders would be here?”

When they were eating earlier, this fellow had said that an elder would be visiting today.

“They’re here! I was an hour late this morning, and brother Hao wasn’t here, so I don’t know. ”

Li Hao nodded.

It’s here!

Was he a powerful night patrolman or a real elder?

Li Hao smiled honestly,”why don’t we go and visit him after work?” Let your elders know that we’ll take care of you here, and you’ll be able to do it smoothly. ”

“There’s no need for that!”

“That elder of mine doesn’t really like to interact with people. He’s a little eccentric,” Wang Ming refused politely.

He understood!

He was definitely a Night Watcher. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have to keep saying that he was his father and his mother.

Li Hao didn’t probe further, for it would arouse suspicion if he said too much.

Wang Ming, on the other hand, took the initiative to chat with Li Hao, so he lowered his voice and said,”Brother Hao, it’s going to rain in Silver City for the next two days. We’re on vacation now. Do you have any plans?”

It was raining in Silver City on the 16th and 18th.

On the 18th and 19th, Li Hao and the others would be on leave.

“You have plans?”

Li Hao seemed to be a little curious. He asked,””You’ve just arrived, so you should know where there’s something fun to do in the Silver City. Why don’t you tell me a place and I’ll see if I can go there?”

“How about hiking?”

“Isn’t there Mount Heavenly King on the outskirts of Silver City?”Wang Ming asked with anticipation. I heard that it’s very majestic ... Let’s go up the mountain and have some fun?”

Mountain climbing!

In the suburbs!

Li Hao was deep in thought. Beside him, Chen Na said with some disdain,””What’s so fun about mountain climbing? We’re in the wilderness, and it’s raining. There’s no place to take shelter from the rain. Why don’t we go sing and eat?”

Wang Ming laughed dryly,”sister na, we men don’t like to sing. Mountain climbing can also exercise our bodies!” If you’re tired at night, you can stay on the mountain and watch sunrise. Mount Tianwang on a rainy night might be even more beautiful!”

Chen Na politely declined.

Forget it. She didn’t want to climb the mountain. It was so tiring and meaningless.

As for Li Hao, he quickly made a judgment.

Wang Ming had asked him to climb the mountain because he wanted to find a suitable place for the night patrol to ambush him.

Mount Tianwang was sparsely populated, and no one would go there on a rainy day, which was in line with the thoughts of the night patrolmen. Fighting with the red shadow there would not have any impact on the Silver City.

After all, it was an official organization with justice and order. Even if there were many problems with the night watchers, it still couldn’t change the fact that the night watchers were the biggest protection organization for ordinary people.

Therefore, the Nightwatchers, including the demon-hunting squads, actually hoped that the battle would be held in the suburbs and not in the city.

In a battle between supers, a single mistake could cause the death of a large number of ordinary people.

The Heavenly King Mountain ...

Li Hao pondered for a moment. The location that the Demon Hunter squad had decided on was not there. Although it was also in the suburbs, the Demon Hunter squad would rely more on hot weapons to be effective. Thus, they needed a flat land, not a mountain, where it was not easy to bury explosives.

“Let’s wait and see!”

Li Hao was in no hurry to refuse. He would ask Liu Long and the others first.

Wang Ming wanted to say more, but seeing that Li Hao had lowered his head and was working, he could only stop forcing him.

He was a little anxious.

Li Hao couldn’t stay in the city all the time!

This guy was the other party’s next target. A Big Shot had come to the night patrol this time, and he actually attached great importance to Silver city’s eight great families. Wang Ming didn’t know much, but he vaguely knew a few things.

The eight great families of Blizzard Silver City had not been highly regarded before, but it seemed that something had happened in the supernatural realm recently. It might have something to do with these eight great families.

Therefore, this time, the big shots of the night patrolmen came. On one hand, they wanted to solve the problem, and on the other hand, they hoped to see what the Li family’s sword was like.

Of course, he knew that Li Hao was cooperating with the demon hunting squad.

After some consideration, he decided that Li Hao might still have to listen to the demon hunting squad’s arrangements. In that case, he could only let that important person consider the arrangements.

……

The morning in the secrets room was very quiet.
