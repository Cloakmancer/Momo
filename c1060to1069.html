        he public house.
         A small black car slowly came to a stop.
         In the small car, other than the driver, there were two other people, an old man and a middle school student.
         The old man's hair was white, and he looked a little old.
         The middle-aged man was well-built and muscular, but he was not too conspicuous under the military uniform.
         "Father, we've arrived."
         The middle-aged man said in a low voice. The old man opened his eyes and looked outside at the high Duke's public house. He stared at the large words on the gate tower and said softly,"I don't know what tricks Xu Qing will play today. When we enter later, listen more and talk less."
         "Father, I know."
         The middle-aged man nodded.
         The two of them came from huoming province, which was one of the most powerful provinces in the East. Because there were many volcanoes in the province, there were many fire element superpowers and they were very powerful.
          Huoming province was also a thorn in the Xu family's side.
         The actual ruler of the huoming province was different from other places. It was the Secretary of the inspection Division, which was the white-haired old man in front of him. He had controlled the military power of the entire province decades ago.
         The old man and Xu Qing had a conflict many years ago, and he was a thorn in the Xu family's side. However, the old man was strong and had become a super a long time ago. Now, he was also in the transformation stage and was an extremely strong fire super.
         He also had an extremely loyal Army of fire soldiers under his command, and he also had many experts. The Xu family would not dare to rashly make a move against him.
         This time, the old man had come personally for the Xu family's grand ceremony. The middle-aged man was extremely unwilling, but he couldn't persuade the old man to come, so he still followed.
         Seeing that his father was about to get off the carriage, the middle-aged man transmitted his voice again,""Father, I'm worried that the Xu family will make things difficult for you. I should've been the one to ..."
         "Alright, there's no need to be so cautious all the time when doing great things! "Although the Xu family is strong, today is a public ceremony. They might have intimidated me, but they don't have the courage to attack me in public. Xu Qing won't be the one to stand out." The other three sides are not in chaos, but the East is in chaos. This is not the result he wants to see. "
         Besides, she wasn't the only one who opposed him.
         There were too many!
         It was impossible for Xu Qing to unify the East, at least for now.
         The old man thought to himself, but he did not say anything. He walked towards the high Duke's public house. At the entrance, the high Duke's public house's powerhouse's expression changed slightly. He quickly said,"The huoming province Inspector General has arrived!"
         The moment these words came out, it instantly attracted the attention of many people.
         Behind the old man, there were also some experts who walked out. When they heard the voice, they all looked towards the door. Seeing the old man, some were surprised, while some had a smile in their eyes. With this person here, they could act according to the situation.  To oppose the Xu family, there had to be a leader.
         In the East, there were three who had the qualifications and strength to directly contend with the Xu family. The first was the huoming province, and the second was the Far East Province, which was also a vast territory with a large population and many experts.
         The system of the utmost East Province was somewhat unnecessary. Just like the border, there was also a big aristocratic family in the utmost East. Although the territory of the Marquis of the East was not as famous as the high Duke's public house, he was still a noble of the star dynasty when it first started.
         Apart from the blazing fire province and the utmost East Province, the 3rd largest power resisting the Xu family was not a province, but an organization called the divine sun society.
         The divine sun society had been established for a long time, second only to the three major organizations. However, it had not expanded as quickly as the three major organizations. It had still taken root in the East and had not yet spread out. However, it was very powerful in the East and had gathered a large number of itinerant cultivators. The three major organizations in the East were not a match for the divine sun society.
         The members of the divine sun society were spread all over the East, and some of them even had prominent statuses. It was rumored that some of the local governors had even joined them, gaining the support of many powerful figures. Just like how the Xu family supported the three major organizations behind the scenes, the divine sun society also had many financial backers.
         Some provinces did not dare to oppose the Xu family on the surface, but in order to maintain their status, they secretly supported the divine Sun Gang.
         The dingguo Army's targets these few years were mostly the members of the divine sun society.
         The moment the old man arrived at the entrance, he attracted the attention of many people.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Behind them, the powerhouses from other provinces hurried forward and greeted them warmly,""Secretary Yu is also here. If I had known earlier, I would have gone with him. With him, it would be safer."
         "Yes." The old man turned around and nodded with a smile."We can go back together."
         "Then I'll have to trouble you!"
          A group of people gathered at the entrance, talking and laughing. They didn't look like they were mourning.
         Very soon, Xu Xing personally came out to welcome him. Upon seeing the old man, he revealed a fake smile."Secretary Yu is here, please come in ..."
         After saying that, his smile disappeared and was replaced by sorrow.""This time, big brother has met with misfortune, and it has been hard on everyone."
         The speed at which he changed his attitude was also shocking.
         He smiled to show his friendliness, but he was sad because his big brother and nephew had lost their lives. Today was the ceremony, so he had to be careful.
         The old man's smile disappeared and he sighed,""My condolences! I didn't expect that the Sword of Light and the others would be so bold, and that Li Hao is even more ruthless. Duke dingguo is such a kind person, but he's sending his son off. I hope that Duke dingguo will take care of his body and live a long life. Don't be angry and damage your body. "
         Xu Xing cursed in his heart!
         Hypocritical!
         Of course, it was not ironic to live a long life. Even if one became a Martial Master or a super, it did not mean that one could live for a long time. If one did not solve the problem of the weak five internal organs of the body, a hundred years was sometimes the limit.
         Therefore, there was not much sarcasm in his words. It was just that when it came out of this person's mouth, it made people uncomfortable.
        
         "Secretary Yu, please!"
         Xu Xing didn't want to say more. He thought ruthlessly,"you'll know later that even if the Xu family has suffered heavy losses, you can't compare to them."
         Originally, the kui mountain lineage had been a little apprehensive when they had not come.
         Now that he had come to an agreement with Mount kui, there were many great demons like Mount kui and many Sunglow. Although the Snake King had the strength of a metamorphosis stage expert, his bloodline as a great demon and his physical body were powerful. They were not something an ordinary metamorphosis stage expert could compare to.
         Let's see if you can still laugh when you find out that my Xu clan and the kui mountain demon race have joined forces!
         The old man did not say anything else. He brought his son and a few other powerful people from other provinces and walked in. After entering, the servants from the high Duke's public house naturally led the way to the ancestral hall.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At the door, the powerhouse who was making the announcement saw another person. His expression changed slightly. He looked at Xu Xing and hesitated, wondering if he should call out.
         Xu Xing also raised his head and looked over. His eyes flickered.
         He shook his head slightly.
         Obviously, he was telling the other party not to shout.
          The identity of the people who had come was not too obvious. Although everyone knew of their existence on the surface, they would not deliberately reveal it.
         The person who came had a valiant temperament. There was more than one person, and there were many people following behind him. They were somewhat disorderly, but they were all led by this bearded expert.
         The bearded man was dressed in short combat clothes. Even in such a situation, he didn't tidy himself up. There seemed to be some blood on his body. He said from afar,""Is the Duke dingguo all right? That brat Li Hao is too audacious. When we get the chance later, we'll behead him and offer him as a sacrifice to the eldest master!"
         The bearded man's voice was very loud, attracting the attention of many people.
         Xu Xing forced a smile and took a step forward."Island Lord Hu is here. Please come in!"
         The big-bearded man who was called Island Lord Hu still had a loud voice.""The eldest young master is dead, so the second young master will be a small Duke in the future? Congratulations!"
         Xu Xing immediately frowned.
         Even if he was thinking about it, he couldn't say it in such a situation. This guy ... Did he do it on purpose?
         Of course, he didn't want to offend this person.
         On the surface, this man was the owner of an Island in the East Sea. In fact, all the powerhouses in the major provinces in the East knew that he was the leader of the most powerful Bandit group in the East Sea, just like the Starlight pirate group in the North Sea.
         However, the person behind the Starlight Pirate team of the North Sea was mysterious, but the one in the East Sea, everyone knew that it was the Duke dingguo.
         However, even though they knew each other in the past, the two sides did not have much contact.
         Today, however, this person came directly.
         Some people were solemn, some were disdainful, and some were resentful!
         The few major coastal provinces were often harassed by this big-bearded man and his men. It was obvious that the Duke dingguo had also instructed them to weaken their strength. Now that they saw the big-bearded man, some people wanted to go up and kill him!
         There were also experts who secretly transmitted their voices and sneered,""Duke dingguo is really ... Confused! In order to intimidate everyone, even the Redbeard Pirates were called over. "
         "What can you do? Redbeard is powerful and is the island master of the East Sea Island on the surface. Everyone knows that He's a Pirate, but the officials haven't defined his identity yet. He's still a good citizen on the surface. "
         "This Redbeard sure is gutsy. He actually dares to come ashore ..."  "You're going to kill him?"
         The person who spoke was silent.
         Redbeard was very powerful. It was said that he had also entered the transformation stage. Moreover, he was not alone. He had a few other experts with him. Who would dare to attack him?
         Not to mention whether it would succeed, if the news was leaked, it would be easy for the high Duke's public house to encircle and annihilate them.
         "I'll find a newspaper company to expose him ..."
         "That's only if there's a newspaper that dares to publish it. Once it's published, it'll spread to everyone ... Besides, what can the general public do if they know about it? What can it change?"
         The four sides fell silent and no longer communicated.
         At the front, red beard laughed heartily until one of his subordinates transmitted a few words. Red Beard's smile faded and he revealed a mournful expression."The death of the eldest young master has really infuriated both man and God, and the heavens and earth are sad. Second young master, I offer my condolences. If you have time in the future, you can come to my place to relax. Although the sea is not as good as the land, we have everything we need ... We can even vent a little ..."
         As he spoke, he revealed a meaningful smile, but it quickly disappeared.
         Xu Xing acted as if he did not see anything. With a sorrowful expression, he exchanged a few pleasantries and had someone lead the other party into the high Duke's public house.
         Following that, the local officials entered one after another.
         There were also mysterious powerhouses who did not make any public statements, but they still received Xu Xing's attention and were led into the high Duke's public house.
         In the end, several people in black robes with a great sun emblem on their chests walked over. Xu Xing's expression changed slightly. Divine sun Union!
         The Xu family did not invite them.
         However, the other party had actually come on his own.
         This time, other than a few families, almost everyone in the entire Eastern Territory had come. The three opposing forces had also come. It seemed that they all wanted to test the high Duke's public house's strength.
         Very quickly, Xu Xing also greeted them for a while, but had people keep a close eye on these people, and led them in.
          ……
         At this moment, Li Hao was also observing from a distance.
         He counted them one by one.
         He was also shocked!
         So many experts!
         21 provinces, including Dingbian province, also sent experts. Almost all of them had a rising light expert. In addition to the experts from other forces, some provinces even sent more than one rising light expert!
         Li Hao's teeth ached when he counted them one by one.
         32 rising light experts entered.
         It was too terrifying!
         The high Duke's public house also had a lot of light. The three generals, the second general manager, and a few foreign officials could see the light, and there were more than ten people.
        
         In addition, there were martial masters who couldn't see the light ...
         All of a sudden, nearly 50 sunrises gathered here.
         Terrifying!
         Of course, this wasn't just a single power, but the elites of the entire East. There were 21 provinces, which was more than all the provinces in the North. There were so many experts who surpassed the rising light in just one silver Moon. The mysterious energy in the East was rich, so it was normal for the rising light to be here.
         "Indeed, if you don't come out to take a look, you won't know the immensity of the heavens and earth ..."
         There were so many powerhouses, and he had wanted to snatch them by force!
         This difficulty was not easy to reach the heavens.
         Even if they were not from the Xu family, once they were robbed, there would be people who would please the Xu family. The Xu family had been in charge of this place for many years, and it was impossible for them to be enemies. At least one-third of the 21 provinces supported them. Otherwise, the Xu family would not have the confidence to unify the East.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, there were so many people that Li Hao hesitated.
         It seemed that scamming was more suitable.
          Forget it, let's wait and see. He wasn't sure what these people's attitude was.
         If they all went against the Xu family ... That would be great. They could fish in troubled waters.
         Just as he was thinking, the effeminate second-in-command knocked on the door.
         "Emissary, the ceremony is about to begin. Second young master has invited you to the ancestral hall to offer your condolences ... I wonder if you ..."
         "They're here!"
         The Black Panther stood up and the door opened automatically.
         Under the lead of the second-in-command, a man and a dog walked towards the Xu family's ancestral hall. The Xu family's ancestral hall was within the high Duke's public house and was not too far away.
         Before he even arrived, Li Hao could already feel a strong aura boiling.
         There were truly many experts.
         During the Xu family's sacrificial ceremony, the others were not allowed to enter the ancestral hall. They were all outside the ancestral hall and did not allow these important figures to stand. Times were different now and some rules were no longer applicable. If the imperial family had been in charge of the world in the past, these people could only stand when they came to the high Duke's public house to pay their respects.
         But now, there were some seats arranged for some important people to sit on.
         Of course, not everyone had a seat. Some of the lower-ranked ones were not given a seat.
         At this moment, the door of the ancestral hall was wide open. There were many members of the Xu family inside. Xu Qing and Xu Xing were not the only ones in the Xu family. There were also many sons of concubines. Xu Qing also had brothers and sisters, but they were not well-known, so no one cared about them.
         At this moment, the Xu family members were standing all over the place.
         It was only at this moment that he realized that there were quite a number of members in a family that had been passed down for 200 years. It was not the kind of one husband, one wife, and one generation. There were many people in the high Duke's public house who had three wives and four concubines. Some people had ten to twenty wives in their entire lives ... Even when the men entered the ancestral hall, there were no less than a hundred people standing there.
         There were probably many people who didn't even have the right to enter the ancestral hall.
         When the Black Panther appeared, it instantly attracted the attention of everyone outside. Some people's expressions changed slightly.
         Demon!
         At this moment, regardless of whether it was the people from the blazing fire province or the people from the utmost East province's Marquis of East Pole's mansion, they all revealed strange expressions.
         First, it was the Pirates, then the demons ...
          This Duke dingguo was really bold!  Where did this demon come from?
         His strength was not strong, only three yang. Among those present, apart from the Xu family, no one was lower than three yang.
         The Black Panther strode forward arrogantly, not recognizing anyone.
         In fact, both Heibao and Li Hao's legs felt weak.
         There were too many experts!
         Being stared at by everyone, it would be strange if his legs didn't go soft. But as a descendant of an ancient demon and someone who had seen many things, even if he had to act, he had to act more domineering. The Black Panther was slightly trembling, while Li Hao's mind fluctuated and he arrogantly said,""What are you looking at? a bunch of trash. I'll blind your eyes if you keep looking!"
         As soon as he said that, some people's faces changed!
         Many of them looked at the second general manager beside him with an unsightly expression, waiting for the Xu family's reaction.
         On the Xu family's side, Xu Xing quickly walked out of the ancestral hall. He was also secretly complaining that he had forgotten the arrogance of this great demon.
         Don't think that it was just three suns ... That was really arrogant!
         They knew the inside story, so they naturally knew why it was so arrogant. What they were afraid of was that if someone did not know and did not understand, they would anger the other party and the other party would directly kill this three yang lesser demon. Then, the high Duke's public house would be in big trouble.
         He quickly walked out and hurriedly put on a smile."Everyone, please forgive me. This emissary of the demon race is different from us humans. He didn't mean to ... Let me introduce him to you. This is the emissary of the Dragon God from Mount kui! The emissary is not just an emissary of the kui mountain demon race, he is also ... The descendant of an invincible existence!"
         As soon as these words were spoken, some people's expressions changed slightly.
         The kui mountain demon race!
         Of course, some people had their own speculations about this. After all, there were only a few places in the eastern Goblin tribe. But what did the last sentence mean?
         The descendant of an unparalleled existence?
         What kind of expert was worthy of such a comment?
         In the crowd, red Beard's eyes rolled. He seemed to be extremely reckless and asked directly,""Second young master, who dares to claim to be invincible these days?"
         "Hmph!"
          "Red-haired trash, how dare you be so impudent!" Li Hao snorted.
         Redbeard was furious!
         Xu Xing groaned inwardly and hurriedly said,"emissary, please calm down. Island Lord Hu, please calm down as well!" This is the descendant of an ancient demon. An ancient demon ... Do you understand?"
         He looked at the crowd."The emissary has the bloodline of an ancient demon. The emissary's ancestor is still alive!"
         Do you understand?
         Everyone's expression changed, including Redbeard 's.
         Is that true?
         They were all big shots, so how could they not understand the meaning behind it? they were all shocked. How was this possible?
         The big demon from the ancient civilization was still alive?
         How many years would he have to live?
        
         With the change of dynasties and the vicissitudes of life, the rise of superpowers had only been 20 years. Compared to these ancient demons, everyone knew that those who could survive until now were definitely terrifying ...
         However, it was still hard to believe!
         The Xu family wasn't trying to scare them, right?
         Did he just randomly find a small demon to scare everyone?
         Was he deliberately intimidating everyone?
         Although the Mount kui lineage was powerful, with a few Xu Guangs at the metamorphosis stage, it was terrifying, but it did not mean that they could not be provoked. However, with an ancient Fey ... They were truly not to be provoked!
         At this moment, even Redbeard's expression changed slightly. He didn't say anything, but he was a little suspicious.
         He glanced at Xu Xing, not knowing if the other party was just trying to scare him or if it was really the case.
         Also, the direct descendants of ancient demons were so weak?
         He's only at the middle stage of the three yang realm!
          He really wasn't afraid of kui Shan. He was also an expert in the transformation stage. If he killed this little demon, he would just enter the sea. If you dared to come to the sea, he would let the entire Mount kui lineage know that the East Sea was not comparable to the land.
         But if a single ancient Fey was still alive ... Then it was best not to seek death.
         In fact, Li Hao was also very nervous. But at this moment, Xu Xing began to lay the groundwork for him, which put him at ease. He felt relieved and said arrogantly again,""Listen up, the lineage of Mount kui is about to appear. All of you better be obedient, or don't blame the monster race for being impolite!"
         Someone revealed a look of anger!
         Xu Xing was also grumbling incessantly. He secretly transmitted a message."Emissary, humans and demons have different habits. There's no need to provoke too many people at Mount kui. Emissary, there's no need to be calculative with them ..."
         As he spoke, his eyes moved slightly and he transmitted another message,""Among these people, the others are all subservient to the line of kui mountain. There are a few people who often speak ill of kui mountain. That old man with the fire element is an expert from the huoming province. His name is Yu Jie. He's not a good-for-nothing."
         "And the one with the crown is the eldest son of the Marquis of East Pole of the eastpole province. The Marquis of East Pole once said that he would annihilate the demon tribe of Mount kui sooner or later."
         "And that black-robed man with the great sun emblem is from the divine sun society. He's also been secretly killing many demons ..."
         At this moment, he thought of diverting the disaster to the East.
         This great demon had a foul mouth.
         It would be best to offend these parties first.
         At that time, it would be impossible to ease the relationship even if he wanted to. He could only cooperate with the Xu family wholeheartedly.
         It would be best if they started fighting on the spot ... And let the demon suffer a little. Then, the Xu family would step in to ease the tension and save the demon. That would be even more interesting. Xu Xing thought of many things in an instant.
         And Li Hao instantly understood!
         These three families had grudges with the high Duke's public house.
         This was a good thing!
         The next moment, Li Hao directly attacked the old man with white hair."That guy, Little Star said that you threatened to exterminate my demon race. You're quite bold. I'd like to see how much you have to be so arrogant!"
         Xu Xing was startled and cursed in his heart!
         艹!
         I didn't ask you to say it directly. Is this big demon doing it on purpose or is he really shooting his mouth off?
         If I had known, I wouldn't have said it.  Although he knew that they didn't get along well, that was in the dark. They didn't have a direct confrontation. Now, with this big dog's actions, everyone knew that it was the Xu family who was secretly ... No, on the surface.
         At this moment, Xu Xing was filled with regret. Although he wasn't afraid, this was too embarrassing and too embarrassing for the Xu family. The Xu family had incited a conflict in front of their faces, but the big demon had directly said it out. This was simply a scene of social death.
         Li Hao didn't give up."And that monkey. There's no dragon God in the mountains. The monkey is King!"
         The eldest son of the Marquis of East Pole's expression changed slightly. He glanced at Xu Xing but didn't say anything.
         Yu Chuo also frowned slightly, but she did not say anything.
         Li Hao turned to look at the members of the divine Sun Gang. "There's also the guy with the red dot. You dare to secretly hunt demons ... Wait for me to return to the mountain and report to the Dragon God. I'll deal with you!"
         “……”
         Xu Xing had completely given up. He hurriedly said,""The emissary is straightforward. Don't misunderstand, it's all a joke ..."
         The group of people all looked at him.
         Some people cursed in their hearts!
         A misunderstanding?
         Even a fool would know that you were the one who incited this through voice transmission just now. This great demon's brain isn't that good either, so he just said it out loud.
         The three forces that were mentioned were all silent.
         Some people were still thinking about the impact of the cooperation between the Xu clan and kuishan.
         Some people were secretly angry.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com This great demon ... Had a great background. It would be interesting if he died in the Xu estate.
         Xu Xing didn't seem to be faking it.
         If that was the case, then once the Golden Demon was killed here, wouldn't it be possible to sow discord between kui Shan and the Golden Demon?
         Killing intent flashed across some people.
         And Li Hao seemed to have felt it.
          A moment later, he seemed to have thought of something.
         "Someone wants to kill me ..."
         As he thought about it, some ideas gradually emerged in his mind.
         The Xu family would definitely not dare to let him die Here.
         Once the Xu family was convinced of his identity, even if Xu Xing died, Xu Qing would not dare to let him die Here. Otherwise, the Xu family was afraid of revenge.
         If ... He were to get into a conflict with these people, the Xu family would protect him, right?
         Li Hao shuddered as he thought.
         What ... What an exciting feeling!
         If the Xu family didn't care about him, he would be finished.
         Of course, if the Xu family really did care about it and protected him ... That would be interesting. He might be able to take the initiative to create a big commotion.
        
         These three parties might all want to kill him and frame the Xu family.
         However, they probably wouldn't dare to make a move on the surface.
         Therefore, he could only think about it.
         However, what if he took the initiative to provoke them and create chaos again?
         Many ideas quickly emerged in his mind, but Li Hao quickly rejected them. It wasn't good to be too deliberate.
         Also, I haven't seen the wind-chasing boots yet.
         At the very least, he had to see it and prove that it was true before he could do so. Otherwise, it would be inappropriate.
         As he was thinking, Xu Xing brought him to a special seat. It wasn't a chair, but a golden throne that was close to the ground. It looked like the Xu family had built it last night.
         The Black Panther laid on it lazily, feeling that it was not bad.
         As for the others, they kept looking at Black Panther from the corner of their eyes.
          When Xu Xing saw this, he heaved a sigh of relief. It was fine as long as this great demon didn't say anything. He would just be a background character and intimidate everyone.
         He sent a voice transmission to Li Hao again, envoy, I'll head to the ancestral hall first to host the ceremony ...
         The Black Panther waved its paw impatiently. Seeing this, Xu Xing quickly returned to the ancestral hall.
         Li Hao also used his spiritual power to probe the ancestral hall without any restraint. Many people looked at Li Hao again and were secretly shocked. He was so bold. However, the Xu family didn't seem to notice it, or they all silently agreed.
         He allowed the great demon to probe him!
         At this moment, it was further proven that this big demon's identity was indeed noble. He actually dared to investigate the Xu family's ancestral hall directly at this time.
         Li Hao looked around, but didn't see the wind-chasing boots.
         There was something like an altar at the top of the ancestral hall. From its shape, it might have been the place where the Windchaser's boots were usually enshrined. However, it was empty at the moment.  Didn't they say that during the Xu clan's ceremony, they would offer the Windchaser's boots as an offering for three days?
         No more offerings this time?
         At this moment, in the ancestral hall, Xu Xing no longer cared about these things. With cadence, bemoaning the state of the universe and pitying the fate of the people, he angrily began to recite a eulogy."My ancestors, the Xu family has been passed down for hundreds of years. For the country, for the people, for the country, for the people, we have done our best until death ... However, my elder brother, Xu Zhen, was killed by a traitor of the Silvermoon clan. There were even traitors who killed generals in the Army ..."
         Every word made the listener sad and shed tears.
         As for Li Hao and the light sword, they were naturally the villains and villains.
         Among the people outside, some had looks of pity on their faces, some lowered their heads and sighed, and some gritted their teeth ... Only they knew how true it was and how false it was.
         "The descendants are unfilial, and their inheritance treasure was stolen by a villain ... The descendants are ashamed of this and will definitely take back the treasure ..."
         Xu Xing mumbled for a while.
         Behind them, there was a commotion.
         Li Hao also turned around and was slightly startled. At this moment, an old man walked over. Normally, he wouldn't appear at the memorial ceremony of his son and grandson. However, Xu Qing appeared at this moment.
         Behind him, there were a few extremely powerful generals.
         Not only that, at this moment, Xu Qing was holding a boot in his hand. His expression was cold as he walked step by step towards the ancestral hall. His voice had already spread out,"Junior Xu Qing is incompetent and has lost the face of our ancestors! I've lost one of my wind-chasing boots and only have one left. I'm too ashamed to worship it and bring shame to my ancestors!"
         "However, the Xu family stands tall in the East. We know shame and become courageous. With the wind-chasing boots as our ancestors 'witness, the Xu family will definitely take back the other one and kill our enemies to wash away our shame!"
         As soon as he finished speaking, he had already walked into the ancestral hall with the wind-chasing boots in his hands. He respectfully placed one of the wind-chasing boots on the altar.
         At this moment, many people's eyes lit up.
          Li Hao was even more straightforward. He directly used his divine will to investigate!  The others didn't have the guts, but he wasn't afraid. Xu Qing seemed to have expected it and didn't stop it. He knew that once the wind chasing boots were used, the great demon wouldn't be able to hold back.
         After all, the other party came for this.
         Li Hao hurriedly checked. He was wrapped in divine will, so he was really afraid that he had encountered a fake one. Now, he could check openly. Ordinary people couldn't tell the real one from the fake one, but Li Hao had another.
         Whether the Windchaser's boots were real or fake, he could tell by looking at the special energy inside.
         This thing was very difficult to forge.
         After a careful examination, Li Hao couldn't determine whether it was true or not, but he didn't hesitate and directly sent a message to Xu Qing.""You are the Duke dingguo? This item is too far away from me. Can this King personally check whether it is real or fake? Let's see if it's something that my Mount kui lineage needs!"
         Xu Qing's expression did not change."Of course you can," he replied telepathically."But please wait a moment, emissary. When the ceremony is over, you can investigate."
         Even though Li Hao couldn't wait any longer, he still held himself back.
         Then wait!
         Countless thoughts once again appeared in his mind. He knew that the cooperation between them and kui Shan was on these boots. The other party would most likely not dare to fake it.
         Once it was confirmed to be real ... Should he take it away immediately?
         Or should he continue to wait?
         As this thought flashed through his mind, Li Hao suppressed his agitation and observed the other people's supernatural fluctuations. Some people's supernatural fluctuations were so strong that they seemed to be unable to calm down. If not for the Xu family's strength, some of them would probably have gone up to snatch the treasure.
         ……
         At this moment, Li Hao was not the only one staring.
         Although the Masters outside didn't dare to release their divine intent or mental energy to investigate, their eyes flickered as they stared at the wind chasing boots. This thing was said to be an inheritance treasure of the eight great families.
         Now that the Li family's divine sword had revealed some of its abilities, countless people were tempted.
         If the Windchaser's boots were one of them, would they have the same ability?
         As she was observing, Yu Jie frowned slightly. She felt a wave of provocative spiritual power or divine intent. She turned her head and saw the big golden dog looking at her with fierce eyes."What are you looking at? the Xu clan is giving this to my Mount kui lineage. What are you looking at?"
         Yu Chuo's heart stirred.
         At this moment, he wasn't the only one who heard it. In fact, there were also people who heard it. They were all a little surprised, but they didn't say anything.
         So that was how it was!
          The Xu family had used the Windchaser's boots in exchange for a collaboration with kui Shan ... No wonder there was no movement from them before. It was because of this.
         Yu Chuo had countless thoughts in her mind.
         Kui Shan needed the Windchaser's boots ... But what if he lost them?
         And then, what if the big demon died?
         Wouldn't that mean that not only would the Xu clan lose the foundation to cooperate with kui Shan, they would also have to bear the wrath of kui Shan?
         At this moment, his mind was filled with a myriad of thoughts.
         They must not allow kuishan and the Duke of dingguo to work together. Otherwise, there would be many great Fey of kuishan, and even some ancient Fey. The others would have no choice but to bow their heads and submit. How would they dare to resist?
         At this moment, he looked at the eldest son of the Marquis of East Pole and the Vice President of the divine Sun Gang. The three of them looked at each other and seemed to understand what the other was saying.
         We can't let this cooperation succeed!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Otherwise, they would no longer have a place in the East!
        
         In the ancestral hall, the Xu family members gritted their teeth and expressed their thoughts of revenge.
         He had said those words that had let down his ancestors countless times. In the end, he began to talk about the Xu family's history, glory, and future prospects.
         His son and grandson had clearly died, but in the end, it was made to look like an oath-taking ceremony.
         This was how a politician did things.
         He was already dead, if he didn't take the opportunity to spread the Xu family's philosophy, wouldn't he have died in vain?
         Everyone outside was listening in silence.
         ,m No one retorted.  After almost an hour, the Xu family's ancestral hall was finally filled with cries. They began to mourn for Xu Zhen and his son. How would they feel if they were still alive?
         The sound of wailing also meant that the memorial ceremony was about to end.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, had been waiting impatiently.
          Seeing that the Xu family was about to be done, he quickly sent a message to Xu Qing,""Duke dingguo, can you let this King take a look? This King has already waited for so long, whether it's true or not, there has to be an explanation ... If it's useless, then don't waste my time!"
         Xu Qing cursed in his heart.
         This big golden dog's words were really unpleasant to hear.
         As the Overlord of the East, it had been a long time since someone had talked to him in such an arrogant manner. Even Yu Jie and the others in the audience would not talk to him in such a manner.
         Xu Qing pondered for a while and said to Li Hao,""We can look, but ... Do you have a way to determine if it's useful or not?"
         "Of course!"
         Li Hao said arrogantly,"it's a small matter. I just have to trigger the origin power in it. Of course, you don't know this, but I can tell if it's useful or not. Otherwise, why do you think I'm the one who has to go instead of the other Sunglow demons?"
         This was true.
         More importantly, the other demons are not as arrogant as you!
         It seemed that the Snake King of Mount kui was using his identity as a demon to intimidate the high Duke's public house. Otherwise, when a great demon came, the high Duke's public house would not lend out the wind-chasing boots.
         However, Xu Qing wasn't a good person. He transmitted his voice again,""If it's true and useful for the Dragon God's advancement ... Can I trouble you to say a few more words, emissary?"
         "What did he say?"
         "Announce the Alliance between Mount kui and the high Duke's public house, as well as the lineage of Mount kui's willingness to conscript the demons of Mount kui to help the high Duke's public house quell the unrest in the East."
         What Xu Qing needed was a public statement. Not only that, he also said,""In addition, we need a batch of spring water of life. We'll lend the wind-chasing boots to the Dragon God for free. We don't need to pay any price. We can use divine power stones or other treasures to exchange for the spring water of life in the Imperial Palace ... Of course, if the emissary is willing to exchange, that'll be even better. We urgently need a large amount of spring water of life!"
         "Those pieces of trash?" Li Hao's voice was filled with dissatisfaction.
         "It's better than what you saw in the treasure vault. The divine energy stone is of a higher grade, not the kind you saw."
         "That's fine. It's a small matter. All general Oki needs to do is absorb some energy and turn it into the spring of life. It's a simple matter ... I thought it was a big deal."
          General damu!  Upon hearing this, Xu Qing understood in his heart that this was probably the name of the ancient monster plant.
         Was he still a general in the past?
         Moreover, the other party had said it so easily. It seemed that some of the records in the ancient books were true. The more powerful the monster plant, the easier it was to produce the spring of life.
         He was a little envious.
         It was a pity that the public house did not have such a monster plant.
         There should be some spring of life everywhere now, but most of them were from the reserves obtained from the ruins, or simply from the dead monster plants, including some remnants inside.
         There really wasn't such a source of living things that could produce continuously.
         Thinking about this, Xu Qing felt quite excited. With a large amount of spring of life, it would be of great help in strengthening his five internal organs. He could directly strengthen his five internal organs, and he did not have to use it to save his life.
         At that time ... If I can completely unseal my combat power, the sooner the better. Who in the eastern land can be my opponent?
         After Xu Qing and Li Hao finished their discussion, they turned around and looked outside the ancestral hall."Today, the high Duke's public house is holding a memorial ceremony for my son ... I shouldn't be saying anything at this moment, but the Dragon God emissary of Mount kui has arrived and has something to announce to everyone. The Dragon emissary has come to speak ..."
         With elegant steps, the Black Panther swaggered into the ancestral hall, still as uncaring as before.
         Outside, the eyes of the experts flickered.
         Were they really working together?
         However, at this moment, everyone was hesitating. This was the high Duke's public house, not a place to pick a fight. Yu Chuo and the others were thinking about ambushing the Golden Demon outside the city, and had no intention of making a move here.
         If they were to fight here...It would be a chaotic battle.
         With so many powerhouses, there were supporters of both sides and a third party, as well as some non-staff organizations. If they caused a ruckus, it would be a big deal. Moreover, it would not be easy to hide it after the matter.
          If he really wanted to kill Jin Yao, he would have to leave the city and find a place with no one around to kill the Xu family's escorts!
         Obviously, they knew that the Xu family would definitely send some powerful cultivators to escort the big Golden Demon back.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Xu Qing wasn't stupid. He wouldn't give them a chance.
         It all depended on who was stronger and who had better skills.
         This was a game between the two sides.
         At this moment, the life and death of this Golden Demon was the key to this battle.
         ……
         At this time, Li Hao had already touched the Windchaser's boots through the black Panther.
         A divine intent entered it.
         A stream of faint sword energy flowed into the black leopard, and the wind-chasing boots trembled slightly. Li Hao's heart jumped.
        
         It seemed that this High Duke did not dare to fake it.
         When Duke dingguo saw the wind-chasing boots actually tremble slightly, his eyelids also blinked. He was secretly shocked. Even he couldn't completely control the wind-chasing boots. He could only draw in a little bit of power.
         But now, a casual move from this ancient demon had actually caused a reaction.
         As expected, it was amazing to have a long inheritance.
         Li Hao's voice also sounded in his ears.""Not bad. There's Origin Energy, but it doesn't feel too strong ... It might not be a pair, so it's a little lacking. But it's good enough!"
         "Then I'll be taking them away!" Li Hao added.
         "Emissary!"
         Xu Qing was shocked. He's going to take her away?
         "What's wrong?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao's tone was filled with dissatisfaction."You said you wanted to borrow it. Are you going back on your word?"
          "No... It's just that ... Messenger, according to the rules, this item has to be held in the ancestral hall for three days and worshipped for three days ..."
         "What's wrong with that? I'll keep it for now, but who knows if you'll take advantage of me not paying attention and change it to a fake one. Everyone says that you humans are treacherous ... It wasn't me who said it, it was the ancestor!"
         "Don't worry,"Li Hao added,"I'll announce the Alliance between kui Shan and your High Duke's public house. Even if I leave with the Windchaser's boots ... You won't lose anything with me as a guarantor for the Alliance agreement!"
         Once these words were said, Xu Qing was a little conflicted.
         However, it was still ... Unbearable to watch their family's inheritance treasure being taken away.
         "You're not happy?"
         Li Hao's tone changed,"forget it!" Let's leave this item here. Kui Shan can look for other divine weapons ... If he can't find them, then he can come back and take a look. However, it may not be me who will come then!"
         After saying that, Black Panther threw his wind-chasing boots down.
         Xu Qing stretched out his hand to help him up. His expression was slightly complicated, but he still quickly said,""No, you've misunderstood me, envoy. I don't mean it that way. I just feel a little regretful that I couldn't lend the complete wind-chasing boots to the Dragon God."
         "This King knows that in the hands of that whatever light sword, it will belong to the Dragon God sooner or later. The Dragon God has successfully advanced this time, so that light sword will definitely die!"
         When Xu Qing heard this, he could only comfort himself for a while.
         The light sword had taken away one of them without paying anything and had even killed many of their own.
         Now, the other one had obtained the support of a huge force ... It was enough, it was not a loss.
         Old ancestor, don't blame me.
         For the sake of the Xu family's great cause, when the Xu family grows up and unifies the world, there will be all kinds of treasures. I believe the old ancestor will not blame us.
         Li Hao didn't hold back. The Black Panther opened its mouth and directly swallowed the Windchaser's boots.
         Xu Qing's teeth ached at the sight.
         No more!
         At the side, Xu Xing also had a look of reluctance. The Xu clan's precious treasure ... Had been completely lost.  Of course, even if he said he would return it, he couldn't say whether he would return it or not ... Since he had lent it out, he shouldn't expect to return it. This way, he would feel more comfortable. Otherwise, he wouldn't feel comfortable if he kept thinking about it.
         The people outside had obviously seen this scene as well.
         Yu Jie and the others had grave expressions.
         At this moment, Li Hao sent another voice transmission, I'll go out and announce the news. It's a small problem ... These few fellows actually dared to humiliate my demon race. When I return to Mount kui, I'll definitely inform the patriarch and let them know that the demon race is not to be humiliated!"
         These words sounded much more comfortable.
         The Black Panther swaggered out. At this moment, in the Black Panther's stomach, Li Hao held the wind-chasing boots. After thinking for a moment, he put them on his feet.
         Not only that, after a moment of hesitation, he still sent a message to Black Panther: "Black Panther, later ... I will give you a hard blow ... Open your intestines and stomach. Your injuries are not light ... After that, I will feed you more delicious food. What do you think?"
         The Black Panther's eyes widened!
         To ... To kill a dog?
         "Pretend to be ambushed ... Do you understand what I mean? Later, when your intestines are cut open, you ... You can activate the power of your bloodline and become stronger in an instant. Then, you can attack Yu Chuo or the Duke of East Pole's son directly. After that, you can pretend to be defeated and be forced to retreat ..."
         Li Hao said quickly. He was acting.
         And create chaos.
         He had also guessed that these people might not dare to do anything here, but ... If he did not do something, it would not be easy for him to leave. Perhaps he could leave the high Duke's public house, but these people might ambush him outside.
         On the high Duke's public house's side, they might also arrange for someone to send him back to Mount kui. By then, it would be difficult to handle.
         It was impossible for them to let him go back alone.
         Once they reached Mount kui, even if the Python was willing to help ... Li Hao actually didn't want to cause more trouble for it. Previously, he had thought that it would be best to have a great demon to help. As for casualties ... What did it matter?
         However, the other party had helped him conceal his identity, and this was a sign of their friendship.
         Therefore, before he left, Li Hao had to reveal his identity to ensure that he had nothing to do with kui Shan. He was only using kui Shan's identity. Once Li Hao's identity was revealed, everyone would know that he had nothing to do with kui Shan.
          This way, he could avoid a lot of trouble for kui Shan.
         Whether it was a human or a demon.
         Li Hao's principle was the same. If you help me, I'll help you. If the Python was willing to help, then I can't bring disaster to the other party.
         Heibao was a bit reluctant.
         Li Hao sent another voice transmission, the sword is enough!
         Black Panther was in a dilemma.
         "I won't ride you next time ... You can ride me ..."
         Black Panther's eyes were shining!
         This ... Was possible.
         Opening up one's intestines and stomach might sound terrifying, but for demons, having a strong body was actually ... Not unacceptable.
        
         "I'll use the spring of life later to help you repair your body. "
         With Li Hao's words, Black Panther had no more objections.
         Li Hao also understood.
         Gou 'Zi agreed.
         "Move closer to them!"
         The Black Panther strode over on all four limbs, walking in front of those people arrogantly and arrogantly.
         Meanwhile, Li Hao also began to send out mental waves."The monster race of Mount kui is willing to form an official alliance with the Duke dingguo's mansion! When I return to Mount kui, the Dragon God will immediately dispatch five Sunglow demons, a hundred three suns demons, and a thousand demons under three suns to assist the high Duke's public house in guarding the border!"
         Everyone's expression changed.
         Some people were all smiles!
         They were all from the Duke dingguo's mansion. When they heard this, they were in a good mood. Five great demons, sunguang, over a hundred three suns, and over a thousand other demons ... That was enough.
          "Not only that, the kui mountain demon clan is willing to support the Duke dingguo's mansion with 500 drops of spring of life every year ..." Li Hao continued to boast.
         BOOM!
         Everyone was shocked. The Duke of dingguo was also shocked. He almost wanted to curse. There was no need to say this. If you said it, it would be a crime to hold a treasure ... It would cause some trouble for the Duke of dingguo's mansion.
         Of course, he quickly thought about it ... Maybe it was a good thing.
         With kui Shan's help, he did not need to fear too much.
         Perhaps, he could even take the opportunity to recruit some people.
         To recruit some top-tier experts!
         After all, 500 drops of the spring of life was an astronomical figure.
         Yu Jie and the others 'faces turned ugly. Five hundred drops of the spring of life? was this a joke?
         To scare people?
         But ... What if it was true?
         Then what's the point of fighting!
         In an instant, Yu Jie felt despair. She cursed in her heart. Why had the kui mountain clan suddenly appeared? and from the looks of it, they really did have the support of an ancient Fey. In fact, there was more than one of them. Damn it, why?
         The Xu family was ambitious, and they were only trying to protect themselves. Was it wrong?
         Why did he have to do this to them!
         Yu Chuo was unwilling, but there was nothing she could do ... She made up her mind. This time, she must keep this great demon here. Even if she died at the Dingbian, she had to leave a way out and hope for the huoming province.
         He was determined. The eldest son of the Marquis of East Pole also had a grave expression.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At this moment, the big Golden Demon was walking arrogantly to their side. He squinted at them arrogantly.
         Li Hao's mind fluctuated again."You humans, don't try to overturn the cooperation between kui mountain and the Duke dingguo's mansion. That's impossible. I'm not stupid. Some humans might want to kill me, but an expert from kui mountain will soon come to escort me back ..."
         Behind him, Duke dingguo vaguely felt that something was wrong.
         Don't be too arrogant!
         If he said that, it would be easy to anger them. He would make Yu Jie and the others disregard everything and fight to the death. It would be enough to intimidate them. If they were forced into a corner, even a rabbit would bite when it was forced into a corner.
         Just as he was thinking, his expression suddenly changed.
          It was at this moment that the Golden Demon suddenly let out a blood-curdling screech as a bloody gash appeared on its stomach!  In an instant, a large amount of blood spurted out!
         "Roar!"
         A shrill roar was heard. In the blink of an eye, a powerful demon appeared. Its aura was intrepid, like an ancient giant beast.
         "Ancient demon ..."
         As soon as this thought flashed through his mind, Li Hao howled,""Damn it, you dare to sneak attack the noble descendant of the ancient demon!"
         Roar!
         The Black Panther's roar shook the world as it swiped its claw at Yu Jie.
         In fact, Yu Jie was also a little stunned.
         He couldn't believe it ... Who did it?
         He was really bold.
         But at this moment, he couldn't care much. This big demon attacked him, and something suddenly happened to this big demon. Even if it wasn't him, the Duke of dingguo would not let him go!
         "Kill!"
         With a loud shout, he punched the Black Panther and roared,""Xu Qing wants to capture all of us in one fell swoop. He colluded with the demons and Pirates. Kill him!"
         The crowd was a little chaotic.
         The Marquis of East Pole's eldest son's expression changed slightly. In the next moment, he gritted his teeth and, without saying anything else, took a step forward and leaped into the air. A spear appeared in his hand, and he thrust it at the Black Panther!
         The powerhouses of the divine Sun Gang also made a decision in the blink of an eye.
         I can't let their cooperation succeed!
         Because, at this moment, Li Hao roared again,""This King will remember all of you. The bright fire, the Far East, and the divine sun society, just wait for your destruction! Kui Shan will definitely seek revenge to the end ..."
         Behind him, Duke dingguo's expression also changed drastically.
         Up until now, he still hadn't discovered who had attacked the big Golden Demon. Was there another expert in the dark?
         But at this moment, he couldn't be bothered to check.
         "Bastard!"
          With a loud shout, Duke dingguo punched Yu Jie and the others. His breath soared and he shouted angrily,""How dare you! Everyone, help me capture these bandits!"
         At this point, even though he was still worried about the existence of experts in the dark, he could not just watch the big demon get killed. Otherwise, he could not bear the responsibility.
         It was a good intimidation ... He really did not expect that Yu Jie and the others would have the guts to make a move here.
         They might not have been the ones who attacked earlier, but the moment the big demon was injured, these few people attacked. Clearly, they had made up their minds to kill The Golden Dog.
         BOOM!
         Powerful auras instantly burst out, one after another, and the world seemed to shake.
         Countless buildings in all directions were instantly destroyed.
         The experts from the various provinces were also instantly affected.
         Some people were a little scared, while others were a little solemn.
         Help who?
        
         Should they help the Duke of dingguo or Yu Chuo and the others?
         "Kill him all at once!" Yu Chuo roared."Will Xu Qing let you off the moment we die?" "The Xu family has wild ambitions and has long wanted to unify the East. Unless you become his dog, you will all die. Take advantage of this moment to kill this demon. Kui Shan doesn't know about this, and when the ancient demon comes, the Xu family will be destroyed!"
         As soon as these words were spoken, some experts in the crowd were moved. In an instant, some of them turned into shadows and attacked the Black Panther.
         In the next second, there were also powerhouses who tried to stop him.
         "You bastard!" Xu Qing shouted angrily."Yu Chuo, you must die today!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com 'Damn it!'
         Everything was going smoothly, but this old man actually dared to do this!
         "Retreat with the emissaries!"
         Xu Qing forced Yu Chuo to retreat with one punch and sent the Marquis of East Pole's eldest son flying with another. He was simply powerful to the extreme.
         However, there were many people who opposed him.
          There were many people who supported him, but there were not many top experts. The more top experts, the more unwilling they were to be under someone else. At this moment, even the red-bearded man only ignored them and quickly retreated with his people. He did not help.
         Redbeard's face was cold, and no one knew what he was thinking.
         However, the red-bearded man knew one thing. As long as the high Duke's public house and Xu Qing were still around, the red-bearded pirate would not be his, but this person 'S. He would be under this person's control for the rest of his life.
         However, if he died ...
         The Redbeard Pirates would be his.
         In an instant, a few people appeared beside Li Hao. They were the second general manager, Xu Xing, and a top-notch expert. From the looks of it, they were probably close to the transformation period.
         One of the three great generals!
         The Sword of Light had killed five generals, leaving only three generals, heaven, earth, and Huang. The one in front of him, judging from his aura, was probably the last-ranked general Huang. He didn't know if he had reached the transformation stage, but judging from his aura, he was not as good as Qian Feng and fan Chang.
         General Huang was not very old. With a serious expression, he protected the retreating Black Panther and struck out with his sword, sending a hidden Dawnlight flying.
         In front of him, Duke dingguo was also extremely powerful. He pushed back the enemy with one punch and shouted,""General Huang, bring them to the back ..."
         At this moment, the front was in complete chaos.
         In the blink of an eye, more than ten sunguang were engaged in a fierce battle.
         As for the others, they either retreated or dodged. Some of them were swept away and had no choice but to participate in the battle in order to protect themselves. In an instant, it was a mess. Xu Xing hurriedly said,"Quickly go to the Treasury!"
         It was chaotic!
         It seemed that someone had gone to the treasure house ... One should know that there were only two three suns there. Now these people were in a riot, and some wanted to fish in troubled waters. Once the treasure house was robbed, it would be a huge loss.
         Moreover, it seemed that the Duke dingguo was still strong and healthy. In addition, the heaven and earth generals were all here, and there were also various foreign officials ... Just Yu Jie and these people were not enough. They would be defeated sooner or later!
          As for the Black Panther, it struggled violently. Li Hao also roared madly,""I'm not leaving ... They actually dared to attack me ... Damn it ... If I didn't have an ancient bloodline that can instantly erupt, wouldn't I be dead? Damn it! We all have to die!"  Everyone was actually very shocked.
         This big demon was only at the middle stage of the three yang realm before, but just now, his bloodline seemed to have been activated. In the blink of an eye, he seemed to have the strength of sunguang. No wonder he was so arrogant.
         This also made him even more certain that this demon's bloodline was powerful and Noble.
         Seeing that it wasn't willing to leave and was going to fight, Xu Xing also secretly complained and hurriedly grabbed the Black Panther."Emissary, avoid its sharp edge for now. After my father deals with this group of Rascals, I'll let you deal with it ... Emissary's injuries aren't light, be careful of other strong enemies in the dark!"
         That's right, Xu Qing had also sent a voice transmission to warn them to be careful. There might still be powerful enemies hiding in the dark. He did not even sense how Black Panther was injured.
         However, at this moment, there was a bloody wound on the Black Panther's stomach that was still dripping blood.
         No wonder this great demon was so angry!
         In fact, the Black Panther was also in great pain. It cursed Li Hao for being too ruthless, but it was also time for it to show its Valiance. It roared with all its might, but Xu Xing couldn't stop it. In the end, the second-in-command had to work together to barely control the Black Panther.
         General Huang's expression was grave as he quickly said,""Retreat! Let's go to the Treasury ... Leave this to the Duke!"
         BOOM!
         The sounds of battle were extremely intense ahead, but anyone with eyes could tell that Yu Jie and her group were probably no match for them.
         In fact, Yu Jie had not intended to make a move here ... But she had made it in time, so there was no other way.
         At this moment, he also felt that something was wrong.
         Just now, who had injured that great demon?
         Or could it be that the high Duke's public house had directed and acted on their own, deliberately looking for a reason to kill them?
          However, at this point, there was no way to retreat.
         Yellow mud falling to the crotch, even if it wasn't shit, it was still shit!
         The big demon was injured. If he did not resist, Xu Qing would definitely take the opportunity to deal with him. He could only roar again,""Xu Qing, we'll stop him. The high Duke's public house has countless treasures in its Treasury. The great demon was heavily injured and on the verge of death ... After killing the great demon, they seized the Treasury and escaped. Who knows who did this?"
         BOOM!
         He was sent flying by Xu Qing's punch, and the eyes of some of the escaping powerhouses flickered.
         The public house's Treasury!
         Also ... If the big demon was killed, the Xu family might be finished. Yu Chuo and the others might not be able to withstand Xu Qing's attack. If they were all dead ... Wouldn't they have a chance?
         At their level, who didn't have some ambition?
         Moreover, some people had even harbored evil intentions.
         The three great organizations and the ninth Department had sent people this time. In their eyes, this was a dog-eat-dog fight. It would be better if they all died. In an instant, several figures flew toward the backyard. Xu Qing's face was livid!
        
         "Stop them!"
         With a loud shout, several figures appeared in the high Duke's public house again. They were all extremely powerful as they charged towards the strong cultivators in all directions!
         ……
         Li Hao, on the other hand, was being dragged by general Huang and the others as they fled in the direction of the Treasury.
         As Xu Xing fled, he quickly said,""It's good that we've entered the treasure vault. Although the treasure vault's defense looks ordinary, it actually has another set of defense system ... If Yu Jie and the others fall this time, the East will definitely belong to my Xu family ... And kui mountain!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao didn't seem to be interested. He continued to roar,"This King will definitely slaughter them!"
         As he spoke, a drop of the spring of life broke and seeped into his stomach. Xu Xing and the others were speechless. This injury seemed serious, but to demons, it was nothing.
         He's going to use the spring of life?
         The second generation of Yao was indeed different!
         In the past, Xu Xing had thought that he was a top-notch second-generation successor. But today, compared to this great demon, what was he?
          Was he willing to spend the spring of life like this?
         "Emissary, please calm down. After this matter is over, the Xu family won't let them off ... They'll definitely be killed to prevent future trouble!"
         Li Hao didn't respond.
         That won't do!
         He couldn't let these people who resisted the Xu family die. If they did die ... The Xu family would unify the East, and he would help the Xu family advance.
         He had many thoughts in his mind.
         In the blink of an eye, they had arrived at the treasure vault. At this moment, the others had not arrived yet. Xu Xing quickly opened the treasure vault and hid inside with the two three suns outside.
         After entering the treasure vault, he did not care about the treasures and quickly led his men to the third floor.
         On the third floor, to Li Hao's surprise, the man took out a key-like object from his storage ring. In the blink of an eye, he swiped the key above his head a few times. In an instant, to Li Hao's surprise, a staircase appeared above the third floor. It was the fourth floor!
         Xu Xing quickly went upstairs, and Li Hao hurriedly followed him on the Black Panther. Xu Xing had wanted to refuse ...
         However, when she saw it come up, she didn't say anything.
         The fourth floor was very small.
         It seemed to be isolated by an illusory formation.
         There was only one thing on the entire fourth floor. It was something that looked like a mirror fragment. Xu Xing quickly sent waves of inner strength into the mirror fragment and then stuffed a large number of divine power stones into it.
         To Li Hao's surprise, a faint energy spread out. The next moment, the entire Treasury seemed to disappear from the world, and the sounds outside also disappeared.
         Seeing black Panther staring at the mirror, Xu Xing could only say: "This is a fragment of a Supreme treasure excavated from a historical site ... It doesn't have much use, but it can isolate and conceal things."
         Of course, he didn't mention that it was also used for surveillance.
         "As long as we hide here, even if sunguang comes, he won't be able to enter the treasure vault ..."  At that moment, the mirror reflected the movements of the entire public house.
         Everything was displayed on the small mirror.
         Xu Qing was suppressing Yu Chuo. Yu Chuo was a powerful powerhouse in the transformation stage, but now, facing Xu Qing, even if Xu Qing had not been unsealed, he was still far from being a match for him.
         In Li Hao's opinion, this Xu Qing might even be comparable to Hong Yitang!
         Li Hao was also shocked. Amazing.
         What was even more amazing was that this treasure fragment had such a magical effect.
         At this moment, the entire Treasury was extremely quiet.
         General Huang, the second General Director, Xu Xing, the two three suns, Black Panther, and Li Hao were all there.
         On the mirror, the surrounding scene appeared again. Many human figures flickered and quickly gathered here.
         It seemed that these people were all eyeing the treasure house.
         At this moment, Xu Xing suddenly cursed,""Bastard!"
         General Huang and the others quickly went upstairs, feeling a little suspicious. Xu Xing pointed outside and said angrily,""Redbeard! "That dog of a B * stard! How much did our Xu clan pay for him to rise to power? he didn't go help my father, and instead brought people here ... He's a bastard!"
         He was extremely furious!
         This Redbeard was actually so bold.
         Otherwise, Xu Qing would have an easier time with one more metamorphosing cultivator and a few more sunguangs.
         General Huang's expression was also extremely cold.""Young master, I'll go out and kill him!"
         Xu Xing waved his hand.
          What a joke. He was a powerhouse in the metamorphosis stage. General Huang was one as well, but ... He had just barely entered the metamorphosis stage. He was not much stronger than a peak Sunglow. If he went out under such circumstances, it would be hard to say who would kill who.
         They all stared at the mirror, but Li Hao seemed to be thinking about something.
         Of the three, Xu Xing could barely be considered one, while the second general manager was only at the mid-stage of the rising light realm ... Which wasn't a big deal. The truly troublesome one was general Huang, who was at the transformation stage. Even if he was weaker than an ordinary transformation stage cultivator, Li Hao wasn't confident that he could kill him in one blow.
         At this point, he didn't want to think too much about it. He only had one thought ... To kill these people and take their treasures.
         As for the powerhouses outside ... Especially the red beard who was standing guard outside, he thought of the tree root that little tree had given him ... Perhaps ... It could deal with those in the metamorphosis stage?
         These Pirates were not good people either.
         If he could also kill them ... That would be for the best.
         At this moment, general Huang was right beside him. If he launched a sneak attack, there was still a chance of success, but Li Hao wasn't sure if he could kill him in one blow ... He quickly thought of something and rolled around in the Black Panther's stomach.
         The Black Panther howled in pain.
         When general Huang heard the voice, the few of them hurriedly looked at him. Li Hao hurriedly said,""Damn it ... There seems to be a special force invading my body ... You ... You're the strongest. Quick, help me get rid of this thing ... This seems to be the Shi of a Martial Master ..."
