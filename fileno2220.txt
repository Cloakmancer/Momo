(Double the monthly votes. It's the last day. Give me some. Pitiful.)Li Hao and his men left quickly.Cutting off the great Dao and weakening the heaven and earth. This move was beyond everyone's expectations.At the same time.- Eastern continent-Ying Hongyue's aura was dispirited, and the two saints beside her had already disappeared. At this moment, blood was also seeping out from the corner of Ying Hongyue's mouth. She couldn't help but chuckle,"How ruthless!" Li Hao, you're so ruthless.How many saints had he killed this time?'Also, did this guy discover something? he's not showing me any mercy at all. If I'm killed and the seal is broken, won't he be afraid?'Or ... Did he know that he would not die so easily?He really thought highly of himself!Ying Hongyue glanced at the two corpses beside her that had almost been cut into pieces. She laughed and her laughter suddenly became louder and louder. She suddenly raised her head to look at the sky and her eyes flickered with red light,"Li Hao ... It seems like he forced you to leave!"Li Hao, you're really something!I've been watching this guy for a long time, but I can't do anything about him. But today, it seems like you've driven him away.You ... Were you waiting for this moment?If so, I can only say that your means are too high!If not, then you'd be considered to have made an unintentional contribution.He reached out and grabbed the two broken corpses. He quickly absorbed their energy. Ying Hongyue coughed for a while and then laughed. She didn't know how many Zheng Yu had lost this time.It was a good thing.He turned his head and looked in a certain direction. In the ruins of star suppression city, Zheng Yu seemed to have another clone that was trapped there. Now that the heaven and earth could no longer accommodate Saints, the other party's clone would probably have to stay there for a while.The premise was that Li Hao didn't deal with him.If he were to go, Zheng Yu's clone wouldn't be able to stay."Maybe ... I should go and see him."While Li Hao had other matters to attend to and might not deal with this clone immediately, he ... Might be able to create a half-Emperor clone to try it out.His eyes flickered and he quickly ran to the ruins of star suppression city.This time, all sides had suffered heavy losses, but it was also an opportunity.Now, Li Hao had finally gotten rid of the influences from all sides. He had even gotten rid of some existences in the dark. Even Ying Hongyue had to admit that this method was very brilliant.As for how Li Hao would deal with it when the world stabilized again, he did not care. A person like Li Hao must be confident, or he would not have done it so easily.Ying Hongyue quickly flew in the direction of the ruins of Star Town City. She had to hurry up. Perhaps there would be some unexpected gains.……On the other side.The Queen's body was broken, and she looked extremely miserable. The Silver Moon Power in her body had almost completely dissipated, and she kept coughing up blood.She, who was paralyzed on the ground, kept breathing and gasping.At this moment, the sky was filled with dark clouds and rain was falling. Her aura was also very weak, but she suddenly laughed. She laughed so hard that blood kept gushing out. Inside her body, Dao meridians were activated one after another, which made her laugh a little crazily.I'm the moon goddess?She looked up at the sky. I'm yueshen?The moment the moon disappeared, she seemed to have sensed something. Combined with Li Hao's strange actions and words, he deliberately let her go several times, and he accidentally opened a few Dao meridians ...Also, the strange way the gods were resurrecting ...She had never considered all of this before.However, today, her belief in her God Country had collapsed, and the God Power in her body had disappeared. The Silver Moon Power had also been cut by the world cutting technique. She suddenly felt its essence."My intrinsic power ... Is not the power of faith, the power of the Silver Moon, or divine power. It is ... The power of the new Dao!Isn't it laughable?"I'm ... The second moon Goddess?"Her eyes were filled with madness, anger, despair, and hatred ...Too many emotions erupted at this moment!From a very young age, some memories flashed in her mind. She was the moon goddess, the number one God in the world.She was the Queen of Scandinavia when she was very young!The Prophet God and the others had found him, and he had recovered a part of his memory. He also knew that he was a God, a God of heaven and earth, the most noble God of the Silver Moon, the moon god!Therefore, she was born to be a king, a noble!At the age of 21, when Li Hao was still struggling, she became the Queen of Scandinavia at the age of 6. No one objected to it, because the gods had sent down a divine decree!She was born to be a noble!But today ... Everything had been exposed.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Everything that was covered on the surface was revealed.Li Hao felt that she was very stupid, and Ying Hongyue might also feel the same ... However, they had all risen from the bottom and didn't know how smoothly it had been for the Queen who was born to be a noble!At the age of six, the billions of people in the divine Kingdom prostrated themselves before her and pledged their loyalty to her without any complaints!A Divine Spirit protecting the Dao, a Supreme talent!He easily crossed countless levels.What three suns rising light, what sun and moon ...It was not a problem for her.Where the limits of the world were, she would be there!Heaven's will was watching over him and he was omnipotent.It was not until that day when he attacked heavenstar that he encountered a slight setback. And the first time, Li Hao lost even more ..."So ... I'm nothing ..." He muttered.The Queen gritted her teeth and laughed.His smile was cold and filled with resentment.At this moment, many details that she had not paid much attention to in the past appeared in her mind one by one. At this moment, she finally saw some of the real world. It turned out that she had been living in an illusion since she was born.

Chapter 2221 Coveting My Body (2)
At this moment, she once again thought of Li Hao's profound words!"She's alive, she's the moon goddess!"As long as I live, I will be the moon goddess!The Queen mulled over the meaning of these words and suddenly laughed hysterically ... So you've already seen through it?As long as I live, I will be the moon goddess!The real Moon Goddess was in the dark ... What if the real Moon Goddess died?All these thoughts burst out in an instant!A person's change was in an instant.At this moment, it was like a queen who had never experienced any setbacks had suddenly matured, grown, and become a little crazy and extreme.For 21 years, everyone has been lying to me!"They're using me, deceiving me, treating me as a puppet, treating me like an idiot, and I ... Have always lived in lies and deception!Hatred, anger, all of it burst out at this moment.Revenge!This hatred, which had been exploited for 21 years, was far greater than Li Hao's failure. At this moment, she understood that Li Hao had never intended to kill her. He was only using her to deal with the real Moon Goddess!No wonder ... He was always so nonchalant. His gaze was so complicated every time, as if he was saying,"you can be even stronger!"It seemed to be saying that he was very pitiful!The Queen gritted her teeth so hard that they almost broke, and a painful roar came from her throat.You guys ... Are you all laughing at me?Am I that laughable?You bunch of bastards!"The moon goddesses ..."Suddenly, she turned her head and looked in one direction. It was North.In the North, Silvermoon's true body was still within the seal.Where was the real Moon Goddess?Was it in the world?He's gone?In the past, he had never felt such a feeling. Today, he could clearly feel that some connection with the power of the Silver Moon had been cut off ...She wasn't stupid, but she had never thought about this. At this moment, she was constantly thinking about something.In the past, the moon goddess might have been by his side, watching his every move.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ However, after Li Hao's massacre of Saints, the moon goddess's control over him had suddenly weakened or even disappeared. She was definitely not in the seal but beside him.Where was he?Where was he?The next moment, he raised his head and looked at the sky. He looked at the illusionary moon. The moon in the past seemed brighter. He had always felt that the moon was real.I'm the moon goddess, and I didn't pay much attention to it in the past, but today...Why is there no silver Moon Power in the moon? Ever since he was young, the Silver Moon Power that he had cultivated seemed to have originated from the moon."She's up there ... She disappeared today!"At this moment, she finally understood.In the past, she had been on top of the moon, but today, due to the sudden eruption of the pressure from the world, and the fact that the other party might have moved the moon away in order to avoid Li Hao ... She had lost contact with the moon, and the other party ... Had not returned!She used to be here, but she didn't come back today. Where did she go?In the past, even heaven and earth could not accommodate Saints, but she was here. This meant that the moon was actually a relic. However, today, this relic had disappeared ... The great Dao universe?A thought emerged.The Queen laughed again. Li Hao, you seem to have forced her to leave!He turned his gaze to the North again ... The Silver Moon seemed to be in the seal as well.Who was the true Moon god?Her eyes glinted. Since Li Hao said that I'm still alive ... Then I'm the moon goddess. Perhaps ... I'm the moon goddess!I thought you weren't going to appear?Perhaps, this is my chance.I've been surrounded by the Silver Moon's power all these years, and I've even obtained some of the moon goddesses "memories. I understand the moon goddesses too well, and in the eyes of the divine Kingdom, the people of the world, and even the heavens ... I'm the moon goddesses!A puppet?When the real Moon Goddess is gone, won't I ... Be the moon goddess?"She was in the seal before, how did she come out?"As these thoughts flashed through her mind, she quickly flew up into the sky. Strands of faint Silver Moon Power spread out at the end of the world. She had some thoughts. Perhaps ... I can enter the seal! To seize the real silver Moon!At that moment, I was the moon goddess.I turned my head to the North. Li Hao, Zheng Yu, Ying Hongyue ... Are you all looking down on me?Then I'll let you all know that I was born noble!In an instant, the Queen broke through the void. She had a feeling that there might be another way to enter the seal without anyone knowing if she followed the overflowing power of the Silver Moon and continued forward!That Red Moon Emperor ... Probably also wished that he could take away Silvermoon's true body and weaken the seal for him, right?Whether he could succeed or not ... He might need the help of this venerable sovereign!At this moment, the Queen seemed to have completely awakened.The successive blows and the pain of suddenly seeing the truth of the world didn't make her collapse instantly. Instead, she regained her calmness after her anger. At this moment, she didn't even care about her multiple failures at Li Hao's hands.Because ... I'm not the moon goddess.I'm just a normal person, so what's the big deal if I'm defeated by Li Hao, who's known as the world's number one expert?……Li Hao didn't expect this change.Perhaps no one had expected such a turn of events. No one cared about the Queen's disappearance, whether she was alive or dead. Ever since the faith in the divine Kingdom collapsed, Li Hao had actually stopped caring.Li Hao was looking forward to seeing if the Queen could get him any more benefits ... But he also wondered if that person would die in this accident.

Chapter 2222 Eyeing My Body (3)
They were all a little worried for the Queen!Such a good person, one death was one less.At this moment, Li Hao was heading toward the Western continent.Soon, he saw the injured Lin Hongyu, the puppets, and ... The smell of blood that still lingered in the air. There were also countless scattered power of faith, countless cries of pain and despair.They were filled with hatred toward the gods!The more they believed in him, the more despair and hatred they felt when their faith collapsed!The sound of cursing gods resounded throughout the world."Lord Marquis!"Lin Hongyu was as quiet as ever. It was as if she had just killed someone with a knife, but she had disappeared again and turned into a graceful beauty. Her smile was gentle. "We've already taken down the divine Kingdom, but ... It's a little chaotic."Li Hao slightly nodded and glanced at her.""Are you disappointed?"Just now, heaven's will must have favored her.In fact, there was even a chance that he could forcibly push her to the Dao integration stage.In the end, because of Li Hao's words, not only did she fail to gain the favor of heaven's will, but at this moment, the entire world seemed to be targeting her.Li Hao, Lin Hongyu, and black Panther.These three seemed to be targeted by heaven's will. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ The Heaven's Will had not completely disappeared.However, after suffering such a heavy blow, he chose to go into hiding.If Lin Hongyu had not listened to Li Hao, this moment might have been the new limit of the world.Lin Hongyu chuckled."I'm not disappointed. You've even given up on the heaven and earth that's within your reach. What's more, it's just some heaven's will ..."Li Hao smiled and nodded."Don't be disappointed. Heaven's will is nothing. It's not a good thing to gather too many of them. Someone is watching heaven's will. Once too many of them gather, you'll become a thorn in their side!"He was talking about li daoheng.The other party wanted to capture the Heaven's Will, but this time, it would be difficult.Lin Hongyu was already at the seventh level of the sun Moon tier earlier on, the second after director Zhao. Now, there were many more of them, and Lin Hongyu was only at the fourth level.And this was only after he had recovered a significant amount. In the instant that he had detonated his Dao meridians, he had only managed to recover a great deal at the mountain and sea level.However, compared to the others ... She, who had always been in the lead, was now behind by a large margin.The fourth stage of the sun Moon realm. At this moment, he was not even comparable to Hong Yitang's daughter, Hong Qing.Even some of the new generation of powerhouses were stronger than her.For example, the Dao sword cultivators from the inspection Office and Hu Qingfeng, who only knew how to flatter, had all entered the middle stage of the sun Moon realm.She was like this, and so was black Panther.This time, besides Li Hao, these two had suffered the greatest losses.Or rather, this man and dog.​ "Follow me ... Students of Yuanping martial arts university, go and meet up with Jiang Ying and Li. Rest in the ancient city for a while. I'll build a physical body for everyone later. Now ... We don't lack these!" The girl from the Li family, li shengzhang, who had scolded Li Hao for touching her in the past, felt very complicated at this moment. She responded and then said,""Governor li, did teacher and the others ... Appear in Silver City?""Right, he's entered the seal."Li shengzhang didn't ask any more questions. He led the puppets and quickly flew toward the ancient city.Li Hao glanced at it but didn't say anything.He looked at Lin Hongyu and smiled."Let's go! To the great Dao universe!"Lin Hongyu did not say much and followed.Li Hao tore open the void and Lin Hongyu stepped into it.At this moment, there was almost no one in the great path universe. Heaven battling city had been teleported out again to suppress the world.Lin Hongyu had been to the universe of the great path before, but this time, she seemed to have a clearer view.One of the galaxies seemed to be in pieces.Many stars were dim and lightless.Li Hao, who had been in charge of various places, had disappeared, and the divine text that had unified the Galaxy had been shattered.This time, Li Hao shattered the divine runes he had condensed earlier.These galaxies and the stars that had gathered here ... Seemed to want to leave this place.The circular River of Stars was about to collapse.Lin Hongyu understood that Li Hao had exploded too many Dao meridians, so he had little control over the Dao universe. He had even lost control. It seemed that he had suffered a great loss this time.He had clearly killed so many powerhouses ... But in the end, Li Hao didn't seem to have gained anything.The losses were too great!"Lord Marquis ... Are all these stars formed by the Dao meridians?""Yes,""Do you know why I only brought you in?" Li Hao nodded and asked.Not only her, but Heibao was also there.Lin Hongyu shook her head."I don't know. Is it because my strength has declined? is the Marquis going to reward me with something?"She revealed a smile, as if she was very ignorant and pure.Of course, Li Hao knew that this woman wasn't that simple!From the first time they met to the second time when they fought, she had given him the city of superpowers. From being the Overlord of a region, she had instantly become his capable subordinate. How could this woman be simple?It was full of courage!Li Hao didn't say much. He just pointed at Xinghe and said,""Overall, the Galaxy has grown stronger. This time, it seems like quite a few bright stars have appeared. This means that someone has opened a Dao Meridian, not just one or two, but many, many! This time, I didn't make any progress, but an extremely powerful energy suddenly exploded between heaven and earth. A large number of Saints died, and a large number of great DAOs scattered. There will always be a group of people who seize the opportunity to enter the mountains and seas, and even the sun and moon!""It's all because of Lord Marquis's selflessness!"Lin Hongyu said softly,"if it wasn't for the Marquis, they wouldn't have had a chance. The Marquis is a true justice for the people. Everyone is like a dragon. He hides wealth among the people!"

Chapter 2223 Coveting My Body (3)
Was it flattery?A little.But the truth was as such.Li Hao had never suppressed the martial arts of the common people. Instead, he had been pushing it forward and throwing out all the good things. Now, there were more than one billion cultivators in the world, if not more.With so many people cultivating, there were bound to be some geniuses. Li Hao had never suppressed these geniuses, and they all made rapid progress.There were many opportunities.First was the opening of the forbidden Sea, followed by the recovery of heaven and earth, then the fall of Saints, the overflow of energy, and the filling of the power of great DAOs ... There were also martial arts academies everywhere, and they could earn energy stones with just basic infrastructure ...All of these were promoting the development of the entire martial Dao.The new Dao had become the mainstream of the world."No need to flatter me, this is not important! "Besides, we just need each other's help. I've given them opportunities, and they've actually helped me a few times. It's good to kill the Heavenly King, but this time, it's better to deal with the Saints and kill the will of heaven ... The People's hearts are useful! Of course, it's also thanks to your propaganda and the creation of gods ... Actually, there's no need for that. However, the people have helped me a few times now, so I won't be pretentious. " p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  If it wasn't for the People's support, it wouldn't have been so easy to deal with those Saints.In just one battle, he had killed 12 Saints.Without the Dao of the People's heart, how could one mess up the Heaven's Will in an instant?Lin Hongyu didn't say anything else. She was only puzzled ... Why did Li Hao bring her to the Dao universe?Give me benefits?Compensate me?However ... Li Hao's own great Dao had been mostly broken. What help could he give him if he didn't hurry to repair it and brought him here?As he thought, Li Hao suddenly said,""Many people want to become the human King, but I have never considered becoming the human King myself."Lin Hongyu was stunned."I'm not cut out to rule the world ... Of course, in this era, martial strength is Supreme!"Li Hao laughed,"martial strength is actually enough. You just need to do your best!" You and director Zhao are both people that I have high hopes for. By right, director Zhao should be closer to you since you're both from the Silver Moon!""But ..."Li Hao said softly,"it's also because director Zhao is also from Silver Moon. I think that if director Zhao is in charge of the world, there might be some disadvantages. Too many people in Silver Moon might not be a good thing!" And one more thing, director Zhao ... You're a bit older, so you still respect me, but you lack a certain feeling. "Lin Hongyu remained silent.When it came to the Silver Moon Martial Master, she usually didn't say much.Li Hao smiled."Let's not talk about this. I brought you in this time because I have some ideas. My previous cultivation was too messy, so I want to sort out the great Dao again. In fact, I've sorted it out a few times, but it's still messy!""It's because we're improving very quickly, but every time, we'll forget or miss something ..." Lin Hongyu nodded and asked softly,"my Lord, do you want me to help you move the stars?"Li Hao had mentioned this before.Previously, many people in heaven battling city had helped Li Hao move the goods."No!" Li Hao shook his head and said, I want to reorganize the great Dao on a large scale! It's no longer as simple as moving it!"Li Hao said,"I've gained something recently. Do you remember when we were sorting out the Dao meridians? we found that 360 Dao meridians could form a sword."Lin Hongyu nodded. Of course she remembered!This was the foundation of the new Dao!Who would forget?Moreover, everyone's cultivation was following this order.Just as she was thinking, Li Hao said, I have some new ideas this time! I want to divide the entire universe's great Dao into 360 regions, corresponding to the 360 Dao meridians. Furthermore, I want to add some attribute Dao meridians into attribute-less Dao meridians ...""What do you mean, Lord Marquis?" Lin Hongyu looked at Li Hao in confusion.Was the current division not appropriate?Li Hao explained,"to put it simply, the 360 Dao meridians will be used as 360 base points. With each base point as the center of the area, the various attributes will no longer be separated. Instead, they will be ... Mixed!" The various Dao meridians are mixed together, not without order, but in an orderly manner, and then they are reorganized!""There's a huge benefit to this ... In the end, I can successfully merge them!"Li Hao smiled brilliantly."In other words, I'm going to completely penetrate a Galaxy and turn it into order and chaos!" Of course, on the surface, I'll still maintain the current attribute division ..."Lin Hongyu hesitated, not quite understanding Li Hao's thoughts.Seeing this, Li Hao could only say, simply put, I want to split the Galaxy into two parts! "The first part is the area we can see now. The second part ... I want to create the astral River essence, the rivers within the astral River! Myriad DAOs return to origin!""The entire Galaxy is divided into two levels. The first level is the current region of various attributes, the five elements region, the wind lightning region, the blades, Spears, swords, halberds ... The stars are decorations. I want to create a river of chaos that includes the Galaxy!""Why?" Lin Hongyu was shocked.Why did he do that?Not only was it troublesome, but it was also a huge project. She didn't understand why Li Hao didn't continue according to the previous division.At this time, he suddenly had to sort it out.Li Hao explained again,"all DAOs return to one!" Previously, when I devoured the great wilderness, I gained some insights. The chaos is very complicated! The great wilderness seemed to be in disorder because this was a disorderly chaos. The orderly chaos and heaven and earth should be able to nourish the myriad DAOs! It can even nourish the world and the universe!""The reason I called you in is to make it up to you. Secondly, I want you to help me with something ..."

"Lord Marquis, please give me your orders!"Lin Hongyu replied hurriedly. She was a little surprised. How can I help you?Now, Li Hao had many saints under his command.With his strength declining, what else could he do to help him?Li Hao laughed."You're very good at public opinion, and you're also very good at bewitching the People's hearts ... Ahem, provoking the People's hearts ... No, controlling the People's hearts ... No, you're just ... Good at talking ..."Lin Hongyu did not know whether to laugh or cry.How am I supposed to respond to this?Li Hao smiled."I have the idea of combing through the great Dao. However, it's too difficult. I need your help!" And this, I will need you to help me!""Lord Marquis, I ... How can I help?"Li Hao hesitated for a moment and said,"it's very difficult!" "I want to sort out the great DAOs and merge them together. I need the cooperation of all the people, but ... I can't be too obvious and let others notice my purpose! In short, it was very complicated! "For example, when I need to extract some fire-type power, I might need 10000 or 100000 cultivators with Dao meridians to activate their fire-type Dao meridians together and teleport with me ... No more, no less. Don't touch those with other Dao meridians ..." p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "I need the wind element, and I might need the wind element to operate on its own ...""In short, it's a sorting out of the cooperation of the entire nation!"Li Hao explained,"I'm just giving a simple example. In fact, it's more complicated. I need the cooperation of the people and the balance of the DAOs to form order and chaos. In fact, it's fine if they don't cooperate, but they'll be very fragile!""I need a stable River, so I need everyone to be United. The fault tolerance is too low!""I think Qian Wuliang might be able to do it ... But he might not be able to do it. Besides, he can only control a small number of people. The world is so big that he can't control all of them!""As for you, you've been in charge of Heavenly Star for some time. Now, the public is familiar with you, knows you, and trusts you very much ... When the time comes, I'll sort things out in the Dao universe. I can only rely on you to command from the outside!"Lin Hongyu was stunned. Command the people?This ... How can I guarantee this?You must be joking!"Lord Marquis, this is too difficult. If things go out of control ... I ... I can't bear the responsibility!" She couldn't help but say.Don't mess around!"Lord Marquis, the people are weak. Why don't we find some powerful cultivators and control them? if we gather these people together, even a million cultivators will do ...""That won't do!"Li Hao refused and shook his head."I want to be the strongest cultivator. I want to build the strongest Galaxy. A million cultivators ... Can they compare to a billion or two?" Even those who haven't opened their Dao meridians have opened their aperture acupoints. Aperture acupoints can also affect the Dao universe ... I need all cultivators to focus on one thing ..." You ... What are you thinking!Lin Hongyu's head was about to explode!Are you giving me benefits, or are you asking me to die?Li Hao said enticingly,"if you can help me, I can give you a great opportunity!" Isn't Qian Wuliang's Dao powerful? Little Doyle! If you help me, I'll forge a new Dao for you! The People's Dao!"Li Hao tempted him,'it's actually a smaller version of the path of the human Emperor! "I'll let your Dao run through the Galaxy ... At that time, I'll control the Galaxy. Although you can't control it, you might be able to become the number two figure in the great Dao universe ... I didn't even give this opportunity to the few people closest to me. I gave it to you. Lin Hongyu, see how much I value you!"Lin Hongyu was speechless.Did he value it? It sounded very tempting.But ...She said with a headache,"Lord Marquis, the human heart is hard to fathom!" It's fine usually, but now it's time to unite the people. They'll do whatever you want them to do. They're people, cultivators, not machines, programs, not puppets ... I'm not sure. Maybe give me three to five years ...""At most a month!"“……”Lin Hongyu was on the verge of breaking down. She was completely dumbfounded. After a while, she said,"A month at most?""In fact ... It might be even shorter! I have to seize this one month's opportunity, because one month later, someone will come out. By then, I won't be able to hide anything from others!"Li Hao said seriously, I can't beat them! In terms of strength and preparation, I'm not as good as them! "The only way is to find another way. This is why I'm so determined to lock them up this time! It's just one month ... If I miss this opportunity, everything I have will be under the control of others, including this Galaxy of the great path!""Now, there is no one in the Dao universe!""Now, no one is monitoring me from the outside ... Besides, I'm worried that Qian Wuliang and the others are being controlled by someone! As for you ... You've been quietly using the Redwood to help you level up ... It's actually a good thing. "Li Hao continued,'I'll only have a chance to succeed if you help me! Not only must it be done, but no one will have any doubts ..."Lin Hongyu had a splitting headache!"Lord Marquis, I ... Can't do it."This was really impossible.Li Hao frowned,"how can that be?" You have a lot of ideas! You always have a way. You see, the superpower City is taken down in an instant, and you always turn the situation around. You can easily control public opinion and people's hearts. You can even say that the revival of the forbidden Sea is my gift and that the dead are alive ... Qian Wuliang is hated by the Silver Moon Martial Master, but you always try to please both sides. The Silver Moon Martial Master thinks that you are good and Qian Wuliang is leaning toward you ... Compared to Qian Wuliang, you are more qualified to be the mastermind!"

“……”Was this a compliment or a criticism?Lin Hongyu did not know what to say.Li Hao said solemnly,"this matter is of great importance. It concerns the future!" "Everything I'm doing today is to lock up all the powerful enemies in the dark for a month so that they can't control me! I want to make a huge change in this month and turn the world around! It's not just them, even the red moon sovereign will not have the time to care about anyone this month ... The Heaven's Will has also hidden itself. It can be said that this is the cleanest moment in history!"Only one month!A month later, heaven's will might appear again. Li daoheng, the moon goddess, Zheng Yu, Ying Hongyue, the red moon Emperor ... All of these people might appear again.He was not joking.Everything he had done was for a month later.During this period of time, he wanted to completely change himself and make everyone lose control and understanding of him. At that time ... Whoever still thought of him as the Li Hao they were now would suffer.As for Lin Hongyu ... He had no choice.Just as Li Hao had said, apart from Li Hao, this woman had the greatest control over the world.Lin Hongyu's forehead was covered in sweat.After a long time, he said,"Lord Marquis, it's very difficult!" The time is too short, and you said that the fault tolerance is very low ... I'm even more embarrassed!"She gritted her teeth and remained silent for a while before saying,""Lord Marquis, if you want me to do this, I have a request ... I hope Lord Marquis will agree!""Speak!""I ... The Marquis is going into seclusion to recuperate! As for me, I'm going to be a villain. I'm going to announce to the world that I'm going to find a way to resurrect professor Yuan and the others!"She looked at Li Hao and said in a deep voice,"Lord Marquis, announce that you're going into seclusion to recuperate and that you'll hand over all the power in the world to me!" This includes the control of the main cities and the Saints. Everyone has to listen to me!""As for me ... I hope to give Lord Marquis a pleasant surprise. I hope to control the people and resurrect my teacher and others while Lord Marquis is in seclusion ... Of course, that's impossible!""I also want control over all the resources in the world," Lin Hongyu continued."I can use them as I please. I'll even give them official titles and authority. If anyone objects to me, I ... I want to ... Punish them, including ... The Silver Moon Martial Master!"She continued,"these are not enough!" I still need a position ...""Speak!""The Marchioness of Silvermoon's wife!"Li Hao was stunned. Lin Hongyu lowered her head. "I'm just an outsider. Why would the Silver Moon Martial Master listen to me? The Marquis is in seclusion. Do they really care about me? "That includes those neo-martial experts. They're afraid of the Marquis, they care about the Marquis ... Unless I can really represent the Marquis. The Marquis controls the great Dao universe, and the Marquis is in seclusion. I have the power to control the world!" Li Hao looked at her in a daze.Lin Hongyu lowered her head even more."I ... I need the Marquis to announce to the world that the Marquis ... Will marry me. I am the heavenstar Governor and the wife of the Marchioness of Silvermoon. So, while the Marquis is in seclusion, in order to surprise the Marquis and to make Yuan Shuo and the other seniors attend the wedding ... I will do everything I can to resurrect them. Only then will I have enough reason!"Li Hao opened his mouth.He was speechless for a while!Don't mess around!I just want you to help me sort out my Dao. Good fellow, you want to be my wife!At this moment, he was stunned for a moment before he said,""So ... I ... I'll take you in as my disciple?"“……”Lin Hongyu lowered her head,"Lord Marquis, do you think ... Anyone will believe you?" Only ... By becoming the wife of the Marquis would she have the right to do so! A disciple doesn't mean anything. On the contrary, it's more like trying to hide something!""And the Marquis wants to marry me ... Which is in line with everyone's thoughts and ideas. In order to win me, senior Sequoia, the sage, and Qian Wuliang, the powerful man from the city of superpowers ... In order to balance the restriction between the Silver Moon Martial Master and the powerful Man From Another Place, this is also in line with the way of the Emperor!""In order to consolidate Lord Marquis's rule. After all ... Lord Marquis's strength is currently declining. In order to consolidate his rule, marrying me is what Lord Marquis's goal is! At the same time, I can openly inform the people and the world that while Lord Marquis is in seclusion, I can prepare a great surprise for Lord Marquis ... To revive several seniors!"Li Hao was silent.Lin Hongyu gritted her teeth and said,"Lord Marquis, it's just a title ... This way, there's a chance of success!" Otherwise, the Lord Marquis would have to reveal his goal himself. Otherwise, it would be impossible to achieve it! The people only believe in the Marquis, not me! "The Silver Moon Martial Master and the neo martial artist both believe in the Marquis, not me. I'm just the Marquis's representative, I don't really have the ability to control people's hearts!"Li Hao scratched his head. For the first time, he showed the uneasiness and restlessness of a young man. Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ He sized Lin Hongyu up and said after a while,""You ... Don't have any thoughts about me, do you?""Marquis, you've misunderstood ..." Lin Hongyu quickly said. Li Hao frowned,"no idea?" I thought that all the women in the world would feel my charm. After all, I'm the most powerful man in the world today!"“……”Lin Hongyu wanted to vomit blood. What kind of answer did he want?If I say I'm interested in you, are you going to find fault with me too?"Lord Marquis, what do you think ... Of my suggestion?" she asked helplessly.Li Hao frowned and pinched the Black Panther's head. The Black Panther grimaced in pain. Li Hao scratched his head again, not quite used to it. "You mean, I have to ... Announce it to the world?"

Chapter 2226 Coveting My Body (3 In 1)
 "Of course! "And ... We also need to confirm the date of the wedding. It's best if it's in a month's time. This way ... Everyone will believe that I made this decision to give Lord Marquis a surprise while he was in seclusion. It's a waste of time and effort, a waste of money and people ..."Li Hao scratched his ears and cheeks."There's no other way?"Lin Hongyu shook her head."There's another way ... That is, you can tell the public that you want to deal with the strong. You have to sort out the great Dao in secret. You have to sort out a different great Dao. You need everyone's cooperation."Bullshit!If that's the case, what's the point of me struggling?Li Hao, who had always been calm, was a little embarrassed at this moment. After a while, he said,""This ... I'm only 21 years old. I ... I've never been in love. I've been fighting all this time, preparing for revenge ... I ... Suddenly announced that I'm going to get married? This ... Does everyone believe this?""Why not?" Lin Hongyu asked calmly. "A month from now, the world will recover, and the Marquis will be in grave danger. Before he dies, why can't he marry a wife, inherit the family business, make some preparations, and enjoy himself? There were three ways to be unfilial, and having no offspring was the worst ... Perhaps the Marquis hoped to have a descendant to pass on his legacy. Heavenstar was still very traditional, starting a family and setting up a career ... First start a family, then set up a career! Lord Marquis's great undertaking has yet to be accomplished, but forming a family first makes people feel more stable!"Li Hao's head hurt even more!Why ... Was it so sudden?I just want you to help me sort out my Dao, not work for me or marry a wife. The one I'm marrying is still you!"You ... How old are you?""Lord Marquis, this is not important!""No, no, no!"Li Hao shook his head,"very important!" Tell me first, how old are you? I've forgotten, but someone seemed to have said that you were 30 years old? Or bigger?"Lin Hongyu's eyebrows twitched. After a while, she said,"Around 20!""Impossible!"Li Hao shook his head and said,"impossible. How many years has the city of superpowers been around for?" You have been in charge of SuperPower City for a long time!"Lin Hongyu looked at him in a daze.Do you know ... At this moment, if you weren't the Marchioness Silvermoon, I might have killed you!The scimitar was about to explode!  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  After a long while, he gritted his teeth and said in a low voice," 31!""It's this big?""You're 10 years older than me!"Li Hao was shocked.“……”Lin Hongyu was silent. She clenched her fists tightly!It's so big! Was it very big?In the era of superpowers, am I that big?31 years old ... Was that very old?This was the era of superpowers!The strong can easily live for 100000 years. You don't mind others being older, but I'm 31 years old. Am I really old?Li Hao was conflicted. He mumbled," 31 years old. You're 10 years older than me. You've been in charge of SuperPower City for more than 10 years. I'm still in elementary school!"“……”Lin Hongyu almost couldn't hold it in anymore, but she suppressed the anger in her heart and held back."My parents died early, my teacher is gone, my brother is gone ... No one is stopping me now ... But ... Sigh!"The sighs continued.At this moment, everyone in the great Dao universe seemed to be frowning."Do I have to pay such a huge price for my career and success?" Li Hao mumbled."Lord Marquis!"At that moment, Lin Hongyu's voice was much sharper.""I was only giving a suggestion for Lord Marquis's Grand cause. I didn't say that I really wanted to marry Lord Marquis!"Li Hao smiled bitterly."But I've already announced it to the world. What's fake has become real. If word gets out that I don't want you anymore, wouldn't I ... Wouldn't I be despised by the world?" Do you really think I don't understand? At that time ... Wouldn't I have to bear the infamy of the ages?"“……”You really think too much!Li Hao sighed and waved his hand."You can go out first. I'll think about it. I'll give you an answer after thinking about it. Think ... Whether it's worth it or not. I'll bet my entire life's happiness on whether I can succeed this time ..."Lin Hongyu turned around and left. Soon, she looked back at Li Hao and suppressed her anger. She said in a low voice,""Lord Marquis, the passageway!""Oh, oh, oh ..."Li Hao quickly opened a passage, and Lin Hongyu disappeared.As for Li Hao, after watching her disappear, he stroked the Black Panther and sighed,""Heibao, do you think she really doesn't have any other way, or is she coveting my body and status?"“……”The Black Panther wagged its tail and head. 'Don't ask me. I'm just a dog. How would I know?'

2227 Chapter 374
Heavenly Star.It was thriving.The battle between experts had nothing to do with the people of heavenstar. It was now the era of fanatical infrastructure, the era of crazy Education Promotion, and the chaotic era of the old replacing the new.Everyone was fighting for their future.There were many opportunities in this era.With the four continents United, the four kingdoms were almost completely destroyed. The Silvermoon world welcomed its first unification in 100000 years. Other than the Li Dynasty, which was still struggling, even the divine Kingdom had been taken.The military governors of the four directions were all leading troops to suppress the people who were in turmoil.The administrative Bureau was also selecting officials.The martial arts Academy opened its doors to everyone, regardless of whether they were rich or poor, as long as they had the talent. In this era, everything was new and changing.The inherent class system was being broken, and a new class system was being born.This was unavoidable.The martial masters of Silver Moon were the largest Interest Group in this world, followed by the neo martial group, led by heaven battling city.Next was the core group formed by Lin Hongyu, Redwood, and Qian Wuliang, who occupied the important positions. Even an old and snobbish person like Chen Zhongtian had to lean toward this group.The outsiders were also forming groups.Although the strong enemy was still there, and everyone was still working together, it was these experts who were fighting for the interests of all parties, for their descendants, for more experts to appear, and for more resources and opportunities to be obtained.To Li Hao, this was nothing.To these people, however, it was very important. Wasn't conquering the heavens and earth for the sake of a glorious future?Although there were no conflicts on the surface, they were competing fiercely in private.The interest groups formed by the Silver Moon martial masters were almost unbreakable.Li Hao came from Silver Moon and was a Silver Moon Martial Master himself, the most outstanding representative of Silver Moon martial masters. Even if the current head of the five military governors was Lin Hongyu, and the head of the demon plant Army was Hong shanmu, none of this could be changed.……Heavenly Star City.As Li Hao's level dropped and the seventh level of the sun Moon realm appeared in large numbers, some powerhouses who had been lagging behind caught up one after another. Their pursuit of their own benefits also became higher.Even though there hadn't been any major disagreements, there were still some minor conflicts.Regarding the distribution of resources, heaven battling city needed them, the experts from martial Union who had come to serve them needed them, some of the students from Yuan Ping martial Sciences University needed them, the Silver Moon Martial Master needed them, the governor's office needed them, the monster plant ...Everyone was lacking in resources!Heaven and earth were recovering, and energy was overflowing. However, to countless cultivators, it was too little.As of now, the mineral veins had yet to recover, and there was a lack of energy. A portion of the experts were still in the recovery stage. The huge Star Mine had been completely depleted, and just the problem of resources alone was a huge problem. They were lacking in resources!It was not just resources, there were also weapons and armor. They had obtained a lot of resources after defeating several big cities, but it was not enough. The number of star soldiers, including the great wilderness, had increased to 1.5 million. The four military governors and the star military governor all needed armor.The raincloud Army was fully equipped, but now that Da Huang had joined them, they still had 200000 cavalrymen, and they needed armor.Not only that, even the inspection Office had a hand in it, and they also hoped to get a share.There were too many people in the inspection Office! There could be fewer troops, but there couldn't be fewer patrol officers.The big cities had seized a million armors, barely enough to meet the needs of the Army. It was really hard for the inspection Office to meet the needs.This also caused Chen Zhongtian to be a little unhappy.He only asked for approval for 100000 suits of armor. There were many people in the inspection Division, so it was dangerous. Although they would not participate in the battle, the inspection Division was the one who maintained order in the chaos.Now that there were no wars in the Army, he felt that the armor should be given to the inspector first.He wasn't too happy that the Silver Moon Martial Master had obtained the fruits of his victory.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  If Yuan Shuo, hou Xiaochen, and the others were still here, he wouldn't have the right to fight for it. But now that they weren't here, Chen Zhongtian wasn't afraid of the other Silver Moon martial masters.As one of the nine divisions in the past, he was very senior. He was also one of the first powerhouses to join Li Hao and had participated in many wars with Li Hao, including the first time they fought against the monster plants in the relic.Many Silver Moon martial masters weren't even as experienced as him.As a result, because of these small matters, heavenstar was in a bit of a mess. It was also related to Li Hao's recent lack of management, and the fact that a military force like the governor's office and a civilian force like the administration Bureau could not restrain each other.……Li Hao had been watching all this for the past two days. He didn't interfere or participate in it.Fighting was actually a good thing.If everyone had no more desires ... Then there would be no room for improvement.If they didn't fight for it, what future would they have?However, the competition had to be controlled within a certain range and within a virtuous circle. A vicious circle could not appear, as it would be easy for things to go wrong.However, as the main force fighting against the powerhouses from all sides, it was indeed impossible for him to spend time on these things.Right now, he was short on time."Qian Wuliang, Zhao Shuguang, Lin Hongyu, Zhou Chuan, Chen Zhongtian ..." He said.These names appeared in Li Hao's mind, but he quickly eliminated Chen Zhongtian and Qian Wuliang. These two were capable, but they were not generous enough and were a little narrow-minded.The others also didn't approve of it.Director Zhou hadn't changed to a new Dao, so he didn't have enough authority to rule the new Dao world. Thus, he was removed by Li Hao.

2228 Chapter 374
No matter how he thought about it, Zhao Shuguang and Lin Hongyu were still the most suitable candidates.Li Hao was actually thinking about Lin Hongyu's suggestion.He felt a little uncomfortable, but ... It was only for a moment. For Li Hao, in this era, after so many years, getting married and having children seemed to be just a mission.Something like love ... Was too much of a luxury for him.He had no time, no energy, and no mood to talk about love.Those who achieved Dao and did great things ... Would not have such time to think about women ... Of course, his teacher was an exception, and in fact, he was not an exception. His teacher had never married and had children, until later on, when he hooked up with the Azure light sword."A title?"Li Hao pondered for a while. Who was more suitable, Lin Hongyu or Zhao Shuguang?It wasn't that he wanted to marry director Zhao, but he was thinking about who would be more suitable to be in charge.Both of them had their own strengths.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ They all had their flaws.Lin Hongyu was ambitious. Director Zhao was less ambitious, but he was still ambitious.One once controlled the city of supers with millions of supers, while the other once managed the chaotic Silver Moon land.The two of them were both at the seventh stage of the sun Moon realm, so the difference in strength was probably not big.One was backed by the Silver Moon Martial Master group, while the other was backed by the foreign Martial Master super group.However, the Silvermoon Martial Master group was already very powerful. Everyone knew that Li Hao came from Silver Moon. Furthermore, Silver Moon was from the northern continent, while Lin Hongyu was from the central continent.The northern barbarian ... No one had ever forgotten this name.The other continents, including the central continent, were much less accepting of the North.After much thought, Lin Hongyu might be more suitable.As for the fact that the other party was a woman ... In this extraordinary era, who would still care about this?After weighing the pros and cons, Li Hao also felt that Lin Hongyu was more suitable. She had made a lot of contributions and was very capable, and the Silver Moon Martial Master had a high opinion of her."Give her a name?"Li Hao thought to himself. At this moment, he was considering a lot of things, but none of them included his personal feelings. Do people like me, who are cursed by the heavens, need feelings?The people I have feelings for ... Are all dead!There were no exceptions!He did not have many thoughts about whether it was suitable or not. When he was talking to Lin Hongyu earlier, he was just in a daze for a while and suddenly felt lost."Looking at the overall situation, what she said is not wrong!"It could also balance all parties. Through Sequoia, it could also balance the side of neo martial.Hong Mu was currently the leader of the monster plant Army and a new Sage. The monster plant Army was related to general Huai and even The Guardian monster plant that had just joined martial Union ..."Also, there are enough reasons and motivation to help me sort out the great Dao!"At this moment, Li Hao finally understood.Perhaps, the only thing I can't get over is the hurdle in my heart ... I'm a jinx. Would she die if it was just in name?I don't believe in fate!"However, I've been struggling. I've been struggling for my life. I don't believe it, but I know ... I'm a thorn in everyone's side. Lin Hongyu, do you understand that this name may give you more power ... But it will also make you die faster?Li Hao's wife ...He could spare everyone in the world, but Li Hao's wife had to die!The wife of the current king ... Her name was too important!Even Li Hao, who seized heavenstar, killed heavenstar King, a large number of experts from the royal family, and almost all the members of the royal family ... No one said anything. Every Emperor had his own courtiers. In the past dynasties, how many members of the previous royal family had a good ending?"She's a smart person, how could she not understand?"Li Hao chuckled. Lin Hongyu should have understood this, but she still brought it up. Women are ambitious.Now, he had both half-step sovereigns and venerable sovereigns. Li Hao was only at the seventh level of the sun Moon tier, and there was no guarantee that Li Hao would win."Director Qi!"Li Hao shouted, and not far away, director Qi, who was on standby, floated over."The core of the world's sky screen is with you, right?" Li Hao asked."Yes, he is."Director Qi nodded. He was now independent and very carefree. He had helped Li Hao complete the construction of the sky screen and was now researching some medicinal materials, preparing to set up a pill Research Institute.All the cultivators in the world were cultivating, and there was a lack of energy.However, he had no lack of herbs now.In the new martial era, an era of energy shortage, herbs were also used to replace some energy consumption. The herbs were nourished by the heaven and earth, so they could play a better effect and consume less energy.Recently, the Research Institute had already produced a batch of pills and was currently testing them.Once it was successful, it would be promoted very quickly.He could also gain some wealth for heavenstar, who had run out of money."Did the pill experiment go smoothly?"Li Hao asked, and director Qi nodded."Everything is going smoothly, and it doesn't come from nothing. It's not difficult to make some changes on the basis of neo martial!"Li Hao nodded slightly."The Lu Zhen Research Institute has eight major projects. I remember that one of them is about spiritual resonance and frequency, right?" he asked."Yes,"Director Qi nodded."Everyone's mental frequency is different," Li Hao said after some thought."However, the hearts of the people are one, and all of them are one. In the end, these frequencies will be unified and form a resonance ... Have you studied this?""There are!"Director Qi nodded."There was research many years ago. Back then, the human King and Supreme martial artist were blessed by the people, so this field was not completely blank. Later, the military's formation actually also began to use this research, the unity of qi and blood!"

2229 Chapter 374
"Including some of the armors we have now, there's actually a small formation that resonates with the frequency ... Otherwise, how can soldiers with different cultivation techniques work together, and even fight as one?"Li Hao's heart moved. This was true.Formations were actually a form of resonance.He had some understanding in his heart and said,""So, whether it's the people or even more people, in the end, they can adjust the vibrations to a single frequency, right?""From the perspective of infinite extension ... It's possible. However, the more people there are, the harder it is to find this frequency!"Sometimes, you can't understand what director Qi is saying.However, Li Hao could understand the meaning behind it."Then, with the same attribute and the same Dao Meridian, no matter how many people there are, will it be easier to adjust the frequency of the oscillation ..." He thought for a while and said."Of course, they come from the same source, so it's definitely like this. It'll be simpler! However, coordination was needed. It depended on how many people there were. A hundred, a thousand, ten thousand ... Everything was easy to coordinate, but a million people was difficult! In the past, the main city's Army would usually be controlled within a million. That's because once the number exceeds a million, it's difficult to adjust the frequency even if the order is strictly followed. "He added,'even in the neo martial world, the largest Army only has millions of people, no more! Because once there are too many people, it'll be hard to control. We'll lose control, and our combat power will decline!"At most a million people?  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. What if I want a hundred million, a billion, or even two billion people to achieve such a resonance?“……”After a long while, director Qi said,"it's as difficult as ascending to the heavens!" It wasn't just the issue of command. There was another difficulty, which was the person in charge, like the Marshal of the Army. Could you grasp this opportunity? Can you achieve such control? It's very, very difficult!""Of course, the path of the human Sovereign can actually do it ... Back then, on the side of neo martial, billions of people completed the resonance and thus the path of the human Sovereign was born!"Li Hao nodded. After thinking for a while, he said,""Director Qi, can you set up some equipment on the sky screen so that everyone can resonate more easily?""This ..."Director Qi looked at Li Hao and pondered for a long time before saying,""It's not that difficult. ""Not big?"Li Hao was a little surprised. Director Qi chuckled.""It's not big, didn't I say it before? Military armor had such a function. The more powerful the armor was, the stronger the resonance. Otherwise, how could it gather blood? If he had a gold-grade armor, it would be easy to achieve this function! But does Lord Marquis want to cover the entire world?""Yes,""Then we'll need more gold armors ... Of course, we don't need armors. We just need some equipment in the armor. Silver is fine too. It's not impossible, but it will take some time to modify ...""How long will it take?""A month ...""That's too long!"Li Hao shook his head.Director Qi's heart moved slightly, and after some consideration, he said, "I'll need a long time to do it alone. If ... There's an expert helping me, then the speed will be much faster. It's just that the sages can't appear now. If there are more Undying's helping me, I should be able to settle it quickly!""How long is the fastest?" "Seven days will do."Li Hao thought for a while and nodded."Then I'll ask someone to help you. Find senior uncle Hong and the demon-hunter guards.""Alright," he said.Director Qi did not ask further.He only had some vague thoughts. Of course, he was still thinking about the Dao of the people and didn't think too deeply about it.Could it be to strengthen the effect of the Dao of all people?It was possible."Give me the heart of the sky screen."Director Qi didn't say anything and handed over a small mirror. The sky screen was actually just an imitation of the heaven-peeking mirror. This mirror was actually a replica of the book of wind and cloud.Li Hao had snatched it from Fengyun Pavilion, but it wasn't very effective now, so Li Hao had put it aside.After some consideration, Li Hao suddenly imprinted a word on the mirror,"Hao!"His spiritual power entered it and felt countless small light spots, which were the sky curtains of various places in the world."I need to disclose a piece of news ... I won't be meeting the others. When director Qi goes out, tell everyone that I'm going to cultivate in seclusion for a while. I'll take this mirror and vice-mirror of wind and cloud with me later, and they'll be my bright star token! The person holding the order is like me!"Director Qi was a little confused, but he didn't ask further. He nodded,"Alright, I got it."Li Hao, what news are you going to disclose?Li Hao seemed to have thought about it for a long time. He didn't quite understand what else he needed to announce and think about. Even when the other party was dealing with half-emperors, he didn't do this.Li Hao, on the other hand, was silent for a while before he activated the wind and cloud Deputy mirror.……At this moment, all over the world, mirrors were floating, covering the sky and the sun.Other than the people of the great wilderness who had just migrated over, the people of the Heavenly Star were used to it. Under normal circumstances, if there was a major event in the Heavenly Star military governor's office, they would send a message to all parties through the sky screen.Now that the mirror had appeared, someone said excitedly,""Are we moving the city again?"Last time, when Li Hao entrusted megacity with his task, he had done a live broadcast. It was also at that time that everyone witnessed Li Hao's great power.Some people had even gone up to the sky screen.There weren't many interesting things to do now. All of a sudden, everyone turned their attention to the sky screen. Some of the large colonies had sky screens scattered everywhere. Some of the higher-ups even had small sky screens in their mansions.At this moment, everyone, big and small, was looking at the sky screen, waiting for the news.
