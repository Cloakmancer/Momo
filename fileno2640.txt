A cat?The new martial arts Emperor Cang was a cat.There was a cat here.Was it related to that Emperor Cang?His strength ... He couldn't see it clearly, but it looked alright. He was probably at the second stage of venerable sovereign. However, he didn't seem too strong. Compared to Emperor Cang, he was far inferior.If Li Hao were to count on this cat to defend against him at a critical moment ... It wouldn't be very good.Of course, Li Hao might have other tricks up his sleeve.However, he had no interest in trying it out.In the next moment, a baby fell to the ground, crying.In an instant, it began to grow.This time, his cultivation speed seemed to be faster than the last time. Kong Ji put in some cultivation techniques. Later on, he seemed to have some ideas. Suddenly, he even put in some destructive power.This might be more interesting.Li Hao, on the other hand, also began to grow rapidly.The process was the same as the last time, and the method to trigger his memory was the same as well ... The effect was not bad.Three years old, six years old, nine years old ...Kong Ji had also seen clearly how this person had reached the venerable sovereign level step by step.When Li Hao walked down the river of life and death, he had already grown into an elegant young man.At the age of 16.This time, even faster than the last time, Li Hao's aura of a venerable sovereign had emerged, and he had recovered to the power of a first-stage venerable sovereign.This was not enough!Bridges of life and death quickly appeared. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  One, two ...Stars appeared one after another like a spider web!Previously, Li Hao had forged 50 life-and-death bridges, but he was unable to enter the second stage of venerable sovereign realm. This time, the accumulated energy began to merge into his body. Soon, 50 life-and-death bridges were built.This speed was still very fast.Then, it was 60,70 ...Kong Ji stared at it intently. It was as if a world existed in his eyes. With a thought, he was born, and with a thought, he was destroyed!100 lines!At this time, a lot of energy had been consumed, and a large amount of life-and-death energy had gathered. At this moment, Li Hao had already forged a hundred bridges of life and death.Even at this point, the world of extinction was still extremely quiet.It was clear that the void's Nirvana domain was extremely powerful. At this moment, it had not attracted anyone's attention.110!At this moment, Li Hao suddenly turned to look at Kong Ji.""I'm about to enter the 2nd rank! "Primal Chaos tribulation lightning is bound to befall me ... I've reached stage two, so the power of tribulation lightning must be at least stage three! In fact ... He's even stronger!""Of course!" Kong Ji smiled and nodded."You can just advance!"Hearing this, Li Hao did not hold back.Whether or not you can take it away ... Depends on your ability.As for the giant pincer, it had a complicated expression.To these people, advancing to the next level seemed like a simple task. The primal Chaos lightning tribulation didn't seem scary at all. On the contrary, it seemed like an opportunity.Comparing people ... It was really infuriating.Fortunately, he wasn't considered a human.The next moment, 120 bridges of life and death appeared.On Li Hao's body, the power of life and death fused, and his aura suddenly became much stronger!The entire life and death Star had expanded.The river of life and death also instantly penetrated the heavens and earth and expanded greatly.At this moment, tribulation clouds appeared in the world, and the primal Chaos lightning tribulation was about to descend once more.At that moment, Kong Ji laughed."This lightning tribulation ... Is for me!" Li Hao had advanced easily.To him, going from level one to level two did not seem to be difficult.Kong Ji didn't care. At this moment, his Nirvana world suddenly flickered with a River of Stars, piercing through the void and covering the Tribulation clouds. However, the Tribulation clouds seemed extremely illusory and he couldn't touch them.Kong Ji raised his eyebrows. In the next moment, he shouted and the world of Quietus trembled!At this moment, a world seemed to emerge from the world of destruction."Open!"With a low roar, the Nirvana world suddenly seemed to split the heavens and earth. The great DAOs in all directions sank and all living things in the world were destroyed!There seemed to be a special power contained in The Quietus. "Revive!"With another roar, the entire world of destruction seemed to want to give birth to life and revive something ... But at this moment, the Tribulation clouds that had ignored him suddenly split the world!Kong Ji laughed.It was a good thing!This meant that ... He was on the right path.Good, very good!I seem to have some understanding and some feelings.As for the Tribulation clouds, they instantly became stronger. What was the big deal?At this moment, he stretched out his hand and pointed at the Tribulation as if the world had been destroyed!Li Hao watched intently as he pointed his finger. Suddenly, a destructive force collided with the chaotic destructive force, and the Tribulation cloud collapsed with a loud boom!His finger was also instantly wrapped in lightning and burned to death.Very quickly, the finger regained its vitality.The void pointed at the Tribulation cloud again and again!In the end, under Li Hao's shocked gaze, Kong Ji suddenly bellowed. This time, he pointed his finger, and it was as if the world was no longer sinking. With a point of his finger, all living things began to recover ...BOOM!The entire world seemed to have gained some life.In just an instant, the Tribulation cloud was completely shattered!The empty finger also exploded into blood and splattered in all directions. The entire silent world was covered in blood. At this moment, a touch of green suddenly appeared in The Silent World.A small blade of grass was growing with difficulty in the depths of the Nirvana world.The blood was like nutrients, nourishing the grass.Kong Ji looked at the grass and was stunned for a moment. After a long time, he looked at Li Hao. "I'm going into closed-door cultivation for a while, and fellow Daoist li probably also needs to do the same ... If there's nothing else, don't cause any trouble for the time being.""Congratulations!" Li Hao nodded and smiled."Same to you!"Kong Ji laughed,'level three isn't difficult ... Fellow Daoist, you can wait for it! As for me ... There's not much difference between level five and level six, but Level Seven is too difficult!"After saying that, he sighed,"but I seem to have seen a little hope!" However, my enlightenment this time is still too shallow. Fellow Daoist, you have to work harder and do more things. I hope that one day, fellow Daoist will revive the great path universe here. By then, the commotion will be unimaginably great. For me, the revival of all the great paths may be where my opportunity lies!"Li Hao smiled."I hope so!""Then let's encourage each other!""This place isn't safe anymore," Kong Ji said with a smile."The chaos lightning tribulation has been destroyed, but there's still some movement ... Let's go together!"In an instant, the world spun.The three of them instantly disappeared.The fire element mountain was still the fire element mountain, without any changes.Soon, the venerable Dragon Emperor and the others reappeared. They were a little confused. Was another chaos lightning tribulation born?Strange!They were rarely seen on normal days, so why did they appear one after another today?Could it be that the entire tianfang world was really going to be completely restored?The Emperor was a little uneasy, but at the moment, he had not found any clues or news. He could only suppress his throbbing and hope to expand the power of the Huilong temple as soon as possible.

Chapter 2641 Exiting Seclusion (1)
After leaving Li Hao in a remote place, Emperor void left alone.As for Li Hao, he fell into deep thought as he watched the other party leave.Nirvana, revival.In his second Samsara, Kong Ji had given him some comprehension of Nirvana, which gave Li Hao some insight. The rebirth of a world was first Nirvana, followed by recovery.p Life and death, on the other hand, was the Dao of life and death.Yin and yang were the cycle of yin and yang in the world. Where there was Yin, there was yang.Elemental systems like the five elements were the foundation of matter.There were similarities and differences between these DAOs, but Li Hao gained more insights. At this moment, he understood that the world he had tried to create in the past ... Could only be called a small space.The real world was not like this.The real world had the five elements, yin and yang, life and death, destruction, recovery, reincarnation, time, and everything!Creating things out of thin air, living beings multiplying, all living things recovering, and the system being complete.This was the world!"I see ... So that's how it is!"Li Hao murmured. In that case, the long river that I opened up before ... Was really not a world."Heaven and earth, great Dao, heaven and earth formed the chaos, and great Dao formed the universe of great Dao ..."Many thoughts appeared in Li Hao's mind.At this moment, he was absorbing the remaining energy while comprehending other DAOs, including some of the orthodoxies that the two advanced venerable sovereigns had spread.Physical body, elements.These orthodoxies were all very important."Time ... Is a very complicated thing! Only when all the elements are successfully created can time be born. I have come into contact with time in advance. Is the time I came into contact with real time?""And where did the Dao of time come from?"Li Hao's understanding of time wasn't that deep.Everything originated from that star of the great path.Time star!It was because of this star that Li Hao had become who he was today.Only then did he have the thought of comprehending time.Otherwise, according to his original path, he shouldn't have comprehended time. Instead, he should have comprehended the 10000 DAOs, controlled the great Dao universe, or created his own heaven and earth. Moreover, what he created wouldn't be time heaven and earth.Everything began to change because of the appearance of Time and Stars."Time is the heart of the myriad DAOs. One still has to comprehend the myriad DAOs. Otherwise, time will be incomplete.""The great Dao of the commander of life and death. The great Dao of yin and yang is the second stage ... If you can't comprehend yin and yang, then you can comprehend the resurrection of destruction."Li Hao kept thinking. At this moment, he didn't consider what he would do next.Instead, he was thinking about how he should walk his future path. As for saving Heaven's Fate and King Huai next, or helping new martial to resist the strong enemy ... These were all secondary. The unclear path was a great taboo in the future.The Bridge of Life and death began to be built again.One after another!There was still a lot of remnant power of a rank four venerable sovereign.Li Hao didn't pay much attention to the Water-type weapon left by the heavenly River Thearch. He simply gave it to the firmament sword to devour. Now, whenever he had any treasures, he would give them to the firmament sword to devour. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The firmament sword was also growing.He had also gradually built about 150 bridges of life and death. If he built more than 240 bridges, he should be able to reach level three, and if he built 360 bridges, he might have a chance to reach level four. However, even if he reached level four, Li Hao still knew nothing about the way of yin and yang.Outside Li Hao's seclusion area, the giant pincer was guarding with all its might, even though it seemed extremely weak.However, the giant pincer's heart was still burning.A powerhouse who could kill a fourth stage venerable sovereign!Not only this, but the empty venerable sovereign, who usually didn't pay much attention to him, was also speaking so arrogantly that it was hard to imagine.The giant pincer was shocked by his attitude, which showed that anyone below advanced venerable sovereigns was not worth mentioning.This venerable sovereign of the Hui long temple wasn't too conspicuous in the Hui long temple. He was very quiet, but ever since he met Li Hao, his tone had been unusually arrogant!These two people ... Where would they go in the future?Neo martial, Crimson Moon, Tian Fang ...For the first time, the giant pincer began to think about the future. It wanted to know where the future would go, and what role these two people would play in the future.And now, in the land of chaos, the neo martial human King and the red moon master were the rulers of chaos.Everything had fallen into chaos and turmoil because of the battle between the Crimson Moon and neo martial.……At the same time.Silver Moon land.A giant beast lay prostrated in the chaos. Within its body, a world was constantly breathing in and out energy.The entire Silvermoon world was also changing.Two to three months had passed since Li Hao left.In the past two to three months, the Silver Moon land had also undergone some changes. The two great Dao Masters 'strength had also increased day by day as they came into contact with chaos.Tens of thousands of people, tens of billions of people, were all cultivating.When these people were strong, the great Dao would also be strong.And now, the truth path universe had already risen to an unbelievable level. Countless stars appeared, and the long river of chaos was incomparably thick. The torrential water crashed into the world.In the void Dao universe, more and more experts were coming into contact with void Dao.Qian Wuliang also received a lot of feedback. Although the void Dao universe was still inferior to the truth Dao universe, it was still improving on the whole, and Qian Wuliang's strength was approaching the venerable sovereign realm.The master of the great Dao in a medium world ... There was no precedent.

Chapter 2642 Exiting Seclusion (2)
Under normal circumstances, a great world would give birth to a great Dao universe, and a master of a great Dao was usually at least level four. Almost no one would be weaker than level four. Even level six was considered weak.The seventh rank was the normal standard.Under normal circumstances, if the Lord of the great Dao and the Lord of the World were united, at least one high-level venerable sovereign would be born.If they did not unite, they would either give birth to two high-leveled venerable sovereigns or two sixth-level venerable sovereigns. This was the average level of experts in the entire chaotic region and great worlds. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  As Li Hao left, the time he took grew longer.Within the Silver Moon realm, more and more experts appeared.On this day, several Silver Moon experts gathered together.……In the small hall, only a few people were qualified to participate in this meeting.The two masters of the great Dao, Li Hao's master Yuan Shuo, Li Hao's nominal wife Lin Hongyu, and the embodiment of Black Panther's will, the king of the Li Dynasty and the Queen of Silver Moon.Apart from Yuan Shuo, who was only at the fourth level of Dao integration, the others all had the qualifications to enter the venerable sovereign realm.In addition, there were Heaven's Fate and Zhang an.These two had always represented the neo martial force.Apart from Yuan Shuo, the nine experts were all close to the venerable sovereign level."Recently ... I've sensed some experts searching nearby."Qian Wuliang was the first to speak."After the Marquis left, the strongest person on Silvermoon's side is Heibao. Heibao is now a second level venerable sovereign, but recently ... The people searching nearby may not be any weaker than Heibao.""As for me, the only venerable sovereign I have so far is Black Panther ..." He continued.After Li Hao left, the defense was obviously much weaker.Previously, they were even confident that they could deal with a third level venerable sovereign. However, after Li Hao left, they might not be able to fight against a stronger second level venerable sovereign. After all, Black Panther had possessed a body and did not reach the second level venerable sovereign realm by himself.They all looked at Qian Wuliang. In fact, this man didn't respect anyone but Li Hao.Even black Panther was no exception.Qian Wuliang was probably the most fearful and ambitious person among them, but he didn't dare to let Li Hao die. He even thought that Li Hao wouldn't die.Lin Hongyu looked at him and said,""Dao master Qian, if you have something to say, just say it!"In fact, Qian Wuliang was the one who called this meeting.As the master of Phantom path, he had the right and qualifications.Qian Wuliang coughed and said,"now that we are connected to the chaos, we finally understand that the internal conflicts of Silver Moon ... Are really not worth mentioning, just like what you said." The chaos was too vast, infinitely huge, and had an infinite number of experts! For many experts, the great path universe is a huge temptation. It's so big that it's unimaginable. It turns out that there's almost no great path universe under the great world. ""So, once Silver Moon is exposed, even if it has nothing to do with new martial, it will still be a disaster!"Everyone nodded. Now, they had some understanding of chaos. Qian Wuliang continued."Before the Marquis left, he told us to adapt to the situation. Now that we've been hovering around here, it's inevitable that some wandering cultivators will find us. I even think that the tianfang world might pay more attention to us because of the Marquis 'recent entry into the tianfang world. They might even take the initiative to look for us!""I mean ..." Qian Wuliang said in a low voice,"we can't just wait for death. We can't wait here for the Marquis and become his burden!""Also, I have an idea with principal Hong. I wonder if principal Hong is willing to agree to it.""Speak!"Hearing Hong Yitang's words, Qian Wuliang said seriously,"You and I are both still a bit away from the venerable sovereign level. Venerable sovereign is a transformation, and you and I both lack the opportunity to transform!" "Governor Lin is not in a hurry ... As long as the time is right, the Dao of life and death will definitely become a venerable sovereign!"Hong Yitang nodded slightly.He had some thoughts in his heart.Qian Wuliang, on the other hand, said,"so, my idea is that you and I should work together to help one person become a venerable sovereign!""What?"Hong Yitang was stunned. I thought you were going to talk about yourself.'But this means ... It's not you?Could it be Yuan Shuo?However ... Yuan Shuo was only at the fourth level of Dao integration, which was far from being a venerable sovereign."It's not professor Yuan or anyone else ... It's the celestial pole Emperor!"Qian Wuliang answered without hesitation.He looked at the celestial pole clone and said,'senior, you're now a half-Emperor clone, and you're actually not that far away from the venerable sovereign level! Senior is a neo martial artist who walks the great Dao of origins. In fact, his Dao attainment is still there. What he lacks is the power of the great Dao! If the virtual and real universes combine their full power to help senior advance first, senior is a venerable sovereign to begin with ... It will be easy for you to give birth to a venerable sovereign-level avatar!"Heaven's Fate, on the other hand, was on guard and a little reluctant.""No!"I'm not doing it!Becoming a venerable sovereign's clone was both a good thing and a bad thing.The bad thing is that if there's any trouble in the future, I'll have to go first.Not only that ... It was very troublesome.I don't want this opportunity!You two go play by yourselves!"Between the two of you, whoever gives up their own power first will help one person become a saint Emperor!" He immediately said.Qian Wuliang shook his head."That won't do. Without the Marquis's permission, neither Dean Hong Nor I can give up control of a universe. Otherwise, the combination of reality and illusion ... Might cause some problems."To put it simply, be it him or Hong Yitang ... They were only replacing the leader.

Chapter 2643 Exiting Seclusion (3)
Once they combined reality and illusion to help one person advance to venerable sovereign, wouldn't they really seize the great Dao universe?Would Li Hao still care?Wouldn't that be asking for trouble?It would be better to help a third person. It would not affect anything. It would only provide a large amount of power of the great Dao, but not control over the great Dao universe.As for Zhang an ... He was actually not bad. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  However, Zhang an's advancement to venerable sovereign might cause some trouble.Zhang an's comprehension of the integration of the Old and New DAOs was not that deep.The celestial pole was bound to become a venerable sovereign!However, at this time, celestial pole didn't want to do it and was a little unhappy.""I'm just a clone, not my true body! Once the avatar enters the venerable sovereign level, the main body will also be a venerable sovereign. Won't You Be unable to distinguish between the primary and secondary?""Senior celestial pole," Zhang an reminded him softly,"so many years have passed. You should at least have the strength of a 3rd rank now, right?"As for not being able to distinguish between primary and secondary?If you don't want to get into trouble, just say it.Zhang an said again,"senior, whether we accept the trouble or not, there will be trouble. You know a little about the current situation of neo martial arts. I think ... Neo martial arts will not give up on us. They will come to us sooner or later." We'll be in great danger during this period. Now that Li Hao is out looking for opportunities, we can't count on Heibao for everything, right? The Black Panther is still the will of heaven, not a real venerable sovereign ... Once the Black Panther is defeated, the whole world will fall apart ..."I'll take it.Why are you still hiding at this time?Heaven's Fate was somewhat helpless.It was easy to say.This matter was not easy to handle."Moreover, I feel that ... My true body might really be coming. I didn't sense it before, but now I realize that my true body doesn't seem to be too far away.This was also what he found troublesome.His main body ... That was him. He would never come here for no reason. Now that he was here, it meant that he was forced.Who could force themselves?The Autarch and the others, of course."If my main body comes ... It might bring some huge trouble. If I become a venerable sovereign, won't my main body be able to easily sense my detailed location? now, he doesn't even want to contact his main body.If his true body came, there would definitely be trouble.This was the first reason. Secondly ... If he became a venerable sovereign, it meant that he would have to deal with any danger that Black Panther could not deal with. So, he would be the only one to fight against those venerable sovereigns?It was really like seeing a ghost!At this time, everyone looked at him, and the king of Dali was somewhat expectant.""If senior isn't willing ... I'm actually willing!"Heaven's Fate was speechless.Qian Wuliang also coughed and said,"it's very difficult." His Majesty, although he's about to step into the half-step sovereign realm, he's still a long way from becoming a venerable sovereign ..." If you could become a venerable sovereign so easily, you wouldn't have a chance.If it was that simple, Hong Yitang and I would have become venerable sovereigns ourselves. Why would we need to find the celestial pole?He just felt that he needed time.Lin Hongyu thought for a while and said,""Senior Empyrean pole! In this case, it won't hurt the essence of the two Dao Masters, but it will consume some power of the great Dao to maximize the benefits and not delay the time of the two Dao Masters to become venerable sovereigns. "Lin Hongyu continued,"for now, other than Li Hao, Black Panther, and the three of us, the rest of us will have trouble becoming venerable sovereigns. Senior Empyrean pole will become a venerable sovereign. Once the three of us become venerable sovereigns, including Li Hao and black Panther, we'll have a total of six venerable sovereigns. We'll barely be able to establish ourselves in the chaos!"Everyone looked at the celestial pole again.,m Qian Wuliang continued."Senior celestial pole, neo martial arts will not give up on us. There is a high chance that they will send you to find us. In this case, your real body is also in danger. If your doppelgangers become stronger, they might be able to come back and help you."As soon as these words came out, celestial pole's heart moved.This was true!If the clone became stronger, there would still be a chance to return and help the main body.But ..."Senior, in addition, once you're found by new martial, you losing senior second cat will also be a problem ...""I didn't lose second cat!"Heaven's Fate couldn't take it anymore!Who said it was lost?Wasn't she with Li Hao?"The Marquis is out now, and we don't know when he'll return. Once he encounters danger ... Senior Buttface will be in danger as well. Only when senior becomes a venerable sovereign will he be qualified to wander the chaos and solve some problems."Heaven's Fate was helpless."In this day and age, are there still people who force people to become venerable sovereigns?"It was like seeing a ghost!"Then it's a deal!" Qian Wuliang laughed.Obviously, the celestial pole had no choice but to accept it.Qian Wuliang then continued,"In addition to senior Empyrean pole, I have an immature idea ..."Everyone looked at him again."The Marquis doesn't care, but I think we should at least care about it a little." Qian Wuliang said after a moment of silence.He looked at the crowd."I have an idea. We can recruit some cultivators in the world ... Cut off or seal the other Dao meridians, leaving only one Dao Meridian. Like some gods in the past, we can cultivate one Meridian alone ... And strengthen one Meridian. This way, our cultivation will be purer. Finally, we can push out a master of the Dao Meridian. Even if he can't become a venerable sovereign today, there is still hope for a Heavenly King or half-step sovereign!"As soon as he said that, everyone frowned. Even the Black Panther's incarnation barked.This won't do!All the cultivators in the world had different branches, so Qian Wuliang's suggestion was actually very dangerous.To cut off the opportunity for some people to cultivate other Dao meridians, to cut off the future progress of some people's great Dao, and to simply cultivate the power of one Meridian to help a Dao Lord ... No matter how powerful such a cultivator became ... There was almost no chance for them to have a future.

2644 Chapter 439
Qian Wuliang sighed and said,"guys, I know it's very risky, and ... The Marquis may not be willing to do it." However, is it true that every living being in the world can enter the venerable sovereign level?""It's not that I, Qian Wuliang, am looking down on the people of the world, but in the entire Silvermoon world, there are only ... A hundred people who can become venerable sovereigns? A thousand people? Ten thousand people?""Where are the rest of the people?""They've all gone to cultivate the myriad DAOs ... If they're distracted, their progress will slow down sooner or later. They might even be unable to improve ...""Right now, we're not forcing them. Let's make it clear. We're recruiting volunteers who are willing to participate in this!""If that's the case, we might be able to give birth to some Dao Meridian owners very soon ... And become half-step sovereigns ... Once the opportunity comes, there's hope of becoming venerable sovereigns!"The idea was not a bad one.However, this would sacrifice the future of some people.Qian Wuliang was right. How could these 10 billion people become venerable sovereigns?It was obviously impossible!But ... Doing so might bring about a lot of trouble.That was Li Hao!"I'll bear the responsibility if the Marquis blames me!"Qian Wuliang said again.In fact, he didn't think Li Hao would blame him. Li Hao's personality was more ... Carefree.If the other party had agreed and he had not forced them, Li Hao might not have bothered.And this way, there would be a huge benefit.Not only the Masters of the Dao meridians, but also him and the Masters of the great Dao of Hong Yitang would benefit. Some people's cultivation path was pure, so they improved faster. They only cultivated one path and did not consider too many things.Everyone pondered for a long time before Lin Hongyu nodded.""Then ... Let's do this!"With Lin Hongyu's support, Qian Wuliang let out a sigh of relief.This was good!Even if there was a problem, there would be someone to take the blame.He then looked at the others, and Yuan Shuo also nodded slightly,""I can do it!"Hong Yitang also nodded,"since you've said so ... Then it's decided!" As you said, not everyone has the hope of becoming a venerable sovereign. Even for us, it's difficult! "Since that's the case, it depends on everyone's willingness ... If they're willing to give up on other paths and focus solely on cultivation, we can give them resources, including the education of their descendants and social status ... We can give them all of these."Now, everyone knew that everyone had an inborn Dao body and there were many DAOs in their bodies.It didn't sound worth it to give up on other great DAOs and cultivate one.Since that was the case ... He would give them some compensation.At this moment, Zhang an and Heaven's Fate looked at each other and did not say anything.However, he felt a little emotional ... These Silver Moon Warriors didn't just sit around and wait for death. If Qian Wuliang's idea worked, there would be many more reserve venerable sovereigns in the future.This was much better than the current situation.Of course, it would also sacrifice the future of many people. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Then it's decided!""Let's help senior Tian Ji become a venerable sovereign first!"Qian Wuliang smiled.Heaven's Fate had a sorrowful look on his face. He was really helpless about this.My true body became a venerable sovereign because I wanted to live a few more years. Now, his clone was about to become a venerable sovereign.How could it be so easy to become a venerable sovereign?Couldn't it be a little more difficult?How troublesome!Even though it seemed shameless to ridicule him like this, it was the truth. He was a clone of a venerable sovereign. As long as he had enough power of the great Dao, a clone forged in 100000 years would not be any shorter than a clone forged by the main body.After such a long time, it would not be difficult for his avatar to become a venerable sovereign. There would not be any difficulties, nor would there be any shackles in the realm.……As a result, in the third month after Li Hao left, the first to become a venerable sovereign in the Silvermoon world were not the two masters of great DAOs, but celestial pole's clone.……At the same time.The two people from Heaven's Fate, who were still drifting in the chaos, suddenly opened their eyes and looked towards the North. After a long while, they cursed and mumbled."What's the matter?"King Huai was puzzled.p "F * ck, my clone has become an Emperor!"“……”King Huai was also stunned and speechless.F * ck!This works too?Your clone has already become a divine Emperor?How did he do it?"What ... Do you mean?" he asked, surprised."I don't know."Heaven's Fate was depressed,'Silvermoon is only in a small world, how did he become an Emperor? My clone needs a lot of energy and the power of great DAOs to become a great emperor, and now my clone can't connect to the universe of origin ... Logically speaking, it's almost impossible to become a great emperor. "The reason why he was depressed was because becoming a saint Emperor represented many things.For example, his clone was going to start blocking in front of him.For example, if the clone was in danger, it had to become a divine Emperor.For example, now that everyone was searching for Silver Moon, his clone had no choice but to step forward when he was about to be finished ...It was not a good thing anyway!Also, did the new king of Silvermoon want him to rush over and save her?In any case, the more he thought about it, the more pessimistic he became!He looked at King Huai. King Huai was also somewhat solemn."He actually allowed senior's clone to become a saint Emperor. Logically speaking, Silvermoon's energy is very weak. At this moment, it's already extremely difficult to provide for one person to become a saint Emperor, but to be able to provide for senior's clone to become a saint Emperor ..."Was this a desperate bet? even the celestial pole avatar knew that only he could withstand it?Heaven's Fate didn't know either, so he could only say,""There's one more thing ... My clone has become an Emperor, so my distance from the Silver Moon is even clearer! Furthermore, as my clone becomes a Saint Emperor, the connection between us will become stronger ... I think we'll be able to catch up to Silver Moon in less time. "

King Huai was also depressed.So, our danger will come early?Should I change direction?But ... What if a Supreme martial artist was monitoring us? if we turn around now, the Supreme martial artist would kill us, right?The two venerable sovereigns looked at each other, both feeling a little pessimistic.He did not feel overjoyed that his clone had become a venerable sovereign.If it was someone else, they would have been overjoyed.How good would it be if his clone could become a great emperor?With the two bodies as one, even if he couldn't become a fourth level venerable sovereign, he would be able to go further on the path of third level.However, Heaven's Fate didn't seem happy at all.There was only helplessness!'I didn't even want to become an Emperor in the neo martial era. Now, in this Silver Moon era, even my avatar can become an Emperor ... Why should I?'What made the celestial pole feel even more helpless was that, perhaps to avoid danger, the Silvermoon world seemed to have locked onto his position and was now heading in his direction. In other words, the Silvermoon world was retreating from the tianfang world and heading back to the Crimson Moon region!This was also the decision made by the powerhouses.As more and more experts had appeared recently, everyone decided to take the risk and return just in case. They didn't want to get too close to the Outlander world, as more and more experts had appeared in the vicinity.……Li Hao was still unaware of all these changes.At this moment, Li Hao was still in seclusion, perfecting his own cultivation system and forging some bridges between life and death.By the time the energy used to kill the venerable sovereigns was almost exhausted, Li Hao had refined and wasted a lot of it. He had forged 220 bridges of life and death, which did not reach level three directly as he had expected.However, it was still not bad. From the original 50 bridges to the current 220 bridges, there were an additional 170 bridges of life and death.Among them, he had even recovered once.If it had not been for the revival this time, perhaps ... There was really hope this time and he would have directly broken through to Tier 3. After all, reviving once had consumed a large amount of energy.According to Li Hao's estimation, he would need more than 240 bridges to become a third stage venerable sovereign.In fact, the difference was not big.The great Dao crystal of a level one venerable sovereign was a little messy, but killing a level two ... Was a hundred percent possible.But now, Li Hao was almost at the peak of stage two.Another life and death venerable Emperor ... He really wasn't afraid of those rank three venerable sovereigns.……While Li Hao was in seclusion, half a year had passed in the tianfang world.During this time, the tianfang world had become quiet again after the death of five venerable sovereigns.However, although no venerable sovereigns had died, the situation had changed. A large number of venerable sovereigns began to pour into the tianfang world.Among them, more and more venerable sovereigns joined the Hui long temple, including some middle-stage venerable sovereigns. Three months ago, the fifth-stage venerable sovereign from The Dark World had chosen to join, which greatly increased the strength of the Hui long temple.He was not the only one to have a rank five venerable sovereign join them. There were six surviving venerable sovereigns in the entire dark world. Apart from this rank five venerable sovereign, three of the remaining five were rank three venerable sovereigns, and two were rank two venerable sovereigns.There wasn't even a single rank 1 expert.All of a sudden, there were six more venerable sovereigns. In addition to the two fourth stage venerable sovereigns who had decided to join the Huilong temple, there were a total of seven middle stage venerable sovereigns in the temple!Such a force was almost impossible for many medium-level worlds to achieve.Only a few top-notch mid-tier worlds could possibly reach this level.With the addition of these people, Hui long temple had two fifth level venerable sovereigns, and Kong Ji's status had also declined.And on this day, suddenly, in the main hall where the emptiness was.In an instant, an aura shook the world.It disappeared without a trace in an instant, but soon, it attracted the attention of several venerable sovereigns. The venerable sovereign Hui long appeared quickly, his expression changing.He advanced? It was actually very difficult for a medium venerable sovereign to advance. It was normal for there to be no change in tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years.He actually didn't know much about the void.However, it had been exactly 100 years since he had joined the Hui long temple after coming from tianfang world.A hundred years was relatively short.But it wasn't too short!When the other party came, he was already at the 4th rank. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  He wasn't sure how long this person had advanced to the fourth tier before he came, or had he been stuck at the fourth tier for a long time, so he advanced to the fifth tier today.There were countless thoughts in his mind, but this was not the time to talk about this. The venerable Dragon Emperor laughed and said,""Congratulations, fellow Daoist Voidwalker! When I return to the Dragon Temple, the third rank five venerable sovereign has been born!"The one who had just taken over The Dark World had now advanced. It was indeed worthy of celebration.Although the difference between Tier 5 and Tier 4 wasn't too great, it was still Tier 5 no matter what!In the hall, an empty voice slowly sounded,""It's just a coincidence!"He didn't seem to be too excited.Fifth rank?He had only barely recovered his strength from before. In fact, he had been a rank five peak venerable sovereign 500 years ago. If he had continued at that speed, he would have been a rank six venerable sovereign by now.In the truest sense, he was at the peak level below some major cosmos absolute beings.It should be the same as the Dragon Emperor.And he had been cultivating for exactly 1000 years.1,000 years ... In the first 500 years, he cultivated to the peak of the fifth level. In the next 500 years, he cultivated to the fifth level again. It seemed to be getting slower and slower, because he started from the third level.

2646 Chapter 439
However ... In front of him, he had followed the Dao of the great Dao universe. There was a true master of a major world in his family.However ... Five hundred years ago, he gave up on the plan that his elders had given him.From level five to level six, then he would see if he could take over the great Dao universe or the world to become the master of the world or the great Dao. He would follow the steps step by step, because this way, his chances would be greater.But ... He didn't like this path.500 years ago, he gave up everything and chose to leave the Dao universe. He started cultivating from the chaos mixed Dao.After 500 years, he recovered to the fifth step.However, he was completely different from his past self.Today, he was a venerable sovereign of the Dao of Nirvana, not the venerable sovereign who had walked the divine path of light in the past. Although the future of that path was great and seemed bright, it was ... So ordinary!I don't want to!Five hundred years!He couldn't help but smile when he thought of Li Hao. That person seemed to have only spent a few years to go from nothing to the 2nd rank. Compared to him, I seem to be much slower.But ... It was nothing. A moment of speed was nothing.He was already a thousand years old.The neo martial human King seemed to be only a thousand years old. The gap between the two sides was still very big. These people were the targets that he wanted to catch up with.He had reached the fifth step, and the sixth step was not far away.It was just that ... Level Seven was still too difficult.The seventh level of the mixed Dao ... Was even harder than ascending to the heavens.It was not a good thing to be in seclusion all the time. Perhaps it was time for him to walk around.He just didn't know ... If he should leave tianfang or something else?He was not too interested in the venerable Emperor Hui long who was outside. He had reached rank six many years ago, but he rarely saw him cultivate. He was either on the road to winning over people or at Dao discussion meetings to win over people.The so-called Dao discussion was all bullsh * t. It was just an analysis of the situation.It was meaningless!Thousands of thoughts ran through Kong Ji's mind. At this moment, he felt a little restless. He had returned to his peak level after entering the fifth step. He felt a little more at ease. All of this proved that he was on the right path.I made the right choice!It was only a delay of five hundred years, which was nothing.It was not a good thing for cultivators to cultivate in seclusion. It might not be a bad idea to go out and increase their knowledge.Li Hao, isn't he going to participate in the hunt in a few months?Perhaps ... I should go and take a look?Of course, he wasn't going to join Li Hao's team. He was going to join forces like the Dragon return temple to hunt down some top existences, such as venerable the sword!Yes, the neo martial Swordmaster. Ever since the incident at the Tianhe zone, all the forces in the tianfang world had come to an agreement. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Kill the Supreme Sword!It was said that he had already entered the sixth step, and the organizer of this event was none other than the return Dragon Emperor!The four major powers would all participate.There were a total of four sixth stage venerable sovereigns, close to ten fifth stage venerable sovereigns, and dozens of fourth stage venerable sovereigns!With so many powerhouses, they even dared to fight a Grade 7.Kong Ji laughed. Maybe ... It would be very interesting.The revered sword of new martial arts might be related to Li Hao.The Silver Moon was the place where the sword Master guarded in the past.And Li Hao had the same surname as him."It's time to move!" With this thought in mind, a sense of emptiness emerged in the hall. Soon, he looked at the venerable Emperor of returning Dragon, who was outside."Senior long, I would like to participate in the upcoming sword hunt!"Hui long Emperor was stunned, but he quickly smiled and said,""Alright!"This was a good thing!Previously, this fellow was not willing to participate and had been in seclusion. He thought that it would be fine even if there was one less Tier 4.But now, the other party had stepped into the fifth stage ... Now, one more fifth stage meant one more guarantee.In fact, everyone was still very afraid of the sword venerable.Even though it was said that he had only reached level six a few years ago ... Sword cultivators were terrifying to begin with.Moreover, he was a sword cultivator from neo martial arts!"Kong Ji, with you joining us, we'll have a greater chance of success!""If we can kill that guy this time, the benefits we will get will be unimaginable!" Now, many forces have offered a sky-high price for that person, second only to the few advanced venerable sovereigns!"The sword venerable's current offer was even higher than that of a new Supreme martial artist.This was because this fellow had a battle record. He had been out all this time. Not only had he killed a fourth level peak venerable sovereign, it was said that he had a conflict with Hong Yue a few days ago and killed a fifth level venerable sovereign.Such an expert could easily kill a middle-stage venerable sovereign, which was extremely terrifying."Yes." Kong Ji nodded slightly."You can ask me to join you when the operation begins.""Alright!"Dragon Emperor nodded and continued,""By the way, your friend is venerable sovereign Hao Yue ... He's been in the Huilong temple for almost a year, but he hasn't been here yet. If you have time, you can come and visit him. I'll personally welcome you!"After all, he was Kong Ji's friend and the only one who had taken the initiative to ask him to join the Huilong temple in the past hundred years. Now that Kong Ji had entered the fifth step, he had to pay more attention to him."Alright, but I don't know if he's willing," Kong Ji laughed.What a joke! I'm a sixth level venerable sovereign. I'm already giving him face by taking the initiative to meet him. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't even bother to meet him. Now, there are many low level venerable sovereigns under his command!Of course, he only took it as empty words.He smiled and didn't say much.Kong Ji didn't say anything else and sent a message to the giant pincer. He and Li Hao didn't actually have a direct way of communicating, and neither of them had mentioned it. It seemed like every time they communicated, it was fate.If he could send a message, then he would.Forget it if the message didn't reach him.A gentleman's friendship was as light as water, and there was no need to be too close.……Li Hao, who had just come out of seclusion, soon received the news.Go back to the Dragon Emperor to see me?Back to the Dragon Temple, they were organizing an event to hunt down venerable the sword ...This is getting interesting!Li Hao, who originally didn't plan to go, suddenly laughed. Hunting a sword venerable ... I can go and take a look and pay attention to this.Is the sword Saint my ancestor?Forget it, who cares!It didn't matter whether he was the venerable sword or not. They could talk more if they met. Li Hao was really interested in the venerable sword.The great path universe might have a lot to do with the sword venerable.The entire Silver Moon was greatly affected by the sword Saint!Also, whether the sword Saint had intentionally sent Silver Moon flying back then or not ... Perhaps, he could ask.[PS: I'm going to another province tomorrow. It's very far. I'll go to my mother-in-law's place. I've said it before. I'll strive to update tomorrow night and strive to not update. I won't say it again during the day!]

Chapter 2647 Two Fanatics (1)
The Skylands world.In the small dragon region of the southern region.The Hui long field was almost the Overlord of the South. Even if it hadn't been before, it was now.The Dark World's rank 5 venerable sovereign had joined the Hui long temple. Kong Ji from the Hui long temple had advanced to rank 5 venerable sovereign. Now, there were two more rank 5 venerable sovereigns. In addition to the original one, there were three rank 5 venerable sovereigns!Such strength was definitely extraordinary!On this day, they returned to Dragon City.The giant pincers, a native expert, was very respectful as they led a person into the dragon City.The guards outside the city were not weak either.Seeing the giant pincers, he recognized them.He also knew that this person seemed to be following a venerable sovereign and had not returned. When he saw the giant pincers, the guard was a little surprised. Soon, he realized that the venerable sovereign who had never been seen had returned.It was said that he was called venerable sovereign Hao Yue.First stage venerable sovereign!If it was before, everyone would have taken it seriously. But now, there were six venerable sovereigns from The Dark World, and none of them were level one venerable sovereigns.The two lords of the small regions in the southern region had also come with several venerable sovereigns. Two of them were middle-stage venerable sovereigns, and several first and second-stage venerable sovereigns.Recently, more than 10 venerable sovereigns had joined the Hui long temple.His power was expanding crazily!Under such circumstances, even the guards were less in awe of Li Hao, a first level venerable sovereign they had never met, and more disdainful."The giant pincer is back!"Another expert who was also at the Heavenly King level, possibly even a commander-level figure among the guards, greeted the giant pincer.Soon, he looked at Li Hao."Welcome back, venerable sovereign!" He smiled.Even if he didn't care, he was still a venerable sovereign.It was said that he had some relationship with the fifth rank venerable sovereign void solitude. Therefore, the guard did not dare to be rude and was more polite. However, he was not as humble as he had imagined.Li Hao actually didn't care.He didn't care and didn't take it seriously.It didn't matter whether he cared or not ... It didn't matter.He did not care, but the giant pincer's expression was a little ugly.It shouldn't be like this!According to common practice, Li Hao, a venerable sovereign recruited by the Huilong temple, shouldn't be so calm on his first visit to the territory of the Huilong temple, even if he didn't clean the streets.At the very least, there would be a venerable sovereign to welcome them.There were more than 30 venerable sovereigns in the Hui long temple.There were so many venerable sovereigns ... What was the harm in welcoming a venerable sovereign?The giant pincer did not quite understand why this was the case.At this moment, there was an indescribable anger!Why was he so slow?He was very angry. He looked at the guard with an unfriendly gaze. As for the guard, he looked somewhat innocent. Why was he looking at him?I didn't order him to do it.In fact, no one had instructed him to do so. Seeing that the giant Pincher was staring at him, he was afraid that the venerable sovereign would misunderstand. After all, it was a venerable sovereign. He had to explain,""Brother giant pincer, don't look at me. I didn't mean to neglect you, it's ... Unfortunate! Today is the day that the venerable sovereign of The Dark World officially joined the Huilong temple with the other five venerable sovereigns. Everyone is now at the Huilong temple to welcome the experts!"It really wasn't a coincidence!It wasn't intentional.The giant pincer still felt uneasy. Even so, it would still take some time to get a venerable sovereign, right?He looked at Li Hao, as if he would kill this commander of the guards who didn't give him any face as long as Li Hao gave the order.Li Hao actually heard the voice transmission. He smiled and walked into the city without saying anything.Seeing this, the giant pincers snorted and glanced at the commander of the guards, then quickly followed Li Hao into the city.After they left, the leader of the guards was a little speechless. This guy ... Was trembling.In the past, he would have been respected if he followed a venerable sovereign.But now, there were too many venerable sovereigns.They didn't even have enough manpower.He, the commander of the guards, had been assigned to guard the gate for a venerable sovereign, so he could be considered a close friend of a venerable sovereign ... Moreover, he was a third-rank venerable sovereign, so he was not afraid of the giant pincers.The master you're following is only at the first rank.He had been envious of the giant pincer when it had followed that person.But now ... He felt nothing.Now that there were so many venerable sovereigns, it was no longer an honor to follow a venerable sovereign. It was an honor to follow a fifth-rank or a middle-rank venerable sovereign. It would be embarrassing for a Heavenly King to follow a third-rank venerable sovereign.It would be bad luck to follow a 2nd rank.Following the 1st tier ... He was extremely unlucky! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Did he think that this giant pincer was the same as before?The leader of the guards curled his lips.……In the city.The giant pincer still felt a little indignant for Li Hao."My Lord, they ...""Be quiet."The giant pincer instantly shut up and didn't dare to say another word.Li Hao smiled and said as he walked,"actually, this is pretty good. You're just a passerby ..."A passerby?No, perhaps, they might even fall out.The other party wanted to kill the revered sword artist!At this moment, there was no need to say anything. These people wanted to kill venerable the sword, so they were his enemies. Furthermore, they had joined forces with The Dark World, so they were even more enemies.The destruction of The Dark World was still related to him. The human King had destroyed the other party for him ... At least, that was what the human King said.Therefore, he and the Huilong temple would definitely fall out. It was only a matter of time!One level six and three level five ... It was really not an ordinary force. Even if it was a neo martial artist, there were not many middle-stage venerable sovereigns, right?They didn't know why, but they were all staring at neo martial.And not the Crimson Moon!Didn't they say that the red moon was the one who everyone wanted to beat?

Chapter 2648 The Two Fanatics (2)
The new martial King ... Was really a troublemaker!Li Hao cursed in his heart. Look, look. Even across the chaotic region, the people from the tianfang region still want to kill you. Your reputation is really bad.Look, no one said they would kill me ... Other than those who wanted to kill me because of neo martial arts, no one said they would kill Li Hao ...Of course, it was also related to his own lack of fame.Of course, there was also a point. Those who wanted to kill me ... Were all killed by me in advance.Li Hao grinned hideously. The giant pincer seemed to realize something as well. He knew Li Hao's identity as the new king of the Silver Moon!As for The Dark World, it was the enemy of neo martial.The new martial ... Was one with Silver Moon.Didn't this mean that all the venerable sovereigns who came today were the enemies of this Lord?His expression changed slightly, but he didn't say anything more. He was a little conflicted in his heart, but it soon disappeared. The Dragon Temple ... Although it was the power he had joined, it was only so.The person in front of him might be the greatest opportunity and guide on his path to becoming a venerable sovereign.Even if Li Hao didn't think so, the giant pincer still believed that Li Hao was half its master.One was the power he was loyal to, and the other was half a master. It was natural to know which one to choose.He didn't say anything. At this moment, he didn't need to say anything. He was too weak.He didn't have the right to say anything.In front of them was a Palace that looked like a Taoist temple. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The individual palaces formed the entire group of palaces.This place was the Dragon return temple.At this moment, the auras here were unparalleled and shocking.Not only that, there was also a special fluctuation in this place. Li Hao carefully sensed it. It seemed to be ... Dark power?Li Hao's heart moved.At this moment, he looked at the giant pincer. Seeing Li Hao's look, the giant pincer seemed to understand something and hurriedly sent a voice transmission."Your Excellency, there's a place with Taoist connotation in Huilong temple, called Dark Demon Ridge! It's said that it was the cultivation ground of a darkness-type Supreme expert in the tianfang world. ""Tianfang world is said to have the names of the light and dark messengers, the divine beasts of the four directions, the divine messengers of the five elements ... And many other powerful beings. This was the cultivation place of the dark Messenger in the past.""The Dragon field is the core of the southern region, and it has the best Taoist connotation ... I told you before that if you are a medium-level venerable sovereign, you can try to comprehend it once without joining ... If you are a low-level venerable sovereign, you can use it once every 100 years for free ... But you have to complete a mission before you can use it. You have never completed a mission, so you can't use it for free."Li Hao came to a realization. Dark Demon Ridge!No wonder Kong Ji stayed here.Because this place ... Had a feeling of ultimate darkness, and it seemed reasonable for The Dark World to join them. It would be of great help for them to gain some enlightenment here. No wonder he would choose to join the Dragon Temple!There were four peak rank six venerable sovereigns in the entire tianfang world. It seemed that the reason why The Dark World did not join the other three sides was related to this place.After returning to the Dragon field, Li Hao first went to the Coiling Dragon Well ... Which might be one of the Four Divine Beasts, a Dragon's physical body expert.The other one was an expert from the fire element mountain. He was a seventh step fire element expert, and was probably one of the five elements oracles. As for the woman in the Tianhe zone, she was only at the sixth rank. Could she travel by water?That shouldn't be the case. He was only at the sixth step, and the gap between him and the seventh step was still quite big.It was said that there were many high-level venerable sovereigns in the tianfang world, and there might be seventh-level venerable sovereigns of water.At this moment, Li Hao thought of many things.The Dragon Temple was also exceptionally quiet today.Everyone was gathered in the Dragon returning Hall.Even though Li Hao and the giant pincer had entered the temple together, some people who stayed outside didn't pay much attention to them. They all listened attentively, as if they were hoping to hear something, a top-notch venerable sovereign's Dao discussion.……At the same time.In the depths of the Huilong Daoist temple.In a large hall, laughter and cheers could be heard.Venerable sovereign Hui long was all smiles."Fellow Daoist mi Han's participation in the Hui long temple has brought the entire temple back to life. We are all very happy. Not long ago, Kong Ji, who had been stuck at level four, successfully advanced to level five. Fellow Daoist mi han is indeed a venerable sovereign of a great world ... The luck you brought is unparalleled!"It was mi han, the rank five venerable sovereign from The Dark World.At this moment, his expression was calm,"brother long, you flatter me!" He's just a person in trouble. ""It's only temporary!""That's right!" Venerable Emperor Hui long smiled brightly."That yin-yang world will be punished sooner or later!" I think the dark great world will recover its great world body sooner or later! By then, you'll be the master of a major world. When that day comes, you'll have to give us some guidance ..."Mi han finally revealed a smile,""I'm flattered. But if that day really comes ... I won't forget the warm reception of the Huilong temple!"This time, the destruction of The Dark World was really unexpected.In the vast macro world, only a few venerable sovereigns managed to escape because they were not in the macro world.Among them, he was the representative and the most top-notch.Rank five venerable sovereign!In the dark World, the rank seven world Lord, two rank six venerable sovereigns, and several rank five venerable sovereigns were all killed by the human King. None of them survived. The other venerable sovereigns died on the spot without exception!

Chapter 2649 The Two Fanatics (3)
It was sad that there were only a few of them in such a huge world.In the past, he didn't even pay attention to such a low-level rank-6 venerable Dragon Emperor, but now ... He could only rely on others.He had a smile on his face, but he didn't think much of it.He didn't take the Hui long Emperor's flattering words seriously.As for the so-called advancement of Kong Ji, he didn't even put him in his eyes.He was a rank five venerable sovereign in the great world. Kong Ji was just lucky to advance to rank five. There was still a huge gap between the two.Moreover, the other venerable sovereigns seemed to have come this time ... The advanced rank five venerable sovereign, Kong Ji, was not present. Of course, according to Hui long, that person had just advanced and was in seclusion.He pinched his nose and admitted it.What did he mean by not coming out of seclusion?I clearly sensed that that guy had come out once before. It was clear that I had stolen the limelight from him, and that guy was just not satisfied.If possible ... Who would want to steal the limelight from you, a low-level venerable sovereign?I was a venerable sovereign of a great world in the past!As he was thinking, he suddenly sensed a venerable sovereign entering the Taoist temple. He didn't pay much attention to it, thinking that it might be the venerable sovereign who had returned to the Dragon Temple.In fact, the Dragon Emperor also knew who it was.He was the one who had invited her, so he wanted to meet her ... But venerable sovereign Hao Yue had come at a bad time. Today, The Dark World had officially joined the Huilong temple, so he had no time to entertain a first stage venerable sovereign. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The two of them were thinking about it and didn't pay much attention to this.The next moment, their expressions changed.Even the venerable Dragon Emperor, who was quite thick-skinned, couldn't keep his face at this moment.What was this emptiness?Previously, she had asked him to come along, but he refused and said that he wanted to go into seclusion.In the end, while he was entertaining others, this Kong Ji suddenly appeared, and actually went to pick up that Hao Yue, wasn't this ...... Throwing his face at others?Huilong was speechless and cursed in his heart!You've advanced to the fifth step, and this Lord has not treated you unfairly. I've also treated you with courtesy, but you're a bit too much. You're obviously trying to slap my face!However, the other party was a fifth stage venerable sovereign.At this moment, the Dragon Emperor seemed to have just realized this. He suddenly said,""Eh? fellow Daoist kongjiao has come out of seclusion? What a coincidence, isn't Haoyue back? Daoist Min Han is here, and he just so happens to have advanced to the fifth step as well. Let's discuss the Dao together ..."He looked at mi han and smiled,"what a coincidence. The sound of the great Dao is not bad. Perhaps you and my friend, mi han, have something in common ..."Chu Han smiled but did not say anything.Was it?Such a coincidence? Of course, he didn't care too much about it. He just felt that this Kong Ji was really childish. It was fine if he didn't give him face, but he also trampled on the face of the venerable Dragon sovereign!These inferior venerable sovereigns just didn't have a structure.He could only use it now. Otherwise ... It would be strange if he wasn't unlucky in such a way.……"Fellow Daoist Hao Yue!"At this moment, in front of a large hall, a smile appeared.""I knew you would come!"Li Hao was also full of smiles."After all, I've joined Hui long temple. I had to come and take a look. As for fellow Daoist kongji, why didn't you go and chat with him?""Boring!"Kong Ji was a little lazy and uninterested.""Huilong likes to talk about empty and meaningless things, such as what will happen in the future, what will happen in the future, what will happen after killing someone ... There has never been anything meaningful. I was interested in it in the past and wanted to listen a few times. Perhaps I could comprehend some sixth level venerable sovereign's Dao ... Later, I realized that it was meaningless and a waste of time!"Li Hao chuckled."You want to go and listen?" Kong Ji asked."I'm a little interested!"Li Hao nodded."It's mainly to get to know people. For example, the venerable sovereigns in the dark World and the venerable sovereign Hui long, whom I've never met. I'd like to see how many experts dare to hunt swords and how bold they are!"Kong Ji seemed to smile.That's right.This was interesting.I knew you'd be interested.He seemed to have thought of something and reminded her,""Don't cause any trouble ... It's not easy to borrow the power of this place. Be careful, you'll die from it! That's number one. Number two ... There's been a lot more powerful people in the Empyrean world recently. There are quite a few Level 6s, and ... There might even be Level 7s hiding in there. "He reminded Li Hao,"I know you have the ability to borrow strength."However, the last time he borrowed the power of a sixth stage venerable sovereign, he almost died. This time, he could not simply borrow it."That's right," he added."The dark emissary's strength back then ... Might have reached the eighth rank ... I'm not sure about the details, but it's said that the light and dark emissaries might have reached that level. The power of light and darkness is also a corresponding power!"He sighed,"the power of light, the power of darkness ... In fact, many worlds have them. They are also very common, but they are also very powerful!" Those who cultivate light and darkness aren't bad at all!"You almost died when you borrowed the power of the sixth step.The power of the eighth step ... You dare to borrow it?Li Hao instantly became serious. He couldn't act rashly. At his current stage, he couldn't even use the power of the seventh step, let alone the eighth step. Going back to the past was going back to the past, but he was just listening, not fighting.But borrowing power ... Be careful not to exhaust yourself to death in an instant."I understand. Don't worry, Daoist forsaken desolation!"Li Hao nodded slightly. Of course I won't do anything rash.I'm not a murderer, nor am I the king of neo martial artists. I won't kill anyone unless I'm forced to.
