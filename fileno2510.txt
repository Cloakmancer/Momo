Where did Li Hao go?The winding River of Heaven and earth.In the long river of time, the water was clear and the sword intent was abundant.Going against the flow was the past, and going along with it was the future.The current Li Hao couldn't truly reverse the past and the future. The past was just a place where memories were immersed, and the future was just one of the thousands of possibilities.In fact, he could not control time and go against the heavens.The current Li Hao had only made a rough cut.At the end of the upper reaches was a cat, jumping and dancing.Downstream, it was endless darkness that shrouded the long river. No one knew what would happen in the future or what would happen next.Li Hao entered the winding river World and went against the current.……This place was actually where his memories were buried.Everyone who entered would bury their memories here. This place was a sea of memories and could not be considered as true time.Just as he told second cat, we all know that this is fake. It's just a memory.But we are willing to live here.Li Hao went against the current. A familiar courtyard appeared in front of him. It was a destroyed courtyard. His city, his hometown, had disappeared into the vast world.There was nothing left.He landed in the small courtyard.In the courtyard, a white-haired old man was practicing his fist art. He turned around and laughed heartily."Little Hao is here!""Teacher!"Li Hao bowed slightly. Looking at the familiar face, he was a little distracted.Resurrection?Actually, there was one thing that he had not mentioned. If they were really resurrected ... Would the resurrected person still be the original person?The core Natal star had exploded!Even if they were left behind, they would only be some minor details and stars that had not been activated. In that case, would the resurrected person ... Really be complete?If he resurrected his teacher and Southern Fist, would they still be the same teacher and Southern Fist?He kept these words in his heart.However, it was very painful.So, he came."Teacher, I have something to ask!"He looked at the figure in the river of memories and spoke.Yuan Shuo motioned for him to sit down and wiped his sweat with a towel. As usual, it was so real. No wonder second cat was immersed in it, unable to extricate himself and unwilling to leave. "Tell me, what problems do you have this time?"In his memory, Yuan Shuo was as calm as ever. During his time in Silver City, Yuan Shuo was an expert, a professor, and a cultured man. He was omnipotent and omniscient.He wasn't the old demon Yuan who had been exposed.The old devil who had killed a bunch of people!He was a professor and an affable mentor.Li Hao was dazed for a moment, but he quickly recovered and asked,""Teacher, in the legends, the strong are omnipotent! I'm thinking, if a powerful warrior's friends and family die, and the warrior can revive them...At that time, his blood, Qi, and blood will all be fake, fabricated. Even his mind and thoughts will be created later. Of course, it'll still be based on his original self ... His memories will also be preserved. Then, will such a person still be your family and friends?"Yuan Shuo seemed to be stunned for a moment.He glanced at Li Hao. Did you read a novel again?"“……”"I'm just asking,"Li Hao chuckled. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  "Study hard and read less novels. Most of them are fake."“……”Li Hao helplessly said,"teacher, I know this. This isn't the point. The point is ... Do you think the resurrected person is still the original person?""Forget it," Yuan Shuo stroked his beard and shook his head.Li Hao was a little lost.The teacher's words were rarely missed."Of course, this is too profound. If the original person is gone ... I think we should forget about it!" Compared to the original person, what do you think is the biggest difference?"Li Hao pondered for a moment."I don't know ... Maybe everything is the same. It's just that ... Something might be missing.""That means he's sick!"Yuan Shuo said,"if the original person is gone and resurrected, I think he should still be the same person. Even if there is a difference, it can only be seen as him being sick or missing an arm or a leg ... You can't think that he is not the same person just because he is sick.""Of course, if the original person is still here, and there is such a person ... Then they are puppets, imitations!"Yuan Shuo chuckled and said,"resurrection is actually a very profound question, but it's also a paradox!" It's very complicated. You said,"if you die, one year after you die, I'll resurrect one of you. If you die two years, I'll resurrect one of you. If you die three years, I'll resurrect another you...Are these three completely the same?"""It's not just about their differences. The key is, what do you think?""Are you the same person from one year ago and three years ago?""It actually depends on the resurrected person's mentality. To the resurrected person, everything about him stops at the moment of death! You think he's a stranger, and he also thinks you're a stranger ... In fact, you can also treat him as if he's a vegetable!""Both sides actually need a little time to adapt to each other!" Was he in a vegetative state?Li Hao's heart skipped a beat."Teacher, are you saying that if we can be resurrected, we still have to be resurrected?""Of course!"Yuan Shuo laughed and said,"since I can do it, why not?" However, it also depends on your own thoughts. If the price is too high ... You can think carefully before making a decision. ""Resurrection ..." Yuan Shuo stroked his beard."I think there were legends about it in the ancient civilization. The legendary hell is also a place where people stay after death. Why are you studying such a profound topic?"

"I'm just asking. "Li Hao smiled. Yuan Shuo looked at him and suddenly said,""You don't seem to be my student!"“……”Li Hao was stunned."But ... It seems like it," Yuan Shuo continued."Could it be that you're a resurrected person?"Li Hao was stunned again.As for Yuan Shuo, he looked at the sky and asked doubtfully,""Could it be that you died and I resurrected you? So ... You're struggling over whether you're alive or not? However, I should be the one asking you the question of me resurrecting you after you dies...In other words, you're the one resurrecting me after I die?""That's not possible! I'm the number one hero of Silver Moon ... You're ... A little trash ... You shouldn't be the one resurrecting me!"“……”Would the existence in his memory still think like this?Li Hao fell into deep thought.This thinking, is it Yuan Shuo's or my own?It's just an illusionary image in my memory, just a fragment of an existence. Can it also bring me a soul-like interrogation?It was ... Unbelievable!The power of time was too mysterious.Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, seemed to be thinking about something. He suddenly said,""If I die, you'll come and resurrect me ... And now you're struggling over whether or not you should resurrect me, and whether or not I'll be your teacher after I'm resurrected. You're too black-hearted, kid. Don't you know how to respect your teachers? I'm still young, and I have a lot of things to do. I haven't had the time to enjoy life yet ... You have the nerve to think about all these messy things?"“……”He was once again questioned by Yuan Shuo's soul!"Teacher, I'm not talking about you," Li Hao laughed."I knew what you were going to do the moment you stuck out your butt!",m “……”Li Haozhen laughed."Teacher, I'm just asking.""Just asking? Then why didn't you have any reaction when I said I was the first of the 36 heroes? This means that you already know about it. More importantly, I've never told you about it!"Li Hao was stunned.Are these my thoughts, or are they the true thoughts of the person in my memory?Was it so realistic?Yuan Shuo stroked his beard again and muttered,""In that case, the future is going to be very strange. I'm actually not as good as you, and you've actually reached the point where you can resurrect people. In that case ... I should be nicer to you. Should I teach you the core technique of the five birds secret technique?"“……”Li Hao was stunned!"Interesting," Yuan Shuo said."When I die in the future, you're able to find my present ... What kind of trick is this? It looks like I've taken in an amazing student! Fine, I'll teach you the secret technique of five birds tomorrow!"“……” Li Hao was stunned.Yuan Shuo looked at the sky again,'is this a period of time in the past? To you, this is a period of time in the past, but to me, it's everything that's happening now ... So, was it me who taught you the secret technique of five birds first, or were you the one who influenced me first and made me feel that I should treat you better?"“……”Li Hao didn't say a word. He was a little dazed.As for Yuan Shuo, he looked at Li Hao and said,'it feels like a dream! Kid, don't interfere with the past, even if it's already in the past ... I suggest that you don't interfere with it! It's hard to say what it is when one's martial Dao has reached its peak. You can already transcend time, so anything is possible. Don't interfere with all of this ... Resurrect me when you need to. If you can do it, then do it. What are you hesitating for?""O-okay!"Li Hao looked on in a daze.I'm just immersed in the memories of the past. Can I ... Really interfere with the past?His teacher had been very good to him, teaching him the secret technique of five birds. Was it because of this interference or because he had wanted to teach him in the first place?But ... It's so complicated!Shi Guang was truly way too complicated."Just treat it as a dream ... If this place isn't important, just destroy it!""For you and me, this meeting might interfere with many things," Yuan Shuo continued."Why don't we destroy this place and stop trying The Paradoxes of the Infinite cycle of the past, the present, and the future? you can't understand this, and neither can I! The current me might be dreaming. I feel that I should treat you better, and that's enough. "Li Hao was dazed for a moment, but he didn't say anything.In an instant, he disappeared.The small courtyard that was left behind instantly shattered.In the courtyard, Yuan Shuo was very calm. He looked up at the sky and did not seem to think that there was anything strange about it.……Li Hao, who had walked out of the courtyard and the river, was still a little dazed.I'm just exploring the past in my memories. Can I really affect the past?It was too ... Shocking!In that case, people from the past could really be pulled out from the river and then ... Become real people?For example, Zhan Tiandi!It's just a fragment of the past. I lived in a special space with second cat. Is this special space similar to my river of time? Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  "The teacher in my memory can actually see through my difference ... The key is, is this the influence of my own consciousness, or did I really come into contact with teacher in the past?"Li Hao was almost driven crazy by himself.Fortunately, he quickly let go of all this and suddenly smiled.""Interesting. I want to resurrect teacher!"The faster the better!I really want to ask, before he taught me the secret technique of five birds, did he encounter this, or dream of this, or was he disturbed in any way?

2512 Chapter 418
If there was ... That would be interesting!Although the teacher in his memory didn't explain all the doubts he had before ... His teacher was right about one thing. Being resurrected was better than not being resurrected!Just treat it as if he was sick!Even if there were some differences from before, the original was no longer there. He was no longer a puppet, but a living person. He needed some time to adapt.……The prayers of the people began.The great Dao shook!The stars were shining.A long river floated between the heaven and earth. Billions of stars were shining, and countless stars filled the universe. They were dim and lightless. Those were the unopened Dao meridians.The Silvermoon humans had more than ten billion.Even if a person had at least 360 Dao meridians, they would have more than three trillion stars. Only a few of them had been activated. The stars that were truly dim and as small as dust were the mainstream.Of course, there was a benefit to cultivators.If one was strong enough, even if the other Dao meridians had not been opened, they should still be bigger than ordinary people. If a cultivator's star with an unopened Dao Meridian was like looking for a needle in a haystack ... It was still a needle, and one still had a chance to find it.However, if one didn't cultivate at all, it wouldn't be like looking for a needle in a haystack. It would be like looking for a drop of water in the ocean and merging it into the ocean. It would be everywhere and nowhere to be found.At least a needle still had some special features.After draining the sea dry, you still have a chance of fishing it out.Yuan Shuo's non-core star was actually this needle. It was very difficult, but there was hope.As for the others ... They might just be a drop of water, and they would completely disappear.……Heaven and earth trembled, and the power of the great Dao spread. The chaos great Dao River ran through heaven and earth.And now, there were no more enemies to stop him.Everything was very calm.Even though there were many demonic races and demonic beasts born in the world, who would dare to stop Silvermoon's group at this moment?Above the river, countless stars were shining.At this moment, there was another person at the top of the river. It was Li Hao.With a casual flick, Li Hao located the billions of shining stars and eliminated them.This was easy to find!It was also the easiest to find.As for the remaining dim stars, if they were related to the twinkling stars, he could eliminate them and reduce his workload.Li Hao kept pushing away the stars. In the long river, Hong Yitang was responsible for dividing the pushed stars into a region, and the remaining regions were countless stars that had not been pushed away.In the void, even Heaven's Fate, who had returned home to sleep, couldn't help but run over again.It was really too lively!He did not want to watch the commotion ... But the commotion was too big, and he would be able to see it clearly from home. Furthermore, Silver Moon was currently free, so he might as well just come and watch the show. Resurrection ... He had seen it before.In the late-stage of the new martial realm, the human King set up the yin and yang realms. Countless experts who had died in battle walked out of the yin realm and were all resurrected.But what was the strength of a human King?The human King at that time could kill the current Li Hao with a single breath.But now, Li Hao wanted to resurrect someone, and he was trying to find a needle in a haystack. This was different from the human King. The human King had control over the source and the seed world, which was why he could easily reverse the situation.In the air, he was not the only one who was watching the show.Li Hao didn't stop him.Let's just treat it as a celebration for the resurrected person.As for whether they could succeed ... Li Hao believed that they could. If they really couldn't succeed, he would beat up the onlookers as a way to comfort them.Everyone was filled with anticipation and curiosity.They were all dumbfounded when they saw Li Hao shatter billions of stars with a wave of his hand. ……The king of Dali was a little puzzled and sent a message to the celestial pole,""Senior, how strong is this guy now? Why do I feel that the master of the great Dao is nothing in his hands? Hong Yitang controls the truth of the universe, but why do I feel that ... Li Hao can kill him with one slap?""It's almost like this!"'Strictly speaking, he's still a half-step sovereign, but in terms of strength, there's a high chance that he'll kill Shi Gu sovereign on the spot if he were to fight with him! You have to remember that the experts in Silvermoon world ... At the current stage, they are still far from being able to compare with the same level of neo martial arts! If the difference is too great, we'll have to weaken them by one level!"The king of Dali was well aware of this, but he was still a little confused.""Didn't you say that once you reach the level of Red Moon sovereign, you won't be affected too much? The daosource has entered their bodies ...""That's a powerful being. Bone erosion Emperor is a weakling. How can he be considered a true Emperor?"“……”Okay.Bone erosion Emperor was a weakling.Since he's a weakling, aren't you no match for him?Otherwise, you would have killed him a hundred thousand years ago!"Can Li Hao succeed?""He wants to borrow all my qi and blood to build a physical body. Senior, I still feel that there's a trap ..." The Dali King was a little nervous. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  He told them what had happened, and the celestial pole felt a little strange. It glanced at him and sent a voice transmission after a long time,""Actually, he's right. It's good for you!"Of course, there were two fatal points.First, the problem of lifespan.The king of Dali might not care about it now, but he might cry for his parents in the future.Second, the problem of the primal Chaos lightning tribulation.It was obvious that Li Hao didn't have good intentions. When he left the Stargate, he would definitely be greeted by lightning. Since the king of Dali had agreed, it meant that he was willing to share the lightning ... Whether he would be struck to death or not would depend on luck.Of course, he couldn't be bothered to answer these two questions.

2513 Chapter 418
As for the king of Dali, when he heard that there were still benefits, he felt a little more at ease. It seemed that he had not suffered a loss this time. He was really afraid of being tricked.Heaven's Fate didn't pay any more attention.At this moment, as Li Hao began to divide the stars, countless stars were pushed to one side, but there was still a huge number of stars left. More importantly, there were so many stars that if he were to choose one by one ... Even if he could sweep through a thousand stars in an instant, it would be a lot of work. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  In addition, not all the stars in the great path universe were here.Some places might look empty, but there might be countless stars gathered there. They were just too small to be seen.……In the sky.Li Hao felt a headache as he looked at the countless stars.,m It's really not easy!It was a pity that he didn't have the strength he had today at that time. Otherwise, no matter what, he would have to find those non-natal stars while they were still alive. Then, it would be easier.He felt a little helpless.Li Hao didn't say much. He circulated the cultivation techniques in his body. He knew all the Silver Moon martial arts and all the breathing techniques.At this moment, the secret skill of five birds was activated!There was a fluctuation, like a human breathing, like a beating heart. The entire Silvermoon world seemed to start breathing at this moment.The enormous power of the five Forces swept across the world!A ferocious Tiger appeared once again, roaring through the forest.They seemed to be patrolling all directions!However, there were far too many stars in this world. The resonance between the stars of the dead and the breathing technique was far less effective than before. If they were still alive, they would have sensed it long ago.Li Hao wanted to try using simple methods to find the person.But now, it was proven that ... It was very difficult!Since that was the case, he could only make it more complicated.He took a deep breath, and in an instant, a long river appeared with rolling waves. Heaven and earth trembled as if it had triggered a reaction from the universe of the great path.In the river of time, a star emerged, shining between Li Hao's eyebrows.At this moment, Li Hao was like a celestial being!"Reverse!"With a low shout, the longsword in Li Hao's hand suddenly burst out with a dazzling radiance. Images appeared on the longsword. At this moment, the longsword seemed to be trembling in fear!Suddenly, eight divine weapons appeared in the image!One of them was the nine-section whip of boundless city.Li Hao reached out to grab the nine-section whip as if he had entered the past. At this moment, the river of time trembled. At the end of the river, a cat suddenly turned around, as if it saw Li Hao and saw through him!The cat's eyes were filled with unhappiness.But soon, it looked at the illusory figure beside it and was a little unhappy. With a "meow," its huge body suppressed the world and the river, making it stop shaking.Not far away, Tian Ji cursed in his heart!Bastard Li Hao!Li Hao didn't say anything. He just raised his head and looked at the Stargate in the sky. Dark clouds seemed to be floating in the Stargate. Li Hao raised his eyebrows slightly. He had a thought ...... Right now, the Silver Moon world must be covered by dark clouds!The primal Chaos lightning tribulation had not left!It was both a good and a bad thing.The good thing was that even if a Crimson Moon expert came from the outside and saw the chaos lightning tribulation ... There was a high chance that he would not dare to move. Once the chaos lightning tribulation attacked, even venerable sovereigns would not be able to withstand it.The bad thing was that if he went out, he would definitely be struck to death!Of course, if the dark clouds covered the Silver Moon, it was possible that they would completely cover the existence of the Silver Moon. In this way, whether it was new martial or Crimson Moon, there was a high probability that they would not be able to find the Silver Moon world."Qian Wuliang!"At this moment, Li Hao shouted.Qian Wuliang looked helpless. He instantly turned the stars into Dao, and the illusionary universe of Dao appeared in the sky, blocking the sky and the earth. The dark clouds that came out of the Stargate seemed to have lost their target.However, there were still some dark clouds that were slowly gathering.Qian Wuliang was scared that he would be killed.This thing ... Was really not to be trifled with.Shi Gu, li daoheng, and the others had all been killed by this thing. One could imagine how terrifying it was.At this moment, a nine-section whip appeared in Li Hao's hand."Defy!" Li Hao shouted in a low voice.He returned to the past, back to the day those people died in battle.The river trembled violently. At this moment, the waves were getting stronger and stronger. Ermao turned to look at Li Hao again, and Li Hao looked back at him."I wish to resurrect my friends and family. If senior is able to immerse himself in it, can senior help me?"Er Mao looked at the end of time. In the end, he didn't say anything. His body grew bigger and bigger, suppressing the entire River. The river's fluctuations were so strong that it could wash a half-Emperor to death at any time.However, under second cat's suppression, it didn't move at all. This showed how powerful this cat was!And in front of Li Hao, time reversal!In an instant, the scene of the battle that day appeared on the screen, and the silhouettes of the Silver Moon martial masters appeared.At that moment, time froze!Li Hao's expression was somewhat grave. The river of time washed over him, and Li Hao's long hair fluttered in the wind.A hand suddenly grabbed into the image.He wanted to bring the people of the past back to the present.A person determining a star!Heaven's Fate's expression changed drastically. He looked up at the sky. To capture the person he had sent over and return, this was really going against the heavens.The void Dao universe could not be concealed!Sure enough, when Li Hao grabbed one of them, dark clouds suddenly covered the sky. Qian Wuliang even trembled as he felt suffocated. He felt that he was about to die.F * ck!The lightning tribulation was coming!Below, Li Hao frowned and looked up. Although the river was stable, the lightning tribulation seemed to be trying to stop him. But ... How could he be stopped?

2514 Chapter 418
In an instant, a Thunderbolt sword intent suddenly appeared in his River. It was the Thunderbolt sword intent that li daoheng had left behind.The long sword appeared in his hand again. It was the firmament sword.The lightning sword intent was instantly integrated into the firmament sword."Go!"The long sword whizzed out and turned into a Li Hao. Its sword intent soared into the sky and pierced through the universe, heading straight for the end of the world. Suddenly, lightning appeared in the sky, and below, the lightning sword intent also appeared on the firmament sword, slashing the firmament with one sword!BOOM!A loud sound reverberated through the world.Without raising his head, Li Hao grabbed a person. The person appeared from the past space-time, somewhat at a loss, and instantly turned into ashes, which then integrated into the great path universe.In an instant, among the billions of stars in the universe of the great path, an extremely dim star suddenly flashed with light.Li Hao was overjoyed!There!He stretched out his hand and made a grabbing motion, and the stars fell nearby. He wanted to revive them quickly, but he suddenly looked up at the sky. Forget it, it would be a waste of time. He might as well revive them together.He tried to grab it again ... But this time, the bones in his hand rotted in an instant.Li Hao didn't mind. He grabbed another person.The crowd outside widened their eyes and looked ... It seemed to be the southern style?The moment the southern Fist appeared, it turned into dust and merged into the great Dao universe once again. This time, there were stars shining.Li Hao was overjoyed!He didn't even care about the Thunder tribulation in the sky. He grabbed at the great path universe again, and a star was grabbed to his side.He did this three times, and shadows were pulled out one by one and merged into the great path universe. It looked extremely simple.However, in the sky, the firmament sword was no longer able to resist the primal Chaos lightning tribulation. The blade of the sword appeared, and many scorched marks appeared on it. Just as the lightning was about to strike down, Qian Wuliang suddenly let out a blood-curdling scream, and a wave of lightning power seeped into the void Dao universe.Qian Wuliang almost collapsed!And this was still covering the heaven and earth!Under normal circumstances, the chaos lightning tribulation wouldn't attack unrelated people. However, even Qian Wuliang, who was a Dao master, was caught in the attack range of the firmament sword and lightning tribulation!Below, Li Hao's forehead was covered in sweat.Beside him, stars were floating.There were quite a few who had died in the last battle-Yuan Shuo, hou Xiaochen, Liu Long, Yu Luosha, Nan Quan, Yao si, Jin Jin, Thunderbolt kick, Kong Jie, mad Demon Blade, Thunder fist, tie Buyi from the previous generation ...​ All of them had died in battle, and silver Moon martial arts world had suffered a great loss.At this moment, everyone was extremely nervous.They had already seen some people's apparitions merging into the stars, which meant that their Natal stars had been found.However ... Someone's expression changed drastically.It was even a little pale!Yuan Shuo's star could not be found.In other words, Li Hao had never been able to capture Yuan Shuo's past, because Yuan Shuo was quite powerful at this moment. Li Hao had been capturing the others, but even as the lightning was about to strike, he had not managed to capture Yuan Shuo. This ... Made everyone extremely nervous!To put it bluntly, the others could take it easy, but Yuan Shuo couldn 't!This guy had to be resurrected!At this moment, Li Hao also frowned slightly. Yuan Shuo was the strongest in this era! If they captured him, the impact would be greater.The more time exploded, the stronger it was.The more powerful the lightning was!The firmament sword couldn't block it anymore, and Qian Wuliang ... Couldn't either.Celestial pole and the others did not involve karma, so they could not even block the chaos lightning tribulation.However, if he didn't capture it, it would be difficult to find the star corresponding to Yuan Shuo.They still had to catch him ...Li Hao reached out to grab it again. At this time, a bolt of lightning passed through the void Dao universe and exploded toward the image as if it wanted to obliterate this past!Li Hao's eyes suddenly glowed with ferocity!Qian Wuliang raised his head instantly. The people below didn't see it clearly, but Qian Wuliang saw it clearly from above. He didn't even dare to scream, only endless fear. At this moment, he felt like he was seeing the reincarnation of a demon!That demon-like gaze almost pierced through the void Dao universe."Again and again, three times ..." Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Li Hao shouted coldly. Suddenly, the river rippled. In the lower reaches of the river of time, li Haos appeared one after another in an instant. Second cat, who was upstream, was shocked.Each of the Li Haos appeared with monstrous power.Everyone was holding a sword!One man and one sword!The sword shatters heaven and earth!The Thunderbolts were directly destroyed. Li Hao grabbed the destructive power of the Thunderbolts and forcibly drew them downstream. In an instant, Thunderbolts rose in all directions downstream, and the entire River began to tremble!As for the celestial pole, it kept taking in deep breaths.This was crazy!This lunatic!He was completely crazy!If he did this ... This kid would have a lot of trouble in the future. He couldn't help but shout,""Don't you dare ...""Don't worry!"Li Hao was calm."I'll be struck by lightning sooner or later. It's just that more lightning tribulations have gathered now. There's nothing to be afraid of. I'll settle the score together!"Then, more li Haos walked out.He walked towards the sky, sword after sword!The Thunderbolts were destroyed one after another!At this moment, Li Hao had already caught Yuan Shuo. Yuan Shuo appeared, then instantly crumbled and merged into the universe. The next moment, a star flickered in the depths of the universe. Li Hao exhaled. "He's really well hidden, he's not afraid that I won't be able to find him!"He quickly escaped into the air and disappeared from his original spot. Soon, a star was brought over by him.At this point, all the stars had been found.It was considered smooth!Everyone heaved a sigh of relief, but at the same time, they looked up at the sky in fear. The power of lightning was being continuously destroyed.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly turned back time again.The heavens were shocked!

2515 Chapter 418
Time went back bit by bit, and the lightning that had been extinguished in the sky suddenly increased again. Even the future Li Hao was struck to death one by one."What are you doing?"Li Hao didn't reply.Time was still flowing backward!Suddenly ... A city appeared.Silver City!Gradually, it became clearer and clearer. Li Hao, on the other hand, grew older and older. Time was still flowing back ...Gradually, an ancient Academy appeared.Everyone's guts were about to split!In the sky, countless lightning bolts appeared. At the end of the river of time, second cat couldn't help but say, "Don't come again!"Li Hao bit his lips. The next moment, his eyes suddenly glowed. He saw ... Saw a familiar person, a person from his memories. He reached out and grabbed at the person!"Don't mess around ..."Second cat, who was so calm, couldn't help but roar.Li Hao's hand had already reached in ... In an instant, his arm completely withered. In the image of time, a young man with a strong head appeared. When Li Hao's withered arm passed by him, trying to pull him out ...But in an instant, the young man was shattered. Li Hao was stunned.The broken young man suddenly raised his head and looked up. He seemed to see that hand. Suddenly, a smile appeared on his face and he shook his head gently. His eyes were the same as before, just like those years ago!He seemed to be saying ... Let's go!The scene began to collapse!It was as if they couldn't bear the past anymore, and the young man seemed to be unable to be extracted. He was just an ordinary person, an ordinary person. He had not opened any Dao Meridian or even any aperture acupoint. An ordinary person was like dust!The only thing in the entire scene was that pair of eyes!It was just like that time when he was corroded by the red shadow and struggled to crawl out of the dormitory. He looked at Li Hao and told him with his eyes ... Run!Don't worry about me!At that moment, lightning exploded in the sky, and the firmament sword was instantly struck down. The void Dao universe instantly cracked slightly. The Li Haos that walked out of the river were shattered one by one.There seemed to be no future!In the withered palm, the young man turned into a wisp of green smoke and completely disappeared from the picture. Li Hao looked at him in a daze.Back then, you also saw me in this way.Back then, I could only watch helplessly ... And now, I still can 't?I've already reached the end of the Silver Moon!BOOM!The scene completely shattered. Li Hao's eyes were filled with ferocity. In an instant, he reached out to grab the falling firmament sword, floated into the air, and slashed with it, splitting the sky and earth!Li Hao charged forward with his sword in hand. Lightning descended, and his long sword was incomparably fierce.At this moment, the swords of destruction, time, and myriad DAOs appeared in the heavens and earth.Li Hao was like an ancient giant, his fiendish aura filling the entire world. It was as if no one had ever seen Li Hao so furious. It was as if heaven and earth had seen Li Hao truly angry for the first time!"Kill!"The sound of the great path, the sound of heaven and earth, and the strong killing intent even surpassed the longevity sword will.At this moment, a man and a sword pierced through the world.Countless Thunderbolts were annihilated and suppressed in the depths of the long river.Li Hao kept flying and attacking with his sword.Heaven and earth shattered!The sky cracked!When they reached the end of the world, a door appeared, and Starlight glittered. Li Hao was about to charge out with his sword when someone behind him shouted angrily,""Teacher Yuan, aren't you going to revive?" Lin Hongyu looked up at the sky and chased after him. She shouted angrily,""Teacher Yuan and the others are still waiting for you!"BOOM!The Stargate trembled slightly, and the dark clouds and lightning disappeared instantly.Li Hao turned his head, and the ferocity in his eyes disappeared.He looked at Lin Hongyu, and under her trembling gaze, his eyes gradually cleared up. He nodded and said,"I lost my composure!"Lin Hongyu panted heavily and did not reply.Li Hao seemed to have regained his calm in an instant. He looked around at the experts who were chasing him and said again,""I'm sorry, I lost my composure. Thunder has left. Starting resurrection!"He didn't say much and regained his calm.Even the celestial pole was trembling.This brat ... That instant of rage, that instant of killing intent, that instant of madness, even made his heart palpitate.The human King was also crazy!However, the human Emperor had always been like this, and he would get used to it. A refined man like Li Hao was instantly enraged and completely lost his mind. His killing intent covered the entire world. It was simply ... Terrifying!At this moment, Heaven's Fate was thinking that if anyone really angered this guy ... It should be very difficult to anger him, but if they really did, it would definitely be an extremely terrifying thing.Li Hao had never been so angry when he was dealing with li daoheng and the others.He treated all his enemies with such ease. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Who was that young man?Some people had already guessed it.The group of Silver Moon martial masters were frighteningly quiet.They knew who that person was.Li Hao's past was actually not much. They knew very well that he was his childhood friend who had died at the hands of the red moon. Before his death, he had crawled out of the dormitory while being possessed by a red shadow and spontaneously ignited. He seemed to have sent Li Hao some message.Today ... Li Hao had forcefully reversed time and returned to that moment, but he had failed to retrieve it.He looked at Li Hao again. Li Hao seemed to have regained his rationality.The angry and crazy person from before didn't seem to be Li Hao.This instant change made people's hearts turn cold.He hoped that the resurrection of Yuan Shuo and the others would make this fellow a little more rational and that no one would provoke him again.Qian Wuliang also walked out of the void with a lot of wounds on his body. He didn't even dare to look at Li Hao, for fear that Li Hao would blame him for this ... He saw everything clearly just now.At that moment, Li Hao was simply the evilest demon in the world!After failing to capture Zhang Yuan, Li Hao seemed to want to destroy the world ... It was too terrifying.Li Hao smiled again.""Alright, everyone, return to your original positions and don't run around. The matter just now is over, and the recovery is starting ..."Then, he looked at second cat and bowed,"Senior must be laughing at me, I've also caused senior to suffer!"Second cat looked at him and didn't say anything. He disappeared into the river.The cat had also sensed this man's madness, but it didn't want to say anything. It had accompanied Zhan Tiandi for countless years and seen human Kings. It had seen too many people, but Li Hao's madness had reached an extremely rational level, which was chilling.In that moment of emotional control, second cat felt ... It was better to immerse itself in the past."King of Dali, I need to borrow your vitality!" Li Hao said with a bright smile.The Dali King didn't say a word, and his qi and blood instantly scattered ..."I'm f * cking scared of you. If you want it, then take it." This Li Hao had to be split between the demonic sword and the Marchioness Silvermoon. The Marchioness Silvermoon was a kind person, while the demonic sword Li Hao was the true demon.Silver moon's greatest demon might not be li daoheng and the others, but this guy.Li Hao laughed heartily."Today, my master is about to be resurrected. Silver Moon, when my master and the others are resurrected, I will thank the world!"BOOM!The stars were suspended in the air, and countless qi and blood gushed into them.The stars were ignited in an instant, and figures appeared one after another. The previous scene seemed to have been completely forgotten, but those who had seen it with their own eyes remembered it in their hearts. They were all a little frightened, afraid that the resurrection would fail.

The stars lit up, and a figure appeared.The Dali King injected his qi and blood. At this moment, countless energy gathered from all directions.Not far away.The Queen didn't need Li Hao's reminder. She was actually more tactful than the Dali King. The scene just now had also frightened the Queen. At this moment, she quickly ignited the fire of faith, burning the world!The fire of faith was the heart of all people. The DAOs of all gathered together. It was also a type of great Dao power, a type of chaos great Dao.In addition to the power of the Silver Moon from the Silver Moon god, he was using it as his bone.In an instant, the figures had formed an extremely powerful Foundation.Is that enough?Not enough!When these people died in battle, the strongest among them was only Yuan Shuo, who could barely fight a Sage. In reality, he only had the power of the sun and moon. The others were all at the sun and moon level, and almost no one had reached the Dao integration stage.If he was revived, his Foundation would still be shallow.He was far behind the others.Currently, the strongest of the Silver Moon martial masters were at the mid-stage Dao integration realm, while the weakest were at the late-stage Sun Moon realm. Even people like Wang Ming had reached the late-stage Sun Moon realm and were not far from the Dao integration realm.If his teacher and the others were to recover, it would be difficult for them to catch up to everyone since they had missed many opportunities in the early or mid-stages of the sun Moon realm.The power of ten thousand people gathered.Countless river water came from the river of chaos. It was the chaos Dao energy from hongyitang. Not far away, Qian Wuliang tactfully released a large amount of Phantom Dao energy without Li Hao's warning.At this moment, he was more tactful than anyone else.As for Li Hao, waves of sword intent rose from the river of time. The sword intent turned into a special power and fused into everyone's bodies.​ The figures became clearer and clearer.At the same time, many huge stars were created by Li Hao.Those stars instantly merged into the river of chaos, and the river Washed over them.Soon, these stars connected to the sky above the figures and became their Natal stars.This scene left many people speechless.In order to resurrect these people, Li Hao had put in a lot of effort. Not only did he want to resurrect them, but he also hoped that they wouldn't fall behind. He had the vitality of the Dali King, the power of the Queen's Silver Moon, the power of the void and reality, and the power of the river of time.And now, he had personally created a great star for them ... All of this made people jealous.This wasn't the end!Li Hao looked at the Queen again.The Queen was a little helpless. A special power flowed out of her body. It was the Heaven's Will power that had been shattered last time. At this moment, this power merged into the figures.It was as if these people were the children of heaven and earth.Before he was resurrected, energy surged in from all directions, as if he had received the favor of heaven and earth.This was also something they had discussed before!However, the queen's heart ached. Originally, she had been very happy that Li Hao had given up on her, but now ... She had given up more than half of her Silver Moon Power and heaven's will power, so Li Hao no longer had to keep an eye on her.The figures had yet to recover their wills, but the auras in their bodies had almost instantly reached the level of sun and moon.Li Hao watched in silence for a while.Suddenly, the firmament sword trembled. The long sword seemed to be wailing, unwilling, and in pain. Li Hao looked at the long sword and said softly,""Spit out the eight weapons. There will be opportunities in the future. I will use the eight weapons to help them achieve Dao! If you don't want to ... You can leave!"The firmament sword was extremely helpless!After devouring eight divine weapons, he had forged the strongest weapon of the Silver Moon, the firmament sword!But now, Li Hao wanted it to spit out the eight divine weapons ... This ...Although they were helpless, who would dare to resist now? who could resist?The eight divine weapons, which had been devoured, were spat out bit by bit.Li Hao nodded slightly. The eight godly weapons gathered and suddenly formed an eight-trigram array!In an instant, it was as if a huge formation had appeared in the world, a huge seal.The eight divine weapons covered the entire world.Even the celestial pole took a slight breath! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  He was really F * cking generous!The blood Emperor was so generous because he was a top venerable sovereign. Li Hao was not even a venerable sovereign, and he threw away the eight divine weapons.At this moment, Li Hao's River appeared!Time washed away!The eight divine weapons trembled!"The mission of the eight soldiers has been completed!" Li Hao's voice was like a great Bell."The eight trigrams of heaven and earth, forging the sky!"BOOM!The eight divine weapons were corroded by the power of time. Gradually, they even began to decay and turn into liquid. At this moment, they were like the essence of life, turning into liquid and falling from the sky.Like spring water, they gushed into his body.Those figures became even stronger.The surrounding crowd was once again left speechless ... How ... Generous!The eight divine weapons were truly top-notch divine weapons. They had transformed into eight main cities, and when wielded by Saints, they could even rival a Heavenly King. In the end, Li Hao had directly cleansed them into essence and replenished the people who had died in battle.This was also a form of compensation.One by one, the figures became stronger. Originally, they were just at the beginning stage of the sun Moon realm, but now, they were even starting to enter the middle stage of the sun Moon realm. This was the result of not fully recovering and their wills not waking up.Furthermore, his body was so strong that it would not pose any obstacles to his subsequent improvements.Forged with the eight divine weapons, the power of heaven's will, the power of the Silver Moon, the qi and blood of the beginner stage, and faith as fire, such a body was naturally powerful.Li Hao was probably the only one in the world who could afford to take out so many treasures.The stars were found, and the lightning had passed. Now, it was just the process of laying the foundation.

2517 Chapter 419
As for the recovery of his will ... It was not difficult for Li Hao.The most difficult time had passed.He couldn't wait to give the best and the most extreme benefits to those who had died in battle. Even if the melting of the eight weapons would cause his sword's strength to decline a little, the firmament sword couldn't return all of them. It could only return a part of them.Seeing that these people's physical auras had all reached the late stage of the sun Moon tier, Li Hao let out a sigh of relief.At this moment, all they had to do was to wake them up and restore their will so that they could take the opportunity to cultivate again and see if anyone could reach the Dao integration realm in one step ... The difficulty was quite high, as they had not even reached the Dao integration realm when they had died in battle.Reaching the Dao integration realm was as difficult as ascending to the heavens, but the ninth level of the sun Moon realm was fine, and the Dao integration realm wouldn't be too far away.Everyone was watching from the side.He was somewhat looking forward to it. It was actually quite simple to awaken the will after everyone recovered. When the Natal star recovered, the will would just be in a deep sleep. He only needed to guide it with his mental energy. It was not too difficult.At this moment, even the Queen knew that resurrection was no problem.She was familiar with this process. It was just like the recovery of a God, and it would be over after waking up.But Li Hao didn 't.At this moment, the river of time appeared once more. Between heaven and earth, divine texts suddenly appeared from the river. In the next moment, a book of the great Dao appeared, and the divine texts were imprinted within.On the other side, Zhang an was slightly startled.And at this moment, time seemed to flow backward again!This scene left everyone dumbfounded!Soon, boundless city appeared.The battle scene reappeared. Li Hao suddenly had a River surrounding them, and a book of Dao appeared in his hand. At this moment, not only Li Hao, but everyone else seemed to have been pulled into the river!……Boundless city.The battle broke out again.Everyone's eyes were dazed, as if they had returned to that day.At the same time, there were some familiar people around him.Nanquan's cursing voice sounded,""Didn't he die? Why are you still here ... Referee! Was I dreaming just now? You can get distracted while fighting?"He was a little depressed!A person appeared in the city. It was Nan Quan.Nan Quan was a little depressed and speechless. I remember that I died in battle, but now ... Why am I still fighting here? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  So ... It was just an illusion?I'm not dead yet?One figure after another appeared in the surroundings. Hou Xiaochen was a little confused. He looked around and attacked with his spear. He felt that something was wrong, so he looked at Yu Luosha and rushed over!He also remembered that Yu Luosha had died in battle.Why ... Why are you still here?As for Yu Luosha, her killing intent was boiling. She was also puzzled.The Marquis ... The Marquis was still alive!This was good! Experts appeared in all directions and fought fiercely. At this moment, he felt a little dazed, as if he was in a dream. For some reason, he suddenly felt like he was dead. At this moment, Li Hao's voice came from the sky.""Fight with peace of mind. If the enemy is strong, create an illusion to confuse us. Break the illusion and don't be disturbed!"An illusion?He understood!The experts were instantly at ease.At this moment, someone appeared beside Nan Quan. Bei Quan looked at Nan Quan with joy in his eyes. There was a hint of disbelief in his joy as he casually killed a person with a punch. He was a little excited."Little he?"Nanquan sent a person flying with a punch. He turned around and frowned."Why?""You ... Did you see the illusion?"Northern fist was a little excited, while Southern Fist frowned.""I saw it, what for?""You ... What did you see?""What did you see? I'll kill all the enemies in a moment. We'll definitely win this battle. I'm invincible!"Southern Fist continued to be proud. Was this enough?"You ... You didn't see it, you're dead ...""Tsk! Even if you die, I won't die!"Nan Quan cursed loudly, unlucky!I did see it, but ... Why should I tell you?It was just an illusion!However ... As he looked at the northern fist, he felt a little strange. Why did this old man feel like he was lazing around in such an intense battle?艹!'This dog is really a piece of trash. But ... Is he hiding his strength?'Why did it feel like even the undyings weren't his match?That's strange!Could it be that ... He was really hiding his strength?You're really not a good thing, are you trying to secretly bully me again!Nan Quan cursed in his heart. He struck out a punch, and his fist suppressed the heaven and earth. The more he fought, the braver he became. He felt that he had become much more powerful.Northern fist was incomparably excited. He sent a golden-armored man flying with a punch and quickly disappeared. The next moment, he appeared in front of a person and chuckled."Commander Yao si, did you see the illusion?"Yao si slightly nodded and also threw out a punch, sweeping in all directions!He saw it. He saw a tragic battle.He saw everyone dying in battle and saw bei Quan on the verge of falling. Bei Quan's fist was majestic. Even he had to admit that this person's fist technique was number one in the world. He also walked the path of fist and saved bei Quan, but he was killed on the spot by the enemy.However, this was just an illusion. There was no point in bringing this up. He only reminded the northern fist: "Be careful, this battle is dangerous!""I understand, I understand ..."Bei Quan was overjoyed and in high spirits.This little old man was wandering around, punching each of them one by one. His fist technique was majestic, no longer murderous, but majestic, and his fist exploded in all directions!At this moment, everyone felt a little strange.The group of people in the crowd who were participating in the battle had strange looks in their eyes. Bei Quan ... Was about to advance. Bei Quan had already reached the Dao integration realm not long ago, but his aura was soaring at this moment, and he seemed to be about to advance to the second or even third level of Dao integration.

Of course, he suppressed it again.It wasn't just the northern fist. At this moment, many people were wandering around.Even the Azure light sword had kept a low profile ever since Yuan Shuo's death. At this moment, it was wandering around in search of Yuan Shuo.All the experts were shocked.They knew where they were.In time, in illusions, in memories, in the past, in the scenes of their battles ... It was not difficult to create illusions. When Li Hao went to Yuanping martial arts university, he was pulled into it by Zhang an once.But ... At that time, he could clearly feel that it was an illusion.At this moment, even Dao integration cultivators and sages felt that ... This was a real battlefield. It was exactly the same as what had happened before. There was nothing different about it except for them!They were a group of people who were just bystanders in the battle.Li Hao's voice rang in everyone's ears.""Don't leak any information. Wait for me to pass time naturally. Let them participate in every battle and comprehend the Dao. Let them return naturally without any gaps!""Everyone, cooperate with me and put on a good show ... Whoever dares to expose themselves will die in battle early and leave the river! Northern fist, if you run around again, I'll be the first to kick you out!"“……”On the battlefield, the northern fist instantly fell silent.The others were also shocked. In order to prevent these people from falling behind, to prevent them from being confused, suspicious, and missing out on something, Li Hao actually ... Actually turned back time and played out everything in the river.It hadn't been long since everyone had died in battle. In fact, it had only been half a year.However ... The past half a year was also the time when the most changes occurred.All kinds of people and experts emerged in an endless stream.If they were to act out everything ... It would be a little troublesome. All the experts were quickly thinking about how to act it out. To experience it again ... It was really troublesome.Of course, it was also very interesting.On the other side, Tian Jian, who had been silent all this time, suddenly spoke,"Hou Xiaochen ... I just saw an illusion. You seemed to be shouting for the Jade Rakshasa. Is that true?"Hou Xiaochen was stunned!艹!You guys saw it too? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Could it be that everyone had seen the same illusion?Nan Quan's expression also changed slightly as he cursed inwardly. Could it be that they were all the same illusions?If that was the case ... Then Northern fist, this B * stard, was intentionally provoking him. He was really a bad person.At this moment, Yuan Shuo's figure appeared in the air.Yuan Shuo was slightly dazed as he looked at Li Hao ... Li Hao also looked at him. After killing the Hanjiang Saint with a single strike, Li Hao said,""Teacher, we must win this battle. The illusionary realm only destroyed our confidence. It's not worth mentioning. I've gained some enlightenment. This battle ... I will definitely advance to a deeper level!"Yuan Shuo was a little dazed. He glanced at him and then at the others. Just like before, everyone was fighting a hard battle.However, it seemed to be different.Northern fist, sky sword, earth-covered sword ...They were all here, but ... It seemed ... It wasn't that difficult. The opponents of these people seemed to be very weak and easily defeated by them.Even the disciple in front of him seemed to be a little different.He was fighting a strong enemy, and as he fought, he suddenly stopped. Li Hao was stunned. Yuan Shuo allowed Zheng Gong to punch through him. He looked at Li Hao and frowned."What the hell?"“……”Li Hao was speechless.Yuan Shuo shook his head."It's a little strange ... This ... This seems to be something I've experienced in a dream. You ... You've returned to look for me once. It's strange. It's similar to what you're doing today!"Li Hao was stunned.Is it really...Really in your memory?Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, rubbed his head and looked at Li Hao, then at the sky, and then at his surroundings. Everything seemed real.He suddenly had a thought and looked at Li Hao,'I seem to have gained some new memories ... You disappointing thing, did You Do Something To Me? Did I ... Die in battle?"“……” Li Hao was silent."You're resurrecting me?"“……”"Then what are you doing with these things?""Let's experience it again!"Li Hao said after a while.Yuan Shuo understood and felt a little strange. He nodded,""Not bad, but ... Are you even human? So, we'll be kept in the dark, and those guys will know, right?""Yes,""I say, there's something wrong with these guys!""How could you tell, teacher?" Li Hao asked helplessly."When you stick out your butt ..."Li Hao was speechless. These words were so familiar. He had heard them before.At this moment, Li Hao smiled and said in confusion,""Teacher, you mean to say that something has suddenly appeared in your memory, and I've looked for you?""It wasn't clear before, but it seems to be clearer this time ... You seemed to have come to me ... Of course, not now, but a long time ago, before you learned martial arts."Li Hao was confused. Was this a new memory, or had it really existed since a long time ago?Forget it, he didn't understand!It was too complicated!However, he didn't expect that his teacher would see through him so easily. He was truly ... Speechless."Then, teacher ... Do you still want to continue?""Of course!"Yuan Shuo nodded. Suddenly, he spat out a mouthful of blood and flew backward, crashing into the aquamarine light sword below. He let out a mournful roar, "Don't hurt bi Guang, you're looking for death!"“……”Li Hao was stunned.Jadesword was also stunned for a moment, but in the next moment, he was touched.Yuan Shuo ... He actually ... Actually didn't forget about her at this time. She really ... Really didn't know what to say. She could only let Yuan Shuo hold her and feel the unusual warmth.

2519 Chapter 419
This man ... Was so overbearing!Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, had a determined expression as he growled,""We will win this battle! The Silver Moon Martial Master is invincible! Follow me!"“……”In the sky, Li Hao was stunned for a moment. Then, he suddenly laughed. He laughed in a way that he didn't know what to do, and he laughed in a ... Helpless way!How did this happen?Overbearing President?What is my teacher doing?Since you already know, why don't you ask what happened, what has changed, and what the situation is now ... You don't even care about it, and the first thing you did was to go and pick up girls!I really ... Want to just punch you back!Li Hao was mentally exhausted!There are so many things, but there's nothing you care about?His teacher was like this, and so was the southern Fist. As if he had seen himself die in the illusion, he also punched out valiantly and shouted,""Come and kill your Grandpa he! Who said neo martial was invincible? Silver Moon Southern Fist, He Yong Wushuang!"That was called a high-pitched and endless scolding!Not too far away, hou Xiaochen had his arm around Yu Luosha's waist. They looked at each other and smiled as if they had broken something. The fiery phoenix spear swept through the heavens and earth, killing enemies with its power!Yu Luosha was also playing the zither and singing in harmony. One palm after another, she killed experts one after another!Further away, Liu Hong was wielding an axe and had just killed a powerful enemy. He looked up at the sky with a puzzled expression.Was everything he saw an illusion?Can we win this time?I don't know!Just as they were thinking about this, a person appeared. It was Zhang an. Everyone was overjoyed. This person had come!There was hope for this battle!Zhang an was also a little curious, a little doubtful, and an indescribable feeling ... At this moment, he also appeared here and shouted,""Neo martial's rebellion, neo martial shall be executed!"Last time, he didn't have such an opportunity. This time ... It seemed like it was going to happen again.Interesting!Li Hao shouted,"director Zhang is here. We will win this battle. Kill!"A monstrous battle erupted once again.However ... In the end, some people still knew that this was fake. The people from the northern fist surrounded the southern Fist and played a supporting role. From time to time, they wanted to ask a few questions and chat. If it wasn't for the boundless killing intent ... These people would really want to chat more.Li Hao was locking onto them.Whoever was exposed would be kicked out.,m This time, no one dared to expose themselves. How interesting!It was these few guys who were kept in the dark.In the days to come ... He could play with her more, how interesting!We've been living in fear these days, so we have to make them feel the same!……At the same time. Li Hao walked out of the river and left a clone behind.The water of the river was still flowing.They seemed to be among them.Heaven's Fate didn't enter either. He was powerful, and if he entered, he might interfere with the entire time change. At this moment, Heaven's Fate was somewhat speechless."This is awesome! This is amazing! Your resurrection and awakening techniques ... I have to say, they are top-notch!"But ...He glanced at Li Hao and frowned.""Is it worth it? If you really can't do it, you can just create an illusion and drag them into time. Your lifespan ... Is about to run out, right?"Every time he used time, it would be a consumption.Li Hao was almost bald!Her long hair was almost all gone.Those were the traces of the passage of time.Li Hao, however, was not in a hurry at all. He smiled and said,"what's the hurry? I'll be out of the Silver Moon land soon. Once I'm out, I'll be struck by lightning ... If I die, it'll be over. If I don't die, there's hope for me to be a venerable sovereign! Half-step sovereigns had a lifespan of at least three hundred thousand years, while venerable sovereigns had a lifespan of at least a million years! I've only used up the lifespan of a half-step sovereign. Once I'm killed, I won't die ... There's a high chance that I'll become a venerable sovereign. There's still 700000 years left. Why would I be afraid of that?"Heaven's Fate felt something strange. This guy had lost a lot of his hostility.It was a good thing!Previously, he had not dared to get too close to Li Hao because the latter's methods were too advanced. He had only gone closer to take a look out of curiosity.He didn't say anything more. He looked at the long river that flowed slowly. The people in it seemed to be experiencing everything."Do you want me to go in and play in the battle later?" he couldn't help but laugh."I don't need to!"Li Hao laughed."Senior, it's better for you to take a bath and go to sleep. With a half-Emperor entering, I'm afraid I'll be exhausted to death before the blood even reaches me!"Seeing that he was speaking so casually, Heaven's Fate also laughed."Your teacher is quite interesting ..."He looked into the water and saw that Li Hao's teacher seemed to be taking advantage of him.Li Hao was also helpless. He waved his hand and covered the river."Teacher has an easy-going personality ... He's only helping uncle-master Azure light sword heal!"“……”Heaven's Fate chuckled. Who would believe that?Healing? why are you touching me?He wasn't familiar with Li Hao's teacher, but he had paid some attention to him. He didn't expect him to be an old lecher.Of course, in his eyes, they were all little kids."How long do you need?"He asked again. Li Hao looked at him and said,""The water of the river is flowing. It'll be soon. Let's have a chat. Their battles are over. They'll return to reality in three or four days!""This method ... Is really extraordinary!"Heaven's Fate couldn't help but sigh again."This way, it's not just the few of them who won't have a break. The others who enter will experience it again and gain enlightenment. Some of the missed opportunities ... May be able to start over again! If you throw in someone who doesn't know the situation, they'll think that they've been Reborn!"Rebirth! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Perhaps that was the case.If someone who knew everything but wasn't close to Li Hao were thrown in, perhaps ... Something interesting would happen.
