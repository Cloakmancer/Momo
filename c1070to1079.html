        ointed at general Huang with its paw. General Huang had no reason to refuse and quickly said,""Emissary, please calm down ... I'll help you drive away Shi ... Perhaps it wasn't yu Jie and the others who attacked just now. Could it be a Martial Master?"
         As he said this, Xu Xing's voice rang in his ears."It might be Yu Jie and the others who ordered it!"
         As he spoke, he glared at general Huang.
         At this time, do you need to explain?
         Of course, they were going to frame them. Regardless of whether they were the culprits or not, they were going to make the demon race emissary remember them. Even if they managed to escape this time, kui Shan would not let them off.
         General Huang understood and didn't say anything else.
         A powerful energy quickly surged into the Black Panther's body. It seemed to have felt something, marveling at the Black Panther's physical strength. It also felt that there was indeed a surge of power.
         It was a little like ... A sword force!
         Swordsman?
         In an instant, he thought of a person, the light sword, but it didn't feel like it.
          Regardless of this, he quickly poured in his own energy to suppress this force. This force wasn't weak. However, he felt that it shouldn't be able to take the great demon's life. This great demon's physical body was really strong.
         As for the Black Panther, it was like a bottomless pit. No matter how much energy he poured in, it would disappear in the blink of an eye. General Huang continued pouring in energy as well ... He cursed inwardly. This ancient demon is really strange.
         Gradually, his forehead was covered in sweat.
         He was only in the metamorphosis stage, and even though he had just entered it, he had actually suffered a small loss from a weak ancient Fey. It seemed like he had very little energy.
         "Ha!"
         He let out a low shout again and poured in even more energy. His entire person also became focused.
         At this moment, Li Hao knew that his chance had come.
         If he still couldn't kill him in one blow ... It would be too difficult to kill him.
         Just as general Huang was focused on suppressing the aura for Black Panther, a look of surprise appeared in his eyes. General Huang noticed it as well and was puzzled. What's wrong?
         In the next moment, he heard Black Panther's miserable cry!
         Woof! Woof! Woof!
         Like a dog barking, the Black Panther was in pain. This time, Li Hao didn't hold back. He directly pierced the Black Panther's stomach with his sword. In an instant, the sword, which was forcibly fused from the five Forces, pierced general Huang's heart in the blink of an eye!
         Li Hao knew that this way, Heibao would also be injured ... But at this time, he couldn't care too much. It wasn't like it was a fatal injury.
         Puchi!
         The distance between them was so close that they were almost face-to-face. Even if general Huang reacted in time, he would not be able to retreat in time. He could only watch as the sword pierced through his heart!
         He was puzzled and in disbelief ... What was going on?
         He was very strong!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, no matter how strong he was, he had not expected that at this moment, when he was focused on saving the emissary, there seemed to be a swordsman in the emissary's stomach. This swordsman had actually drawn his sword and killed him!  Was it the swordsman who had just attacked the messenger?
         How did he manage to hide in the Messenger's stomach?
         He didn't understand this.
         That's right, even at this point, he had never thought that the Black Panther was fake. It shouldn't be. He was just really confused. How could this person enter the Messenger's stomach without a sound?
         A special superpower?
         However, the other party should be a Martial Master!
         Therefore, at the moment when he was confused, the Black Panther struck out with its claw at an extremely fast speed and directly smashed his head. He seemed to have completely understood that the emissary and the swordsman were in cahoots!
         However, it was too late.
         A man and a dog joined forces and killed general Huang in an instant.
         Xu Xing and the second general supervisor finally realized that something was wrong. The second general supervisor's first thought was to escape, while Xu Xing's first thought was to pounce on the mirror and break the restrictive spell. He had just sealed this place, so no one would know that someone had died here.
         If he opened it, Redbeard and the others would come in!
         Even if the Redbeard wanted to rebel, he did not dare to kill Xu Qing at this moment. Xu Qing was not dead, and the Redbeard might even say that he was here to protect him.
         Xu Xing's reaction wasn't slow either ... But Li Hao instantly drilled out of the black Panther's stomach and slashed at Xu Xing with his sword. The powerful sword momentum exploded in an instant. Xu Xing's hand was about to touch the mirror, but it was too late!
         Puchi!
         The starry sky sword pierced through his neck. Li Hao drew a line in the air. Xu Xing's head was twisted. He looked at Li Hao in shock.
         His lips opened and closed slightly.
         He was obviously saying ... Li Hao!
          That's right, at this moment, he saw the face of his murderer clearly. Li Hao. He would recognize him even if he was reduced to ashes. The guy who killed his elder brother and nephew. Everyone in the high Duke's public house knew him, because Li Hao's appearance had long been known.
         Demonic sword!
         Li Hao killed him with one strike, then turned around and punched. With a loud boom, he punched through the two escaping three suns. Then, he turned around and attacked the second general manager, whose leg was bitten by the Black Panther.
         "Demonic sword ... You're demonic sword Li Hao!" The second-in-command shrieked.
         It was filled with incomparable fear!
         Impossible, how could the demonic sword come out of this dog's stomach, and how could it enter the Xu family? the other party should be in the White moon City, and now countless people want to kill him. If it wasn't for the memorial, the Xu family would have sent people over long ago!
         However, Li Hao had actually come.
         BOOM!
         With a loud sound, the sword trembled and slashed out. The Black Panther also exerted force through its mouth and clawed out. Ignoring the wound on its stomach, it instantly clawed through the other party's lower body ... A scream was heard again as Li Hao slashed down with his sword!
         With a pfft, the sharp cry ended!
        
         It was quiet.
         On the ground, the five corpses had died with their eyes wide open. General Huang's head was missing, so he must have died an even more unjust death.
         The transformation stage!
         If it was face to face, Li Hao and black Panther wouldn't be able to kill him even if they joined forces. They would only be able to escape. But now ... He was killed by Li Hao so easily.
         A drop of the spring of life fell on the Black Panther's stomach.
         The Black Panther looked at Li Hao resentfully. Although Li Hao had given it two drops of the spring of life, it still felt aggrieved and in great pain!
         Li Hao didn't say anything and quickly collected the corpses.
         Then, he quickly went down and packed up all six treasures on the third floor.
         Then, he went to the second floor and put all the origin God weapons into his storage ring.
         Finally, he quickly arrived on the first floor and put away all the storage rings. He quickly strung them together with a rope and made a long ring Necklace. The silver armor appeared, and Li Hao put the necklace into the bag that the silver armor had brought.
          Li Hao didn't let go of the armor on the ground, either. Although he didn't know how to use it ... He kept it!
         He took out a storage ring and quickly put it away.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Outside, the sound of an attack could be heard. It was obvious that someone was attacking the Treasury.
         Li Hao spent some time collecting all the armors and returned to the fourth floor. At this moment, there was only one treasure on the fourth floor ... The mirror fragment.
         The mirror reflected the situation outside.
         Outside, the red-bearded man seemed to have killed a Daoguang and scared off many people. At this moment, he was leading his men to attack the Treasury, his eyes full of ruthlessness.
         On the other side, Xu Qing was beating Yu Qiao to the point where he couldn't stop vomiting blood ...
         All of this happened very quickly.
         Li Hao glanced at the mirror fragment ... Once this thing was taken away, the red beard would appear. But if he didn't take it away ... Was he going to wait here for Xu Qing to kill those people and then come to kill him?
         Wouldn't he be cut into a thousand pieces!
         Li Hao took out a tree root, his eyes filled with ruthlessness ... It's fine if Redbeard doesn't stop me, but if he does ... I'll feed him a tree root!
         Little tree wasn't weak. This thing ... Might be able to kill him.
         If not, he and black Panther would have a chance of killing red beard.
         Li Hao made up his mind and instantly put the mirror fragment into his storage ring.
         In an instant ... The protective cover seemed to have disappeared.
         Outside, a sound could be heard.
         There was a loud boom!
         "Second young master, I'm here to protect you!" The red-bearded man's cold voice sounded.
         In the distance, Xu Qing was slightly stunned.
         At that moment, the entire public house seemed to have lost something ...
         Just as Xu Qing was in a daze, the red-bearded man's surprised voice came from afar."Who are you? Where are the second young master and the others?"
         At this moment, Redbeard was indeed surprised!
         Who was this person?
         As for Li Hao, seeing that he was charging at him, he knew that there were three other rising light experts. Although they were only at the early or middle stage of the rising light realm ... He didn't have the time to deal with them.
         A powerhouse in the transformation stage, right?
         Li Hao gritted his teeth and activated the root.
         Redbeard wanted to kill this man first, but in the next moment, a look of fear appeared in his eyes. It was as if a towering tree had appeared in front of him!
         Countless branches of the giant tree shot towards him!
         Was it an illusion?
         Redbeard thought to himself as he roared and slashed at the tree with his saber!
         At this moment, a beam of light shot across the entire eastheart city!
         Under the shocked gazes of Xu Qing, Yu Jie, and the others, it was as if they had seen a huge tree. In an instant, the huge tree had thousands of branches and directly pierced through red beard and his three subordinates!
         His entire body was covered in holes!
         The red-bearded man was dumbfounded. His head was also instantly pierced through, leaving bloody holes. Li Hao, on the other hand, was also extremely shocked. Without thinking, he slashed out with his sword!
         With a plop, the head fell!
         The Black Panther also exploded in an instant and killed the others ... In fact, they were almost all dead.
         The giant tree had also disappeared after unleashing this attack.
         Only Li Hao and black Panther were left in the air.
         Li Hao picked up a few corpses!
         He looked into the distance and laughed madly,"Xu Qing, can you still recognize my voice?" Idiot! What Messenger of the demon race, you believed me and even took the initiative to give me the wind-chasing boots. Thank you for your generosity, Duke dingguo ... Your two sons, your grandson, your general, your general manager ... I'll kindly accept all of them! Oh right, and your Treasury ... Hahaha, thank you!"
         Xu Qing was instantly dumbfounded.  At this moment, the big golden dog in the air instantly turned into a big black dog."Woof, Woof, Woof!"
         The Black Panther cried out, looking extremely proud.
         "Li ... Li Hao ..."
         Xu Qing was stunned!
         Li Hao?
         Li Hao laughed."It's me. You actually believed that my dog was a demon from the Imperial Palace? you're so stupid!"
         As soon as he finished speaking, he broke through the air and left!
         The speed was extremely fast!
         Xu Qing was stunned. He was in a daze. I ... Was tricked?
         I ... I've been tricked!
         "Li Hao!"
         With a furious roar, there was only blood in his eyes.""Get lost!"
         Hong, a punch sent Yu Jie flying.
         "Chase after him and kill Li Hao! If I don't kill Li Hao, I'm not a human!"
         At this moment, he had gone completely crazy.
         My two sons, my Windchaser's boots, my treasure vault, my mirror divine weapon ...
         There was nothing left!
         At this moment, he had no time to care about Yu Jie and the others. He would kill them sooner or later, but Li Hao ... Had to stay!
         The heaven and earth general and several foreign ministers and sinecures charged over ...
         At this moment, their expressions kept changing.
         Li Hao!
         A huge scandal!
         What a joke!
         The Grand Duke dingguo, the Overlord of the East, had actually been tricked into coming to his house by Li Hao, who had given him a precious treasure and two of his legitimate sons ...
         Yu Chuo was also shocked when he saw that Duke dingguo did not care about them.
         Shocked, he looked in the direction that Li Hao had fled in and frowned.
         This Li Hao ... Was rather interesting.
         If he had made less noise, he might have been able to escape quietly. Of course, with red beard there, it wouldn't be good to make less noise. But if he had hidden his identity and not said that he was Li Hao, perhaps Duke dingguo wouldn't have been so crazy.
         It wasn't just because Li Hao had killed someone and stolen the treasure, but also because of the Li family's divine sword!
         His eyes flickered and he quickly said,"let's go!" Go back ... Everyone, be careful. However, this was also an opportunity. After this battle, Xu Qing had once again suffered heavy losses ... Most importantly, his reputation had been ruined. Who would believe that a piece of trash like him could lead the East to glory? Quickly, go back and spread the news to the world, no matter how big or small ... Xu Qing, just wait for the ridicule of the world!"
         He was no match for Xu Qing. If he continued to stay, he would only die.
         As for the weaklings in the high Duke's public house, he did not want to kill them as it was meaningless.
         As for saving Li Hao ... Forget it. He didn't want to die together with him. Besides, he had no reason to save him. If it weren't for Li Hao, they wouldn't have been nearly killed. It was already a good thing that they didn't cause trouble for Li Hao.
         With that, Yu Chuo soared into the sky and threw a punch. Flames soared into the sky, and the entire High Duke's public house was set on fire!
         In an instant, a loud voice resounded through the entire eastheart city."Duke of dingguo, Xu Qing, is extremely incompetent and hypocritical. He attempted to ambush and kill the administrative heads of the 21 eastern provinces, but devil sword Li Hao broke into his residence and killed the red-Bearded Bandit who colluded with Xu Qing ..."
         Yu Chuo and the others, who were adding insult to injury, shouted in the end,""Xu Qing has been killed by Li Hao. The high Duke's public house has been destroyed. Heaven and earth are celebrating!"
         After saying this, the experts quickly fled in all directions.
         Go back!
         He would only be safe if he returned to his own territory.
         As for the fact that Duke dingguo wasn't dead, he probably didn't have the time to refute the rumors. He was probably frantically chasing after li haozhong and didn't have the time to care about this place.
          As soon as the news was out, the entire eastheart city was shaken!
         In the city, countless spies had their mouths wide open!
         Their mouths were opened wider than eggs!
         Did we ... Hear wrong?
         Who was it?
         The demonic sword Li Hao?
         My God, what kind of fantasy is this? how is this possible?
         The Dominator of the East for two hundred years, the Duke dingguo's mansion, had been wiped out by Li Hao?
         The world ... Was going to be in complete turmoil.
         This wasn't a small figure. It was the big news that the Overlord of the four continents and the eastern continent had been flattened ... In an instant, countless communication jades were activated, and the news spread all over the world in the blink of an eye.
        
         It could be said that the East heart city had been turned upside down.
         People like Yu Jie were also overlords, so they naturally knew how to most effectively strike at Duke dingguo's prestige. In this era, half-true and half-false rumors were the most fatal!
         At this moment, the high Duke's public house was on fire. The fire was caused by the metamorphosis. Even if the servants of the high Duke's public house tried their best to put out the fire, they were helpless. They could only watch as the fire spread and covered the entire High Duke's public house in the blink of an eye.
         This move also proved that something had happened to Duke dingguo.
         Otherwise, a High Duke would be able to put out such a big fire, even though it was fierce. Most importantly, no one would dare to set fire in the high Duke's public house.
         "The high Duke has fallen?"
         "We're finished. Will there be a war?"
         "I don't think so? If the high Duke were to die ... Whoever came, wouldn't we still be commoners? We're not officials ... As long as it's not Pirates or mountain bandits ..."
         At this moment, the high Duke's public house was not really empty. Very quickly, some three suns powerhouses flew in all directions and quickly suppressed the turmoil. The dingguo Army outside the city also quickly moved out to prevent any surprise attacks from all sides.
         However, it was easy to create rumors, but difficult to refute them!
          Even though the people from the public house had spread the news that the high Duke was fine and that it was just a rebellion caused by the evildoers that had been quelled, not many people believed it.
         Preconceived notions prevailed, and everyone was more willing to believe Yu Jie's words.
         Otherwise, where was the high Duke?
         Why was the high Duke's public house burned?
         Did Redbeard really get killed?
         If he was really killed, it would be a cause for celebration for many people. As for whether red beard was colluding with the Duke, no one knew, but there were rumors, so they were willing to believe it.
         ……
         And at this moment, the news spread far and wide.
         Linjiang province.
         All the parties were still discussing how to mobilize their troops, how to attack the South, and how to lure Li Hao out ...
         Fan Chang revealed a smile.
         This time, with these people's help, he believed that Silver Moon would at least suffer some losses in order to vent the hatred in his heart!
         The Earthcover sword, the radiant sword, and Li Hao all deserved to die!
         Everyone was talking about the last matter of the day, the time to send out the Army ...
         All of a sudden, many people's communication jades vibrated.
         All of a sudden, many people looked at each other and quickly took out their communication jades. It was a big deal. Not just one or two people, but many people had received the news.
         Fan Chang had also received the information.
         He didn't want to watch it at first, but seeing that everyone was watching it, he took out his communication Jade and checked it.
         With one look ... Fan Chang instantly stiffened.
         Not only him.
         In an instant, the entire Hall became extremely quiet. There was no sign of life, as if it had become a Cemetery.
         A moment later, there was the sound of breathing.  "Impossible!"
         "Rumors!"
         "Nonsense, this is simply laughable!"
         “……”
         Some people angrily rebuked. This was impossible!
         There were also people who had ugly expressions. If it wasn't just one party's information, one party might be wrong, but many parties had sent out information at the same time. The people present were all experts from various major forces, so how could their information be wrong?
         After a long time, someone was so shocked that his throat became hoarse.""The demonic sword ... Has a Silver Moon ... When did that happen?"
         "A few days ago, he even appeared in Silver Moon. I heard that he's returned to Whitemoon city ..."
         It was unbelievable!
         Everyone was still discussing how to force him out.
         Now, he had come out.
         However, it was better not to appear.
         "The Duke dingguo's mansion has countless powerhouses, and red beard is a powerhouse in the transformation stage. It's said that the four generals of heaven, earth, black, and yellow are all powerhouses in the transformation stage. The Duke dingguo is also a top martial Master. The Xu family can suppress the 21 eastern provinces and make Yu Jie and the others unable to breathe ... How could they be defeated by Li Hao?"
         "There isn't too much information, so we can't make a judgment. They only said that the high Duke's public house was burned, but they didn't say that the high Duke Ding and the others must have died ..."
         “……”
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The crowd discussed animatedly, unable to hide their shock.
         The demonic sword Li Hao!
         That day, the weakest of the three Swords of the North Sea was the demonic sword Li Hao. Although he was also very powerful and killed a late-stage Sunglow, many people thought that he could be killed if they seized the opportunity.
         But now ... A basin of cold water had been poured on them, chilling their hearts.
         A ten thousand mile long-range raid!
         In their eyes, this was Li Hao's counterattack and warning. You want to kill me?
          Alright, I'll kill you guys first!
         The Duke dingguo's mansion was destined to fight to the death with him. He went to the Duke dingguo's mansion first and attacked first, directly launching an attack on the day of the other party's ritual.
         Fan Chang took a deep breath. His palm trembled slightly, but he quickly suppressed it and said in a deep voice,""Don't be impatient, the detailed information is not out yet. We still need to find out the specific information! I've seen Li Hao's strength. A few days ago, it was still very difficult for him to kill a late-stage Sunglow ... It's impossible for him to reach the level where he can kill a Sunglow in the blink of an eye. If that's the case, he's not a demonic sword, but a divine sword!"
         He didn't believe it!
         He also could not believe that Li Hao had reached such a level in just a few days that he could destroy a major force. It should be known that the high Duke's public house was much stronger than the Linjiang Prefecture.
         There were many people in the transformation stage under the Duke dingguo's command.
         It was even more powerful than the forces under the king of the plains.
         The Dominator of the East had been killed by Li Hao so easily?
         He didn't believe it!
         At this moment, everyone managed to calm down. After a long time, someone said,""Then, about the attack on the South ..."
        
         "Attack, my ass!"
         Someone cursed,"even Li Hao has run away. Are we supposed to fight Silver Moon and fight the martial masters there? Are there any benefits to it?"
         They were here for Li Hao, not to kill a Silver Moon elite.
         If they killed Li Hao, the divine sword would help them break through.
         What was the point of killing a Silver Moon Martial Master?
         For Li Hao's divine sword, they could still try, but they didn't want to fight the Silver Moon Martial Master.
         When fan Chang heard this, he cursed in his heart.
         As Silver moon's neighbor, he had hoped that these people would directly attack Silver Moon, but now, they were clearly not willing to do so. After all, their core member, Li Hao, had escaped. Wouldn't it be foolish to deal with Silver Moon now?
         Fan Chang sighed in his heart, but he also felt somewhat solemn.
         Was the Silver Moon really demonic land?
          Li Hao had actually travelled thousands of miles to attack the Duke dingguo's mansion. Although no one said anything, in fact, they were probably all panicking at this moment. If there was no news, some of them would probably have to return home!
         It was too terrifying!
         The high Duke's public house, which had been supported by many Metamorphoses and Sunglow, had been broken through. This was somewhat shocking. Even the top powerhouses of the nine divisions and the imperial family did not dare to say that they could break through the high Duke's public house.
         Everyone was waiting for the follow-up, waiting for the news to come.
         At this moment, the atmosphere in the main hall was a little restless. Cups of tea and wine quickly disappeared into everyone's stomach. The cold Linjiang was now a little hot.
         ……
         White moon City.
         Pfft!
         Kong Jie spurted out a mouthful of tea and was stunned.
         The next moment, he flew up into the sky.
         Not only him, at this moment, in the military camp far away, Huang Yu flew into the sky. Director Zhao didn't fly up, but he looked at the Wei Wu army base in the distance. He gritted his teeth and said,"Go and ask where Li Hao is!"
         Deputy Director Zhou didn't say anything and just disappeared.
         Where's Li Hao?
         Li Hao's divine boat was still in the Plaza, and Li Hao's demon hunt squad was still in closed-door training. It had only been three days, so no one took it seriously. It was the same every time Li Hao returned.
         But where was Li Hao now?
         Or was someone trying to create chaos by pretending to be Li Hao?
         Director Zhao thought to himself, but he felt that this was a joke!
         How was that possible?
         He was very clear about the strength of the Duke dingguo's mansion. The three generals were all in the transformation stage. It was said that red beard had also gone today, and he was also in the transformation stage. Even if the Duke dingguo himself was not unsealed, he could also be regarded as a transformation stage.
         There were a total of five powerhouses in the transformation stage and more than ten sunrise realm powerhouses.
         With such strength ... Even if silver Moon did not unseal himself, he might not necessarily win.
         But now, the news came that the Duke of dingguo had been killed!
         Who would believe that?
         In the distance, two powerhouses broke through the air!
          In the blink of an eye, he landed in the sky above the Wei Wu army base.  "Liu Long, Hao lianchuan, come out and see me!"
         Kong Jie shouted!
         In the hall far away, Liu Long was cultivating. He opened his eyes and frowned slightly before quickly walking out.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Secretary Kong!"
         He cupped his hands at the two men in the sky and called out to Huang Yu,""Commander Yu!"
         "Milords, how may I help you? The captain is currently cultivating in seclusion. If the two of you make too much noise, it'll easily cause the captain to make mistakes in his cultivation ..."
         Hao lianchuan also walked out and said,""It is! The two of you directly barged into the Wei Wu Army's camp, isn't that too much? Although the Marquis has left, the night patrolmen ..."
         "F * ck you!"
         Kong Jie cursed!
         Hao lianchuan was stunned. Kong Jie scolded,""Do you take me for an idiot? Was Li Hao still here? Do you really think I'm an idiot?"
         “……”
         Huang Yu didn't say anything.
         It was almost the same.
         It's better to stop struggling. We only found out about this when the news from the East spread. What are we if not idiots?
         Hao lianchuan was a little embarrassed. He coughed and said,""Why are you scolding people? Director Kong, this isn't good, what's the matter?"
         Had Li Hao's whereabouts been exposed?
         Hao lianchuan also knew that they had been in seclusion for three days to cover for Li Hao.
         Did Li Hao Do something?
         Kong Jie was on the verge of breaking down."What else? Li Hao had run away long ago, hadn't he? Did this guy run away as soon as he came back? Good Lord, he went to the eastern Duke dingguo's mansion and directly wreaked havoc there. He seized the wind chasing boots, killed a powerhouse in the transformation stage, and it was said that he even killed the Duke dingguo, exterminated his entire family, burned down the Duke dingguo's mansion ... Now, the entire dynasty was in turmoil! There are 21 provinces in the East. Once the Duke dingguo dies, I'm afraid there will soon be a drastic change in the East ..."
         Liu Long and the others felt as if they were listening to a heavenly book, and their mouths were agape.
         What?
         Are you talking about Li Hao or someone else?
         "Did Li Hao leave on the day he came back?"
          At this moment, Hao lianchuan did not dare to hide anything. He was extremely embarrassed as he whispered,""I ... I'm not too sure. Minister Li's whereabouts are unknown, and he wouldn't tell me ..."
         "Then shut up!"
         He looked at Liu Long, who slightly frowned and nodded,""The commander said he had something to do, so he went out first."
         Go to hell!
         This is called having something to do?
         Alright!
         These guys, each and every one of them actually kept it a secret.
         He was a little mad. Seeing the Wei Wu Army coming out from behind, he looked at one person and shouted,""Wang Chao, you came from the inspection Division. Now that Li Hao has left, you're helping to hide it. You won't even tell the inspection Division?"
         In the crowd, Wang Chao and the others were still in shock.
         Hearing Kong Jie's criticism, Wang Chao was at a loss.""Chief ... We don't know!"
        
         Did he really not know, or was he just pretending?
         Kong Jie wanted to vomit blood, but at this moment, she had nothing to say.
         He had only come here to confirm if Li Hao had really left. Now that he had confirmed it and really left, the one in the East was probably Li Hao.
         He snorted and turned to leave.
         ? Huang Yu did not say a word and quickly disappeared as well.
         Outside the Wei Wu army base, the radiant sword's eyes flickered. It quickly rose into the sky and followed behind Huang Yu. It did not ask any questions, but its face was filled with suspicion.
         Kong Jie was speechless!
         When I asked you to help me with something, you ignored me and said that you were waiting for Li Hao ... Now, you can just wait!
         He threw a communication Jade to her.
         He took the light sword and examined it. His expression changed instantly as he muttered,""How is that possible?"
          As the head butler of the high Duke's public house, she was well aware of the high Duke's public house's strength.
         Li Hao could not afford to offend any of the three generals, and the Duke himself was also extremely powerful. Even she was no match for him. If she had not unsealed her combat strength, she would not have been able to defeat the Duke of ding last time.
         But now ... She frowned slightly."The news may not be true. It's not so easy to kill the Duke dingguo. If he's forced, he will unseal his combat power. In today's world, there are only a few who can kill him."
         This was impossible!
         Kong Jie and the others nodded, but she still said,""Even if he didn't kill that fellow, something must have happened. Otherwise, it's impossible for no one to care about the high Duke's public house being burned down. If the Duke dingguo didn't die, and Li Hao didn't die ... That means the people of the Duke dingguo's mansion went after him. Otherwise, they wouldn't have ignored the turmoil!"
         This matter, if one carefully guessed, one could still make a deduction.
         If that was the case ... Li Hao would be in danger.
         How could this madman think of finding trouble with the Duke dingguo?
         The light sword did not speak and quickly disappeared from its original spot.
         "Where are you going?"
         Swords gate!
         “……”
         Kong Jie was speechless. It seemed like he had gone to find Hong Yitang.
         Was he preparing to rescue them?
         He looked at Huang Yu, who said in a low voice,""Let's go find old Zhao first. If Li Hao isn't dead, he's probably being hunted down now, but ... He's too far! Moreover, this time is different from last time. Last time, it was only his son who led the team to hunt down the light sword. This time, Xu Qing probably personally participated in the hunt ... We may not be able to catch up. "
         He might not be able to leave.
         They all knew that a large number of experts had gathered near Linjiang.  Also, the White shark Pirates, the Starlight Pirates and the other Pirates were also getting restless. They might not be able to leave.
         Kong Jie took a deep breath."Let's wait for the detailed information first. It should be soon. There's not just one person in the high Duke's public house today, but many. It's impossible for all of them to be dead. We'll have detailed information soon ... But we have to think of a way ... Li Hao's situation might be very dangerous!"
         Huang Yu nodded.
         This was inevitable.
         Then, Kong Jie laughed bitterly, old Huang, this Li Hao...Is even more troublesome than his master! Even his master wouldn't dare to do such a thing, directly attacking and killing a High Duke. In the 200 years since the star dynasty was founded, I don't think anyone has ever dared to attack the three high Duke's public houses!"
         This was the first time!
         He was extremely bold. If Li Hao survived this attack ... Yuan Shuo would no longer be able to compare to his reputation.
         No matter how famous Yuan Shuo was, would he dare to attack the high Duke's public house?
         Yuan Shuo was very famous in Silver Moon martial forest, but only a few older martial masters in the world still remembered him. As for Li Hao, his actions this time would probably be remembered by all the superpowers in the world, and even the common people.
         The eastern Overlord had been beaten up by him!
         ……
         At this moment, all the places were in a heated discussion.
         Stellarsky city, Nightwalker's headquarters.
         Hou Xiaochen had been worried that the world would try to kill Li Hao, but now, he sighed. The world should be the one having a headache. If Li Hao was still alive, they wouldn't be able to sleep.
         In a small office, several powerhouses from Silver Moon were waiting for further news.
         Soon, they all looked at their vibrating communication jades.
          Hou Xiaochen quickly picked it up and examined it. After a long time, he let out a breath,"It wasn't a direct attack. This guy took the dog and hid in the dog's stomach, pretending to be a great demon of Mount kui, a descendant of an ancient demon. He tricked the Duke of dingguo into giving him the wind-chasing boots. He even used the ancient demon of Mount kui to intimidate everyone in front of the powerhouses of the 21 provinces. In the end, Li Hao directed and acted on his own, triggering a conflict between Yu Jie and Xu Qing. After that, he killed Xu Xing, general Huang, and the others, and seized Xu Qing's treasure house. I don't know what method he used ... It seems extremely special. He killed Redbeard and his three Sunglow experts ..."
         "Now, the Duke of dingguo is chasing him with general heaven and earth!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com When he said that, Yu Luosha first heaved a sigh of relief, but then she became serious.""So, he did kill a cultivator in the transformation stage ... Even if he used some external means?"
         "Yes,"
         "Does he still have more of such methods?"
         Hou Xiaochen chuckled. If I knew, I would be a God.
         "Xu Qing isn't weak ..." Chief Steward Yu said with a heavy tone.
         "He is very strong!"
         Hou Xiaochen's smile disappeared,"even I don't dare to say that I can beat him. That guy might be on the same level as the king of the plains. He's very strong!" Moreover, he brought two powerhouses in the transformation stage and many sunguangs to hunt Li Hao down. He did it for revenge, for the Li family's divine sword, and for the complete Windchaser's boots!"
         "With two divine weapons in hand, Xu Qing will kill Li Hao even if he has to unseal himself!"
        
         At this point, he exhaled."Xiaoyu ... You go! Be careful and go find Li Hao. Hurry ..."
         "Minister ..."
         "You can unseal it, but the Golden spear can 't!"
         At the thought of this, he frowned,"no, how about this, you go to sky sword Mountain! If skysword is still in seclusion, just tell him to come out and say that I'm looking for his help. Demonic sword Li Hao ... No one will question him if he says that he's using the eighth sword of Silvermoon! Get Tian Jian to save them personally. Hurry up!"
         "I know!"
         Yu Luosha knew that this was because the Minister felt that she might not be able to save him.
         "But Li Hao ... Can he wait until then?" she asked nervously.
         No matter how fast they were, they wouldn't be able to make it there so quickly.
         "I'll do my best and leave it to fate ... That kid can't be so reckless without any confidence. He might be able to use the Windchaser's boots since he took them away. In this case, his speed might be very fast ... The other party might not be able to catch up with him in a short time!"
         He then continued solemnly,"what I'm afraid of is ... Li Hao being hunted down. If he's not in Silver Moon, he'll attract the attention of countless experts from all over the world. He was a target to begin with, and he's even more so now!" Who wouldn't want to kill him when he has two divine weapons?"
          Yu Luosha didn't say anything else and left quickly.
         He was going to ask Tian Jian for help!
         As for hou Xiaochen, he took a deep breath and looked at Jin gun,"Time to get things done!"
         "What?"
         "Li Hao's name is already known throughout the world," hou Xiaochen said in a deep voice,"how can we, the older generation, be any worse than him? At the same time ... He would throw stellarsky city into chaos so that no one would have the time to find trouble ... He would bring the Wei Wu Army and eliminate the hidden members of the three large organizations in stellarsky city from today onwards! That's right, let the night patrolmen assist in the investigation and send letters to those young people. As a member of the night patrolmen, the Heavenly Star military governor is now recruiting them to work. If you're afraid of offending people, you don't need to come back!"
         Jin Jin's expression changed slightly, and he quickly nodded."Understood!"
         The Minister was about to take action.
         Hou Xiaochen waited for Li Hao to leave, then looked to the East and frowned again ... Li Hao is a madman!
         Although he knew that the Duke dingguo's mansion would definitely not let him go, it was too crazy to kill his way to the East.
         Who was the last person to be so crazy?
         He thought for a while, but he couldn't think of anyone who would be so crazy. Even Yuan Shuo wasn't as reckless as Li Hao.
         ……
         At this moment, the whole world was paying attention.
         Soon, the real information was also spread. Some people ridiculed him, while others were shocked.
         "Xu Qing is an idiot!"
         "I was actually tricked by a little kid!"
         "However, we can't underestimate that demonic sword. It's extremely audacious. Under such circumstances, it actually dared to step out of the Silver Moon and take the initiative to attack. In addition, no one can tell what method he used to kill red beard, but it's likely an ancient civilization method. This brat might have obtained some killing technique in heaven battling city, so we can't be careless!"
         "He's even more torturous than his master, and even more ruthless! It would be strange if Xu Qing didn't go crazy after killing his two sons. Of course, more importantly, he now has two divine weapons ... In addition, he also has the Xu family's treasure vault!"
          In an instant, many people thought of something.  On this day, all the large organizations, and even some of the provincial overlords, had secretly sent people to the East.
         Li Hao was being chased by Xu Qing and his men!
         Divine weapons, treasures, and it was said that there was even the spring of life.
         The name of the demonic sword was etched deeply in their minds at this moment. Everyone realized that this guy was crazy, bold, and had many tricks up his sleeve.
         Although he ridiculed Xu Qing, he was actually thinking that Xu Qing's deception had something to do with the ancient demon. The demon that Li Hao had brought might really have the bloodline of the ancient demon. It was said that he was brought out of heaven battling city.
         Could it be that ... That monster dog was a descendant of the ancient monsters of heaven battling city?
         In this case, Li Hao didn't actually lie to him.
         That was indeed an ancient demon, and it had a powerful background, which was heaven battling city.
         ……
         The news quickly spread.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com In the central region, in a remote forest.
         Somewhere underground, the ground suddenly loosened, and a head popped out. Yuan Shuo shook his head and looked at the sky outside. He smiled happily,""Damn it, I'm finally out. It took me more than ten days!"
         It had been more than ten days since they entered the ruins.
         He had almost died inside.
         Fortunately, it went smoothly.
         At this moment, Yuan Shuo was in a good mood.
         Naturally, there were many benefits.
          "It's a pity that the monster plant died and didn't leave much of the spring of life behind. Otherwise ... That's good too. Fortunately, it's dead. If it was alive, I might not be able to fight it."
         He came out of the ground. Behind him, the Jade light sword seemed to have obtained many benefits as well, and it was also smiling brightly at this moment.
         Yuan Shuo was still very supportive.
         This time, he had dug a hole in the ground and excavated the ruins. Although there were many traps, he had gained quite a lot. In just ten days, Jade lightsaber felt that his strength had increased by a large margin.
         Comfortable!
         Yuan Shuo's smile was incomparably radiant."Finally, no one will say that a master is inferior to a disciple. That brat only killed the White shark Pirates 'commander, and it might not even be him. I've now combined four forces, and the fifth force is almost there ... Let's go. We'll find a mid to late-stage sunguang to test it out. If it's easy to kill, then we'll go find a peak-stage sunguang to play with!"
         Old Yuan was extremely arrogant at the moment.
         "It's only been a little more than ten days, less than twenty days in total. No matter how powerful my disciple is, no matter how many swords he has, it's impossible for him to make such a huge improvement so quickly.
         A master inferior to a disciple?
         I'm about to completely merge my five powers. Once I succeed, even if I'm still in the spiritual accumulation stage, I won't be a match for ordinary sunrise.
        
         He was in an extremely good mood!
         This time, the excavation of the ruins was not in vain.
         "Check your communication Jade and see if there's any news ..." Jade lightsaber reminded them from behind.
         "I've lost it!"
         Yuan Shuo rolled his eyes and said,"it's not mine. It's someone else 's. Why would I bring it with me when I dig a grave?" Wouldn't that mean he was being located? Biguang, clear your mind. "
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Besides, what could have happened in such a short time?"
         Even so, he still wanted to find someone to ask if there was anything going on recently.
         "Let's go. I remember there's a stronghold in front. It's the flying Pavilion of the assassins. Let's go and get some information ..."
         He took the Jade light sword and was just about to move when he suddenly looked up at the sky and saw a figure flash by.
         He was just about to take a closer look when another figure came through the air.
          He was a little wary. Looking for me?
         Was he located?
         I didn't bring my communication Jade.
         Just as he was thinking about it, another figure broke through the sky at an extremely fast speed. None of them were weak. These people seemed to be running towards the east. Each of them flew in the sky and burrowed into the ground, not caring about their energy consumption, as if they were in a hurry.
         Yuan Shuo was a little suspicious. What's wrong?
         Did something big happen?
         He scouted the area and saw another expert flying over from the distance at an extremely fast speed. Yuan Shuo's eyes flickered as he leaped up and soared into the sky!
         In an instant, he appeared in front of the man.
         Opposite him, a middle-aged man quickly stopped, his face full of vigilance. When he saw the other party's appearance, his expression changed!
         He turned around and was about to escape!
         Yuan Shuo threw a punch and said with a smile,""Old acquaintance, hahaha, aren't you that ... That person? I remember seeing you more than 20 years ago. Which province are you from? your father seems to be a high-ranking official in that province, right?"
         The man's expression changed slightly. When he felt the threat behind him, he quickly stopped and turned around, saying in a hurry,""Brother Yuan, I'm just passing by. I didn't see anything. I'm also a night patrolman now and the head of the night patrolman branch. I'm not from the three major organizations ..."
         Yuan Shuo chuckled and said,"a Night Watcher?" Forget it, I can't be bothered with you! Give me your communication Jade! Oh right, I just saw a lot of people flying by, all in a hurry. Pick up the money? You too, tell me, what are you going to do?"
         The middle-aged man's expression changed slightly and he whispered,""Brother Yuan doesn't know?"
         "Nonsense, why would I ask you if I already knew?"
         "What?" the middle-aged man took a deep breath."This matter has something to do with brother Yuan. The demonic sword is in trouble!"
         Demonic sword!
         Yuan Shuo was startled. What demonic sword ... Li Hao?
         However, Li Hao was Li Hao. He wasn't used to people calling Li Hao "demonic sword." Calling him by his title meant that his title had been acknowledged by everyone. Ordinary martial masters didn't receive such treatment.
         Especially in this era, it was too difficult to make a name for yourself!
          Was it the result of Li Hao killing the white shark Pirates?  "The White shark Pirates went to take revenge on him?"
         The middle-aged man was a little stiff. He glanced at Yuan Shuo. You're ... So out of touch with the news!
         White shark Pirates? that was a long time ago. Now, white sharks might not even dare to look for trouble with Li Hao.
         "No, it's the Duke dingguo!"
         "Oh, you killed Xu Feng, right?"
         Yuan Shuo had guessed it and sighed,""I knew it, the news can't be hidden for long ..."
         He then glanced at his communication Jade.
         He was a little distracted.
         After a long time, he looked at the middle-aged man and narrowed his eyes."This is the news from today?"
         "Yes!"
         "Why did he go to the Duke dingguo's mansion? It says that he originally had a pair of wind-chasing boots ..."
         "Brother Yuan, please continue scrolling. There's another big piece of news a few days ago!" The middle-aged man said hurriedly.
         Yuan Shuo quickly flipped through it.
         After a while, he laughed."He killed the eldest son of the Duke of dingguo a few days ago ... He's good! If I didn't know that I've only been in closed-door cultivation for ten days, I would have thought that I've been in closed-door cultivation for more than ten years!"
         "So, now that Xu Qing is chasing him with his men, why are you running to the East?"
         "I ... I'm just going to gather some information. If possible, I'll try to save the demonic sword. After all, he's brother Yuan's disciple ..." The middle-aged man was a little nervous.
         "Am I stupid or are you stupid?"
         The middle-aged man was terrified."No... I'm just ... Big brother, you've seen it too. I'm only at the early stage of the rising light realm. I wouldn't dare to have any ill intentions. I'm just going to take a look ..."
         Yuan Shuo laughed and thought for a moment before saying,""Forget it, I'm not a murderer! There are too many people going, so it doesn't matter if you go or not ... But don't leak any news about me. Tell me, I remember you ... Oh right, what's your name again?"
          The middle-aged man was speechless and his eyes rolled around.
         "Don't lie to me." Yuan Shuo laughed."I remember fighting with you back then. Although I don't remember your name now, I can find out once I check ... I'm a kind person, but my disciple is cruel and merciless! If he's not dead, I'll send him to find you, what do you think?"
         "My name is Zhou Long!" The middle-aged man's expression changed and he hurriedly said.
         "Yes, yes, yes, I think that's it. Your father seems to be an assistant in the administration department ..."
         "I'm the head of the administration department now,"the man said carefully.
         "Ah?"
         "He's not dead yet?"Yuan Shuo was stunned.
         The man remained silent.
         "Alright, it's good that you have a background. I'm just afraid that if you don't have a background, you won't be able to find it ... Alright, go and do your work!"
         Yuan Shuo chuckled."Let me use your communication Jade. Don't report it and lose it. Otherwise, I won't be able to receive any news. I'll go to your house to see you when I have time!"
        
         The middle-aged man was embarrassed.
         Yuan Shuo chuckled and quickly disappeared without saying anything.
         "Big brother Yuan, the East is dangerous. It's better if we don't take the risk. The demonic sword has caused too much trouble this time!" The middle-aged man could not help but say.
         Yuan Shuo seemed to have thought of something. He looked up and suddenly laughed,""I remember now. When I fought you, you were defeated by me, and then you hugged my leg and kept begging for mercy ... Right?"
         The middle-aged man's face immediately turned red!
         "No wonder I have an impression of you. I've defeated so many people, it's impossible for me to remember all of them ... You're that cowardly fellow ... That's good, I've completely remembered you this time!"
         Yuan Shuo laughed."You're a person with a strong desire to live. Very good. Don't say that you saw me!" Do you understand?"
         With that, Yuan Shuo landed on the ground and looked at the Azure light sword,""I'm going to the East. You can have fun by yourself."
         Wu Hongjun looked at him and frowned slightly,""What happened?"
         "That's right, an unfilial disciple who causes Trouble Every Day. I originally thought that I was the biggest troublemaker, but it turns out ... I was wrong!"
          Yuan Shuo laughed, but he was calm. He looked at Wu Hongji and said,""You're too weak. Although your progress isn't slow and you might be able to fight against an ordinary early stage rising light realm cultivator ... You're still too weak! You can go and play with the three major organizations. Just be careful ..."
         "How about you?"
         "I'm going to find my unfilial disciple!"
         Yuan Shuo laughed,"otherwise, everyone would think that I'm dead!" That B * stard Hong Yitang actually wants to replace me. It wasn't easy for me to cultivate such an awesome disciple, but he actually wants to snatch her away ... If he still doesn't appear, everyone will think that Li Hao doesn't have a master!"
         "Give me all the divine power stones and the spring of life you have!"
         Wu Hongjun didn't say anything and handed him a storage ring.
         Previously, Yuan Shuo had given her some, saying that there were benefits to be shared.
         At this moment, they were all taken back.
         Clearly, he felt that the current situation was not enough. He needed to quickly become stronger.
         Even stronger than now!
         After Yuan Shuo received the storage ring, he didn't say much. He waved his hand and said,""Be careful. You can wait for me at Heavenly Star City, or you can walk on your own!"
         "When are you coming back?"
         "I don't know,"
         Yuan Shuo chuckled. Like a flying bird, he quickly disappeared from his original spot. In the blink of an eye, he had disappeared without a trace. His speed was extremely fast.
         Wu Hongjun looked at it for a while, then turned and disappeared.
         'I'm too weak ...
         These words were too hurtful.
         The Jade light sword, one of the Seven Swords of the Silvermoon, was now disdained. Without even asking, it was decided not to bring him along. It was obvious that he felt that he would only drag them down.
         Wu Hongjun quickly shuttled back and forth and disappeared. Then he shouldn't be so weak!
         If the boundary was broken, then he would bravely move forward!
         ……
         In the distance, Yuan Shuo was flying faster and faster!
         As he flew, he suddenly gritted his teeth!
         After swallowing all the life essence in his hand, his qi and blood boiled, and his five internal organs shook.
         "They all thought I was dead!"
         One by one, he killed and captured as he wished.
         What was he doing?
         Is it that I, Yuan Shuo, can't lift my blade anymore, or are your heads harder?
         Xu Qing ...
         Xu Qing!
         Thirty years ago, they had fought once. Xu Qing was not weak, and he must be stronger now. But that year, if he was not a member of the Xu family, he would have been beheaded as well!
         A burst of anger rose up!
         Stupa mountain, the three great organizations, the Xu estate ... All of these people who couldn't be dealt with in the past were now floating on air.  And the king of the plains ...
         Although I've fallen behind by a few years, I'm not as weak as you think.
         His speed was getting faster and faster ... The East was very far.
         He didn't know if he could catch up ... But it didn't matter. Li Hao was dead, so he would just slaughter the Xu family to avenge him. One by one, the old ones came after the young ones. It seemed that he, an old one, wasn't strong enough.
         ……
         The entire place was shaken.
         At this moment, Li Hao was gasping for breath.
         He swallowed a drop of the spring of life and recovered some of his injuries. His inner strength burst out again, and his wind chasing boots instantly burst out. He shuttled through the air, and in the blink of an eye, he shook off the pursuers behind him again!
         At this moment, there were only three people who could catch up to him.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Xu Qing, the two generals of heaven and earth.
         The three of them had been following behind him, and their speed was extremely fast.
         Xu Qing's expression was ice cold!
         At this moment, they did not say anything and simply continued their pursuit. They had already traveled hundreds of miles from the high Duke's public house to this place. They had long left East heart city. Li Hao was fast, but the three powerhouses at the metamorphosis stage were not slow.
         As for the other Sunglow, they were all left behind.
         At this moment, Xu Qing's legs were like whirlwinds. He wasn't flying like a superpower but gliding. Every time he glided, he would surpass two powerhouses in the transformation stage. With each movement of his legs, he would cross hundreds of meters.
         The distance between them had been maintained at about four to five thousand meters. However, every time Li Hao used up his internal energy, the other party would quickly catch up to him and maintain a constant speed.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, was much slower in terms of speed.
         Only with the help of the wind-chasing boots could he increase the distance between them again and again.
         In front, Li Hao panted for a while. At this moment, not only did he have to run, but he also had to run with the Black Panther. The Black Panther was very fast, but it was still a bit slower than a metahuman. At this moment, he was really riding on a dog!
         Li Hao didn't have the time to care about Black Panther. Black Panther simply grabbed his shoulder tightly, and under Li Hao's lead, they shuttled back and forth again and again.
         One in front and one behind, four people and one dog, all silent.
         No one made any big movements.
         Why did they attract so many people?
         Li Hao was afraid that he would be in danger if there were too many people.
         Xu Qing was afraid that if there were too many people, someone would try to take the opportunity!
         He had to kill Li Hao!
         If he didn't kill Li Hao, he wouldn't be able to wash away his shame. Of course, for an old politician like him, the most important thing was the enormous benefits. The two divine weapons, the divine sword of the Li family, might allow him to unseal his combat power without any fear.
         So at this moment, the four of them tacitly didn't say a word and just ran.
         Li Hao's eyes flashed with anxiety.
         This guy's speed was beyond imagination.
         If this continued, he might not be able to outlast him. Although his sword energy was constantly being replenished, activating the wind chasing boots would also consume divine intent. Once the divine intent was exhausted ... It would be difficult to escape!
         "Are we going to Mount kui?"
          Li Hao thought that going to Mount kui might bring the great snake a lot of trouble.
         Now that he had just cleared his name with the Python, wasn't it inappropriate to go to Mount kui again?
         However, if no one stopped these guys, he might not be able to escape.
         "The Silver Moon is too far away. Mount kui ... There's no need ..."
         As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Li Hao had already made a decision. The next moment, he changed his direction and ran West!
         That was where the East Sea was located.
         Xu Qing's expression changed slightly. Was Li Hao going to Donghai?
         He wanted to enter the sea?
         He quickly took out a communication Jade and sent a message that East Ocean and the continent were all his territories!
         Li Hao was dreaming if he thought he could run to the East!
        
         The four Seas surrounded the central continent. North, South, East, and West, the four Seas were all connected. There might be some tributaries in the middle, but the four Seas could all be connected together in the end, forming a ring that surrounded the central continent.
         Li Hao was running toward the east Ocean.
         The North Sea had eight great pirate groups, with the Starlight pirate group being the strongest.
         There were Pirates in the East Sea as well. Although they were not as rampant as the North Sea, there were still many in the East Sea. For example, Redbeard was one of the top Pirates. Most of these Pirates were actually reared by the overlords and tyrants!
         One point was to raise bandits for self-respect, one point was to plunder benefits, one point was to seal off the continent ...
         The reason why he chose to enter the sea was because the silver centipede could travel through the sea. It was easier to run than on land and was more concealed. On land, even if one were to escape into the forest, there was only one area. However, it was different in the sea. In the entire sea, one would have to look around to find a place to hide.
         As a Martial Master, as long as he escaped their sight, these people wouldn't be able to catch up to him.
         Li Hao made up his mind.
         Another factor was that there were powerful demons in the sea, some of which were not weak. Martial masters were fine, but once superpowers entered, they would be discovered very quickly. Li Hao and Xu Qing were fine, but the two transformation stage superpowers would be easily surrounded by the powerful demons once they entered the sea.
         Originally, he had wanted to use the Python to hold the other party back, but now that Li Hao remembered the favor, he chose to enter the sea.
          Sword energy crazily emerged.
         As he ran, Li Hao took out a treasure, the sky Golden Lotus.
         All eight petals were there.
         He directly tore off a piece and swallowed it into his stomach. A clear stream emerged and flowed towards his five internal organs, strengthening the five Forces.
         Behind him, Xu Qing's expression changed slightly as if he had sensed something. The next moment, he suddenly burst forward and crossed a thousand meters in an instant, quickly approaching Li Hao!
         Li Hao's qi and blood surged, and the blood Blade technique burst forth. His blood Qi poured into the wind chasing boots, and he instantly shot out, accelerating again!
         Xu Qing looked at Li Hao coldly as he fled, and said in a cold voice,""Li Hao, do you think you have the chance to wait for Silver moon's rescue like the radiant sword?"
         Li Hao did not say anything.
         There was no need to communicate.
         Xu Qing caught up with Li Hao again, and his tone became gentler.""As long as you return the Windchaser's boots to me, it's not impossible for us to clear up our previous grudges. When they met, a smile would erase all grudges. This was how the pugilistic world worked. You kill me, I kill you. I underestimated you. My son died, my grandson died ... That was because I was not as good as you. However, hatred can't last forever. Give me back my Windchaser's boots, and we'll go our separate ways. What do you think?"
         Li Hao still didn't speak.
         I'm not an idiot!
         I've given you the Windchaser's boots, do you think I can still live?
         He couldn't even escape!
         The next moment, Li Hao suddenly changed his direction and continued to run. Xu Qing's expression changed and he cursed.
         But Li Hao didn't care at all.
         An ambush?
         Find a top-tier Martial Master!
          In front, on a small hill, there was a ball of light that was like a big sun. Do you think I'm blind?  It seemed that Xu Qing knew that he was going to East Ocean, so he had arranged for people to intercept him in front. Even if he was only intercepted for a moment, Xu Qing and his men might catch up, surround Li Hao, and kill him!
         However, Xu Qing had underestimated Li Hao. His eyes were his greatest protection when he was escaping.
         Since a long time ago, he had relied on this pair of eyes to see the red shadow and escape several times.
         At the back, Xu Qing's expression was unsightly. He transmitted his voice to the two metamorphosing cultivators behind him,""This person might be a heavenly eye cultivator. He might be able to sense and see something."
         Heavenly eye cultivator!
         In fact, there were also such people in the Duke dingguo's mansion. There were such people in all places, but there were strong and weak ones. They had come in a hurry and could not bring them in time. Moreover, the other party was too weak, so they might not be able to see anything.
         Li Hao was still a Martial Master, so it was even harder to see him clearly.
         ……
         Li Hao panted heavily.
         He looked back. He had his sword to replenish his energy, and the two metamorphosing cultivators behind him also had mysterious energy and divine energy stones to replenish their energy, but they were not as fast as he was.
         But Xu Qing ... Li Hao was still a little shocked.
         This person was very strong!
         His internal strength had reached an extreme. Li Hao rarely saw him stop or stop to replenish his internal strength. This meant that his Qi, blood, and internal strength had reached an extreme.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Therefore, the consumption was not too great.
         If it was just a simple pursuit during the transformation stage, Li Hao had the wind chasing boots and the starry sky sword, so it would be difficult for the other party to catch up with him.
         However, a Martial Master, and an extremely powerful one at that ... This was what gave Li Hao a headache.
         ……
          Behind him, Xu Qing also frowned.
         "His inner strength is being consumed so quickly. If he can use the wind chasing boots, it will also consume a lot of inner strength. How can he continue to use it ..."
         As he thought about it, his eyes flickered.
         The Li family's divine sword!
         It must be so.
         The Li family's divine sword played a huge role in Li Hao's progress in such a short time. In fact, he had caught up with his opponent at the beginning and even hit him with a punch, but he had sensed that his opponent's five internal organs were extremely powerful.
         Therefore, Xu Qing's eyes were filled with greed.
         If he could obtain the divine sword and completely strengthen his five internal organs, then he, Xu Qing, might become the number one person in the world. He was already powerful, so how could he be a match for him when no one else could unseal the power?
         He took out his communication Jade again and sent a message.
         Not only that, but he also sent a voice transmission to the two generals,"go to the East Sea and wait there. This fellow may be beating around the bush, but his ultimate goal is either the East Sea or Mount kui! He must have some connection with the great snake of Mount kui ... But there's no need to worry about it now. He's trying his best to break away from the great snake, so he probably doesn't want to go to Mount kui ... You guys go to the East Sea first and quickly mobilize the Pirates of the East Sea to seal off the sea area!"
        
         "Duke, you ..."
         "It's fine!"
         The two generals pondered for a while and left quickly.
         They were well aware of the Duke's strength.
         Even though they were on the same level now, once their combat power was unsealed, even if they were at their peak, the light sword would still be killed. It was just that Xu Qing was not too willing to unseal it. Every time it was unsealed, it was a life-and-death struggle.
         To Xu Qing, it had not reached that stage yet.
         As for capturing and killing Li Hao, he couldn't guarantee that he would be able to use the Li family's divine sword immediately. If he could guarantee that he could use it and seal his internal organs, he could unseal them without any worries and catch up with Li Hao immediately.
         The two generals quickly left.
         In front of him, Li Hao saw it too. He turned around, and his expression changed.
         This Xu Qing ... Was really difficult to deal with.
          The two of them might have left to ambush him in the sea.
         Even though the ambush was ineffective Haiti it would be difficult for him to enter the sea once he blocked the entrance to the sea.
         "Xu Qing, you're really bold!"
         Li Hao finally spoke. In the howling wind, he laughed and said,""It seems that today is the day you die! If you keep chasing, be careful that the light sword and the earth overturning sword will join hands and invite you to drink tea!"
         Xu Qing's face was cold and indifferent,""Li Hao, if you think that the high Duke's public house's intelligence system is so poor ..."
         p "Not bad. How did I get in?"  “……”
         Xu Qing was speechless.
         At this moment, he no longer replied.
         Yes, it was quite bad.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He actually did not know that Li Hao had left Silver Moon. However, under normal circumstances, how could Li Hao have left at that time? if he had left, why would he come to the high Duke's public house? let alone Xu Qing, who in the world, other than Black Panther, could have thought of this?
         Seeing that Li Hao wasn't convinced, Xu Qing pondered for a while and said while chasing,""Li Hao, right now, I want to kill you only to solve the problem of your internal organs. You're seeking revenge from the Xu family because you're afraid that I'll take revenge on you first ... But to me, it's just two sons and one grandson who died. I have dozens of children and grandchildren, so it's not a big deal to lose a few!"
         "How about this, since you have the bloodline of the eight great families, you can agree to one condition of mine. I won't kill you, I won't even take revenge on you, I won't steal your treasures ... Instead, I will help you. What do you think?"
         "You think I'm an idiot?"
         "No, you don't understand!"
         "You have to understand that the eight great families were not necessarily the strongest existences even during the ancient civilization era!" Ancient kings, ancient emperors, and countless powerful beings during the ancient civilization!"
         "The rise of my Xu family, or rather, the rise of the families or forces in this era, is all related to the ancient remains. However, for many ancient remains, we are actually unable to open the core area, but the eight great families ... Might be able to!"
         "To everyone else, snatching your divine sword is only for them to enter the next stage. If there were other ways, why would they need to find you? The Xu family controls a relic, which is the key to the Xu family's rise!"  "The Windchaser's boots aren't much, even if it's one of the divine weapons of the eight great families. But from what I know, the Liu family wasn't too outstanding during the ancient civilization era, and the ruins I control are the true sites of the top experts ..."
         "If you're willing to explore a ruin for me like your master did, I can even protect you like hou Xiaochen did!" Xu Qing chuckled.
         "A relic?"
         Li Hao asked, but he ran even faster.
         Go to hell!
         "Right, ruins! It's an extremely important ruin, and it's not just the Silver Moon. During the ancient civilization of the eastern continent, there were also extremely powerful existences guarding it. The eight great Guardian families only guarded a single gateway to that mysterious place ... That doesn't mean that the eight great families are the strongest!"
         "The ruins controlled by the Xu family have been developed for hundreds of years, but they still haven't been fully developed. That city is called Saturn! As long as you help me excavate this ancient ruin ... I, Xu Qing, will not lie. Not only will I not hold you responsible for killing my descendants, but I will also help you take revenge!"
         Xu Qing was very serious.
         In fact, this was what he was really thinking at the moment. When Li Hao could use the wind-chasing boots, the starry sky sword, and even a heavenly eye cultivator or a descendant of an ancient demon ...
         At this moment, he really had such a thought.
         Help him to explore the remains!
         Wasn't an extremely powerful ancient city stronger than Li Hao's divine sword?
         The eight great families weren't the strongest during the ancient civilization era. It could only be said that the eight great families had a great responsibility, and the star suppression city under the control of the Xu family, according to some rumors, had once been the home of an invincible master!
         Even the ancient king might not be able to match him.
         Of course, it was just an ancient book, and it was hard to tell if it was real or fake. However, Xu Qing knew that there must be a Supreme treasure in that place.
         ……
         In front.
          Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. Saturn!
         Could it be that Xu Qing's two sons, Xu Zhen and Xu Xing, were also related to the remains?
         It was inevitable that the Xu family had control of the remains.
         Otherwise, where did those broken air armors come from?
         Where did those divine power stones come from?
         However, from the looks of it, the ruins controlled by the Xu family were probably not weak. Even now, the Xu family had not finished exploring them. It must be known that the Xu family had many transformation stages.
         Was it another place similar to heaven battling city?
         Of course, Li Hao wasn't interested. He didn't even have the time or strength to explore heaven battling city, let alone the ruins in the eastern continent.
         "Really?"
         Even though he was uninterested, Li Hao still expressed his interest.""I don't believe what you say. If you're really sincere ... If you help me kill Ying Hongyue, I'll help you explore the ruins ... Even if you kill me in the middle, I won't feel like I've lost anything."
