Thirdly, Li Hao cultivated sword Dao, but there was no special power of great DAOs here. Under normal circumstances, the cultivators in the Dao universe actually had the lingering charm of great DAOs. For example, the red moon cultivator had the power of the red moon.At first glance, Li Hao looked like an unaffiliated cultivator without any background. He was not a cultivator from the great world.Since that was the case ... It was normal for him to say a few words when he was in a bad mood.Of course, the most important thing was ... Perhaps this person felt disgusted, but Li Hao's swordsmanship was actually very similar to that of venerable sword. After dispelling the power of time, his swordsmanship was not much different from that of venerable sword.The world of Yunyang ... There wouldn't be too many venerable sovereigns in a medium-level world.The world Lord had been killed, so the medium world was probably done for. This was a refugee.This thought emerged in his mind, and then he thought that this guy's boss had been killed by the sword venerable ... Obviously, he was an enemy of new martial. Of course, if he was an enemy of new martial, he was also an enemy of himself.He didn't have many friends, but he had a lot of enemies.Neo martial really could provoke the opponent.Fellow Daoist, there are countless sword cultivators in the world ... You can't bear a grudge against all sword cultivators just because your world was destroyed by them, right?"Li Hao said sincerely,"besides, as a venerable sovereign, it's not a good thing to bully the weak and fear the strong. The neo martial Swordmaster destroyed your world. If you want revenge, you can go to him. Why involve the innocent?" "I'm also a venerable sovereign ... And I've never provoked fellow Daoist. I've only come here to gain some enlightenment, and I have no other intentions! Helping each other is the way to survive for venerable sovereigns, why should we get into trouble?"These words were reasonable and well-founded.However, at this moment, the other two venerable sovereigns glanced at Li Hao again. Although Li Hao's words were reasonable and well-founded, why did he feel a little irritated?The two of them also knew a little about the destruction of the Yunyang world.To mention venerable the sword here, and a first-rank swordsman at that ... Was there going to be a good show?Li Hao's body contained sword intent and deathly aura. In fact, he was not on the same path as the neo martial Swordmaster. Why should he bring up the neo martial Swordmaster and cause trouble for himself?Although they were both first stage venerable sovereigns, there was a third stage venerable sovereign behind the other party.Under normal circumstances, a 3rd rank would be considered a top-notch expert.At Tier 4, they would almost not run around.Middle stage venerable sovereigns would either become Masters of a region or make friends in higher level places. These Taoist connotation places were not suitable for them to live in.The face of the Yunyang world's venerable sovereign turned cold.He had targeted Li Hao ... Not because he was deliberately looking for trouble. He just felt that this person's sword intent was extremely uncomfortable. When Yunyang city was destroyed, he had actually been nearby. However, when the Supreme Sword killed the master of Yunyang city, he had directly destroyed the world and ignored the people around him.Thus, he survived.However, he remembered the sword intent of venerable the sword. When he saw Li Hao, he suddenly felt extremely disgusted, as if he could smell the scent of venerable the sword. Although this person seemed to be full of death energy and didn't seem to be that way. Moreover, the new martial Swordmaster did not have any inheritors of the way of the sword, nor did he have a disciple of a sword principle venerable sovereign ...However, he couldn't hold back and deliberately provoked her with a few words.In the end, this person in front of him clearly knew the situation ... Yet he still dared to provoke him like this.Although Yunyang had been exterminated, Yunyang still had a third stage venerable sovereign.Other than a few domain Lords, Tian Fang was already at the peak of Level 3.He glanced at Li Hao coldly and said,""I don't usually stir up trouble, but you ... I suspect you're a spy from the yin-yang world!"  Best novel online free at ùöó0ùöüùöéùöïùöãùöíùöó  The two venerable sovereigns looked at Li Hao.The giant pincers were stunned and looked at Li Hao.Li Hao was also stunned. I'm a Scout for neo martial arts?Speaking of which ... It could also be counted this way, right?He was stunned for a moment before he laughed,'I ... A spy from the yin-yang world? Fellow Daoist, are you really going to cause me trouble? [I'm new here, so I must be careful. I'm afraid that I'll do something wrong and cause trouble ... I don't dare to talk nonsense!] The yin-yang world is at war with the Crimson Moon world. That's a place where eighth rank venerable sovereigns are guarding. Are you trying to kill me by saying this? You and I have just met, how can you be so vicious?""I don't want to cause any trouble for no reason," Li Hao said."You have a third level venerable sovereign, and I can't afford to offend him ... Now that you've suddenly called me a yin-yang spy, I really ... Have nothing to say!"The others didn't take it seriously. They just felt that this newcomer was bold.At this moment, he was still trying to provoke the other party."I really don't intend to be enemies with anyone. Since you don't welcome me, I'll just find another place ..." Li Hao said helplessly.However, Supreme Emperor Yunyang looked at him coldly. "I'm just saying. You're in a hurry to leave because you're afraid? Or was I right? The sword intent on your body ... It makes me feel like a bastard! It's fine if you're just trying to reason with me, but you're taking the initiative to retreat. I'm even more suspicious now!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao felt helpless. This person was really hard to please. He didn't know whether to leave or not.He was already a venerable sovereign, why was he still so childish?I know why Yunyang was destroyed.With you venerable sovereigns here ... It's not normal for them to not be annihilated.'He's out and about. He doesn't even have his own backing, yet he's still causing trouble. He's not low-key at all. Look at me, when did I say that I've seen several seventh level venerable sovereigns in neo martial arts and that I'm still half a family member?'

2601 Chapter 432
I've never said that, right?Li Hao felt a headache and helplessness."I really don't want to cause trouble ... How about this? it seems that you're using me as a punching bag. Since you've injured a venerable sovereign here, perhaps you can activate some of your Taoist connotation ... So, you want to give me a warning ..." He said.After some consideration, Li Hao said,"I'm a newcomer and don't know the rules here. Besides, this is a place of Taoist connotation, which is not suitable for breaking. If you really want to take it out on me ... This place is not far from the South realm gate. You and I can go out and fight. At most, I'll help you vent your anger and save some face."‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùEveryone was stunned.  Best novel online free at ùöó0ùöüùöéùöïùöãùöíùöó  Supreme Emperor Yunyang was also slightly stunned.Go out, one-on-one?This guy was so childish!He hated the house and its Crow, so he took the initiative to find fault with him. But this person actually invited him out to spar ... It was also strange.Was it confidence ... Or was it like what he said, giving him a beating outside and then everything would be over?At this moment, he was the one who was being held back!At this moment, the second level venerable sovereign who had been silent all this time suddenly took the initiative and chuckled,""Why do you need to seek the distance? why don't you two have a spar here? I'll be the middle man. Whether we win or lose, we'll write off the previous conflict. How about it?"If one of them was injured, he could get some venerable sovereign's blood essence to activate his Taoist connotation. That would be good.Just to watch the fun! Li Hao's head hurt."I'm really just here to take a look at the Taoist connotation ... I don't know how many people are staring at me while we fight here. It's not good to be strong or weak. As a venerable sovereign, I have to keep some trump cards ... Does this fellow Daoist of Yunyang want to expose his strength and trump cards in front of everyone?" Why don't we go out and have a simple exchange of pointers? either I beat you up, or you beat me up ... The grudges between us will be written off, and it will save us from trouble!""There's another bet ... If I win, you'll give me a drop of your blood essence. If you win, I'll give you a drop ..." Zhang xuan said with a smile.The heart of Yunyang's venerable sovereign moved slightly and he suddenly nodded."Good! However, we can't go too far. How about we stay near the South realm gate?""Sure ... I'm also afraid that if I go too far, your third level venerable sovereign Yunyang will find a place to ambush me!"Li Hao laughed, like a fledgling calf, not afraid at all.At this moment, he glanced at the venerable sovereign in front of him.It was a little strange ... And really ... Interesting.Since they had already reached the level of venerable sovereigns, shouldn't everyone be more open-minded and sit down to discuss Dao?How can you fight so casually?He had lost his dignity for no reason!Of course, I don't mind if the other party wants to find fault with me.Li Hao didn't waste time. He still had to come back to observe the place of the Taoist connotation. He quickly looked at the giant pincer and said,""Wait for me, I'll be back soon. It's nothing to be beaten up. Fellow Daoists, I hope you don't spread it ... To avoid embarrassment." Li Hao smiled."I'm still young. I don't care about these things. But ... I won't admit it when I come back!"The two venerable sovereigns were amused.The female venerable sovereign, who had been silent all this time, sized Li Hao up. He was indeed a young venerable sovereign. Interesting. She smiled and said,"Fellow Daoist, you can go. However ... Even if you are a venerable sovereign, it is not a good thing to lose a drop of blood essence. You are young and impetuous. Once you learn from your mistakes, you will understand in the future.""Thank you for your reminder, sister!"Li Hao's words were sweet, and the female venerable sovereign laughed again.The venerable sovereign of Yunyang snorted and left without saying anything.Li Hao also waved at them.""Giant pincer, give me a moment ..."As soon as he finished speaking, he also disappeared.After the two of them left, the second stage venerable sovereign chuckled,""Yu ancestor, what do you think?""It's just a small conflict!"The female venerable sovereign chuckled and said,'this newcomer is too young! This time, we'll definitely lose a drop of blood essence. Let's wait and see, maybe we can get some benefits. When they come back, let's see if they'll drop it directly into the Coiling Dragon Well. Maybe we'll get something. ""Difficult!"A rank two venerable sovereign shook his head slightly."A drop of rank one venerable sovereign's blood essence ... Is very difficult to stimulate anything. This place is no longer the same as before. Eight thousand years ago, a drop of blood essence could stimulate something. Now ... I think it's difficult to not have a rank three or four venerable sovereign's blood essence! However, at that level, who would waste a drop of blood essence to stimulate some insignificant Taoist connotation?"They didn't care too much about what was happening outside. They were both level one venerable sovereigns, and there might be some differences in their strength. Li Hao looked slightly weaker. After all, he looked too young and had just advanced.However, it was difficult to determine the victor among first level venerable sovereigns. It all depended on whether the newbie would keep his promise and give him a drop of blood essence. Otherwise ... He might even run away.Could it be that he really had to chase after them for a drop of blood essence? that would be a life-and-death situation.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Outside the gate of the southern realm.Li Hao quickly teleported away, and Yunyang's venerable sovereign quickly followed.Soon, he teleported a few times and was not too far away from the southern realm gate.Just as Supreme Emperor Yunyang was about to speak, Li Hao's eyes turned cold.The energy of life and death appeared, and in the blink of an eye, the sword exploded with dazzling light. The river of life and death fused with the sword, and the destructive power of the primal Chaos tribulation lightning also fused with it!"Haoyue!""Die!" With a light shout, he slashed out with his sword. Life and death reversed, and the world turned black and white.At that moment, Supreme Emperor Yunyang's expression changed drastically!

Chapter 2602 Fearless (1)_6
The Dao of life and death?In just an instant, his appearance seemed to have aged. As his expression changed wildly, a wave of scorching sun Power erupted. However, in just an instant, the scorching sun Power was extinguished and turned into death Qi!Suddenly, the venerable sovereign seemed to have experienced the five curses of heaven and man!In the blink of an eye, his skin began to loosen.His power began to decline!At the same time, Li Hao's vitality was sucked away. His sword even contained the power of Primal Chaos tribulation lightning!Crack!At this moment, a powerful venerable sovereign was turned into dust by the sword. The sun was destroyed and shattered!The long river engulfed everything in the blink of an eye.Li Hao's face was cold."A first stage venerable sovereign without a Dao universe ... A refugee from a medium-sized world. He's far inferior to the red moon sovereign. He's only on par with a rotten bone who lost the red moon great Dao!"Such an existence was too weak.Back when he was still a half-step sovereign, he was able to kill it!Now, he had officially advanced to venerable sovereign, and he was even a life and death venerable sovereign. He was definitely not weaker than any second stage venerable sovereign ... How could such a trash provoke me?If he wasn't afraid of causing trouble, Li Hao wouldn't be afraid even if the three venerable sovereigns attacked him together.Li Hao wasn't afraid of the third-level venerable sovereign behind him. The third-level venerable sovereign was definitely inferior to the third-level venerable sovereign of the red moon. Li Hao felt that he could even look down on a second-level venerable sovereign without a universe of DAOs.He shook his head slightly. As expected, without a Dao universe ... His own Dao was also a little messy. There was nothing to be afraid of!"I don't want to compare myself with these people, but with the powerhouses from the top macro worlds. I don't want to waste my time with these small fries. I'm going to observe the Dao. I'm not interested in wasting my time with small fries.However, killing a venerable sovereign would bring him some benefits ... It wasn't a bad idea to keep it for now.Li Hao smiled and instantly disappeared.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The Coiling Dragon Well.Li Hao really came back very quickly. He was a little unlucky."As soon as I went out, that guy disappeared. I waited for a while, but I don't know where he went. Could he have gone in the wrong direction with me? Forget it, I'm too lazy to wait!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe two venerable sovereigns were stunned and laughed.He didn't think too much about it. It was too fast. Li Hao's clothes weren't even wrinkled. He obviously hadn't fought.However, the two of them were wondering if this guy didn't go out at all.  Best novel online free at ùöó0ùöüùöéùöïùöãùöíùöó  He's deliberately swaying that person!Or, as soon as he went out, this guy ran back, leaving that person waiting.If that was the case ... This little fellow was a little sly!"If you want to comprehend it, you should observe it as soon as possible. You should leave as soon as possible, in case that person comes back and won't let you go!" The Empress smiled.Li Hao laughed,"he's lost, right?" How could he return so quickly! I think he won't be back for a while, but thank you for your reminder, sister. I'll just take a look. If there's nothing, I'll leave soon!"The two venerable sovereigns didn't say anything more.As for Li Hao, he didn't talk much. He sat down cross-legged and was surrounded by a deathly aura. In the deathly aura, a subtle light appeared, and outsiders couldn't detect it.A faint time power appeared. Time backtrack!At this moment, tribulation lightning could be vaguely seen in the outside world, but it was very weak. Li Hao's power of time was also very weak. Although dark clouds had gathered, they didn't seem to be able to lock onto anything for the time being.It was this faint dark cloud that attracted the attention of some powerhouses.Very quickly, monastery master Hui long was in the air.He looked out of the macro world and frowned. He looked at the sky and mumbled,""Tribulation clouds? Primal Chaos lightning tribulation? A tribulation cloud that has yet to take form ..."He turned his head to look at the great world and fell into deep thought.Why did such a change suddenly occur?Could it be ...There was a hint of joy in his eyes.Could it be that ... An opportunity for the celestial world was about to appear? why else would the chaos lightning tribulation suddenly appear?If that was the case ...Thinking of this, he was a little excited.All of a sudden, he frowned and looked into the distance. There seemed to be some special traces. He flew up and checked. He frowned slightly."Did a venerable sovereign die?"That's strange!How could a venerable sovereign die Here?"Cultivators of the Dragon Temple, keep an eye on whether any venerable sovereigns have passed by or gone out recently ... Check if anyone has snuck into the area of the Dragon Temple. It seems that a venerable sovereign has just died ..."He suspected that it might be the work of the other three parties and that he was lacking some blood essence.How hateful! This place is the territory of the Dragon Temple.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.The giant pincer's expression changed drastically, and its heart trembled violently!At this moment, Li Hao's voice resounded in his mind.""Daoist giant pincer, do you have any news?"The giant pincer was extremely shocked!"If there's any news, you can let me know, so that Daoist giant pincer won't be in a difficult position."The giant pincer did not dare to say anything else. It held its breath and focused its mind. There was only endless horror in its heart!This person ... Who was he?Did a venerable sovereign just die?How was that possible?At this moment, he couldn't believe it.Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't care.'There will be some traces left after killing a venerable sovereign. I can't do anything about it. If I'm discovered ... So be it. What's the big deal? I'll run away after I'm done looking at these places!'I'm not afraid of anything!

Chapter 2603 Enlightenment, Deterrence (1)
Li Hao knew that he might have discovered something when he returned to the Dragon Temple.But ... I am not afraid!Would the giant pincers dare to speak of it?He didn't dare!Yes, he was certain that the other party would not dare to.As expected, the giant Pincher's face turned pale, but it didn't dare to say anything. It didn't even dare to spread the news that a venerable sovereign was gone.It was just that instant.He even suspected that the man in front of him was a powerful venerable sovereign who had hidden his strength.Otherwise ... Even though a first stage venerable sovereign was weak, it shouldn't have been gone in an instant, right?Li Hao, on the other hand, was in no mood to pay attention to him.Time backtrack!At this moment, a different scene appeared before his eyes. It was as if he had returned to the past.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In a huge Hall.A Daoist ... Or rather, a Daoist incarnated from a Dragon, was resting on a futon. Below him, countless cultivators and even demons were sitting cross-legged, all in high spirits, as if they were listening to the great Dao."The Dao of the fleshly body lies in the foundation ... The foundation of the fleshly body, the foundation of the Golden body. Strong blood, strong bones, strong flesh...This is the Dao of the fleshly body!""My tianfang world doesn't specialize in the physical body. The world Overlord specializes in the Dao of space. Tianfang world is unparalleled in space and can even cut through chaos ... It's extremely powerful. As for me, with my physical body ... Although I only have a rank seven body, ordinary rank eights will find it hard to break through my physical body ..."That Daoist was extremely powerful. Just by sitting cross-legged, he had the effect of suppressing the heaven and earth.At this moment, Li Hao possessed a person, who was also shocked!Rank 7 venerable sovereign!A corporeal venerable sovereign!This world, this place, there really were great opportunities and countless experts!What shocked Li Hao even more was that the master of Tian Fang cultivated the Dao of space. According to Li Hao's categorization, life and death, yin and yang, and space were the three top great DAOs.A spatial path master, and a rank-nine one at that ... That was simply unbelievable.While he was still in shock, the dragon clan's venerable sovereign suddenly seemed to have seen something. He looked at the person Li Hao had possessed and frowned. He seemed to have noticed something, but he didn't seem to see it.When he frowned, it was as if the world had collapsed.This was a seventh rank venerable sovereign!It was simply unimaginable how powerful an existence on the same level as the neo martial human King was!After frowning for a moment, he seemed to ignore Li Hao and continued,""Virtually every major world and chaosverse has the Dao of the fleshly body! It's the most ordinary of DAOs, but in my eyes, it's the foundation of all DAOs!""Abandoning the physical body, this is the heterodox path! No matter how strong your great Dao is, you won't have a foothold!""Today, I'll talk about the art of the physical body!"The Daoist began to preach.He did not know if he was going to talk about the physical Foundation of the way of Dao, or if he had discovered something, that was why he began to talk about the physical Foundation of the way of Dao. It was obvious that he had talked about this before.In the crowd below, many people were somewhat absent-minded. Li Hao, on the other hand, was listening attentively.A lucky chance!At this moment, in Li Hao's eyes, this was an opportunity. Perhaps all the Taoist connotation places were opportunities.A place of Taoist connotation often represented a high-level venerable sovereign.  Best novel online free at ùöó0ùöüùöéùöïùöãùöíùöó  In the chaos, high-level venerable sovereigns were rare. Even if you met one, why would he teach you?The difference between the two sides was too great!However, at this moment, this venerable sovereign began to go from shallow to deep, and began to talk about the qi and blood of the physical body. Li Hao listened carefully and felt enlightened!With the experience of traveling with neo martial artists, he was not unfamiliar with the physical body.New martial artists also cultivated their bodies!The human King's body was extremely strong. The blood Emperor's body was also extremely strong. He was even an iron Emperor. They were both experts in the way of the physical body and were extremely terrifying.Silvermoon, on the other hand, focused on the Dao meridians of the physical body.Li Hao had discovered some physical body Dao meridians before, but he had never tried to cultivate them. In Li Hao's mind, the physical body Dao was actually a bit vulgar, but at this moment, he was fascinated by it!It turned out that the physical body still had so many magical uses and divine abilities.He could even turn his body into a world!Li Hao took a deep breath!His body had become a world, and his body was a barrier. It was not just an inner world anymore. He had become one with the world, which was somewhat like a beast of Chaos.Devour the world and make it his own!"A strong body gives birth to Dao. One Dao is formed, and thousands of DAOs are opened. The great Dao is one. It's nothing more than the primary Dao. Any advanced venerable sovereign has thousands of DAOs. The difference lies in which Dao is the primary Dao.""The realm Lord focuses on the Dao of space, turning clouds and rain, chaos subverting, with a thought, the world begets ... The void begets the world ..."At this moment, Li Hao was extremely shocked.With a single thought, the world was born.How terrifying was this!Could humans really do this?It was extremely troublesome to open a small world and even attracted the chaotic lightning. However, from what this person said, the birth of a world could be done with a thought. Was this a level nine venerable sovereign?Such an existence should not be able to be destroyed.Didn't that mean that the other party was still alive?However, it was no longer in this area?All sorts of thoughts flashed through his mind. In the end, the other party even sent out a Daoist technique, the "chaotic body technique."Li Hao wasn't actually very interested in Taoist techniques.The key was still some concepts, including turning the world into flesh and blood, creating the world with flesh and blood, and all sorts of mystical methods. There were even some that could create the world with a thought, creating regional walls with flesh ...To Li Hao, these methods were unbelievable.He kept thinking and thinking.At this moment, he suddenly felt that his physical body was no longer crude. On the contrary, the physical body was the foundation. Cultivators should not be biased or abandon their physical body. No matter how powerful the great Dao was, they should not abandon their physical body.

Chapter 2604 Enlightenment, Deterrence (2)
Many thoughts appeared in his mind.While Li Hao was thinking, the Dragon Daoist suddenly said,""Fellow Daoists from the depths of time, the chaosverse is incomparably complicated. I'm willing to make friends with experts from all over the world. If they were fated to meet in the future ... They could exchange their DAOs! Fellow Daoist is interested in the Dao of the physical body. The good fortune of the physical body Dao ..."Li Hao didn't say anything. He was calm.Those at the 7th tier would usually be able to find Shi Guang's tracks.If that was the case ... Was the Supreme martial artist of neo martial arts a seventh-grade?  Best novel online free at ùöó0ùöüùöéùöïùöãùöíùöó  Emperor Cang and the human King should be at the seventh rank, but the Supreme of neo martial ... Could it be that they were also at the seventh rank?Otherwise, how could he have discovered him so easily that day?"Junior Meng Lang spied on Daoist techniques ... If there's a chance to meet senior in the land of chaos ... We can exchange Daoist techniques and share my Dao of time ..."At this moment, Li Hao responded.The Daoist seemed to be stunned.He was a little shaken, but he quickly spoke again,""The master of my realm is the master of the ninth-rank space ... He has invited many friends and invited the Dao Masters of all realms, the life and death Dao master, the Yin Yang Dao master, the physical body Dao master, the five elements Dao master ... The only one he has never met is the time Dao master!""If fellow Daoist has the chance, you can come to my Tian Fang for a chat ..."Tian Fang!Today, Tian Fang no longer had these people.Li Hao was about to say something when the river suddenly shook. His expression changed slightly, and he instantly fell into the river. The negotiation and the exchange seemed to have triggered something. At this moment, Li Hao even felt a fatal threat.Li Hao didn't dare to say anything more. He quickly dove into the river and returned to the future.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Soon, Li Hao woke up.His expression changed slightly as he looked up at the sky. The lightning tribulation had yet to descend, but at that moment, he felt that if they continued to communicate, something big might happen!Going back to the past ... This was a heaven-defying act.He also conversed with experts of the past and was even more heaven-defying.If they continued to communicate, he might encounter an unpredictable crisis.The point was that Li Hao found that he had consumed a lot of his lifespan after the first exchange. A venerable sovereign's lifespan was almost endless, but at this moment, he could clearly feel that he had aged a little.Of course, he was young.He had already cultivated it once again. At this moment, he was only eighteen years old. However, he had consumed a lot of his lifespan.As Li Hao woke up, the aura of death spread.His true self was revealed!The two venerable sovereigns looked at Li Hao doubtfully. This man's Taoist connotation was a little special and complicated. They observed him for a while and found that they could not see through him.What was this person's style?At this moment, the giant Pincher behind him didn't dare to say a single word. Even now, it was still immersed in fear.Killing a venerable sovereign ... A first level venerable sovereign was something that many people could do. There were many people in the Dragon returning temple who could do it.However, it was still extremely terrifying to kill a venerable sovereign just because of a verbal conflict.Most importantly, what the other party displayed was also the power of a first stage venerable sovereign.At this moment, he could not believe that this person was only a first stage venerable sovereign.He even thought that this person was at least Grade 4!More importantly, did this person have any ulterior motives for infiltrating the Grand celestial world?Should he go back to the Dragon Temple?These thoughts could not be dispelled.Li Hao, on the other hand, did not care about them. At this moment, his body suddenly trembled and his qi and blood surged. Not only that, a great Dao surrounded his body and even the power of a venerable sovereign appeared. It was instantly consumed by him!The venerable sovereign's power had been purified by him, and the remaining energy was less than a third.At this moment, they were all merging into the acupuncture points in his body.Li Hao recalled everything that had happened. At this moment, he began to strengthen his body. Some of the Dao meridians that had been sealed were opened again. He had already opened 360 Dao meridians.However, at this moment, he had activated many more Dao meridians.The enormous Dao meridians suddenly merged into the river like living Dragons. Li Hao had an idea at this moment. His physical Dao meridians would become a world barrier!He replaced a sword, a seal, and a tree.Back then, he had promised the three experts that in the future, they would turn into their own worlds. However, at this moment, the three of them were all part of Li Hao's River of Life and death. If this went on, it would be difficult for the three of them to break away from their own River.It was better to use the power of his physical body to bear the weight of the river ... In the future, he could open up a new world for these three!At this moment, Li Hao was thinking about the future while he was cultivating his physical body.The Skylands world was a place of opportunity for him.Many advanced venerable sovereigns used to live here.He had gained a lot from merely reversing the past. For Li Hao, a high-level venerable Emperor's explanation of the great Dao was more exciting than devouring a medium-level world.More importantly, there were four Taoist connotation lands in the return Dragon field.And this place was only the tianfang world, the southern region, one of the ten major regions.p How many advanced venerable sovereigns were there in the entire tianfang world?Regardless of whether they were advanced or not ... All venerable sovereigns were extraordinary figures, and they were venerable sovereigns of major worlds. It was Li Hao's opportunity that they were willing to explain their great Dao to him!What could be more tempting than this?As for the consumption of lifespan ... It didn't matter!At this moment, Li Hao was both excited and shocked.The world Lord of this world was really a Grade 9!

More importantly, he was a top venerable sovereign in the Dao of space.The space ...When he had arrived at the world through the realm gate, was this formation set up by the Huilong temple or had it already existed?In addition ... As the most powerful spatial venerable sovereign ... Then, was the entire tianfang world really as it seemed? a ninth stage spatial venerable sovereign was already unimaginable.Was that tianfang world the tianfang world he had seen?Were there different levels of space?Why did a major world have to be completely relocated?Also, it was said that this world Lord wanted to gather the top existences of all paths. What was his purpose?Dao discussion?It shouldn't be.At this moment, Li Hao's mind was filled with thoughts. The qi and blood in his body kept rising. The energy he had compressed from a first stage venerable sovereign turned into pieces of chaos great Dao crystals.Li Hao didn't care about the orthodoxies of a weak venerable sovereign. He completely abandoned them and only absorbed the energy he needed.He was a venerable sovereign after all.This energy was enough for Li Hao's cultivation and to continuously activate his physical body's Dao meridians. Once he activated one, Li Hao would merge into the river and become its wall!  Best novel online free at ùöó0ùöüùöéùöïùöãùöíùöó  Not only that, but the power of his qi and blood had also been integrated into the river, becoming a part of the river of life and death.In this way, although Li Hao's strength didn't advance, it had increased by a lot.This made Li Hao a little excited.To him, after becoming a venerable sovereign, the difficulty of cultivation would increase. It would still be difficult for him to enter the second or third stage. Even if he did not need ten million years, he would still need a few years.However, if he could maintain this progress ... He might be able to step into stage three very soon.The prerequisite was that one had to have enough comprehension of Dao."Fellow Daoist!"While Li Hao was thinking, the female venerable Sovereign next to him suddenly asked in confusion,""Has fellow Daoist gained any insight?"Li Hao turned his head and smiled.""A small gain." ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe female venerable sovereign was a little confused.This place had been visited by countless people, but in terms of gains, very few people had.This is your first time here, and you've only comprehended it for the first time. You haven't even activated the power of your Taoist connotation, and you've already comprehended it. However, this person's vitality seemed to have fluctuated a little just now.She couldn't make a judgment at the moment.At this moment, it wasn't for this but for something else. He transmitted his voice over,""I think you've just advanced to the venerable sovereign realm not long ago. You're severely lacking in comprehension of Dao and resources!""Recently, we venerable sovereigns who wander the chaos are preparing to join forces to do something ... If fellow Daoist is willing, you can join us. It's also an opportunity!""What's the matter?"Li Hao was a little curious. You wandering chaos beings are not very strong, yet you want to cause trouble?What was he doing?"Does fellow Daoist know of the red moon region?""I know a little."Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. Was it related to the red moon zone again?It seemed like he couldn't get rid of the influence of neo martial."A war has broken out in the Redmoon region ... Recently, there's news from the Redmoon world that anyone who can kill a venerable sovereign from the yin-yang world and below level three can obtain tens of millions of chaos great Dao crystals! Middle-stage venerable sovereigns ... Are even more unimaginable. They can even enter the great path universe and comprehend the Dao of the red moon. The red moon sovereign is an eighth-stage venerable sovereign, an unparalleled expert!""The Crimson Moon world has stood in the chaos for many years and has a deep foundation. In the past, it has always been fighting alone. This time, it took the initiative to wander around the chaos and spread information. It is obvious that the new martial arts have brought great pressure to the other party!""In addition, the yin-yang world has a small subsidiary world. From what I know ... The Crimson Moon has also offered a sky-high price! It's said that it's just an unranked small world that was lost in the chaos more than 50 years ago. If anyone can find it, take it, and give it to Hong Yue, Hong Yue will even give a medium world in exchange ..."Li Hao's heart moved.So fast?It was normal for Red Moon to make a move, but this was way too fast. He had only just arrived, and silver Moon had already sent him a wanted order."Fellow Daoist, you mean ... We should join forces to deal with the neo martial artist?"Li Hao frowned."We're just a part of it," the female venerable sovereign said."Recently, not only the red moon, but all the major forces in tianfang, the domain Lords, and even the experts from the surrounding macro worlds have been coveting the yin-yang world!""This world is extraordinary. In just a thousand years, the neo martial human King has advanced from mid-stage venerable sovereign to seventh-stage venerable sovereign. He can even kill seventh-stage venerable sovereigns. It's terrifying!""Some people even suspect that if this new martial human King and that Emperor Cang really merge ... They might also have eighth-grade power!""Fellow Daoist should know how difficult it is to cultivate as a venerable sovereign! The Lord of any major world has experienced many dangers and is the top elite of the world. He's a neo martial human King, so he's not special. How can he improve so quickly?""It's said that the origin universe of neo martial is no small matter ..."The Empress said a lot to Li Hao before she added,"I can see that you're not afraid of danger and you're young. If you're willing, I can introduce you to join us and form the sovereign venerable Alliance of the chaos roaming ... If you can kill a neo martial artist, Crimson moon's Foundation is deep and you'll definitely get a lot of benefits. One adventure is enough for us to rest for thousands of years!"Li Hao's heart trembled slightly. Red Moon borrowed external power to deal with neo martial?

Chapter 2606 Realization, Deterrence (3)
Red Moon, did she feel the danger, or was she not confident?During the battle of the great world, the other party had taken the initiative to invade ... Now, they were recruiting chaos to roam around to deal with neo martial. This was not good news. He also knew that neo martial was actually ... Very poor!The human King was a person who lived in the moment. Whatever resources he had, he would use them immediately!According to him, if he did not use it now, it would benefit the enemy.Therefore, neo martial almost had no foundation to speak of.Red Moon could spend money to recruit people, but neo martial arts couldn't ... Because he was poor and had no money to recruit people.The chaos Ranger was not too strong.Most of them were Tier 3 and below!However, many ants could bite an elephant to death. Not to mention, not everyone in neo martial arts was a high-level venerable sovereign. There were very few high-level venerable sovereigns, and there were not many middle-level venerable sovereigns. The real number was the low-level venerable sovereigns.Most of them were in the neo martial world.However, in the past few years, some of them had left the neo martial world to train in all directions. Even in tianfang world ... There might be some of them.Li Hao frowned at this thought.He still owed neo martial a favor.Not only that, Silver Moon also originated from a new martial artist, and he had also become a wanted target of Red Moon. Red Moon did not know that Silver Moon had advanced to a medium-level world, but she was willing to trade an intermediate-level world for him.  Best novel online free at ùöó0ùöüùöéùöïùöãùöíùöó  A medium-level world was very attractive to those at the peak of the third level or even the fourth level venerable sovereigns.As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Li Hao said telepathically,""Why are you looking for me? The previous one said that I'm a spy for new martial arts. Fellow Daoist, aren't you afraid that I'll betray you?"Suddenly looking for me ... Something's wrong!The previous one said I was a spy for neo martial.You're not worried at all?The Empress laughed and sent another voice transmission."What neo martial spy ... That person doesn't understand neo martial arts at all. Neo martial artists all cultivate the great Dao of origin. The aura of the great Dao of the great world is actually very obvious and can be distinguished at a glance! Fellow Daoist doesn't have the aura of the origin at all ... How could you be a neo martial artist?""Moreover, neo martial world is xenophobic ... It almost doesn't take in foreign powerhouses. In addition, they appear in the chaos for a short time. Under normal circumstances, no venerable sovereigns will rashly join neo martial world at this moment. That neo martial human King has caused trouble everywhere. Everyone feels that a great disaster is imminent. Even if we wander in the chaos, we will not rashly join the other party!"Even though the new martial artists were powerful, there was more than one level Seven venerable sovereign, which was stronger than the general great world.However, who would seek refuge with the wandering chaos?This is crazy! The new martial human King was extremely crazy. All these years, he had not been idle. Instead, he had been looking for trouble, fighting and killing everywhere. How many venerable sovereigns had he killed?Such an existence ... Do you dare to seek refuge with him?Naturally, he did not dare to!As for Li Hao, a newly-advanced venerable sovereign, it was still difficult to see the specific information of the great Dao, but he was definitely not the origin. The aura of the origin was actually very obvious. Experts who were familiar with great worlds could almost tell at a glance which great world the other party belonged to.It was still possible that he was a spy of the Crimson Moon, as the Crimson Moon had recruited many foreign experts.However, neo martial arts ... Was very unique and had never been created.Therefore, if a venerable sovereign did not have the aura of origin, he was definitely not a venerable sovereign of new martial arts.This was also the reason why giant pincer and the Empress had no scruples in front of Li Hao. They directly said that they wanted to deal with neo martial, because neo martial had no allies. It was an independent force!Although he was strong, he didn't have many friends. He was a neo martial artist, an independent circle of his own.Even the more well-known sun god among the neo martial artists was not considered to be part of the origin ... In fact, he had been contaminated with a large amount of the origin aura. Moreover, such a powerhouse did not need to hide his identity at all.Rank 7 venerable sovereign!Such an existence might be weaker than some of the Masters of great cosmoses because he did not have a great Dao universe or world power. However, he was still a true high-level venerable sovereign ... How could he pretend to be a newcomer?Li Hao raised his eyebrows and sent a voice transmission, fellow Daoist, are there many people? Who was he going to deal with? "As far as I know ... On neo martial's side, everyone dares to self-destruct. They're extremely powerful, cruel, and extremely terrifying ...""It doesn't matter. This time, we have several level three venerable sovereigns, and even ... A level four venerable sovereign will lead the team! And the opponent is actually not strong, and ... I'm not afraid you'll know that they're just two fringe venerable sovereigns of new martial arts ... They're even ... A disgrace to new martial arts!"She smiled."We wouldn't dare to provoke a peak venerable sovereign of neo martial arts. He's too terrifying!" "But this time, we have to deal with two marginal figures of new martial arts. One is the celestial pole Emperor, and the other is a submissive of new martial arts, King Huai! One of them is a rank two venerable sovereign, and the other is a rank three venerable sovereign ... Most importantly, the other party is very timid and is famous for escaping venerable sovereigns ..."Li Hao was shocked! King Huai, celestial pole.I'll go!"I know both of them. The celestial pole is all too familiar with them.However, how could the two of them ... Go out?Even Li Hao was stunned. He said telepathically,"I do have some understanding of these two. It's said that ... If they can lie down, they definitely won't stand. They're both inside the neo martial world. Unless it's a big battle, they definitely won't leave the neo martial world. Why would they come out and give us a chance to hunt them?""You don't know this! We don't know the exact details, but these two have indeed left the yin-yang world! If we kill them, not only will the spoils go to us after they die in battle, the Crimson Moon world will also give us a high price! "Not only that ... In order to deal with neo martial, even some of the surrounding great worlds have offered bounties!"

Chapter 2607 Realization, Deterrence (3)
"Not just one, but many, and ... All of them! In recent years, new martial has provoked too many people. Moreover, it is more aggressive than Red Moon, which makes many people afraid!""The neo martial human King has been killing everywhere ... This person's existence has brought immense pressure to the Lords of some major worlds! They're afraid that the other party might use the excuse that they don't know the way to invade us ... They're even more notorious than the Crimson Moon!""We can't deal with a top-tier venerable sovereign ... But killing a fourth-rank venerable sovereign and below ... The benefits we get are no less than that of a fourth-rank venerable sovereign. It's a huge opportunity for the wandering chaos!"The Empress kept talking. This time, she had taken the initiative to invite Li Hao because she found him pleasing to the eye.First, Li Hao was quite handsome.Second, remain calm.Third, his bearing was different. He had a scholarly air and was gentle. Although he had been a little aggressive before, he was not afraid in the face of a venerable sovereign's provocation. It was extraordinary.Due to various reasons, she decided to invite this person.For a newly-advanced venerable sovereign, such opportunities were too rare.How could there be many opportunities for a first level venerable sovereign?Li Hao didn't want to agree at first, but at this moment, he was shocked. Two neo martial Supreme emperors had left the neo martial world ... And the key was that one of them was Heaven's Fate.Why?The next moment, he came to a realization. He was looking for Silver Moon!But ... This kind of information should be confidential. Why was it leaked?Could it be ... There was a traitor in neo martial?It was not impossible!On neo martial's side, li daoheng and the others had betrayed them before. Why couldn't the next one appear?Moreover, not everyone agreed with the ideals of the human King and the Supreme martial artist. It was very possible for them to be too crazy and betray the other party.However, the news had spread so quickly.New martial arts had dispatched venerable sovereigns to look for Silver Moon. It should have been about a month after Silver moon's appearance. In a month's time, the news had actually spread to the tianfang world!This ... Was too fast.This was the chaosverse, not the insides of a world. For a message to be transmitted so quickly was simply too terrifying.He was originally uninterested, but at this moment, he had an idea and quickly said,""If we kill them and provoke a neo martial artist to take revenge ...""No need to worry! For this matter, some powerhouses had their own plans! That new martial human King doesn't dare to come to tianfang region rashly. Once he comes ... Under a pincer attack, do you think he can escape? At this moment, the other party is fine because of his mysterious appearance!"The human King's loss had become a ghost.But the truth was as such.,m The other party said that he was looking for Hong Yue, but in fact, he was running around everywhere. You had no idea where he would appear the next moment!Just because of this, you can't even surround and annihilate the other party.Previously, someone had caught up to the human King ... But the result was that they were all caught by the human King! Not a single one was left!Now, who would dare to chase after him?As for the human King, ever since he detonated the great path universe of the darkest great world, he had disappeared without a trace again ... The other party was in the dark, which was dangerous. Obviously, neo martial arts were not good, but the human King moved forward alone and was in the dark. No one knew where he would appear in the next moment. Even within neo martial arts, no one knew where he would appear.Li Hao finally understood.Many people wanted to kill the neo martial artist human King!  Best novel online free at ùöó0ùöüùöéùöïùöãùöíùöó  This was because the other party was powerful and did not follow the rules. Furthermore, the other party was powerful and the key point was that the other party had only cultivated for a short period of time!Li Hao was considered a genius, but he was now a level one venerable sovereign ... Would he be able to become a level Seven venerable sovereign in a thousand years?No one could be sure of this!And the neo martial human king who had killed countless people was a seventh rank venerable sovereign!It was too shocking!As these thoughts crossed his mind, Li Hao asked,""When will they move out?""One year later! On the way, we will need some time. Plus, we still need to prepare and wait for some people. It's not something that can be done overnight, so a year is not long!"A year?Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. It hadn't been too long. After entering the chaos, he understood that one year was really nothing.A year's journey was nothing.Now, he was only a first level venerable sovereign, but this time, it was said that there was a fourth level venerable sovereign.There was still hope for him to deal with a 3rd rank.Tier 4 ... It was time to wash up and go to sleep.However, if he entered the second or third stage, there would be hope.As for sending a message to neo martial ... Let's not talk about whether the power of time could go back to neo martial again. Even if it could, the two people would walk out and enter the chaos. Neo martial would not be able to contact each other!Therefore, in this one year, he had to at least enter the second rank, or even the third rank, before he had any hope of solving the crisis for these two!"I agree!"Li Hao said telepathically, thank you for your help, big sister! If it wasn't for big sister, I'm afraid I wouldn't have a chance to participate in this operation ... By the way, will the major forces of tianfang world participate?""They're different from us. Even if they participate, they won't be dealing with the weak, but the strong! Their target is probably the neo martial experts who are wandering in the chaos, such as venerable sword, venerable blood Emperor, heavenly suppression King, and venerable Emperor Qin Fengqing!"The great Empress sighed,'these people are all middle-stage venerable sovereigns, and that's their true goal! As for us ... We can only deal with the weaker venerable sovereigns. The stronger ones are the experts of the macro world. It's not easy to deal with them!"Li Hao understood, and his expression turned grave.Neo martial ... Could really provoke the enemy.

It was like this in the past, and it is still like this now. Look, even outside the red moon region, they are thinking of ways to deal with you. You people really know how to cause trouble.Look at me ... I never cause trouble!Even if he had killed a venerable sovereign, he had kept a low profile.Of course, he couldn't do anything when it came to those who were too strong, so ... He could only do his best.He suddenly looked at giant pincer."Daoist giant pincer, I will be staying in tianfang world for a while. During this time, you can accompany me and be my guide. As for the Dragon Temple, can you help me talk ... I am interested in joining, but ... I may need some resources."The giant pincer was shocked!At this moment, he didn't even dare to recruit this person. Even if he recruited a venerable sovereign, he would have many benefits, but ... The situation of this person in front of him was unclear. If he had ulterior motives and joined the Dragon returning temple, to him ... If this person escaped, he would be finished!Of course, this was the venerable sovereigns 'inspection.It had nothing to do with him! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  However, he was too weak ... If he was implicated, it would be troublesome.He thought to himself, but a smile appeared on his face."Of course, I'll definitely pass on the message. If senior is willing to join the Huilong temple, it'll be a great addition to our sect!"In his heart, he was crying bitterly!Why did I encounter such a troublesome existence?For a moment, he didn't know what Li Hao was trying to do.Li Hao, on the other hand, said telepathically,"don't worry. I'm just here with an identity. I'll cultivate for a while and avoid some trouble. I'll leave in a year. Fellow Daoist, why are you so wary?" If you pretend not to know anything, you will have one more venerable sovereign, or even more ... But if ... Even if the Huilong temple offers you benefits, I'm afraid you won't be able to enjoy them!"The giant pincers secretly cried out bitterly!I know!Otherwise, I would've reported it to the higher-ups."Senior ... But these two ... Also saw that person leave. If that person doesn't return for a long time and sends a message ... It will be troublesome. These two will definitely think of something!"Helplessly, he sent another message.I can keep it a secret, but what about these two?One was a rank one, and the other was a rank two.It would be very troublesome!Won't they suspect you if the news is leaked?The point is, I saw it with my own eyes, and they saw it too. When the time comes, I'll also be implicated!Li Hao glanced at the two of them. The stage-one ones were easy to kill, but the stage-two ones were a little troublesome.To silence him?Forget it!This was not appropriate!I, Li Hao, am not that kind of person.Even if the Empress was prepared to hunt for neo martial artists, it was only for the sake of benefits. It was not like she was deliberately targeting him or the neo martial artists ... And yet she was kind enough to invite him!In that case ... I, Li Hao, am not a bad person.In the next moment, a surge of qi and blood rushed into the sky from the Taoist connotation. A giant dragon hovered between the sky and the earth. At this moment, the two venerable sovereigns beside him were both shocked and surprised."The Taoist connotation!"The two venerable sovereigns were overjoyed. At this moment, they could not care less about Li Hao and rushed into the giant Dragons in the sky.Li Hao smiled and looked at the giant pincers.""This should be enough, right? To comprehend the Taoist connotation ... One year isn't too long, is it?"The giant pincers were stunned! The Taoist connotation!How was that possible?This person in front of him ... How could he present his Taoist connotation at any time? this must be his doing. Otherwise ... This was too much of a coincidence!He was completely stunned!He felt that all of this was beyond his imagination. In fact ... He was a little frightened. Could the person in front of him be ... A seventh rank venerable sovereign?Otherwise, the Taoist connotation here would have completely dissipated.How could it appear so easily!This place was originally the place where the Dao accumulation of a high-level venerable sovereign was located. Ordinary people would not be able to display it.Li Hao glanced at it and smiled."This place is just enough for two low-level venerable sovereigns to cultivate and comprehend. Experts don't come here, and they won't let ordinary people come here. It doesn't matter if they fight or fight ... It has nothing to do with us!" Let's go to another place ... We're weak and can't compete with the two venerable sovereigns!"At this point, Li Hao shouted,"fellow Daoists, I'll take my leave first. The Dao accumulation here doesn't seem to be enough for three people ... I don't have the intention to fight for it. The Dao of the physical body and my Dao of death don't match. I'll go and take a look elsewhere ... Fellow Daoists, see you later!"The two venerable sovereigns were also delighted.It was best that this person didn't come!Even though the Empress had tried to recruit Li Hao before, she didn't want Li Hao to join the fight. She was only at Level 1, not Level 2. If they fought ... She might be excluded.Even though she felt that she was no weaker than Li Hao, and that Li Hao might not be able to compete with her ...But ... It would be best if there was less trouble.At this moment, he hurriedly sent a voice transmission to Li Hao, then I'll see you in a year ... By the way, may I know your name, fellow cultivator?"Supreme Emperor Hao Yue!""I'm yi, you can call me ancestor Yi or fellow Daoist Yi ..."The other party replied quickly."Alright, thank you, sister min. I'll come back in a year!"Li Hao chuckled and said no more. He then left in a carefree manner. After he left, the second level venerable sovereign looked serious.""Will this person's departure ... Leak ..."The sudden appearance of the Taoist connotation was an opportunity.Most importantly, there wasn't much movement, and it just happened to be near them.Although many venerable sovereigns came and went here, it was normal that no one would come for a while.What he was afraid of was that this person would spread the news everywhere after he went out!Yu ancestor pondered for a while, then shook his head and said,"it's hard to say. But this man has an extraordinary aura. He doesn't look like he came from a small world. But ... There is no power of the great Dao of the universe. Since he has left ... We should seize the opportunity to comprehend it!" "If it's really leaked, then there's nothing we can do. Normally, those above rank three wouldn't come. Rank three ... This is only a part of the Dao accumulation, not the entire thing. The other party might not be interested ..."Anyway, he would just try his luck!The stage two venerable sovereign didn't say much. He quickly began to comprehend and immerse himself in it. At this moment, he only felt that the great Dao was extremely mysterious!For a moment, he was so excited that it was hard to imagine.Not all venerable sovereigns had the opportunity to receive guidance from a high-level venerable sovereign.There were only a few high-level venerable sovereigns in the entire Red Moon region and tianfang region.Every one of them was a top-level existence in the great world. Who would be interested in wandering chaos like them?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, the giant pincer was so shocked that it was in a daze.At this moment, they seriously suspected that the person in front of them ... Was a hidden advanced venerable sovereign. It was too terrifying!Li Hao, on the other hand, looked at him with a bright smile. He judged that this person didn't dare to say anything. His loyalty to the Dragon returning temple ... Was just so-so. This kind of power that didn't unite the world actually had very limited cohesion.

Chapter 2609 You Can't Even Keep A Low Profile (Happy New Year)_1
(It's the New Year's Eve today. Let's have a good time and have a complete New Year's Eve dinner together.)The chaosverse.In the boundless chaos, a warship was traveling across the sky at an extremely fast speed.The two notorious neo martial venerable sovereigns had avoided danger after danger. Even if they had to take a detour, they would rather go a little further than take the risk.Steady!There was only one word in the whole process, stability was the most important!What was more important than stability?In other words, was there anything more important than staying alive in this world?This was Heaven's Fate's thought.The celestial pole was really stable. Although King Huai was also stable, he was born at the bottom of the society and was a slave. He was afraid of death, but he was also ruthless and crazy. This was why he could become one of the few venerable sovereigns among the surrendered generals.In the new martial era, almost all the enemies were killed, but this person had survived to this day, which showed his ability.At this moment, the two of them were on the floating warship.There was no difference in the surrounding environment. King Huai's expression was calm. He looked around and frowned slightly, but he did not say anything.On the other hand, Heaven's Fate crossed his arms and was a little unhappy.After sensing for a while, he also frowned slightly.His clone seemed to have stopped moving.Not moving might not be a good thing."Any thoughts?" celestial pole asked after a long time."Nine out of ten will die!" King Huai replied.Heaven's Fate curled his lips.A narrow escape?I think it's more serious.It's been a month since we left, and we haven't seen anyone. We're safe, but it also means ... Danger is coming.It was a very troublesome matter!As for the token left behind by the Supreme martial artist on his body ... Whether it was a clone of the Supreme martial artist or a tracking device used by the Supreme martial artist, it was still uncertain. But one thing was for sure, the two of us might have become bait.Bait the enemy out.You're really not a good thing!"The key is that this bait might not be safe ... Because there are more than two new martial artists outside. It's impossible for Supreme martial artists to keep an eye on them all the time. This bait isn't just for the two of us. The ones we catch are also small shrimps."If we can catch a big fish somewhere else ... We might be in trouble."Was celestial pole stupid?He was not stupid at all!King Huai was not stupid.On the contrary, these two were smart people. If not for this, neo martial arts would be a group of lunatics. How could they have a foothold? they were not very good at fighting and often dropped the ball. They were not even considered direct descendants.If he wasn't smart, he would have been finished long ago! As this thought emerged in his mind, celestial pole also investigated. After a long time, he mumbled,""Go to sleep! There hasn't been any danger recently, and even if someone tries to block our way, they'll be stopped ... Either we make a move, or ... We'll just strike like lightning!"King Huai nodded slightly.He thought so too."For now, we won't encounter any danger. It's possible that the other party will keep an eye on us and even want to follow us to find the Silvermoon world.Silver Moon was born in neo martial.Taking down Silver Moon would very likely allow him to find the weakness of some neo martial artists, or even the weakness of the great Dao. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  At this very moment, there might already be people watching them. The two powerhouses didn't say much.However, they were all a little worried.Even though they knew that this was bait, they still had to act. Even though Heaven's Fate was extremely arrogant and their father was a top-notch expert, if they disobeyed the orders of a Supreme ... The Supreme wasn't really kind.He was a person who hid daggers behind his smile!New martial arts provided for you, but you didn't put in any effort and ran away when you encountered danger. Did you want to die?According to the human King, you have to pay for as much as you get. Usually, when the sky falls, the tall ones will hold it up, but when you are needed, even if you know that you will die, you have to die on the front line!Those who retreated, those who avoided battle, and those who betrayed were beheaded ... Regardless of identity and status, once the battle started, the Supreme martial artist would escape. For the sake of neo martial, the human King would also be beheaded!As for the resurrection ...Reversing yin and yang to resurrect someone was possible, but to a human King, each resurrection was a blow to their very essence. How could they just resurrect someone for no reason?If one reversed yin and yang too much, they would also encounter the chaos lightning tribulation. Even if Emperor Cang could devour them, the lightning tribulation was too strong and could easily lead to serious consequences.Many thoughts appeared in the minds of the two.The two of them retreated back to the battleship. At this moment, King Huai suddenly sent a message,"Is there something special about the Silver Moon world? venerated sword, Zhang an, and venerated circle were all in the Silver Moon world! They're all close to human Kings and Supremes ..."Not to mention others, these few people were not ordinary.Moreover, the direct descendant of the waterpower family, li Fuhai, and some descendants of venerable sovereigns were also among them.Now that Silver Moon had appeared, new martial would quickly look for him.King Huai judged whether there was something special about this place.As for the celestial pole's clone, he had been watching over Silver Moon for many years. What was his motive?Heaven's Fate didn't hide it and directly sent a voice transmission."Old Wang is over there, resurrect second cat!"King Huai slightly raised his eyebrows.Resurrect second cat?He wasn't too sure about that but ...
