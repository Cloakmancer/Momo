The Grandmaster's face was calm.However, venerable sovereign Zhi Yang sneered."I don't want to die. Also ... I want to continue watching ... Whether you all will die or Chi Yang will die!"The Grandmaster raised his eyebrows slightly, but didn't say anything.As for Supreme Emperor Zhi Yang, he didn't say another word.Why did he say that?Because ... He could see that the new martial art's power of yang was too weak. It was so weak that the so-called yin-yang world had completely become half of the world of Yin, and it was impossible to balance it.Even if he had devoured the power of the searing Sun World, it might not be enough. It was enough for an ordinary world, but a neo martial artist ... Perhaps he could be regarded as a level eight.If that was the case, it would not be enough.In the four-direction region, the Scarlet Sun World had the most yang energy.These people would definitely have conflicts with the Crimson sun realm.This was for sure!The Paragon didn't say anything. The moment the other party left, he waved his hand, and the 10000 pages of the book transformed into a lone boat that drifted into the great path universe of the scorching sun.A large amount of yang energy was instantly absorbed by him.The entire searing Sun World started to dim.He looked at the many venerable sovereigns around him, and in the next moment, a powerful force of extreme yang emerged from the book and rushed toward the blood Emperor. With a wave of his hand, countless forces of yang were extracted from the entire world.The next moment, he looked around.At that moment, the neo martial Supreme emperors, who had suppressed the entire area, looked up one after another. Their eyes were filled with eagerness and passion.Martial Dao must fight!The power of the great DAOs in the entire scorching sun World had been given to the blood Emperor. The blood Emperor was already full of Yang Qi. After absorbing a large amount of Yang Qi, it would be a piece of cake for him to reach Level Seven.However, there was also the power of the world ... It should also be able to satisfy a rank 6 with balanced yin and yang.Who could get such an opportunity?The princess Consort?This was naturally the case according to how close they were to each other. Perhaps it was the human King's younger sister ... But the human King's younger sister had yet to advance to the next level. It would be a waste to give her to him.It was a habit of a Supreme martial artist, so he probably wouldn't give it to her.If it was the human King ... Then it would be hard to say."Give it to me!"At this moment, there was a man with a shaved head. He was obviously very handsome and young, but his bald head added a bit of Valiance. At this moment, he held a big saber and shouted,""I'm taking it!"Qin Fengqing!A guy who was rarely mentioned in the martial arts world was so confident that even after a thousand years, he still thought that the human King was just one step ahead of him. He would catch up sooner or later and he would be invincible!The Grandmaster glanced at him. The Qin Emperor held his head high and puffed out his chest. If he didn't give it to me, who could he give it to?Give it to that idiot, iron head?To old Yao?He gave it to Fang Ping's wife ... His wife was terrified again. She was extremely weak and could be killed in one strike!Even if the human King was here, he would do it! The Paragon ignored him and looked around. In the end, he sent a powerful force toward the king of earth, the old man with the coffin. The Paragon looked over at him, his face calm.The king of earth chuckled. The Qin Emperor glanced at the king of earth and then at the Supreme martial artist. He cursed and did not say anything else.If it was given to someone else, he would not accept it!Give it to old Wang, he will take half.To the king of earth ... Forget it, I'll just force myself to accept it. The old man is very difficult to deal with. More importantly, he's very cunning. He has three sons, all of whom are strong. The youngest son, Li Zhu, is even more difficult to deal with.This family, who had provoked them, would be in for a long time.Next time, next time, no one will compete with me!He muttered in his heart.As for the Supreme martial artist, he casually threw out the remains of the Elysian world. In an instant, countless pages drilled into the melting searing Sun World. Billions of lives instantly spun and entered the pages. In an instant, they all entered the Elysian world, that broken world.With a wave of his hand, venerable sovereign Zhi Yang barely retained his venerable sovereign power and became a rogue cultivator.He had instantly thrown her into paradise.The expression on venerable sovereign Zhi Yang's face changed.In fact, if he gave up his power, he felt that there was a high chance that he would be killed, but ... This person did not kill him."Doesn't neo martial kill anyone they see?"He stood in the broken world and looked at chaos with a puzzled expression.The Grandmaster smiled, but didn't explain anything.Why did he need to explain?If he wanted to kill, he would kill. If he didn't want to kill...Then he wouldn't kill.In the next moment, countless venerable sovereigns returned. The huge gray cat swallowed everything in its path, and the remnants of the searing Sun World were swallowed.In the blink of an eye, Emperor Cang brought everyone and disappeared from the spot.Only a broken world was left.Supreme Emperor scorching sun's expression changed slightly. He didn't say anything and fled with the broken world. He had fallen from rank 7 to rank 1. If he didn't leave now, others might not come to help him. They might ... Kill him along the way. After all, he was a seventh stage venerable sovereign who had fallen. If he killed him, he might even conjure countless Dao accumulation crystals and seventh stage comprehensions.Neo martial was too strong! Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  Previously, when neo martial broke through Nirvana, he still thought it was because of a surprise attack. However, after personally fighting today, he understood that in this world, even if the human King was not here, it had the ability to break through any seventh-rank world.There were three seventh rank venerable sovereigns and many sixth rank peak venerable sovereigns, and ... He could vaguely see that they seemed to be ... Forming a world!What a terrifying group of people!The four sides of the chaos had underestimated the terror of the neo martial world. If these people had not lacked the power of extreme yang, the neo martial world would probably have produced more seventh rank venerable sovereigns.……And at this moment.Tian Fang.Suddenly, the sword saint's eyes flickered. He seemed to have sensed something. Although his Dao had separated from neo martial and its origin, it had not completely cut off the connection with neo martial.

Chapter 3041 Abnormally Strong (3)
He looked at Li Hao and gestured with his eyes.Li Hao's heart moved.It's starting?On new martial's side, their movements were quite Swift.In an instant, a crack suddenly opened in the Dao universe.At this moment, a figure rushed out directly. Outside the crack, the two level 8s didn't even have time to see the situation clearly before they struck out like lightning!BOOM!The red shadow trembled and flew backward, fresh blood spurting out."Bastard!" Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  A low shout was heard. Only then did venerable sovereign Chi Yang and Dragon Master see the figure clearly.Red Moon?It was just that ... It seemed to be much weaker than before. The power of the Crimson Moon had dissipated a lot. Although it was still at the eighth level, it looked ... Very pathetic.What was going on?The two of them were still in a daze. Suddenly, their expressions changed slightly, and they quickly retreated. The next moment, a long saber directly cut through the sky from behind!At the same time. Below him, mountains of clouds and seas of mist appeared, and a long sword cut through the heavens and earth!The two Grade 7 experts attacked at the same time.The two level eight venerable sovereigns frowned slightly, but they did not stop him.The human King, Wu Shan, and the newly arrived rank seven venerable sovereign.At the same time, a Book of Darkness appeared. Within the regional wall, it was as if a King of Darkness had walked out from the endless darkness. He brought with him light, like the two extremes of light and darkness, yet it was not.Another seventh rank venerable sovereign!Red Moon master was also shocked!He was currently being pursued. He had just seen the crack appear and in the blink of an eye, he had been hit by two level 8 cultivators. Although he had not died, his injuries had worsened. Who would have thought that three level 7 cultivators would suddenly appear?The mist Mountain ...He wasn 't?He didn't even have time to think about it. BOOM!A loud sound reverberated in all directions. With a loud bang, countless cracks appeared on his physical body. Red Moon sovereign burned his blood essence and escaped instantly, but he was still seriously injured!He kept coughing up blood!The power of the great Dao spread wildly, and the power of desire burned the void.Red Moon master could not hold on any longer and shouted,""Help me!"He didn't say his name.However, at this moment, the long blade behind him was suddenly surrounded by countless clouds. The long blade exploded with an extremely powerful killing intent and broke through the clouds. However, in the next moment, more clouds appeared! The Lord of the clouds!At this moment, heaven and earth split open.One figure after another appeared.The cloud Lord made his move. He blocked the human King while the deep sea venerable sovereign appeared in front of the Senlan world Overlord. He struck out with a single strike, causing huge waves to surge into the sky.The human King's expression was cold.The Lord of the clouds had a calm expression. He looked at the human King and then at Wu Shan. Suddenly, he said softly,""Wushan, I knew you didn't have good intentions, but I didn't expect ... You're actually mixed up with the neo martial demon. Neo martial, the demon of chaos! Red Moon, cangjiang, tianlan, Yeming, bliss, and dark. The six great worlds were destroyed by neo martial. I'm afraid you're only able to recover because you helped the evildoer devour a part of the universe!"The two eighth level venerable sovereigns, who had been confused just now, were shocked by his words.So that was how it was!Wushan actually wasn't lying.A game!This time, it was really a trap. The four major worlds had been destroyed."Yunxiao, the four worlds are gone?" venerable sovereign Chi Yang's expression changed slightly.The cloud Master nodded slightly,'ah, a demon has appeared! This time, the tianfang universe is a cage and has not been restored. It is a trap set by them. Unfortunately, several World Masters have fallen here, and fellow Daoist Red Moon has also been severely injured and left the universe. I'm afraid that the Crimson Moon universe will no longer exist!"Not far away, Red Moon master, who was severely injured, coughed up blood and snorted.""Neo martial is the destroyer of chaos! "You didn't believe it before ... But in just a few years, with me, Hong Yue, a rank 8 world and five rank 7 worlds have been completely destroyed! In the past 300000 years, the square region only destroyed 3 rank 7 worlds!"A hundred thousand years would probably destroy one family.But now, in two years, six of them had disappeared!The two eighth level venerable sovereigns 'expressions changed slightly.At this moment, in the depths of the universe, the power of light appeared. Red Moon master's expression changed slightly, and cloud Master raised his eyebrows slightly."Guangming, it's not a good thing for your son to be with them! Today, I'll kill the human King, Wu Shan, and the others here to prevent the chaos from continuing!"The human King laughed coldly,"you sure know how to talk!" If the neo martial artists don't attack me, I won't attack them! "Hongyue took the initiative to attack me, a new martial artist, and now you dare to pour dirty water on me. It's just the law of the jungle. Why are you looking for excuses? Yunxiao, you're more disgusting than Hongyue. You'll be the first one I kill when I enter level eight!""I'm afraid you won't have the chance!" The cloud Master said coldly.He would get the other two rank eight Masters to attack together and capture the human King today.Yunxiao and neo martial had a grudge, but it wasn't too deep. Yunxiao had supported Hongyue before, including the venerable returning Dragon Emperor and the others. They were all under the command of Yunxiao world, but they had never really fought, so The Grudge was actually nothing.However ... Supreme Emperor Yunxiao was extremely afraid at the moment.There was no other reason. Wu Shan had actually joined them.Wu Shan had a deep hatred for him.Wu Shan didn't say anything, but venerable Emperor Yunxiao felt that he had taken away all of Wu Shan's energy and almost killed him. How could Wu Shan not be resentful?He would definitely take revenge!Since that was the case ... Today, he would cut the weeds and eliminate the roots!Moreover, Wu Shan was in cloud sky's territory, and there were many people surrounding him. It was also a problem, so he had to kill Wu Shan.Neo martial was indeed a big problem.Emperor Cang could move with neo martial, and human king and emperor Cang could combine their powers. For the four-sided domain, there was no need for such a hidden danger.

Chapter 3042 Abnormally Strong (3)_5
Everything was fake, only benefits were real.At this moment, the master of Scarlet sun also raised his eyebrows slightly.Not bad!In fact, he didn't care how many worlds neo martial destroyed. The key was that neo martial was indeed a big problem. The key was that at this moment, three level Seven venerable sovereigns suddenly made a move. In addition, there was the human King and the Senlan realm Lord ...In addition, there were Emperor Cang and sun god who had not shown up.There were a total of seven advanced venerable sovereigns!In addition, the Son of God of light was also entangled with them ...This was indeed a great hidden danger!The master of Scarlet sun was deep in thought when suddenly, the power of the great Dao in his body trembled slightly. A faint message was transmitted, and the next moment, his expression changed.Not only him.At this moment, some venerable sovereigns in the sky also received the message. A venerable sovereign from the chiyang region suddenly changed his expression. His world was not far from the scorching sun World.At this moment, the experts of the realm were asking him for help, asking him to quickly return.Something big had happened!In the next moment, the rank seven venerable sovereign's expression changed and he shouted,""Not good, neo martial has launched a surprise attack on the scorching sun World. The scorching sun has been destroyed, and neo martial might sweep across the chiyang region ..."“……”All the venerable sovereigns in the surroundings were shocked!What?The seventh level venerable sovereign didn't even look back. He flew away and shouted,""Supreme Emperor Chi Yang, neo martial artists want to seize the power of extreme yang. It's said that a neo martial Supreme has also entered the seventh tier. Three great seventh-tier Masters joined forces and seized the scorching sun in an instant!"Venerable sovereign Chi Yang wasn't that worried at first.The information he had received wasn't as complete as the enemy's because the Scarlet sun region was further away. At this moment, his expression suddenly changed.What?Three level Seven?Red Moon master, seeing this, immediately shouted,""Let's join forces to kill the human King first, then deal with neo martial ..."He could tell that this guy was leaving!At this moment, he couldn't leave. He had to kill the human King first.The master of crimson sun swept his gaze over them. The power of a human King was strong, no weaker than an ordinary rank eight. There were also four rank seven venerable sovereigns and Wu Shan, who was at the peak of rank seven.Hong Yue was seriously injured, but she was only comparable to Wu Shan.Cloudsky, Deepsea, and himself might not be able to take them down quickly. Even if the Dragon Master made a move, the situation of the light Thearch was still unknown ... He didn't have time to delay!Although the chiyang region was powerful, he wasn't there. If he was really attacked by the neo martial artists, even if he killed the human King at this moment, he would be in deep trouble. His expression didn't change. He looked at the great Dao universe that had cracked open in the sky. It seemed that it had not recovered ...Since he had not recovered, there was no need to rush.He didn't say anything else. In an instant, he disappeared from his spot. The power of his great Dao surged and he disappeared. The Lord of the clouds 'expression changed."Chi Yang!"Damn it!Do you think you can leave just like that?The master of Scarlet sun didn't care at all."You guys can wait, but I can 't. If we fight, it'll easily cause a big problem."The searing Sun World had actually been broken through in an instant.He recalled some of the previous rumors. On the side of neo martial arts, because the human King had resurrected a large number of dead cultivators, there was insufficient Yang Qi and they could not enter rank-8 ... At this moment, once the neo martial arts absorbed the scorching sun, if they entered rank-8 ... Or a new rank-7 was born, it would be a big problem.The master of crimson sun left without a word.He didn't mention anything about besieging the human King.The cloud Master quickly looked at the Dragon Master!The Dragon Master was incomparably majestic at the moment, and the Dragon Qi on his body was vigorous. He glanced at the crowd, and his eyes faintly carried some fiendish Qi. Neo martial ... Was really a big problem!Within two years, the seventh major world had been destroyed!This was a huge problem!If they could destroy the human King today, that would be pretty good."Dragon Master, I heard that the ultimate yang energy in the Vajra realm isn't weak!" Wu Shan suddenly said."Wushan, what do you mean?" the Dragon Master's eyes were cold.Wu Shan smiled."Don't ask me. I don't know the situation. I just heard it from others."The diamond World was not the dragon world.However, once the new martial arts swept over, Dragon World would also be in trouble.At that moment, the cloud master's expression changed slightly. Very quickly, he snorted coldly,""What a joke! New martial was still in the chiyang region, which was very far from the Dragon field. Even if he really wanted to, he wouldn't have arrived so quickly. You actually used neo martial to destroy the world and threaten the Dragon Master. It was indeed the right choice for the cloud world to expel you. Otherwise, you would have brought me, cloud world, to a dead end sooner or later!"At the next moment, he shouted loudly,"world overlords, the primal Chaos has been quiet for many years. Now that a new martial has appeared, it will be turbulent!" In a short time, Seven Worlds were destroyed. They were all great worlds. Everyone might be the target of neo martial! The next one might be you or me ... If we don't kill the neo martial artist King and the Devils hidden in the various realms like Wushan, the chaos will face a catastrophe sooner or later!"Since Chi Yang had left, he would contact more world Lords and join forces to attack these people!He shouted again,"these people can break open tianfang universe at will. We won't be stationed in tianfang all the time. If tianfang revives, they might be the first to truly seize tianfang universe and become the master of a level-nine universe!" When that happens, you'll no longer be able to restrict her, and she'll become a rogue cultivator ... Do you all think you're stronger than her?"Red Moon master was slightly unhappy, but she did not say anything.Right now, they might not have enough strength to deal with these people. Perhaps ... They could join forces to kill them today. Otherwise, they would be a great threat!The Lord of the clouds appearing at this moment was what he wanted. Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  The Dragon Master was still hesitating. Supreme Emperor Yunxiao looked at the Supreme Emperor of light and shouted coldly,""Light, your world of light has a strong power of yang. If the new martial artists are not satisfied after swallowing the sun, are you going to use your world of light to feed them?"

Chapter 3043 Abnormally Strong (3)_6
Light Thearch frowned slightly.In his eyes, neo martial ... Was indeed a disaster.It was very troublesome!This group of people was too aggressive.Although it was Hong Yue who had taken the initiative to pick a fight ... Everyone had the mentality of sympathizing with the weak. The current Hong Yue was so miserable. The world was destroyed, the great Dao was shattered, and she had been reduced to an itinerant cultivator. Now, she was seriously injured.On the other hand, for neo martial ...He glanced at his son's side. Including Wu Shan, there were three more seventh-rank cultivators.One of them ... Must be venerable the sword?They could open tianfang universe at will! Obviously, the sword venerable had left the great path universe in advance to attack the red moon. To be able to enter Level Seven, he must have devoured the great path universe and had enough energy to complete his advancement.In the past, all parties were relatively balanced.But now, the existence of neo martial arts had broken this balance. The main thing was that neo martial arts always brought the world with them and had the home advantage. Without the home advantage, they could only compete with their strength.And these guys were clearly not weak.As he was thinking, his eyes flickered. He saw his son and another fifth level venerable sovereign approaching a seventh level venerable sovereign. Qi Shui?He frowned.What was he doing?Of course, with me here, Qi Shui probably wouldn't dare to touch them, but ... Why are you two approaching her?Son, you seem to have made some progress this time.Had he entered the peak of the sixth step?As for his son's friendship with the Silver Moon King, he didn't care much about it. This was a matter of the bigger picture, a matter of light and good. His son's friendship wasn't worth mentioning!He was just considering that after annihilating the human King ... Neo martial was still missing. Would the other party ... Fight to the death with Guangming?After all, it was said that there were three venerable sovereigns there.Human Kings weren't weaklings either. If they were to fight to the death, they might even be able to kill a tier 8!The light Emperor was still hesitating.He was weighing the pros and cons.Not far away, the human King just looked at everyone silently. He looked around, then his eyes fell on cloudy sky, and finally looked at Red Moon master. These people were discussing, discussing how to kill him ...Do they think I'm deaf?Although they are at the eighth step and I am only at the peak of the seventh step ... Is the gap that big?Cloudsky was still trying to convince everyone when the human King suddenly laughed. His laughter was a little arrogant. He glanced at the master of the clouds and laughed,""Are you done?"The cloud master's expression turned cold.The human King walked towards him step by step. The aura on his body suddenly rose crazily. At this moment, it attracted the attention of countless people. The human King was getting stronger and stronger, and his aura was getting more and more ferocious!Yin and yang Qi appeared on his body, and the two extremes merged!The power of Emperor Cang!Vaguely, he had even broken through the barrier of the seventh step, but it seemed to be restricted."You're more annoying than the red moon!"The human King dragged his long blade, his eyes filled with coldness and madness."You shameless thing, Who Do You Think You Are? you ... Are you worthy of killing me?" In the next moment, it was as if a world had exploded in his body.An extremely majestic power instantly erupted!Emperor Cang's power swept over and in an instant, the human King seemed to have broken through the barrier and stepped into tier 8. He slashed out with his saber!The cloud Master was shocked!So strong!In the next moment, he was overjoyed. What an arrogant human King!It was a good thing!The more Savage he was, the more everyone was afraid.You're so crazy ... Who wouldn't be afraid of you?BOOM!The blade light seemed to split the entire heaven and earth, and the sky was torn apart. The Lord of the clouds roared, and the great path universe appeared. There were thousands of cloud mountains, but countless of them were instantly shattered!The strike of the human King was ridiculously strong. If it was a tier 7, it would be normal for him to be killed in one strike.He was too strong!BOOM! Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  Even the cloud Master couldn't suppress it. The power of 10000 paths collapsed, and the entire great path universe trembled violently. His expression changed. How could he be so strong?A human King was only at the seventh rank!"Alright, at this moment, it's as if I've broken through a barrier. But even so, the level 8 that we've combined our strength with is only at the initial stage. I'm a true level 8!"On the side, Red Moon master did not watch the show.In an instant, he also made his move. However, the three experts of Wushan all charged at him at the same time. In the darkness of Lizhu, a majestic force appeared. The sword Master split the world in all directions!Thearch Wushan stirred the heaven and earth threads, and a sea of mist surrounded him ...The other venerable sovereigns were still observing. The Dragon Master was ready to make a move, and no one knew who he was going to deal with. The radiant sovereign was also observing, but he was more observing his son.There was no doubt that human Kings were very strong. However, it was not that easy to kill a rank eight.Let's see first!As for her son ... What was he trying to do?……At this moment, venerable sovereign Qi Shui also frowned slightly.She glanced at the two people who seemed to be passing by not far away. She knew one of them, Ming Tang, the son of the radiant Thearch ... He was not to be trifled with. She was not afraid of him, he was only at the sixth rank. The key was that the radiant Thearch was here.Otherwise, she would have slapped a Tier 6 brat who dared to get close to her.As for the other Tier 5 ... She pretended not to see him.Too weak, not worth paying attention to.At this moment, she was also looking over at the scene of the battle. She wanted to act against Wu Shan because she had offended him before. Not only that, she also wanted to kill the Senlan realm Lord and had offended the human King ...Now that the human King was so fierce, she was also a little afraid, even afraid.The human King was too arrogant and too powerful!At this moment, he was actually somewhat suppressing the Lord of clouds.

She looked around. There should be a few other seventh rank venerable sovereigns who had the same thought as her ... At this moment, as long as the two eighth rank venerable sovereigns made a choice, they would attack soon."Emperor Qi Shui ..."An empty voice came into his ears.Qi Shui turned his head and looked over. His eyes were cold, but he quickly returned to normal. Since the radiance Thearch was here, he still had to give him face."It's mingtang ...""Don't hang out with Wu Shan and his gang. They're all cancer of chaos ..."She smiled.Kong Ji nodded.The next moment, he smiled. Suddenly, a world of Nirvana appeared and enveloped the surroundings.In just an instant, Qi water Thearch felt that something was wrong.It was a little shocking!You ... Are you crazy?She didn't care about Kong Ji and subconsciously looked at the light Thearch."You want to deal with me, light?"Did you guys team up with neo martial? Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  Just as he was thinking about it, his expression suddenly changed. At this moment, it was as if thousands of worlds appeared in the sky, and an incomparably majestic force instantly descended from the sky!Hundreds of realms instantly pressed down.A long river appeared!Li Hao and Kong Ji's goal was simple. They wanted to kill a fence-sitter like Qi Shui to intimidate everyone. Killing a tier 7 wouldn't intimidate anyone ... But Kong Ji had made his move, representing the light!The divine light plane's attitude was unclear, but it was enough to terrorize everyone!Hurry!The others didn't even have time to react.In an instant, the firmament shattered, and the path chess seemed to appear instantly. A universe pressed down directly, and the power of the path chess swept over.Li Hao roared!Ten thousand DAOs transformed into a net, and the huge net enveloped him. The long sword merged with ten thousand worlds, and the sword slashed down!Kong Ji also let out a roar. Life and death Nirvana, the realm collapsed. The two middle-stage venerable sovereigns both erupted with incomparably strong power!Thearch Qi water was shocked!At first, they were afraid of the light Thearch and were looking at him. However, at this moment, they suddenly realized that something was wrong!These two weren't ordinary intermediate-level!Not far away, the light Thearch's eyes flickered. He sensed something and instantly looked at Li Hao and the others. In the blink of an eye, he suddenly turned to look at the Dragon Master. The Dragon Master was about to attack, but his expression suddenly changed and he looked at the light.The radiance Thearch was speechless.He glanced at the Dragon Lord and transmitted a message,""My son is my son ..."He wanted to say that it had nothing to do with him!But would the Dragon Lord believe it?He obviously didn't believe it!At this moment, the Dragon Master was instantly filled with fear. Even light neo martial had joined forces!This was big trouble!"Great Nirvana!""Die!" Kong Ji roared as all the power of his great Dao was instantly consumed. The world shattered and the heavens and earth were destroyed!"Light, descend!"The universe of light emerged. In an instant, countless amounts of light energy were absorbed by him ... At this moment, the radiant master was in an awkward position. Should I ... Suppress it or not?Since he was here, the light universe had also covered this place.His son had left, but not completely. Otherwise, how could he cultivate the two extremes of light and darkness?At this moment, he was drawing countless light power to recover himself. Should he stop him or not?Stop ... Our son is in trouble.If he didn't stop her ... Didn't that mean that he had ordered her to do so?This B * stard ... Was he really that deceptive?Forget it, it's just Qi Shui, I'm not afraid of her!He thought for a moment. If he didn't stop him, why should he? his son had grown up. He dared to lay his hands on a seventh-rank Alchemist. How ruthless! This psychological change only lasted for a moment, and Thearch Qi Shui was shocked. The great Nirvana of void was not weak. In an instant, it seemed like all the DAOs had been destroyed. The key was that at this moment, light descended and they were instantly restored!This ...The waves surged up to the sky. She quickly counterattacked and suddenly slashed down with her sword!She wasn't afraid of the sword. Although it was strong, it wasn't a match for her. But at that moment, a cat suddenly appeared, holding a star. In an instant, it was as if the water had been suppressed.It froze for a moment!BOOM!The longsword instantly slashed down, and the power of hundreds of realms appeared, causing a loud explosion!Thearch Qi Shui's face was filled with disbelief. My Dao was frozen for a moment ... With a crack, her body shattered, and she instantly recovered, turning into a long river. The long river of the great Dao appeared. 10,000 DAOs converged!With some disbelief and anger, she roared,""You guys ..."The next moment, Li Hao's consumed great Dao was instantly recovered. A small flower appeared in his mouth. He swallowed it and, without saying anything, the power of destruction and the power of emptiness appeared together!The two of them instantly merged their great DAOs and shouted in unison!"Nirvana!"BOOM!Heaven and earth trembled, and the entire River instantly entered a state of silence. Li Hao and Kong Ji were both extremely weak.At this moment, Qian Wuliang, celestial pole, Huai King, Hong Yitang, and black Panther all emerged from Li Hao's River. They were a group of weaklings that Level 7 experts wouldn't even pay attention to.At this moment, they attacked at the same time, hitting the river of great Dao!Crack!A section of the Dao River instantly shattered!"Save ..."Qi Shui recovered and was about to roar, but in the next second, the infinite worlds appeared again. With a boom, countless worlds exploded, and the long river collapsed.Li Hao's face was completely pale!There were too many people and it wasn't convenient to use time. He could only let second cat use it for a short time. It was difficult to kill a rank seven!However ... Regardless of the price, it was not impossible.Dozens of worlds were shattered!His life seemed to have come to an end. He had been on the verge of death from using time again and again, but this time, he had simply accelerated it."Empty!"Li Hao shouted in a low voice. Kong Ji's eyes turned sharp, and he roared again,""Kill!"Light and darkness instantly converged, and life and death appeared.A star instantly turned into a realm, and a Dao net began to weave, covering all directions. In an instant, the Dao net covered the long river, and with a loud bang, the Dao net broke, and the Dao River inside was instantly destroyed!Kong Ji continued to vomit blood and looked up at the sky."Father, the treatment ..."“……”The radiance Thearch was speechless. In an instant, an extremely powerful power of light emerged and Kong Ji, who had just been seriously injured, instantly recovered.At this moment, the radiant sovereign felt that he had no way of explaining himself.Bang! Bang!The sound of an explosion rang out, the great Dao fluctuated, and the long river shattered!"Light!" Venerable sovereign Qi Shui's afterimage roared,"light!"The light Thearch was speechless. 'It has nothing to do with me. I didn't kill you. You ... You've really wronged me. I didn't expect that you would be killed by a group of people under the seventh level!'Feeling helpless, he coughed lightly and the power of his great Dao instantly erupted!BOOM!The afterimage exploded instantly!He was speechless. He looked around and saw the seventh rank venerable sovereigns. He thought for a while and said slowly,""It has nothing to do with me ..."It was true!"I was just too lazy to listen and destroyed the other party's remains. The other party has already been killed.The surroundings were silent!On the other side, the Dragon Master's face changed completely. Light really joined forces with new martial.Also, light's son and that rank five venerable sovereign ... These people were ridiculously strong. They had actually surrounded and killed a rank seven venerable sovereign!How was that possible?BOOM!A flash of blade light reflected the void. The cloud Master was suddenly sent flying, his body covered in blood and filled with shock!The human King had completely suppressed him!And at this moment, the human King was dragging his blade as he moved, looking extremely cold.When the cloud Master saw this, he was shocked. How could he be so strong?At this moment, the radiant sovereign and the Dragon Lord were frowning as well.Something was wrong!Cloudsky was actually being suppressed so miserably!Why?The human King suddenly laughed."My neo martial ... Has a few more Level Seven. Not bad!" It seems like ... Today, only I can kill you. You can't kill me. Guangming, join forces and kill them all. We'll split the square domain evenly!"“……”The radiant sovereign wanted to say,"F * ck you!"He endured it!This time, I've been screwed over by my son!

Chapter 3045 The New Master Of Tianfang
The seventh rank venerable sovereigns around them all looked solemn.Before this, everyone was watching the show, waiting for the right time ...However, before the battle between the seventh and the eighth step had even been decided, light's son had joined forces with the Silvermoon King to kill Qi Shui. This was inconceivable.The Silver Moon King!Some people recognized him, but not Li Hao. They knew that the Silver Moon King was on good terms with the Son of God of light, and it was said that he had once killed the Level 4 wandering cultivator Ming Hao. Now that he had made a move, many people had guessed his identity.,m However, he didn't expect the Silver Moon King to be at the fifth step!As for the fifth rank, it was actually not much.However, the strength that the other party had displayed ... Was somewhat shocking. It had exceeded quite a number of sixth step cultivators and could even fight against peak sixth step cultivators.In this battle, the human King was incomparably powerful and defeated Yun Xiao.In fact, no one was too surprised.What was truly surprising was that Li Hao and Kong Ji, together with some third and fourth-level venerable sovereigns, had actually killed a seventh-level venerable sovereign. This was even more unbelievable.There was a chasm between Tier 6 and tier 7!This was not the difference between the fifth and sixth step, but the difference between the sixth and the seventh step.At this moment, the venerable sovereigns became extremely solemn.There were many venerable sovereigns present, many of them at Level Seven, but a portion of the Scarlet sun region had run away, worried that something would happen to the Scarlet sun region. Qi Shui had been killed, Red Moon master was in danger, and cloud Master had been defeated ...At this moment, there were only two people who could change the overall situation.The Dragon Lord and the radiant sovereign!If these two tier 8 experts and Yao yang, who was also at the peak of tier 7, had joined the battle, the three of them would have been enough to change the situation. But now ...What was the situation with the radiant sovereign?Did he form an alliance with new martial arts?Voidness didn't represent the world of light, but when voidness killed Qi Shui, the radiant sovereign tacitly agreed, and even helped out a little ... This was his attitude.On Li Hao's side, there were three at the 7th step, and two of them could kill a powerhouse at the 7th step if they joined forces.With Senlan master, they could fight a level eight human King ...If the Lord of Light and Supreme Emperor Yao yang joined them, they would have a force equivalent to eight advanced powerhouses, two of whom were at the eighth-rank.With all the venerable sovereigns present swarming like bees, it was natural that they would win. Besides them, there were many other venerable sovereigns here, close to a dozen of them at the seventh rank and a few at the eighth rank.But ... They had never discussed it before, and no one could be the link, so how could they cooperate?Some people didn't feel like they needed to be involved. In the world, there were already seventh level venerable sovereigns who had left quietly. When someone saw this scene, his expression changed slightly and he left immediately. As for the human King, he chuckled and said with disdain,""What? why are you running? Qi Water World was only a level 7 world. Did it have a level 9 incense? We'll continue to stay here and keep an eye on them. Today, we might have the chance to touch the bottom of a rank 8 world!"“……”In an instant, some people who had not thought of this before suddenly came to a realization!Qi Water World! Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  That's right, Thearch Qi Shui was dead.There was no rank seven master in the qishui world now, and he might be hiding nearby.In an instant, at least five or six seventh rank venerable sovereigns escaped.He might not be able to get any benefits here.However, it was the Qi Water World!A great world without a level 7 world was like a pie in the sky. They knew that this place was extremely dangerous and from the looks of it, tianfang universe had indeed not opened!This was the benefit of killing a Type 7.The rank 7 Lords all knew what to do. Of course, they would go and take Qi Water World.In total, seven or eight venerable sovereigns had escaped.It wasn't that the remaining people weren't interested. It was just that those guys were faster than them. They were obviously much slower. If they followed them, there was a high chance that they wouldn't be able to pick up any advantages. Actually ... They had their own plans.If these two sides were to fight, perhaps ... He could really pick up an advantage.At this moment, Li Hao also took the initiative to speak. Although he was weak, he snickered."The Crimson Moon is gone, but ... Cloudsky is still there! The Lord of the clouds is here, senior Wushan has left, and the deep sea Thearch is also here. In such a huge eighth-tier universe, there are two seventh-tier Masters keeping watch ... If three to five seventh-tier Masters were to gather and break into an eighth-tier universe, they would be able to eat their fill. We just ate the Crimson Moon and gave birth to two seventh-tier Masters! It even allowed senior Wushan to fully recover, making him equivalent to three rank 7s ... It was a very full meal!""Bastard!"The moment these words were said, the cloud Master was furious and shouted coldly,""You are the new king of the Silver Moon? At such a young age, his heart was already vicious! Wushan, you were born in the clouds, but you actually incited others to attack the clouds. You demon, you've been harboring evil intentions for a long time!"At this moment, he wanted to retreat.It was a fact that cloudsky only had two tier 7 experts holding down the fort.At this moment, he saw that it was somewhat difficult to take down the other party. He was even being suppressed badly by the human King, and the Dragon Master was unwilling to participate in the battle ... This made him a little annoyed. It was difficult for the human King to kill him, but once he was really entangled, would there really be lunatics who would dare to attack cloudsky?There was no trace of the new martial, three rank-7s from the light side were holding the fort, Supreme Emperor Chi Yang had returned, and only the Dragon Lord had come. In the entire rank-8 world of the four-sided region, he, Yun Xiao, was the easiest to attack!If it was before, no one would dare to.However, Red Moon had learned her lesson. The Silver Moon King and his group had been able to take them down, and ... They had even given birth to three seventh level venerable sovereigns. One could only imagine how rich an eighth level world was!As Li Hao spoke, the human King sneered. The next moment, he dragged his saber and charged toward the cloud Lord, laughing. "I'll hold this grandson back. It's hard to kill him, but it's not hard to hold him back so that he can't return. If you break through the clouds today and meet him in the chaos the next day, I'll spare your lives!"

Chapter 3046 Tianfang's New Master
In the void.There was a faint fluctuation.The chaos did not care about friendship, only interests.New martial artists were hard to find, and human Kings were hard to kill. In that case ... It was better to go to Yunxiao's side and take a look. If there was no chance, then forget it. But if ... There was?What if the human King really held the other party back and prevented him from returning? Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  Two tier 7 beings were not as good as three light beings. Moreover, the light Lord did not participate in the battle and could escape at any time. In that case ... Cloudsky was too fragrant!At this moment, the void fluctuated.In the dark, more than one seventh level venerable sovereign had left. Perhaps they had reached some agreement in secret. In an instant, several more venerable sovereigns had left.As for the cloud Master, his expression changed drastically!Bastard!These bastards, are they crazy?Would they dare to attack a level 8 world?There were still two tier 7 experts guarding the world. Without three or four tier 7 experts, it would be difficult to break through the clouds. Didn't they know that?Cloudsky had the geographical advantage!In the next moment, the cloud Master could no longer sit still. He tore open the void and his great Dao appeared. It was obvious that he was about to leave.p "You dare to run?" the human King shouted in anger.The long saber swept across the sky and the earth!At the same time, Red Moon master suddenly exploded. With a boom and an explosion, she broke through the restrictions. She was covered in blood, and her great Dao was broken. The power of her great Dao overflowed, but she drilled into the void and shouted,""Together!"The Lord of the clouds 'eyes moved slightly, but he did not stop him.Eighth-rank!What if Hongyue joins Yunxiao?Wu Shan's departure only meant that there was one less tier 7 ...Of course, it was too dangerous for a level eight to join them. There might be a situation where the two kings would fight. However, the current situation was too complicated. An additional level eight might ... Bring many benefits.His heart moved, but he did not stop Hong Yue from entering his own great path universe. Although it was somewhat dangerous, an internal strife at this moment would obviously give the human King and the others a chance. Hong Yue was not stupid. If they fought now, the result would be that both of them would be finished.The human King roared!In fact ... It was very empty.He had suppressed and even forced a tier 8 to retreat. In reality, he was only a tier 7, not a tier 8. To be able to fight above his tier at this level showed how strong a human King was ... However, at this moment, he was an arrow at the end of its flight.If the fight continued, he didn't have the ability to keep a rank eight.If there were, with his personality, he would have killed them long ago.He didn't have the time to waste on the other party!Seeing that the two of them had escaped, the deep sea venerable sovereign also instantly escaped towards the void great Dao. The boss had already left, and if he stayed, wouldn't he be courting death?There were too many venerable sovereigns here. Wu Shan, the sword venerable, and Li Zhu didn't stop him. The human King was too far away to stop him, not to mention Li Hao and Kong Ji.It was a good thing that these people had escaped.At this moment, if they continued to fight, the radiant sovereign's attitude would be unclear. Who knew what he was thinking?Just as everyone was feeling at ease.On the other side, sector Lord Sen Lan's eyes were filled with ruthlessness. He had been fighting with Deepsea all this while. Because she had inherited a lot of the energy from Wu Shan, her strength had increased greatly, and she was much stronger than him.She had been suppressing him all along, making him powerless.At this moment, the two level eights entered the great path universe first, while Deepsea was a little slower.Sector Lord Sen LAN suddenly grinned.His eyes were filled with coldness."Boundless nature!""Die!" A loud shout resounded through the heavens and earth. The world suddenly changed, turning into hell.A limitless world appeared like 18 levels of hell, covering the entire area. Sector Lord Sen LAN hollered and his body exploded, turning into a limitless world.The boundless nature was a killing array and also a killing array.At this moment, for some unknown reason, he suddenly used his physical body to transform into a world and shattered his physical body. It was as if he wanted to forcefully stay in the deep sea. This change was beyond everyone's expectations.When two Grade 7s fought, it was actually very hard to determine life and death.Not to mention, both sides clearly didn't want to continue fighting. The other party had also fled ... Sector Lord Sen LAN, why did you suddenly act like this?In the sky, a realm appeared.The Asura hell trapped the deep sea Sovereign in an instant. The deep sea Sovereign turned pale with fright. He penetrated the void, but he could not break this world. On the other side, cloud sky Master, who had just entered the great path universe, was waiting for the deep sea to come in. He would close the universe and return to the cloud sky.Who would've thought that the unassuming sector Lord Sen LAN would suddenly consume such a huge price and burn his body to trap the enemy!He was stunned for a moment, and then he wanted to leave the universe.This was Yun Xiao's seventh rank venerable sovereign!Red Moon master's expression changed slightly, and she quickly sent a message.""Hurry up and leave. I can't hold on any longer ... If you stay any longer, I'll definitely die. Once I die, can you ... Still escape?"What?Yun Xiao's expression changed. That would not do. That was a seventh rank venerable sovereign, a peak seventh rank venerable sovereign at that. In order to get rid of Wu Shan and obtain their consent, he had given a large amount of great Dao power to Deepsea.Once Deepsea was left behind, he would suffer a great loss!He turned around and was about to leave. He could not leave Deepsea behind. It was not because of his deep love for her, but because Yunxiao could not bear the loss of two seventh level spiritual masters. Otherwise, he would be the next red Moon sovereign!However, the moment he was about to go down, Red Moon master suddenly went straight into the inner part of the great path universe. Obviously, he would not stay. If he stayed, he would definitely die."You!"The cloud Master was shocked!If he went out, but this person didn't and stayed in the great Dao universe, an eighth-level venerable sovereign, even if he was injured, he could be held back for a while ... Once this grandson sneaked an attack on his origin of great Dao and seized the eighth-level great Dao universe, that would be a huge problem!

Chapter 3047 Tianfang's New Master
"Red Moon!"He roared in anger. Bastard, I saved your life, and you're treating me like this?Damn it!The trapped deep sea Thearch also saw that Thearch Yunxiao was about to come out. He was about to heave a sigh of relief, but the next moment, his face changed and he roared,""Red Moon!"Animals!Damn, bastard, why would the realmlord let him into the Dao universe?……Li Hao and the others had not expected this series of changes.They hadn't thought about what to do ... In the end, cloudsky had led a Wolf into the house.In fact, if Red Moon had not run away and had stayed behind to attack together with cloudy sky, breaking the Asura hell and taking deep sea away, it would have been very difficult for the human King and the others to hold her back. With the three of them working together, the human King would have been somewhat powerless, unless the radiant sovereign made a move.But ...What was going on?The human King was dumbfounded. He looked at Red Moon master. This guy ... What a fraud!Of course, it was normal for the other party to be afraid of death after being seriously injured.But ... The Lord of the clouds saved your life. He even brought you into the Dao universe and teleported you away ... And this is how you repay him?The human King was stunned, and so were the others.We haven't even done anything yet! Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  In the next moment, the human King, venerable sword, and Lizhu ...Except for Wu Shan, who was a little hesitant, everyone suddenly went crazy. Even the human King didn't care if his weakness was discovered, including the weak Li Hao and Kong Ji. It was as if they had seen a piece of fat meat!Everyone erupted together and charged towards the Asura prison!Oh my God, I can still pick up a piece of meat?Peak of the seventh rank, not bad!At this moment, the other party didn't even have the time to extract the power of the great Dao. At the very least, the energy that Wu Shan had lost previously could be returned. Wu Shan even had a little hope of stepping into level eight ...Of course, it was not in everyone's consideration at the moment.One kill, one less!"Kill!"Sword Saint didn't even bother to hide his identity anymore. His seventh-rank longevity sword will burst out madly and was extremely powerful. This sword was even more powerful than ever before. He was so excited that he felt like he had seen a peerless beauty.On Li Hao's side, a River also surged out.The deep sea Thearch's face had already turned pale with fear as he roared,"Sector Lord!"The cloud Master was in a difficult position. He roared,""Dragon Lord, help me once ..."The Dragon Lord was restless. Helping once was fine too. It was a favor, after all, and he definitely had to return it.As he was thinking, he suddenly felt something. Not far away, the radiant God and the brilliant sun Thearch seemed to be staring at him. The Dragon Master's expression changed slightly, and he disappeared from where he was in an instant. The great path universe appeared and he escaped into it.Forget it!It wasn't worth it.Once something happened to Yunxiao, Hong Yue's grandson would snatch the other party's great Dao universe. This grandson would not acknowledge any favors."Bastard!" Cloud Master cursed and turned around again. Red Moon Emperor had already entered the great path universe. It would be very troublesome to drive him out now. Cloud Master gritted his teeth and turned around to leave!Seeing this, the deep sea Thearch's face was instantly filled with despair. He roared loudly,"Wushan!"At this moment, he could only place his hopes on Wushan.The realmlord is gone!Only Wushan can save me.The corner of monarch Wushan's mouth rose slightly, but he didn't make a move. He just shrugged slightly as if to say ..."It has nothing to do with me. I'm not a monarch of Yunxiao.""Wushan! You betrayer ..."The deep sea Thearch roared and punched out with a loud boom. The Asura hell trembled continuously and Wu Shan felt helpless.I feel quite wronged when you say this.You betrayed me, and I didn't even settle the score with you. Now, Yunxiao has given up on you, Senlan has trapped you, and Hongyue has dragged you down ...You don't even scold these people, but you scold me?p Was the kind bullied?The others joined forces to kill you, but I just stood there and watched. I didn't even move, and you're scolding me?Wu Shan felt very helpless. He chuckled. Although he was a bit further away, he suddenly stretched out his hand, causing a mountain to appear in the air. He touched the mountain, and a sea appeared within it.The moment the sea area appeared, it seemed to form a connection with the cloud world. Venerable Lord cloud heaven, who was sealing off the great path universe, changed his expression slightly. The next moment, a huge star in the cloud world seemed to be stirred.BOOM!The great star trembled. It was in the deep sea of Sen Luo hell when it suddenly vomited blood with disbelief. As for Wu Shan, he chuckled. "You've absorbed the power of my great Dao and you're still scolding me?"I'm innocent!It's only been a few days since you absorbed my great Dao's power. Have you digested it?You dare to provoke me?Bully me?Wasn't bullying him once enough? he wanted to do it again?BOOM!The vast star trembled, and so did Deepsea. With a crack, the Asura hell shattered. At the same time, a blade, a sword, and a book fell.The next moment, the river appeared and the Nirvana world exploded.The deep sea Thearch's body was instantly shattered and turned into dust.The power of countless great DAOs overflowed and headed straight for the great Dao universe, as if they hoped to return to the great Dao universe. Wu Shan smiled."I told you, that's my power ..."His five fingers were like sharp blades, piercing into the sea in front of him.BOOM!The power of the great Dao instantly dissipated, as if a force had appeared and was crazily backfiring. The next moment, a miserable scream rang out, and Deepsea roared in despair,""Wushan ... Beast!"“……”Monarch Wushan was helpless. This time, he was right.I'll admit it!But you scolded me first.There are so many people who want to kill you, so many people who want to set you up, yet you don't scold anyone but me first ... Otherwise, I might not have interfered.

Chapter 3048 The New Master Of Tianfang
But now ... He was not wrong.BOOM!The power of the great path collapsed in an instant. In the great path universe of the clouds, a star was instantly destroyed and exploded with a rumble. Lord of red clouds 'expression changed. He looked at Wu Shan with a complicated expression.He instantly closed the great path universe and completely disappeared.Wushan ... Was retaliating!In their impression, Wu Shan would not retaliate.In their minds, including Deepsea, they thought that they knew Wu Shan very well. Even if they scolded him, it would be fine. Wu Shan might even feel bad and save them.But ... He didn 't.Separated from the clouds, Wu Shan seemed to have changed. In the past, it was because they were all on the same side, colleagues, and friends of hundreds of thousands of years. If he could suffer some losses, he would. Otherwise, as a peak seventh step, he didn't have to do everything by himself. The other seventh step cultivators could do it.However, Wu Shan was older, and considering that the other rank Sevens were not as strong as him, they would need more time to cultivate. Therefore, he did everything by himself.However, being a good person ... No one seemed to appreciate it.She felt that this was what he should do. On the contrary, she felt that he was giving her more power and she should be happy.Deepsea dared to scold him even though she did not dare to!Wu Shan chuckled. He looked at the void and silently watched the great path universe disappear. Yunxiao, I'm no longer Yunxiao and Wu Shan. I'm the Rogue cultivator Wu Shan. In the past, I helped everyone because I'm Wu Shan of Yunxiao!It's you guys who are too heartless!If you let me leave with the power of the seventh step, even if I die, I won't let anyone attack the clouds. If you want to break the clouds, kill me first!But you ... Abandoned me first!In the blink of an eye, cloudsky, Red Moon, Dragon Lord, and Chi Yang had all run away.Two venerable sovereigns, Deepsea and qishui, had been killed.Including the Crimson Moon, the scorching sun, and the two of them, the chaosverse had lost another eight high-level venerable sovereigns in just a few days.In addition to the previous few, in the past two years, 13 Level 7 venerable sovereigns had been missing!At this moment, a few seventh rank venerable sovereigns fled without looking back.At this time, Dao mark phantoms appeared in monarch Sen Lan's body.Li Hao frowned slightly. Although he was very satisfied after killing a venerable sovereign, he couldn't help but say,""Senior Sen LAN, there's no need to take the risk to make him stay ..."Although he had left the deep sea behind, it had been too dangerous.What are you doing, Senlan?Sector Lord Sen LAN didn't say anything, he turned into a shadow and looked at the human King,""Human ruler, the portion of this person's great Dao that belongs to me, as well as the portion that killed the Lord of the endless sky path, will all belong to you! This can be considered as repaying the human King for protecting me for three days ... If it's not enough, Senlan will help new martial arts again in the future!"The human King raised his brows slightly and glanced at him. Did he break his physical body and trap his opponent just to seize some power of the great path to repay me?He laughed, and his laugh was a little arrogant."I, Fang ping, have protected you for three days. Is that all you're worth?" The Sen LAN sector Lord was silent for a moment before nodding,""Human King's words are extremely true! If I have the chance, I will repay you again. "The human King laughed scornfully. Suddenly, a piece of paper appeared in his hand."There's no proof. Write down a loan receipt. You owe me a seventh-rank great world. It's equivalent to the money for your life! A trash from an eighth-tier universe at the seventh-tier isn't worth this price!"“……”The surroundings were silent.Even Li Hao was a little surprised, but he also felt that ... It was normal.He had once traveled to new martial arts. It seemed that ... The loan receipts in the hands of the human King could pile up into a mountain, especially the loan receipts signed by the Qin Emperor. One person's loan receipts could fill a room!The radiant sovereign hadn't expected this, and was rather surprised.Loan receipt?This new martial artist human King ... Was really unexpected!He didn't have the mood to care about them. He looked at Kong Ji and sent a message,""Come with me, you little brat, you're just messing around!"He felt somewhat helpless!To be honest, he felt that neo martial was a disaster and a problem. In fact, he had some ideas before. He wanted to join forces with others and eradicate neo martial. He knew very well that neo martial was a problem!In the end ... He was tricked by his son.It wasn't that he couldn't stop Kong Ji. In fact, it was quite simple. With a single slap, he could send Kong Ji flying. As a Tier 6, how could he resist?It was just that ... His son had grown up.He actually went against a tier 7!To tell the truth, he was so gratified, excited, and proud. My son had gone against the will of a seventh-rank!He really couldn't bear to stop them!But ... He was screwed. Neo martial was indeed a big trouble. Now, the outside world felt that he had joined forces with neo martial, which was more troublesome."Father, I've grown up. I'm not leaving. I want to stay at Tian Fang ... This time, we came to take Tian Fang. It seems like our plan succeeded. It was quite simple. We scared everyone away by killing two tier 7 experts ..."Go to hell!You call killing two tier 7 "s as simple as that? Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  You son of a B * tch ... Forget it, you little brat, do you know what you're saying?"The world of light dominates the chaos, and there are only five high-level venerable sovereigns. This is the limit that an ordinary eighth-level universe can accommodate. It's not that there can't be more, but if there are more ... We'll have to separate people from the world and become independent cultivators. However, in that case, the independent cultivators will no longer be under our control.Did you think it was easy to kill two rank 7s?"Tian Fang universe has yet to recover. What's the point of you staying here? you just caught everyone off guard today. Soon, everyone will make a comeback. Are you ... Waiting for death to come if you stay?""Father, I know what I should do! Father, you should go back first. Otherwise, Guangming will not be safe. Now, a group of venerable sovereigns are eyeing him covetously. The legend of being invincible in the eighth-rank universe has been destroyed from the red moon world! Father, if we don't go back now, Guangming will be in danger!"

Chapter 3049 The New Master Of Tianfang
艹!"Damn it!" Light Thearch cursed.He was a little angry, a little helpless, and also a little ... Gratified.My son!He was really amazing!As for Li Hao, the human King, and the sword Saint, none of them were as good as my son, who was a level 6 master fighting against a level 7 master. As for Li Hao's strength ... He didn't see it. He only saw his son, great Nirvana, and Qi Shui's death!However, staying in Tian Fang would be dangerous."You ..."He wanted to curse, but he thought about it and decided not to.He had no intention of conversing with the human King and quickly transmitted his voice,""If you don't leave ... I won't care about you! But you have to remember, you can't represent the light. The light doesn't belong to me alone, so don't mess around! I'll wait for the day when you'll cry and beg me to take you back!"As soon as he finished speaking, the void was broken and he escaped with Thearch Yao yang. Ren Wang looked at him and smiled, showing his teeth."Brother Guang Ming, let's talk more when we have time. I'll take care of your son, my nephew!"“……”The radiance Thearch ignored him and instantly disappeared.The human King laughed and after everyone left, he suddenly went limp. Venerable the sword quickly helped him up and couldn't help but Mutter, "You're messing around again! As soon as you opened your mouth, I knew you'd run out of energy again. They all say that my sword strikes miss, but you're no different from me now!"The human King laughed heartily."The closer you are to Vermillion, the redder you will be. Old man, congratulations. You've reached the seventh rank!" Hahaha!"Then, he turned to look at Li Zhu. The smile on his face disappeared, and he said calmly,""Old Li, you're at tier 7!"“……”The surrounding crowd was dumbfounded. The speed at which the human King changed his attitude was really fast. Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  Wasn't he also a neo martial artist?Li Zhu, however, was used to it. He said indifferently,""It's all thanks to the human King!""Stop it!"The human King laughed coldly,"I didn't expect you to become a seventh-rank magical beast. If you become a seventh-rank magical beast, nothing good will come out of it! But ... Don't worry, I'm almost at level 8. Even if you're at Level 7, you're useless. If you want to beat old Zhang to death, I have no objections. If you dare to hit others, I'll beat your father to death first!"“……”Li Zhu was speechless. After a moment of silence, he disappeared.He was too lazy to communicate with the human King.It was very tiring to communicate with the human King.You say East, he says West.If you say West, he'll say he'll hit your father!He couldn't beat your father, but he beat your big brother, your second brother ...In short, they could not communicate.He could at least communicate with a martial King."Hahaha!"The human King laughed again as he watched Li Zhu disappear into the regional wall. After laughing for a while, he finally turned to Wu Shan and nodded, showing his courtesy. He then looked at Li Hao ...This time, after watching for a while, he laughed. This time, old Li has entered the seventh tier. The matter of you asking me to help you block Hong Yue will be written off! Lizhu isn't counted, but this guy is my enemy. I won't appreciate it if he enters Level 7!""That day, I broke a world for you, a rank seven world. So, you still owe me a rank seven world!""Of course. You and I worked together to kill a venerable sovereign of the red moon. You gave me a chance to kill a rank seven venerable of the red moon and then broke into the red moon world ...""With this calculation, you and I are even once again!"Li Hao looked at him and nodded.The human King had a score to settle in his heart. This person was actually very legendary."But ..." The human King continued.Li Hao looked at him, and he looked back at Li Hao.""Silver Moon was separated from my neo martial. Silver Moon is now yours! It used to be old Li's fief. Now, we don't want it anymore. That place is actually very magical!"His eyes were slightly complicated, but they quickly returned to normal. "It's your good fortune to become the Silver Moon King! However, the Silver Moon is an extremely special place. It's separated from my neo martial, so ... I can give up the Silver Moon, but you have to use a seventh-tier universe to exchange for it! Is the Silver Moon worth a level-seven universe?"Li Hao nodded. It was worth it!Just based on one point-flowing time!"That's good, sign it!"The human King had taken out an IOU and handed it to Li Hao. He chuckled and said,""You and Senlan both owe me a seventh-level universe! I've paid it off, we're even!"After saying that, he threw out a lot of great Dao power.""This is the power of the sky horizon Dao master and the power of the deep sea that I just killed ... They're all trash. I'm not interested in them. They're not even comparable to a level-seven universe!"He would settle the accounts clearly and ask you to write an IOU clearly and clearly ...Be it Li Hao or sector Lord Sen LAN, at this moment, they were all extremely calm.That's good!It was best to make things clear.He liked people like the human King. He didn't beat around the bush and didn't try to be pretentious. He just took as much as he could. He had saved sector Lord Sen LAN and a seventh-level universe wouldn't be a problem. This was the value of a seventh-level master!He gave Silver Moon to venerable the sword, but venerable the sword didn't devour it and kept it. In the end, Li Hao took it ... Li Hao originally wanted to return Silver Moon to new martial. At worst, he would just wander around with the Silvermoon people.But now, the price of his opponent opening a level 7 great world ... Was worth it!Yes!It was pretty good.Thus, Li Hao signed the document without hesitation and said,""Do I need the great Dao to be my witness?""No need!"The human King was so straightforward that it was unimaginable. He laughed and said,""Just the IOU is fine. I won't pay it back ... Add interest, pay it back or not ... Ha ... Let's wait and see!"He laughed and looked at the crowd."Seize Tian Fang and control Tian Fang? What are you guys doing?""We hope to use the heaven's recipe to raise the Silver Moon!" Li Hao said."Oh ...""Yes!" The human King nodded and quickly said,"I should have stayed behind to help you ... But I probably can 't!"
