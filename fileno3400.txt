He would still go wherever he wanted to.His thoughts were a little mixed.It wasn't that he was thinking about whether it was good for them to be like this, but that ... He had broken through so many worlds. Actually, he had something more than the Dragon Lord and the human King. What he had more might be hypocrisy, or a trace of pity.His compassion for outsiders ... Therefore, whenever he conquered a world, he would care about it for a while. He would not just leave it be and let so many living beings die.As for the human King and the Dragon Lord, they actually did not care.They only cared about their own land.Perhaps ... This was hypocritical.Since he was in charge, he should have been more in charge instead of being thrown into the Queen's divine Kingdom. There was no society, no civilization, no agriculture, nothing, only ... Faith!In that case, it would be more straightforward to destroy the world.In fact, he had never thought of this before. Now, he had such a thought because there was no king Dali to gather these people who were unwilling to believe in him. Seeing countless people fall into hell and sink into hell ... Li Hao suddenly felt that something was wrong.Before this, he didn't really care about this.At this time, because the Twin realms had just been conquered, how could there be so many people who believed in the Queen? there were only a few. In the realm, there were tens of thousands, no, tens of billions of creatures, but none of them would believe in the Queen!This wasn't to save the human race, as the human race was doing pretty well in the Twin realms.It wasn't like the Dragon field, where many humans were willing to worship.In the Dragon field, he could still tell himself that he was saving someone, but here ... It was not.Li Hao fell into deep thought as he watched countless people sink into hell.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  After breaking through the Twin realm and the firmament realm, countless living beings had been gathered. Most of them had fallen into hell, and in the blink of an eye, hundreds of billions of living beings had appeared in this empty hell.It was terrifying!And the number of believers in the God Kingdom had reached a terrifying level, more than a trillion!So many living beings had actually lost their future.Yes, they actually had no future.Even if the people of the divine Kingdom seemed beautiful, in fact ... It was just an illusion.In essence, it was the same as hell, just that it looked more beautiful. If one were to sink into the illusions of the mind, one would starve to death sooner or later and become a pure body of the mind."What's wrong?"Kong Ji glanced at Li Hao. Seeing that he was staring at the Queen, he said telepathically,""Aren't you engaged? Are you thinking of marrying my second son?"Li Hao smiled, but his expression didn't change. He just sighed and said,""Brother Kong Ji ... Back in the Dragon field, we killed a large number of venerable sovereigns of the chaos race and said that we would save the human race ... You said that I was hypocritical, but it seems like I was telling the truth."Kong Ji was startled. "Too many worlds have been destroyed," Li Hao said."Humans and demons have lost their homes and become the puppets of the divine Kingdom. They have no future, no civilization, no life, nothing ... There's only ... Faith and no faith."Kong Jue was silent.This was inevitable.When a world was breached, it would usually be destroyed. It was already very rare to be able to preserve these living beings.The other worlds devoured each other, so who would deliberately save those people?It would be very difficult.Moreover, there was no place to put it.There were too many!The existence of a divine Kingdom was no small matter. Even Kong Ji found it rather inconceivable that it could hold so many people.Li Hao continued,"everyone yearns for freedom. In the past, it was still considered freedom in the native world, but now that we've entered the divine Kingdom, the area that we can move about in, be it believers or non-believers, is very small. There are people all around us, and there's nothing to play, enjoy, or learn. There's only an endless number of people ... Is this saving or destroying?""Brother Hao Yue, this is a very difficult problem to solve ..."Li Hao nodded."I know. So, I'm thinking about something!"Li Hao looked at the broken sword in his hand and said after a long time,""I wonder if I should try to open up a chaotic zone that is isolated from the world. Time will suppress everything and open up thousands of worlds ... I will place those people in it and develop my own civilization, my own era, my own world ... But now, the biggest problem is the source of life. Otherwise, even if I open it up, it will only be a cage!"With the source of life, one could give birth to their own life and spread civilization. This was the true world.However, without these, this group of people would be fine for a short period of time, but after a long time ... They would all die!Kong Ji was stunned and fell into deep thought.Establish the false chaos?p This ... Where was he going to open it?There was a world everywhere, so he had to find a safe place.This was the first reason. Second, Li Hao had yet to figure out anything about the source of life and the source of the world. How could he develop them?Putting billions of humans in it and letting them survive?That was a good idea.He might be the first generation of pioneers, but ... Would that work?It would also require an endless amount of energy and resources ...At this moment, Li Hao said,"I don't have much clue about the source of life. Even if I go back in time, it's easy to cause a great disaster. It might even cause the stars to collapse. However, the day I open it will be the day I reopen time!" I'm not afraid of that ... There's hope to solve the problem of the source of life, which is to trace back the source of life through time and recreate chaos ... But where should I start?"

Chapter 3401 Preparation (4)
At this moment, he still had the thought of opening up a chaos as soon as possible.Opening up would cause one to lose some things, but one would also gain many things.Comprehension, experience, ideas, and enlightenment of the great Dao.What he had left behind were just some external items of the current Qianjie.The square region within the Thunder region was actually a very good place, but unfortunately ... That was the Dragon Lord's territory, and the Lord of Tian Fang also had a territory there ...Thoughts kept appearing in his mind.It had happened before, but before, he had only thought about his own Dao. Now, he was thinking that he couldn't let this go on after taking in so many living beings and placing them all into his divine Kingdom ... In such a situation, it would be better to directly destroy them with the world.He quickly suppressed this thought.The Twin universes in front of him also started to collapse.Many worlds were devoured by the black leopard, and the black leopard's aura rose again. As for the Dao universe, it had already been devoured by the Dao chess and was being digested. The Queen had also absorbed countless creatures, in addition to the creatures from a seventh-level world. At this time, her aura had actually begun to transform towards the fifth-level.There were too many people!The speed of her advancement was extremely fast, but this way, she would have to endlessly absorb outsiders. At this moment, the Queen actually could not concentrate on managing her own divine fruits, and they were all shallow believers.Such believers were not as valuable as fanatical believers. Out of 10000 shallow believers, one fanatical believer might not be able to provide as much power of faith as 10000 shallow believers. On the contrary, they would make the God's kingdom more fragile.However, the Queen didn't say anything. At this moment, she was still immersed in the joy of gathering countless creatures and didn't think about these things for the time being.……Li Hao waited for a while. With a loud boom, the Twin universes in front of him completely collapsed, and the chess piece walked out. At this moment, the illusory image was no longer so illusory, but rather clear. A refined man walked out with a smile."Many thanks!"Dao Qi cupped his hands and looked at Li Hao with a smile.Many years later, he had finally recovered.Eighth-ranked power!As a tool spirit, he was probably the only one who had reached level eight. However, when the master of Tian Fang left, he didn't take him away but left him behind.Dao Qi didn't understand this point either.After a million years of consumption, he had fallen from level eight to Level Seven, and even to level six before. Now, after devouring the universe twice, he had finally recovered to his peak, level eight!Li Hao's group had killed a large number of experts in this battle, so they could only fulfill his wish.As for the Queen's advancement to Tier 5, the Black Panther's aura had stabilized since it had entered Tier 6, and Li Hao's advancement to tier 7, none of these were significant. In fact, it was not difficult for Li Hao to advance to tier 7. He had only advanced to tier 7 at the same time."You're too polite!"Li Hao also smiled."I've finally paid off another debt. I'm less stressed now. I've paid off my seniors and the human Emperor ... Now, I don't owe any more debts."What he owed was also Tian Fang.He had some interactions with Tian Fang's Coiling Dragon, Huo Yan, and Shui Ling, and he owed them some things. However, from the looks of it now, they were not worth much. They might have felt that they were very terrifying back then."Let's go. Let's return to the Thunder World first ..." Li Hao laughed bitterly."I was planning to go to the South to take a look ... But I have to go back before I can go far."The Thunderbolt master had been exposed. If his group left, the Thunderbolt master would be in trouble.Moreover, he had killed a rank eight venerable sovereign from the reincarnation realm.On Samsara's side, their strength was greatly reduced.Three rank eights and four rank Sevens had died ... But there was still a top rank eight venerable sovereign and ten rank seven venerable sovereigns. They were still a powerful force that the Thunderbolt master could not match.Taking advantage of the fact that the others had yet to join forces, the Thunder World might have to move.……Thunder World.The Thunderbolt master was also depressed. At the same time, he was also repairing the Thunder World and thinking ... What should he do now that he had been exposed?This time, with the help of a type 8 powerhouse, he finally understood that he was nothing.Whether it was the Dragon Master, the human King, or the reincarnation sovereign ... None of them were people he could fight against. Not to mention these people, even di yang, Fu Sheng, these sovereigns were not people he could fight against.All these people had been killed, and he was now exposed. He was the first to kill a level eight venerable sovereign ... It would be very troublesome.At this moment, Li Hao returned.The Thunderbolt master was overjoyed!He's back!He had not been too at ease before, but now that this person had returned, he was much more at ease.……Thunder World Great Hall.The group of people who hadn't gone out looked at Li Hao with excitement and helplessness. Didn't he say to keep a low profile?Why did he do such a big thing the moment he went out?  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ What happened to keeping a low profile?You said that the human King was causing trouble, but your ability to cause trouble is not much worse than the human King.At this moment, Li Hao exhaled and said,""The situation in chaos is very complicated ... The idea of discussing the Dao is actually a bit difficult in itself ..."Everyone was speechless. They should have expected this."I've returned this time because there are some problems that need to be resolved ..." Li Hao said again."I need everyone to make a decision with me!"Everyone looked at Li Hao, wondering who he was going to hit this time.Li Hao was silent for a while."Right now, chaos is in turmoil," he said."As for our side ... Let's count as a group. We have level eight Dao chess pieces, Wu Shan, and Thunderlord ... Three great level eight Dao chess pieces!""With me, Kong Ji, er Mao, Sen LAN, Qian Wuliang, and uncle Hong, we can also be considered Level 7."

Chapter 3402 Preparation (3)_5
"Three rank eights, five rank Sevens, hundreds of venerable sovereigns ... They don't seem weak, but they're actually not as good as the reincarnation realm, right?"Everyone nodded thoughtfully.He was inferior.If the reincarnation Emperor was not included, it might be similar. However, if the reincarnation Emperor was included, the three rank eights were far from enough."But Samsara isn't the Overlord of the primordial chaos. They were almost destroyed ...""That's just bad luck. We just happened to be attacking together ..."The Thunderbolt master laughed. Li Hao shook his head,"it's not bad luck, it's inevitable!" Even without us, there are the spring and autumn of the South, the five elements of the North, and the huntian of the East, all of which are far more powerful than the Samsara. Since the chaos is already in turmoil, these inferior powers will either submit or ... Be destroyed!"Is there any other way?There was no such thing.Subduing? the other party didn't dare to easily subduing him for fear that he would betray them.Li Hao exhaled."Before this, I didn't know much about the outer area, but now I'm more certain. With our strength, we can still survive in the East, but in the other three ... It's impossible for us to survive at all. Moreover, our reputation isn't good either. At least, after this incident, our reputation in the outer area will be bad!""There's a Wolf in front and a Tiger behind ... This time, it's not worth it to exterminate the twins. We've made a loss, and our reputation has become hated by the public ...""It doesn't matter if we go to the other three places or return to the four-sided domain. We ... Will have a hard time!"No one had ever thought about this question. At this moment, they were all slightly stunned when they heard Li Hao's words."You mean ... We're now ... Even more difficult than before?" the Thunderbolt master asked hesitantly after a long while.It can't be, right?Li Hao thought for a moment and nodded, it's more difficult! If we go to the three regions, unless we join the three overlords and sign a Dao agreement, they might not even believe us. Plus, my time ability might have been completely exposed. In that case, do you think they will still trust us?""Or should I join hands with neo martial to form a new force?"Li Hao said,"the neo Martial Emperor is not weak. With Emperor Cang, Zhi Zun, light, and US ... We can form a powerful force. Perhaps we can unify the East and become the Overlord of the East. We can compete with the other three regions!""But ... In essence, we're still not as good as them. Moreover, if we join forces with neo martial, it may not be so smooth. Now, everyone is just cooperating. Once we really form an alliance, it will definitely not be like this." Everyone was deep in thought. Wu Shan also said, "That's right, it's quite difficult ... Cooperation is cooperation, Alliance, and even integration, then ...""That's a little uncomfortable!"He said, feeling a little troubled.At first, everyone thought that the situation was good after defeating Earth Sun and killing a level eight. However, when it came to Li Hao, everyone realized that the situation did not seem to improve at all. Instead, it seemed to have become more troublesome!How did this happen?There was a Wolf in front and a Tiger behind. There were three overlords in front and the Dragon Lord behind. The four regions might be the true Overlord of the East.They and new martial had left the four-sided domain. In fact, they had fallen into a state of no return."Then why don't we join forces with new martial and fight back!"Wu Shan suddenly said,"we'll fight our way back to the four regions and annihilate the Dragon Lord's side. Right now, only the Dragon Lord is slightly stronger. The black Tiger and the red moon are actually nothing. Now that their Dao chess has also reached the eighth level, if we join forces, we can defeat the other party ..."  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Li Hao shook his head."The Dragon Lord is very powerful. Moreover, there are many venerable sovereigns in the Dragon field, including those at the seventh rank ... We can fight, but if we really do, both sides will suffer. Do you think the others won't mind?"Then what should he do?Li Hao didn't try to hide it anymore. He said directly,""Right now, I have an idea ... I want to establish my own primordial chaos! First, the source of life. Second, a suitable place. ""In addition, there are some other problems, such as the stability of chaos, the establishment of rules, a large amount of energy ..."Li Hao looked at everyone."This ... This might be an opportunity to overtake them!" He said.He looked at everyone."Let's open up, prepare, and prepare together. Let's merge our spirits into the Dao River and open up the universe! This way, we'll all be able to absorb a large amount of the Dao of the natural order. A true great Dao with natural laws ...""Start from zero and build! To perfect and to prepare! For example, the countless creatures in the divine Kingdom, like the Thunder World, the Silver Moon, and the forest orchid worlds, can temporarily merge with it and hide within it. Outsiders won't know about it, or else the world will become a burden to us!"Li Hao exhaled."Of course, this is to help me. However, I believe that everyone's gains will not be small! "Since the human King has appeared and is causing trouble everywhere, we should just keep a low profile. Be it the human King or the Dragon Lord, one has the power of 5000 Dao laws while the other has the power of nearly 7000 Dao laws ... To be honest, the few tier 8 powerhouses present are not enough to fight them alone!"Even if the weakest human King seemed to have a hard time fighting Fu Sheng, this was under the premise that he had killed four rank 7s in an instant. Therefore, killing Fu Sheng was a little more difficult.However, if they were to fight one on one, the human King would definitely be able to kill venerable sovereign fleeting life quickly.It could only be said that the human King was slightly weaker on the side of the Dragon Master and the Samsara Emperor. However, the human King was still far stronger than the rank eights present.

Chapter 3403 Preparation (6)
Li Hao said,'establishing a Dao law domain is the path that all powerful tier 8 existences are taking! "As for you, Thunderbolt master, after entering the eighth step, you're actually far from being able to do so ... So, I think that you should still have some ambitions. The eighth step is definitely not the end, but only the beginning!""As for rebuilding chaos, pseudo chaos ... That is still chaos!"At this thought, Li Hao suddenly said,""If ... I build this pseudo-chaos in the chaos great Dao, such as a pseudo-space form like a divine Kingdom, does it mean that it will be more hidden?"Everyone's hearts stirred.At this moment, none of them made a sound and were lost in thought.Li Hao felt the pressure and gap between them after his first trip. He also felt that asking this question might not be useful.Moreover, it was easy to cause friction when they went out.He seemed to want to take a different path.Since the human King had gone, he would not go.The Dragon Master was managing the four-sided domain behind him, and he had no place to manage it, nor did he have the mood to manage it. In that case ... Why not restart chaos?It was a crazy idea!"You need a lot of energy, right?""Well, the Queen can provide a part of it. We have some savings ourselves, but it's not enough to build chaos ...""We still need to find an absolutely quiet and safe place, and ..." Li Hao said. Li Hao pondered for a while."I still don't know enough about chaos. Everyone said that the nine Heavens might be the Dao of an expert. Then, I might need to find what I want and observe the structure of the nine Heavens and the distribution of those worlds ... In order to further perfect my Dao ..."This process was extremely complicated.After reaching the seventh step, Li Hao finally had the ability to complete it. Before that ... He didn't even have the ability to do so.Tier 7, the path of calamity. After stepping into tier 7, there was a slight increase in strength, but it was not too big. However, after entering, one's vision was broadened.Everyone quickly started discussing.He no longer walked the Dao of plunder, but the Dao of creation.It was a good thing, but it was also full of difficulties and troubles.After a long while, Wu Shan spoke."This is a good thing. It's helpful to everyone, so of course we support it. Moreover, you're right. Just killing and plundering is actually of little use to rank eights. It's almost impossible for us to reach the peak of rank eight or even rank nine ... It's just that this process, including the things we need, is very difficult for us to satisfy at the moment."Li Hao nodded."Therefore, we still need some time ... But at least we have a goal. We need to make preparations for this goal!“Li Hao said,"after we entered the outer area, we actually didn't have a clear goal. We just calculated where we went. There are good and bad things about this. The bad thing is that ... We don't have any rules, and it's easy to make mistakes. This time, we almost made a mistake!"Everyone nodded in agreement.At this moment, they were a little interested. One by one, they looked forward to it.Open up the chaos?Opening a world was still possible, but opening the chaos ... This ... Could it really be possible?Li Hao, on the other hand, fell silent.In the previous battle, they had killed a bunch of powerhouses, swallowed an eighth-level universe, and obtained a seventh-level universe ... But Li Hao had already discovered a huge drawback, which was that after they reached the seventh or eighth-level, these universes could no longer satisfy their appetites.How many universes would he have to swallow to reach level eight? The others were the same.How many people did he have to kill and how many great worlds did he have to wipe out?Energy might be fixed, but that wasn't important. What was important was that you couldn't kill one rank eight to give birth to one. You might have to kill ten to give birth to one ...If everyone wanted to reach Grade 7 or grade 8, how long would they have to kill?Perhaps ... It was time to change direction.Constructing chaos, splitting the heavens and splitting the earth, and establishing a chaosverse of his own ... Perhaps this would be of greater help to everyone. It would also help him perfect his own Dao system.He would just treat this as an experiment.Then, he looked at the long sword in his hand ... The firmament sword was too useless.A Grade 6 sword was useless.He was too weak!Even if it entered the seventh tier, it might not be of much use to him ..."In addition, there are many people who should see what the real world is. This way, they can broaden their horizons and have more hope. They can take a step forward, including in the Silvermoon world. If they want to step into Level 7, perhaps ... This is an opportunity.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Many thoughts appeared in his mind.After the battle, Li Hao didn't feel the joy of victory. It wasn't just because he hadn't been in the limelight, but because he felt a potential crisis and a bottleneck in his strength.He was probably at a huge bottleneck, and his progress was too fast.Almost everyone present had improved.Whether it was a level Seven or level eight, before this, they were not at this level.He had killed so many powerhouses at once, but only his chess piece had improved. Li Hao didn't even look at the Queen's power of the fifth step. This was not the result Li Hao wanted.……On this day, after Li Hao's group left, all the parties in the Eastern Region quickly joined forces.This was big trouble!The strength of the four-sided domain's experts was beyond imagination. Strength was only one of the reasons. The key was that these guys were too ruthless!Of the 16 level 8 worlds in the East, one was gone, and Samsara had also suffered heavy losses. No one in the other worlds could compare to Samsara, and there were even fewer worlds that could compare to Gemini. And Gemini had been destroyed!How could he not panic now?The level 8 worlds began to unite quickly, including the level 7 worlds. Li Hao and his people helped to unite the East. It had to be said that their existence often caused such a phenomenon.It allowed the scattered powers to start merging.The news was still rapidly spreading to the West, North, and South.The four-direction region, a small place that was only known as tianfang world in the past, had a few more names that resounded in the ears of some experts.Neo martial human King, Thunder Emperor of Thunder World, Silver Moon Li Hao, Yun Xiao and Wu Shan, as well as Guang Ming, and some people who knew long Zhan, quickly became the focus of attention of all forces.

3404 Chapter 552
Primal Chaos outer domain.Within a day, Dongfang shuangzi was destroyed and the world of reincarnation suffered heavy losses. They lost the firmament world, a rank seven world. In the past, it was an Overlord. Now that it had disappeared, no one cared about it anymore.Of course, the firmament world was a little special. Although it was only Level Seven, the firmament Supreme Emperor was actually a vassal world of the chaos heaven world and an important chess piece rooted in the East. His destruction had caused some waves.Originally, Samsara still had a good chance of dominating the East. Now that three of their rank eight venerable sovereigns had died, it was difficult for them to have another chance to dominate the East.On the other hand, the previous second-ranked Extreme Ice world had inexplicably become the number one force in the East. It had three level 8 powerhouses in charge, and the realm Lord, the extreme Ice Thearch, had more than 5000 Dao laws and was considered a peak level 8 powerhouse.However, at this moment, the East was less competitive.Everyone was in a state of panic!New martial, Silver Moon, Dragon field, light ...These forces from the four regions were the targets of vigilance of all parties. These guys were bandits in the eyes of the experts from the other regions!The new martial human King continued to wander the outer region.Some people saw the other party's tracks and were quite frightened. The worlds they passed by were all shocked and terrified. In the outer region, wherever the human King went, it caused another wave.Within a short period of time, no one dared to come and disturb the Thunder World. Wu Shan and the lightning Master had both revealed their strength of the eighth step. Ordinary worlds would not dare to come and seek death.……Thunder World.At this moment, the Thunderbolt master was having a headache.The Thunder World was huge. After devouring a rank eight venerable sovereign, one could be considered to have completely entered the rank of rank eight. Such a world was very difficult to compress or take away.As a result ... The existence of a world here was too big a target.But this time, Li Hao's goal, including his thoughts, was clearly to keep a low profile. He would let the human King and the others walk in the light while he and the others would do things in the dark and develop in a low profile.In that case, the existence of the Thunder World ... Seemed to be of little value.Devoured?What about the living beings in the Thunder World?What about the venerable sovereigns of the Thunder World?Were they all itinerant cultivators?They might not be able to take it if they fell from level eight to rogue cultivators.The Thunderbolt master had a headache, but so did sector Lord Sen LAN.When he left the square region, it was in turmoil. However, just a few days after he came out ... The outer regions were in turmoil. At this moment, sector Lord Sen LAN finally understood that it wasn't a region that was in turmoil, but ... A place with Li Hao, the human King, and the others. It was hard to not be in turmoil.The Thunderbolt master's considerations were also what he needed to consider.Unlike Wu Shan and the others, he and the Thunder Emperor both had their own boundaries.In order to continue on with Li Hao, was he going to give up the world? All the living beings in the world would be sucked into the Holy Kingdom of lingyue sovereign?Or should he put it in the great li realm?Or perhaps, temporarily placed in the Silvermoon world?But no matter which one it was, to the two sector Lords, it wasn't appropriate. They felt that they owed the people of the world. No matter where they went, they were living under someone else's roof. Also, civilization stopped and order disappeared. From now on, they would become people without a home. Yes, home.In the chaos, this concept was very faint. However, each world had its own people. As long as one's native world still existed, one would still have a Foundation. However, once it was gone ... One would have no home at all.The human King's neo martial and Li Hao's Silver Moon were still there, which was a sign of their confidence.Should he give up?Although the two advanced venerable sovereigns were decisive people, they hesitated this time. It was a difficult choice.……Reincarnation.While Li Hao was in a difficult situation ...The world of reincarnation.To Samsara, this unexpected situation was a disastrous loss. It was a loss that could not be made up for. They lost the chance to become the Overlord of the East. To put it more seriously, this could even be the fuse that led to Samsara's destruction!At this moment, the reincarnation Emperor's face was extremely grave.The human King and the others were still alive.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ The trouble might not end here.In the East, there had been no Overlord for many years and the forces were not United. There were only 15 out of the 16 rank 8 worlds. Samsara had suffered a heavy blow. Even if many worlds felt that it was a little troublesome, they had no intention of joining forces.Everyone was thinking,"it's not necessarily me that they're targeting. They're targeting Samsara and Gemini because there's enmity between them."But ... Was it enough to have no grudges?"The East is still in turmoil and will be devoured by others sooner or later ... These people won't give up and be suppressed by huntian ..."At this moment, the reincarnation Emperor looked at the group of rank seven venerable emperors in front of him. There were still many rank seven venerable emperors left.Moreover, with the death of the three rank eights, the power of the great Dao was in turmoil. It was difficult to produce a rank eight in a short period of time. However, as time passed, with the power of the world of Samsara, it was very likely that another rank eight venerable sovereign would be born.In fact, there was more than one.But ... Could he wait until that time?"Fu Sheng and a few others have fallen ..."The Samsara Thearch was somewhat solemn at this moment."Long Zhan's strength is strong. That neo martial human King was able to kill Fu Sheng and the others. His battle strength can't be underestimated. Although he might not be as strong as me, the gap shouldn't be too big ... And as far as I know, these people are all very young! The new king of the Silver Moon, Li Hao, is frighteningly young. Previously, he instantly reached Gemini and killed a level 7. His methods ... Are extraordinary!"Some of the rank seven venerable sovereigns below looked grave, but they did not understand what the Samsara Emperor meant.

3405 Chapter 552
After a moment of silence, the reincarnation Emperor said,""I'm afraid it'll be difficult to become the Overlord of the East. My reincarnation cycle might even be in danger of being destroyed! "Extreme frost and the others are indecisive. Although it was a little dangerous when they attacked earlier ... They didn't even move. This also means that ... If they really encounter danger, they might lose their sense of propriety ..."The extreme Ice realm and the other realms did not interfere this time. It seemed good that they did not suffer any losses.However, if this happened again and again, it would be difficult for the rank 8 worlds in the East to have the power to dominate."And now, I can't do it alone ..."The reincarnation Emperor was silent for a while before he said slowly,""I have the intention to form an alliance with the Western huntian ... Or even ... Surrender!"Everyone was shocked!However, the Samsara Emperor regained his composure. As the strongest expert in the East, he was not so easily depressed and desperate. However, this sudden crisis made him feel the threat of the destruction of the realm.The fall of three rank-8 venerable sovereigns and the incapability of the other rank-8 venerable sovereigns in the East made him realize that the East was no longer peaceful and safe.In the four-direction region, long Zhan was also restless. The attack this time was not necessarily to help the human King and the others, but ... To weaken the strength of the East.Unfortunately, those guys were all sweeping the snow in front of their own doors.In the previous battle, none of the rank eights had participated, not even a rank seven. They had just watched."Of course," the Samsara Emperor said in a deep voice."As a price, I need the heaven battering realm to pay a large amount of resources and the power of life and death to pry open the Samsara and see if we can revive Fu Sheng and the others!""Let Samsara become the representative of huntian in the East ... Huntian will pay a huge price, but from now on, it can take root in the East! Stop the dragon clan from leaving the four regions ..."The seventh level venerable sovereigns looked at each other and one of them said in a low voice,"Realm Lord, Fu Sheng and the others ... Can they ... Be resurrected?",m "I control the reincarnation, the Emperor of life and death!" The reincarnation Emperor said in a deep voice. Although the three of them are dead, the great Dao is broken, and the stars are shattered, their Foundation still exists ... As long as the reincarnation realm is not destroyed, they will have a chance to live ... Now, everyone thinks that our reincarnation has suffered heavy losses. If we can resurrect a few people now, our reincarnation ... Still has a chance!"He looked to the West, where three parties were fighting for supremacy.Huntian, spring and autumn, and the five elements were all fighting for supremacy. The West wanted to unify the chaos, and the East should be the last territory. Therefore, huntian was the first to bear the brunt. The problem he had to face was to attack him from the north and south!However, if it was the East, with his people and his Alliance Army ... Only then would huntian have more opportunities.Would huntian agree?He should be.Moreover, huntian had been making sovereign skydust active in the East all these years, drawing in people from all over the world. Perhaps ... There were also rank eight worlds that had come to join him, and there should be quite a few rank Seven Worlds as well.If he could combine all these powers, he could even surpass the past.However, he would have to pay a certain price.With so many thoughts in his mind, the reincarnation Emperor couldn't tell if he was regretful or not. He looked at the crowd again and said softly,""My fellow Daoists, do you have any objections?"Everyone understood that the Samsara Emperor had made up his mind. Someone was a little disappointed and sighed,""The reincarnation realm has dominated the East for many years. Today ..."He couldn't continue.Venerable reincarnation monarch was still in a good mood. He said calmly,""Since things have come to this, sighing is useless. I can only save myself!"He appeared calm and looked to the West again. After a moment of silence, he said,""No matter what, reincarnation still exists! If huntian wants to unify the world, I might need to help him ... I still have a chance in my reincarnation!"As he said this, he waved his hand and a man appeared in front of him. It was a venerable sovereign of the world of reincarnation. At this moment, the man's face changed dramatically.He was terrified to see a group of top venerable sovereigns here. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ As for the Samsara Emperor, he didn't say much. He was already aware of some of huntian's spies and methods, so he didn't bother to care. At this moment, he extended his hand, and that person's aura surged and ripples appeared on his body.It began to spread into the void.After an unknown period of time, an extremely weak fluctuation appeared from an unknown place far away.After a long time, the fluctuation suddenly trembled."Reincarnation?"The reincarnation Emperor sighed with emotion. After a long time, he nodded. "It's me, I greet fellow Daoist huntian!"The fluctuation stopped for a moment."Fellow Daoist Samsara, is there anything I can help you with?""I'm sure you know about the changes in the East. "Samsara didn't waste time and went straight to the point."The powerhouses of the four-direction region have left the Thunder region and the East is in turmoil. This may be a good thing for fellow Daoist ... But it may not be a good thing! The situation in the East is complicated. In the four regions, there are still the Thunder region and the tianfang world, two secret lands. They might even attract a level nine venerable sovereign!""In the world of Samsara, you can sign an Alliance agreement with me. What I need is to resurrect three rank eight venerable sovereigns and four rank seven venerable sovereigns. I also need many corpses of high-ranked venerable sovereigns, including a large number of great Dao crystals and world origins!""As for Samsara, they can take root in the East. At a critical moment, they are willing to attack the north and south Lords from the side!"The weak fluctuation seemed to be in deep thought."How much do you need?" he asked after a long time."Three eighth-rank corpses, four seventh-rank corpses, three high-level world origins, and the more mid-tier worlds, the better! A Dao crystal requires 100 billion!"Huntian Supreme Emperor seemed to be weighing the pros and cons."Eighth-rank corpses ... There aren't that many ..."

The requirements weren't too high.But it wasn't low.Of the seven high-rank venerable sovereigns, the rank seven one was still alright, but huntian Supreme Emperor had only killed one rank eight venerable sovereign.However, the reincarnation Emperor was calm.""Fellow Daoist should have it!"A tier 8, one dead?There were more rank eight worlds in the West than in the East, but there was not much movement. They only knew that huntian had killed a rank eight world and nothing else.Was that really the case?"Daoist reincarnation ... You're really ..."Huntian Supreme Emperor laughed. A moment later, his voice wavered."Alright, I can provide it for you. If you have any other requests, please state them together.""I need to control all of huntian's forces in the East! "Encircle and annihilate new martial, Silver Moon, and light, or force them back to square region, or force them out of the east and into the north and south regions ..."This was a good thing for huntian Supreme Emperor. He had already received news of what had happened in the East.After thinking for a while, he quickly said,"yes!" If there's a need, I can still provide some assistance ... I'll arrange for someone to send you the things you need very soon. "He didn't say much about the great Dao Alliance agreement.When the reincarnation monarch saw that he agreed so readily, he took the initiative to ask,""Then, the great Dao Alliance ...""There's no need for an Alliance of the great Dao. The primal Chaos lightning tribulation ... Might not have been born naturally. It might have something to do with the lightning territory's Lord. By signing an Alliance, you'll be placing your safety in the hands of the Lord ... The Lord might even know the contents of the Alliance! If fellow Daoist doesn't mind, you can sign the huntian covenant with me ..."The heart of the reincarnation Emperor moved slightly.The great Dao Alliance was based on the chaos lightning tribulation. The chaos lightning tribulation spread all over the world, and wherever there was chaos, there would be chaos lightning tribulation. It did not have the same effect on just anyone.Huntian covenant?Unless the chaos heaven world could spread throughout the chaos, the Alliance was nothing as long as the chaos heaven world couldn 't. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ If it wasn't for huntian Supreme Emperor's confidence that he would be able to cover the East sooner or later, the other party would have already invaded the chaos at this moment.With countless thoughts in his mind, the reincarnation Emperor quickly agreed."Was the person you fought with long Zhan of the dragon clan?" huntian Supreme Emperor asked."It's him. ""What do you think, fellow Daoist?"​ "He's very strong. He has condensed a Dao domain and has a Dao law of slightly more than 6000. However, his physical body is already strong to begin with and is close to 7000 Dao laws!" Huntian Supreme Emperor was silent for a while before his voice wavered,""Very strong! Then ... How's that Fang ping human King from new martial arts?""The saber slashed through floating life. It's hard to judge, but it has about 5000 Dao law power.""The square region has produced some monstrous geniuses!"Huntian Supreme Emperor sighed and said,"What about the Thunder Emperor?""He's not considered strong. It was just a coincidence that he killed the injured underworld constellation of my world. According to my judgment, he has just entered grade 8. The power of over 2000 Dao laws ..."Huntian Supreme Emperor didn't say anything this time. A rank eight expert like this wasn't considered strong.At their level, they were different from ordinary people who judged the strength of the other party. In a situation where they were all at the eighth step, it was very difficult for one eighth step to cover all powerhouses.Each Overlord had their own set of methods to distinguish them, and they were all similar."It's said that this time, there's also a world derived from neo martial arts, the Silvermoon world. They also participated in it and killed di yang. So what if he killed di yang?""It's still okay ... In the final stage, I reached stage seven and have some Primal Chaos tribulation lightning power ... The power of Dao laws is close to 2000, close to a weaker stage eight, but it shouldn't be considered ..."The reincarnation Emperor replied and gave his own judgment.As the strongest person in the East, his judgment was still very accurate."However, I suspect that this person ... Is skilled in some special DAOs. He even has a feeling of the southern Dao of spring and autumn," the Samsara Emperor added."Similar to time?""Yes,""This is interesting!"Huntian Supreme Emperor seemed to be smiling, but he also seemed to be thinking about something. After a long time, he said,""If you can capture this person, it's best if you can capture him alive! His rapid progress in the Spring and Autumn period has a lot to do with his Dao law. From what I know, he might have needed a time Dao master back then ... Also, time might be able to bring back those who left. In short, it's very complicated and troublesome!"As the most powerful man in the East, the Samsara Emperor knew something about the situation. It was rare for him to communicate with the Overlord of the West, so he said,""Those Dao Masters who left back then ... Are they still alive?""A part of them is alive ..."Huntian Supreme Emperor didn't hide it, but he didn't go into detail either. He simply said,""However, it's not that easy to escape. Most of them are in absolute trouble. Therefore, if you and I can't reach the ninth level in this era ... It's very difficult for a true ninth level to continue to wander in the chaos!""Whether it's your life or death, the five elements, or something else ... If you want to enter the ninth-rank, you might have to break through some things. Do you understand?"The reincarnation Emperor was silent for a while before he nodded slightly."I understand. You mean ... Some people have become an obstacle to our progress?""It's almost like that!"Huntian said a few more words and finally said,""They might all be waiting, waiting for a cultivator who can truly control time ... To reverse the universe and reverse yin and yang. I don't know the details, but I can sense some ideas from some chaos, and they may not be accurate! Be it Spring Autumn or this Silver Moon King Li Hao, he might be the one they've been waiting for, or he might not be ... None of that is important. What's important is that I also want to see what time is. "

"I will try my best! Now that they think that Samsara has suffered a heavy blow, as long as we secretly revive Fu Sheng and the others, we can catch them off guard if they are ambitious!""Alright!"“……”The two overlords conversed for a while, and soon, the fluctuations disappeared.The reincarnation sovereign took a deep breath and no longer said anything. He just looked into the distance silently and then looked in the direction of the four-sided region. Long Zhan, do you want a share of the loot too?Even if I have to submit to the Western Heaven, I will not let you have your way!You drove out new martial and silver Moon, drove the wolf to swallow the Tiger, and let these guys stir up chaos in all directions.……On this day, without anyone knowing or even thinking about it, the Samsara Emperor, the Overlord, came to an agreement with huntian in the West.No one thought that he would give in so easily. After all, Samsara had always been the number one World in the East.…… Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ And on this day.Thunder World.The Thunderbolt master finally made a decision. He looked at Li Hao, exhaled, and expressed his thoughts,""Fellow Daoist Li, you're going to build a pseudo-chaotic universe. I'll have to reserve a world in advance to be the place where my Thunder World will take root in the future ...""At our level of cultivation, we're no longer ordinary people. However, our existence has already interfered with the development of the entire world and the future of the entire race ...""The meaning of the world's existence, to us, is the convergence of ten thousand DAOs and stepping into level nine! In fact, there's almost no such hope, so there are many level eights and level nines in the entire primordial chaos. I've only heard that huntian has reached level nine. ""I wish for little friend Kong Ji to seal and destroy all the beings of my Thunder World! I don't want them to enter the divine Kingdom. I only hope that when they recover, the world they see will still be the Thunder World!"The Thunderbolt master made his decision and continued,""The existence of this world has become a restriction to us! The Thunder World and the Thunder world's great Dao universe have both stepped into level eight ... I'll devour a part of them. As for the rest, I want to merge them into a world in fellow Daoist's River of great Dao ... The second thunder World! It will become the future of the Thunder World, the place where all living beings of the Thunder World will Live!"He absorbed a portion of it.A part of it was directly integrated into Li Hao's Thunder World. In the future, he would leave this world to the common people of the Thunder World.Li Hao glanced at him and said after a long time,""Senior Thunder Emperor, you don't need to do this ..." "No!"The Thunder Emperor said in a deep voice,"the chaos is already in chaos. It's not caused by you all. Instead ... After a million years of silence, another tier 9 was born. Now, it's inevitable! Under the turbulence, no one could transcend, no one could escape this great calamity! How could our Thunder World be able to survive the crisis of the ten thousand worlds alone?""If that's the case, why not ... Let's destroy it first. If the time is short, perhaps not many people will die and peace will be restored. If it takes too long and I can't unseal it, then ... I'll die in the destruction!"Nirvana could stop everything, but only time would not stop. It would continue to pass.His lifespan was still being consumed normally, but at a slower rate. Eight to ten years was nothing, and a hundred years might not be anything, but thousands of years ... There probably wouldn't be many of those who had died.On the side, sector Lord Sen LAN also sighed,""My forest orchid realm will do the same! With the current situation and the world, the goal is too big and too obvious!"Li Hao nodded. That was indeed the case.Furthermore, it was a rank 7 or 8 world, so there was almost no one who could drive it. On the other hand, worlds like silver Moon and the Li Dynasty were only rank 6, so they were not considered high-leveled worlds, so er Mao and black Panther could still drive them.However, once Silver Moon broke through to tier 7 ... The Black Panther would no longer be able to carry him. In the end, he might have to remain in the pseudo-chaos and deal with it according to the outcome."If the two seniors have considered it carefully ... I have no objections.""It's just that it wasn't easy for your worlds to advance ... It's a bit of a pity,"Li Hao said.He also felt a little regretful. Unless these two didn't come with him, but at this moment, their worlds had been exposed. If they didn't leave with him and just stayed here, it would be even more dangerous.The Thunderbolt master laughed."Things have already come to this. Moreover, it's better than the destruction of the world. If it wasn't for fellow Daoist's help earlier, the Thunder World would have long been destroyed, let alone a grade 8 one!"Sector Lord Sen LAN also nodded.His forest world was in the same situation as the Thunder World. If Li Hao and the others had not made a move, the world would have long been fused with the Crimson Moon. Since that was the case ... The current situation might be a little better.They took the initiative to devour the great path of the universe and the power of the world. This way, they could become stronger, and the rest could integrate into the chosen realm and make the realm stronger. This way, if they really wanted to establish themselves here in the future, they would have the opportunity.Li Hao didn't dwell on this. He quickly nodded and said,""Then, we can't delay ... This time, we can leave an empty shell of the two realms and disguise it for a while. After the worlds are destroyed, we can devour the great Dao universe and the power of the world, and the outer shell of the world will remain here. Under normal circumstances, outsiders won't dare to come and investigate!""When someone attacks this place and finds out that it's just an outer shell, we'll have left long ago!"On the east side, although everyone had gained some benefits and killed a large number of experts, it did not mean that the East was safe. Were they invincible?

How could that be possible?If the Thunder World remained here, it would be invaded sooner or later. It was better to leave before the eastern worlds reached an agreement.At this moment, monarch Wushan laughed and said,"it's good. Being a rogue cultivator isn't bad either!" Although the world is good, it has many restrictions. If we can find a safe place to open up the false chaos and place all the living beings in the world inside, and then seal the chaos ... It will be even safer!"Li Hao nodded. That was true.However, this wasn't something that could be accomplished in a day."Then let's begin! There's no time to waste. Once all parties react, there'll be no small trouble. ""Alright!"Everyone quickly got into action. Kong Ji was in charge of destroying the two worlds while the Thunder monarch and the forest orchid sector Lord started to extract the power of their great DAOs. They also had to maintain the appearance of the world.Wu Shan and the others also started to help.As for the Li Dynasty and silver Moon, one was currently sealed off while the other was still cultivating. Neither of them had reached the seventh step. Er Mao and black Panther could still take them away, but the people from Nirvana had been temporarily sent into the God Country.Thunder Emperor and the Sen LAN sector Lord were both reluctant.However, at this time, perhaps this was the only way to fight for a better opportunity for the living beings of the two worlds.……Time passed day by day.In Li Hao's River of Dao, there were two more powerful worlds. One was the Thunder World, and the other was the forest world. These were the two world Lords 'choices. One was dominated by Thunder-elemental power, while the other was dominated by the forest power.At present, Li Hao's power of tribulation was the strongest among his thousand worlds. It had reached Level Seven. The other world DAOs were not too powerful, but after the Thunder monarch and the Senlan monarch integrated the power of their great DAOs into them, the two worlds were much stronger.As for Li Hao himself, he was mainly opening up new realms.He created some small realms and filled them with energy to continue strengthening them. The power of a thousand realms was quite powerful for Li Hao, but it was still far from Samsara and the others.Using a realm as a Dao law was indeed more powerful than the Dao laws of rank eight venerable sovereigns under the same circumstances. However, the power of a thousand worlds could not double at all and could not reach 2000 Dao laws.This kind of strength was actually a bit weaker than a tier 8, even if it was a weaker tier 8.After reaching the seventh step, Li Hao's strength had improved somewhat, but there was a limit to it. At this point, he hadn't reached the level before he became a human King, where he could truly suppress an eighth step cultivator while he was still at the seventh step.Of course, Li Hao had only just reached Level Seven, and only one of his techniques had reached Level Seven. It was understandable that he was not as good as a human King. However, after some time, he would strengthen his Qianjie, or even 2000, and that might not be the case. ……At the same time.All parties were taking action.In the four-sided domain. The Dragon Lord was also in tianfang world, comprehending something and did not go out again.On the side, Red Moon master seemed to have become a guard, watching and observing. Although he said he was protecting, in reality, he was just here to do nothing. He did not know what the Dragon Master was looking at or observing.The battle between the Dragon Master and the reincarnation Emperor had shocked him. This guy was really strong.He was still thinking about something when suddenly, many stars appeared in front of the Dragon Lord.Red Moon master was slightly stunned. These stars ... Most of them were shining, and some of them had not yet awakened. These were ... The ones that he had brought out from tianfang universe.Many of them had been distributed to some seventh rank venerable sovereigns. He did not expect the Dragon Lord to have recovered a lot.Was this guy going to enter tianfang universe?He was still thinking when the Dragon Lord suddenly said,""Say, if the master of Tian Fang and the others are still alive but have yet to return, is it because they can't return or ... Because they haven't accomplished their goal, they've been staying somewhere and are unwilling to return?" Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 "This ..." Red Moon sovereign frowned slightly."Red Moon!"The Dragon Master turned to look at Hong Yue and smiled.""You're a smart person. Those who are too stupid would have died long ago!"Red Moon sovereign was speechless.After a long time, he said,"maybe he can't return?" Or rather, if they return, there will be some major changes. It seems that there was more than one type 9 expert who left back then. With so many experts, there is almost no one who can match them in the primordial chaos. Since they are already invincible ... Will they be killed?""Yes." The Dragon Lord nodded."Then ... Under what circumstances do you think that this group of tier 9s can't return?""I don't know," Red Moon master shook her head.The Dragon Lord laughed."It's either related to chaos itself. It's also not related to tier 9 and above. Otherwise ... It's an internal strife?" A collision between order and disorder? You're right, who would know about this?"Speaking of this, he looked at Red Moon."You, Red Moon, have a deep hatred with new martial and silver Moon. The Dao of desire should actually be very strong. But I don't feel it from you ..."Red Moon master didn't say anything. Was this mockery?The Dragon Master quickly added,"the human heart is very complicated. The heart of a cultivator is also very complicated. Everyone will have desires that will fill any place. There's no reason for such a powerful Dao to be so weak!""Becoming stronger is a desire, living is a desire, everything is a desire ...""Red Moon!""I'll help you, and you'll help me as well, how about it?"the Dragon Master looked at him again."Dragon Master ... How do you want me to help you?" Red Moon master was a little wary.The Dragon Master took a deep breath."For Tian Fang to recover, it needs a large amount of great Dao power. It needs a lot of things and many conditions ... The desire of the weak is actually very slow to devour and cultivate, but what about the strong? What about the desires of a group of powerhouses, or even ... Powerhouses of the ninth step?"

He looked at Red Moon master."Do you think Tian Fang master hopes for the recovery of Tian Fang universe or not?" No matter what, did he have any desire? I'm sure there is ... Since that's the case, I'll stimulate his desire, you devour the power of desire, and I'll absorb the power of heaven. How about it?"Red Moon master's expression changed.He understood.This guy had guessed that the master of Tian Fang was not dead, but he still had thoughts about the Tian Fang universe. It was no longer a simple inheritance, but ... Luring the master of Tian Fang to give him a part of the power of the great Dao for him to comprehend and cultivate. What he needed to do was to absorb a part of the power of desire.Red Moon Lord's mind was spinning, and Dragon Master said softly,""Whether it's Fang ping or Li Hao, they've improved very quickly. This time, Fang ping killed Fu Sheng, and Li Hao killed di yang ... Hongyue, can you kill a rank-8?"Red Moon master was silent for a while, then shook her head.It was difficult.Or rather, it was almost impossible.He had lost the great path universe and the world, but he had not been able to escape much power. At the moment, he could only maintain the power of a level eight. It was too difficult to kill a level eight.It was already good enough that he wasn't killed."Since you don't have the confidence, you'll be killed by them sooner or later!""Not willing to take a gamble?" the Dragon Lord said with a smile."That's too dangerous," Red Moon master said."You-""It's not as simple as inheriting the comprehension. You have to swallow it by force and even lure it out. The master of tianfang, even among the rank nine, should be an extremely top existence, right?Was he really not afraid of death?"It's precisely because it's dangerous that there will be gains. If you're always afraid of death, how can you have any gains? Li Hao, Fang ping, and the others have been taking risks every time, and they've always reaped great rewards ... You ... Are you sure you don't want to give it a try?"Red Moon master was extremely conflicted. In the end, she said,""Then if ... If he's trapped, then no matter ... Or rather, he can return and descend ...""Then die!"The Dragon Lord was incomparably calm,"clearly, we're unable to match a true tier 9. That only leads to death! However, be it the Thunder region or Tian Fang, they had existed here for millions of years and had never descended. Could it be that they would descend this time? If you're really that lucky, then you can only wait for death!""Compared to the current crisis, don't you think that these considerations are a little too far off?""Then I ... Will only devour the power of desire that the other party passes on?""No... Perhaps you can say it this way. Or perhaps you can say it's a desire to revive. In short ... In my eyes, no matter if the other party is reviving or infiltrating their power, they all have a goal. If they have desires, you can eat them!""If you don't improve, you'll be completely outdated in the chaos where level eight is rampant! You've only just entered level eight and don't have the power of 3000 Dao laws!"Red Moon master no longer hesitated and nodded.""I ... I can try!""That's good. "The Dragon Master smiled."There's no rush. You can make preparations first and wait for the right time! Without absolute strength, the day we leave the lightning territory might be the day we're annihilated. This is a rare opportunity, a time of peace. Li Hao and the others are out there, which has bought us time to develop. " Red Moon master was speechless.Did it count?Perhaps.…… Time continued to pass.As for the new martial human King, he had not been idle these days. He had been wandering around, which made many people extremely afraid.In the Eastern Region, some rank eight worlds started to form an alliance.The speed was still not fast.However, with the presence of the threat, they, who had almost never joined forces in the past, were rapidly moving towards a closer Alliance.The disappearance of the neo martial world was a big threat to many people.In addition, the existence of the Thunder World had also caused some experts to feel fear. It was too close to them.At the same time, the reincarnation realm was sealed, as if it was still in pain from the death of three rank eights. This time, the eastern realms, under the leadership of the extreme Ice world, began to unite and cast the reincarnation outside.After many days of discussion.In the end, he made a decision.In the extreme Ice world, within an incomparably snow-white Palace, the extreme Ice world Master pondered for a long time before saying,""The people from the four-sided region are all very threatening. At this moment, the neo martial human King is acting alone, but his combat strength is extremely strong. Moreover, the whereabouts of neo martial are uncertain, so there is no way to lock on to him ... But the Thunder World is right in front of us!""First, we must destroy the Thunder World and remove this nail so that peace can be restored in the East ..."After many days of discussion, everyone still decided to uproot the Thunder World first!Otherwise, with a rank eight world around, it would still be very troublesome."Silvermoon's side might have returned to the Thunder World, but their strength is not as good as the new martial artists ... Wu Shan and the Thunder Emperor are both at level eight, and there are many Level Seven. If we want to annihilate them, we'll have to strike like lightning ...""We've only contacted 12 level eight worlds and 14 Level Seven Worlds. If we really want to work together this time ... We'll eliminate them in one fell swoop. It's the safest to send five level eight and more than ten Level Seven Worlds ... The rest of you, stay behind to prevent the neo martial artists from taking advantage of us!"There were more than 15 level eight venerable sovereigns in the 12 level eight great worlds, but they could not all leave. It would be too dangerous. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Some of them should be left to guard the various places.Five was definitely enough.Picking on the soft persimmons, it seemed that Silver moon's side was obviously softer.
