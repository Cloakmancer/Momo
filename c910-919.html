        Nan Quan continued,"the five internal organs are the most difficult. In other words, it's similar to the head. The four limbs should be the easiest path. So, most martial masters nowadays are like this. I am like this, and old Hong is probably the same ... In the end, we will still end up with the same destination. It just depends on how everyone will walk in the middle."
        He added,"there's another point to the difficulty of the five organs. The five organs have five separate superpower locks. They have five different powers. These five powers ... Actually conflict with each other!" Conflict is the biggest problem, and it can easily lead to the five internal organs shattering. This is also the reason why we have been unable to find a suitable way to step into this level. "
        "Your teacher, the breathing technique of five birds ... Might be able to solve this problem. That's why we're all waiting and looking forward to it ... Sigh!"
        He sighed. It seemed like he had been tormented quite badly.
        Strengthening the five internal organs was a very difficult path.
        "Even if your teacher succeeds, he's at the mastery of all Five Forces while we only have one. That's the difference ... Tell me, even if he succeeds, do we have any hope?"
        He was very pessimistic.
        However, Li Hao's eyes flickered."Don't forget the five bridges construction method. Teacher's five birds breathing technique might still have some problems in the end. But what if we cultivate the five internal organs as one?"
         "You've been looking at the five bridges construction method, did you get anything?"Nan Quan's heart was moved.
        "Yes, but there are still some problems ... I may need some of my teacher's theories to support it ..."
        The problem was that his teacher's organs had not reached their maximum capacity yet. So, how was he going to temper his organs without weakening them and strengthening his superpower lock?
        In this ... There were still some key points that his teacher had not mentioned.
        Maybe she only realized it after he left, but she didn't know if she had resolved it.
        However, if he couldn't solve these problems, Li Hao would have to strengthen all five of his super locks to the maximum in order to successfully build the five bridges. If that was the case ... The southern Fist and Hong Yitang should give up!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Who knew how long it would take for him to reach that stage.
        Li Hao's current knowledge was not enough for him to make some changes. As for the breathing technique of five birds ... Perhaps only his teacher could modify some of the plans to balance the energy and avoid the absorption of the Super Lock.
        The next moment, Li Hao cut off the connection.
        Since he could not find his teacher now, it did not matter. If it did not work, he would try to strengthen his five organs and five organs Super Lock. Anyway, he had sword energy, so strengthening it was much easier than others.
        If not ... He would have to spend many years to successfully strengthen a single Super Lock.
        However, with the sword energy, it was much easier.
        With this thought in mind, Li Hao began to absorb elemental energy. The energy quickly merged into his body.
        At the same time, the martial masters outside were also strengthening their five internal organs. Countless amounts of energy overflowed for them to absorb. A Black Dog also opened its mouth from time to time to suck a few times. It was obviously fatter than when it had just come out. It had eaten so much that it wanted to sleep.  This place was still the most comfortable!
        At this moment, apart from Liu Long, almost all of the other 49 martial masters had broken through to the late-stage of the 100-plus level. There were only two or three who hadn't broken through yet, but it was only a matter of time.
        The team leaders had already begun to study the divine decree.
        There was a special case in the crowd: Wang Ming.
        At this moment, Wang Ming was different from these martial masters. They still needed to comprehend divine intent, but Wang Ming didn't need it. He absorbed a large amount of elemental energy, washed through the superpower lock, and absorbed it into his five internal organs, which clearly strengthened his metal element Energy.
        In the blink of an eye, he was already at the late stage of the sun glory realm, and even began to move towards the peak stage.
        Superpowers had their advantages and disadvantages.
        The advantage was that they were not facing any major bottlenecks. As long as they found the superpower lock and broke it bit by bit, they would become powerful sooner or later.
        He was improving rapidly!
        However, Wang Ming wasn't in a hurry to break the next SuperLock. He could only see five at the moment, which was theoretically enough for him to cultivate to the rising light Stage, but he also remembered what Yuan Shuo had said back then ... The potential would be greater if he strengthened the SuperLock!
        Back then, he had broken a superpower lock and fused the chain fragments into other superpower locks. It was strengthened once. Now, he began to absorb some elemental energy to strengthen the superpower lock. He was not just trying to wear them down.
        Since he couldn't become a Martial Master, he would become a powerful super!
         If he had obediently followed the prescribed order and absorbed all this elemental energy, he might have already broken through to the third yang realm. But after much consideration, Wang Ming decided to take it slow.
        In the same realm, even if he couldn't defeat a powerful Martial Master, he was invincible among supers!
        In the distance, Liu Long was also strengthening his five internal organs.
        This time, Li Hao had gained a lot. Everyone had benefited from it and were all training crazily.
        Time passed day by day.
        Li Hao's divine power stones and mysterious energy were also being consumed rapidly.
        Li Hao, who had more than 2000 divine power stones, had used 30 of them to exchange for the water of the spring of life, which was equivalent to spending 300 divine power stones. One divine power Stone could be converted into 250-280 cubic meters of mysterious energy.
        In the past few days, Li Hao had consumed almost 300 divine power stones and converted nearly 70000 cubic meters of mysterious energy because he had absorbed so many people.
        Black Panther had stolen a lot, Liu Long had absorbed a lot, and so had Wang Ming. The martial masters had absorbed a little less.
       
        Li Hao had absorbed most of it.
        However, Li Hao's physical body and internal organs were not strengthened much. This time, he was mainly trying to figure out how much energy he needed to fill up the superpower lock. As he continued to experiment ... Li Hao realized that he might have been too naive.
        He might have absorbed half of the 70000 cubic meters of mysterious energy, which was more than 30000 cubic meters, but the superpower lock was like a bottomless pit!
        His five internal organs and physical body had absorbed some of the mysterious energy in the ancient city and had reached the standard of 6000 cubic meters.
        Over the past few days, he had been absorbing like crazy, but in reality, he had not improved much. Right now, he was only at the standard of about 7000 cubic meters.
        Less than 10000 cubic meters of mystic energy was absorbed by his body and five internal organs.
        The remaining 20000 cubic meters were almost all absorbed by the Super Lock. There was only one, the one in his heart. Li Hao focused on the Super Lock this time.
        In the end, a whole 20000 cubic meters had been absorbed, but it was still not full. This made Li Hao feel incredulous!
        This was impossible!
        He didn't believe that people like Southern Fist would need so much energy just to fill one strand. He could only do so because of the sword energy. Without it, he would have to wait until his next life if he wanted to absorb 20000 cubic meters of mysterious energy!
         Yuan Shuo and the others could not do it either. When Yuan Shuo's heart reached 1000 cubic meters, he started to accumulate spirit.
        Even if Nanquan and the rest did not delay, they had already filled many of the locks in the past 20 years. Could it be that each of these people's locks contained more than 20000 cubic meters of energy?
        "That's impossible ... There must be a problem."
        Three days passed by in a flash.
        Li Hao felt that there was something wrong with this. There was something wrong with the fact that none of the Super locks were full.
        "Unless ... It's a problem with potential!"
        Li Hao frowned. Perhaps it had something to do with his bloodline. His bloodline meant that he had some abilities that others didn't have. His body might be stronger than ordinary people.
        Therefore, the amount of mysterious energy he absorbed might be a bit more.
        "But ... If this continues, it'll be like a bottomless pit. Who knows when it'll be full?"
        The key was that the improvement in strength was not obvious after being absorbed into the Super Lock!
        No, it was almost no change.
        This was not worth it!
        It was true that this was to strengthen one's Foundation, but the consumption was huge, and without an increase in strength, what was the use of having a strong foundation?
        At this moment, Li Hao sighed and gave up.
        This won't do!
        It seemed that he had to find his teacher and discuss a plan. Otherwise, he would not be able to build the bridges of his five viscera. He had to avoid this.
        The more he thought about it, the more his head hurt.
        The power of the superpower lock had also led to a problem ... The fusion of the five Forces with the five internal organs. Now that his heart was strong, his force was still the same as before. This also led to a new drawback. The force was locked too tightly. If this continued, the five Forces would be completely locked!  At that time, if the five Forces were unable to appear, then it would become a joke.
        "Strengthen the five internal organs, strengthen them to the end, and completely lock the five Forces. You can't break them, and you can't come out ... Then what's the point of playing?
        "Ten thousand cubes, at most ..."
        Li Hao estimated that he could only strengthen his five internal organs and physical body to 10000 cubic meters at most. Any stronger, and his Shi might be locked. At that time, he would have a headache!
        He had exchanged for some spirit accumulation fruits this time, but he didn't know if they would be of any help to his aura accumulation.
        Just as Li Hao was thinking about this, a voice suddenly came from outside the door.""Li Hao, you there?"
        Li Hao's eyes flickered, and he disappeared.
        ……
        Outside the cultivation room.
        The sky was still dark, and at this moment, Mu Lin was waiting at the door.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Seeing that Li Hao had come out, his eyes flickered, and he quickly smiled.""You've been cultivating for the past few days?"
        "Yes, brother ermu,"
        Mu Lin smiled and didn't mind."I didn't want to disturb you when you were cultivating, but today ... Is the day we set off. The higher-ups have given the order to transfer the Marquis troops into stellarsky city! Our Wei Wu Army, as the direct descendent of the Marquis's division, will follow the Marquis's division and set off for the Heavenly Star City.....I thought about it, and decided to give you a heads up, because ..... It's possible that only your demon hunt squad is still here. "
        Today?
        Li Hao was startled. He quickly recalled their previous conversation. They would set off in three days.
        This meant that it was already the 4th.
        So fast!
         That's right. He had absorbed a total of 30000 cubic meters of mysterious energy. It had indeed been a few days.
        In the distance, the Wei Wu Army was packing their luggage. They even started to line up. The entire base was bustling.
        "Is everyone willing to go?" Li Hao frowned.
        These people were all Silvermoon people.
        Now that you're leaving your home, you're willing to leave with hou Xiaochen?
        "Of course!" Mu Lin laughed. In the era of the decline of martial masters, the hou tribe placed great importance on martial masters and pulled us up step by step. Now that the hou tribe has entered the capital, their future is uncertain ... The Wei Wu Army naturally has to follow! The stellarsky city might be full of schemes and intrigues ... But if we guard it, the Marquis will have an easier time. "
        Li Hao's heart moved. The Wei Wu Army's loyalty to hou Xiaochen could not be underestimated.
        They were willing to leave their homes and travel thousands of miles away, but these people were willing to follow.
        "Where are hou bu and the others?"
        "At the night patrolman's station. We'll meet up there later. First, we'll take a car to the vicinity of the cloud River. After crossing the cloud River, we'll enter Linjiang province, take a special car, and head to Beihai province. Finally, after crossing the Beihai province ... After entering the central region, we'll be able to take a car all the way to stellarsky city."
       
        This journey was ten thousand miles long.
        If they continued to walk, even if they ran hundreds of miles a day, it would still take months to get to Sky Star City. Sky Star City was too far away. Although it was said to be ten thousand miles, in reality, according to the map, it was twenty thousand miles away.
        In the central region, the road traffic was quite convenient. If he took a car, he could travel about 3000 miles a day, so he could reach there in about a week.
        Of course, if one had the money, they could take the plane that was unique to the central continent.
        That would be even faster, but there were simply too many people in the Wei Wu Army, and they would have to travel separately. There was a high chance that hou Xiaochen would not choose this option, so they would have to travel by car. They should be able to reach stellarsky city in a week's time.
        Of course, Li Hao, who had read many ancient books, knew that in the ancient civilization, there was a special express train that could reach a speed of more than 500 miles per hour, which could travel 10000 miles in a day.
        However, today's technology was far from that level. Although some of the technology used in excavating the archaeological ruins had been used, it was still not as good as it was in the past. The speed of the car was much slower.
        And this was after the rise of the supers, which used some superpower methods. Before that, they could only be transported by horse carriages.
        Li Hao exhaled."Let's go together. I'll send you off. I'll also say goodbye to the Marquis."
         Mu Lin laughed."I came to look for you with this intention. After all, you are the only 100-man Regiment left by the Wei Wu Army. You have too few people. The Marquis is leaving today. There will probably be some important figures sending you off ... I want to get to know you so that I can take care of you."
        "It's a pity ... We've only been working together for a few days, and we'll have to leave soon. "
        Originally, they had wanted to explore the ruins together.
        Thinking of this, he added,"by the way, boss seems to be looking for you too. He failed to explore a relic previously and wanted to ask you to explore with him, but you ran away quickly. Now that this has happened, we probably don't have time to explore together. Boss might give you the address of the relic ... You can explore it yourself later, but be careful. Boss failed ... But your strength is really terrifying. It might not be related."
        He had entered the remains before, so he had naturally seen Li Hao and Zhan Xuguang's power.
        Since the Golden spear had failed, it was hard to say for Li Hao.
        Li Hao didn't say anything and just followed Mu Lin.
        At this time, a person followed behind him, Liu Long also followed,""I'll go too. I'll see hou bu off. Although I didn't make a name for myself in the night patrol, it was hou bu's approval that allowed me to return to Silver City and continue my job as the patrol law enforcement team captain, becoming a Demon Hunter squad ..."
        Hou Xiaochen was about to leave, so he felt that he should send him off.
        Li Hao didn't say anything. A moment later, they followed Mu Lin to the car outside.
        At this moment, trucks appeared outside. There were over a thousand Wei Wu Army soldiers. This time, they had mobilized 20 large trucks. These were only used to carry people. Some storage rings had also been used to carry some armor and resources.
        At this moment, a person walked over. It was Jin Jin's disciple, who was also Kong Jie's daughter, the woman called Kong you Yun.
        Li Hao wasn't actually familiar with him. After all, they had only met a few times.  Kong Youyun walked over and said,"Centurion li, the captain is looking for you!"
        A small car was parked in front of them.
        Li Hao thought for a moment, nodded, and followed them.
        Jin Shan was seated in the carriage. It had only been a few days since they last met, but he seemed to have aged a lot. Previously, he had looked to be in his forties or fifties, but now, he seemed to have aged.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao had some guesses. Perhaps ... It had something to do with the explosive power of the people from the earth overturning sword.
        ……
        "Get on!"
        Jin Jin's voice was calm. Li Hao didn't say anything and quickly got into the car, sitting side by side with him. In front, Kong Youyun got in and started the car.
        The Golden spear sat upright, like a javelin.
        His tone was still as calm as before,""After I leave, you will be the only ones left here. There are some things left in the warehouse. There are some divine energy stones and mysterious energy. There are also some Dao Comprehension ancient weapons ... They are not in the warehouse but in the storage ring!"
        Then, he threw a storage ring to Li Hao.
         "Originally, you weren't in charge of this, but since you didn't leave, I'll leave it to you."
        "There aren't many things, and we've taken most of them, but we can't leave you with nothing."
        Li Hao took the storage ring without saying anything.
        Before the Wei Wu Army left, they had left him some things. This was something he didn't expect.
        Then, golden spear gave Li Hao a book.""This is some information we have sorted out after exploring some ruins over the years. Take a look for yourself. Mulin might have told you that I found a ruin a few days ago, but I didn't have time to explore it. There are some dangers inside, so you can do as you see fit. Some information about the ruins are also in the storage ring."
        "Thank you, Captain."
        "No need,"
        "I can't explore it because I'm not strong enough," Jin gun said calmly."Maybe you can. There's no need to thank me."
        After a moment of consideration, he added,"also, be careful of the Moonsea Pirates. We've organized some information about the Pirates. You have to be careful. The weak ones among Pirates are nothing. What you're afraid of is that the Pirates of the North Sea know that we've left and that the Minister has left. They'll enter the Moonsea to seek benefits. You have to be careful! Some of the Pirates of the North Sea are very strong, and some of them are even at the peak of the rising light realm. Some of them even have powerful demons ... You must be careful!"
       
        Li Hao nodded again.
        Jin gun thought for a while and said,""Don't be shrouded in the shadow of your master. Don't rely on him for your entire life. The five birds technique is very powerful, but I hope you can find your own path. I don't have the right to say anything, but I know ... Once there's a mountain above you, it's too difficult for you to move it!"
        At this moment, the curtain was somewhat drawn.
        Jin Shan's eyes were filled with exhaustion. It was hard to tell if it was regret or helplessness.
        The first of the three Spears of the Silver Moon was not even a match for the light sword. The trip to the ruins had completely shattered his pride, making him feel unspeakable pain. Now, he did not know what to do and could not move forward. The Golden spear had been extremely dispirited these few days.
        Seeing him like this, Li Hao didn't say anything.
        He had to break all of these by himself.
        No one could comfort her, and she didn't need it.
        Following that, Jin gun did not say a word and closed his eyes to rest. Li Hao could only sit in the car and follow them to the night patrolmen's station.
        ……
         At the night patrolman's encampment.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Today, no one went out.
        A large number of superpowers were gathered here.
        Hou Xiaochen was about to leave.
        Ever since the Silvermoon Nightwalker was established, he had been the leader of this place. It had been almost 20 years since then, and now, he was about to leave.
        Hao lianchuan's face was also bitter.
        Once hou Xiaochen left ... The Silvermoon Nightwalker's status would drop greatly.
        Wei Wu's Army also left. Out of all the night patrols, he was the only one holding up the fort. As for the other three suns, there were also some. Two days ago, the two deputy ministers had successfully advanced to the three suns realm.
        Minister Zhou of the metal element and Minister he of the water element had both reached the three-sun level, and this was also related to the large number of divine power stones they had obtained.
        The three three suns were the main core power of the night watchers.
        However, was this power ... Very strong?
        He might have felt this way in the past, but now, it was not worth mentioning.
        "Minister, why don't we let secret Yu stay?" Hao lianchuan looked reluctant.
        “……”
        Chief Steward Yu looked at him with eyes that could kill, but Hao lianchuan did not care. With a sorrowful face, he said,""Otherwise, I won't be able to hold on!"
        It was too sad!
        "If it really doesn't work, find someone to replace the Minister and let me be the acting Minister. I'm afraid I can't handle it ..."
        Yes, he was the acting Minister. It was unexpected!
        However, the central continent didn't arrange for anyone to take over this time. For some unknown reason, perhaps ... They were afraid of death?
        Therefore, no one was willing to come.
        Under such circumstances, they could only let Hao lianchuan temporarily take over the position of Minister. There was no joy from being promoted, only fear and helplessness. 'I really can't do it, especially when the previous Minister was the powerful hou Xiaochen.'
        "Don't worry,"hou Xiaochen chuckled,"there's not much to do here now that I'm gone. The three major organizations have pretty much been wiped out, so they won't send any more powerful people after I leave ..."
        How was that possible?
        Hao lianchuan was speechless."I'm not an idiot. Now that you're gone, it'll be the best time to stuff sand into Silver Moon. Also, Li Hao of the eight great families is still here, and you're telling me that the three major organizations are not sending anyone?"
        Don't mess around!
        My mind is still very clear.
        "Don't be afraid,"hou Xiaochen laughed," if you really can't handle it, you can just find someone to help you. "
        "Who is it?"
        "Aren't you here already?"hou Xiaochen looked outside and smiled.
        Hao lianchuan also looked outside and saw Jin gun and Li Hao get out of the car. He was slightly surprised and looked at hou Xiaochen.
        Hou Xiaochen chuckled,"doesn't he like to be an official?" Let's just fulfill his wish!"
         "If he's not leaving ... Then he'll have to shoulder some of the responsibility. It's just that he's blinded by hatred and might not really care about these things. You do as you see fit. You don't have many good points, but you're honest with others. You have to take care of Li Hao ..."  As soon as he finished speaking, hou Xiaochen's voice rang out,"Li Hao of the Wei Wu Army will be promoted to a high-level City Patrol from now on. He will be the Vice-Minister of the Silver Moon Inspection Committee. He will assist the acting Minister, Hao lianchuan, in managing the Silver Moon Inspection Committee!"
        Li Hao, who had just gotten out of the car, was slightly stunned.
        What was going on?
        He had always wanted an advanced city Patrol, but he had yet to come down.
        He had been promoted today, but ... Why was he given the position of Deputy Minister? and he was in charge of the night patrol with Hao lianchuan?
        In the distance, a few small cars slowly came to a stop. At this moment, a few faces were revealed. They were all surprised, but no one said anything.
        Hou Xiaochen's voice rang out once more,"In addition, the formation of the Wei Wu Army hasn't been canceled. Li Hao will temporarily take over the position of Captain of the Silver Moon Army and guard the defense line at the lunar ocean to prevent Pirates from attacking! Protect the safety of the Silver Moon and do not let the Pirates enter the land of the Silver Moon!"
        Downstairs, Li Hao slightly frowned.
        He wouldn't be staying at Silver Moon for too long, and he was currently the Vice commander and acting captain ... What was hou Xiaochen trying to do?
        Not long ago, he even wanted her to go with him. Now that she was not leaving, he arranged so many positions for her ... What was he doing?
        A demon hunt squad, only a few people!
        "The night patrols and the Wei Wu Army have to ensure the safety of their people. Only then will they live up to the wealth of the people. Be it the salary of the soldiers or the provisions, they all come from the Silver Moon. Li Hao, You Must Remember This!"
        Below, Li Hao had yet to speak.
        At this moment, hou Xiaochen had already walked out. He looked at Li Hao and said indifferently,"Li Hao, are you still not going to accept the order?"
        “……”
        Li Hao looked suspicious and struggled. After a while, he stomped on the ground and shouted,""Yes!"
        Hou Xiaochen chuckled and nodded. Without saying anything, he tossed a storage ring over, "I'll give you some information and a list of names regarding the night watchers. You must assist Hao lianchuan well and help Silver Moon live a peaceful life!"
        After saying that, he stepped forward.
        They got into the car and did it in one go.
        "Let's go! Everyone, see you tomorrow!"
        "Let's go!"
        "Go!" The Golden spear opened its mouth, and the next moment, dozens of chariots started to move.
        In the distance, director Zhao, Huang Yu, Kong Jie ...
        The leaders of the various factions got off their vehicles one after another.
        After a long time, someone sighed."I wish you a safe journey. The Dragon hides in the abyss. Silver Moon ... It's time to go out!"
        Hou Xiaochen didn't say anything to these people and left with his team.
        Li Hao, on the other hand, was a little absent-minded.
        He's ... Leaving just like that?
        At this moment, he suddenly had a strange feeling. His teacher had left, and before he left, he had asked hou Xiaochen to protect him. Although he had many doubts, when hou Xiaochen was here, Li Hao always felt that he still had someone to rely on.
        It was the same for Hong Yitang and the southern Fist ...
         Now that hou Xiaochen was gone, Nan Quan would be leaving today as well, and Hong Yitang had completely sealed swords gate off, not allowing any more visitors ...
        He looked around and suddenly felt a chill run down his spine!
        At this moment, Li Hao suddenly felt that he was in a Wolf's Den and a Tiger's Den. It was a bit cold, as if the support behind him had all left in an instant.
        At this moment, it was as if he had returned to a year ago.
        At that moment, his good friend had told him to escape ... But where could he escape to?
        Darkness seemed to have enveloped Li Hao.
        It turned out that the sinister fellow could bring her a sense of security even if he did not do anything.
        What a ridiculous feeling!
        At this moment, Li Hao was extremely silent. On the side, Hao lianchuan looked as if he had lost his parents, his face full of pain.
        Hou Xiaochen had really left.
       
        (In two hours, on the 28th. Monthly votes seem to be double. Remember to vote.)
        Hou Xiaochen left.
        At this moment, the news of hou Xiaochen's departure quickly spread as a group of people set off for Heavenly Star City.
        ……
        Central region.
        In a Palace deep in the mountains.
        On the throne.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com A man with a slightly pale face, who was abnormally handsome, was listening to the report from the people below.
        "Leader, hou Xiaochen has already set off. Yu Luosha, Jin Jin Jun, and the Wei Wu Army, with the exception of Li Hao's demon hunt squad, have all set off."
        On the throne above, a man rested his chin on his hand and looked a little lazy.
         After listening to her silently, she seemed to be thinking about something.
        On the left was a beautiful woman in a long green robe. Her eyes were cold and sharp."Leader, the day that hou Xiaochen and that B * tch yuluo arrive in the central continent is the day they die! Hong Yue's dignity has been trampled on again and again. Hou Xiaochen, Yuan Shuo, and the others all deserve to die!"
        "Don't say such harsh words. "
        The man's voice wasn't fierce. He pressed his hand down and motioned for the woman to be quiet.
        The woman instantly fell silent.
        There were people on both sides of the Silver Moon below the hall. It wasn't very bright, but if you looked carefully, you could see some ghost faces in the hall. It was just that it was very quiet, making the entire Hall seem particularly quiet.
        "Hou Xiaochen ..."
        The man seemed to be in deep thought and sighed.""Silver Moon and the others are all itching to eat my flesh and drink my blood. I didn't do anything to them; all I did was capture Li Hao, so why bother?"
        "What heaven battling city's ruins, what mysterious Silver Moon ... At my current stage, I'm not too interested in them. Only Li Hao, do you think that the eight great families should not be destroyed? Things are getting interesting for Li Hao. First, it was Yuan Shuo, and then it was hou Xiaochen ... Things are getting more and more interesting. "
        "Leader, let's take advantage of hou Xiaochen's departure to enter white moon City and capture Li Hao!" The green-clothed woman said again.
        The man seemed to roll his eyes and said lazily,""That's probably what hou Xiaochen wants you to do. Even if he's gone, there's still Kong Jie and Huang Yu. As for the state Administration ... There's still that old ghost. Other than hou Xiaochen, Kong Jie isn't one of them, and Huang Yu is the last one. He hasn't made any moves in the past few years, so I can't think of anyone else other than the state Administration Department ..."
        "AI!"
        He sighed and shook his head,"it's a time of trouble." If I had known earlier, I would have taken advantage of the moment when I found Li Hao and killed him in the Silver City. Now that he's left the Silver City, his strength has improved rapidly, and he might be able to match a mid-stage sunrise expert. This is going to be troublesome. "
        "He killed the third Sun ..." The woman in green was stunned.
        How did he reach the middle stage of the rising light realm?
        Ying Hongyue leaned back in her chair. She was too lazy to explain anything. It was very tiring to explain everything.  Did the Sword of Light find trouble with Li Hao for no reason?
        Sometimes, a lot of things could be inferred from some information. Even if Xu Feng wasn't killed by Li Hao, he must have had something to do with Li Hao. This piece of information alone could reveal a lot of things.
        Li Hao might have gained a lot of benefits in heaven battling city.
        It was a pity ... The world was only concerned about hou Xiaochen and had neglected many things.
        That's good. If not, how could he appear wise and farsighted?
        Ying Hongyue smiled, making her look even more handsome.
        In reality, even if he was younger than Yuan Shuo, he was already in his sixties and was a genuine old Martial Master. However, he looked like he was only in his thirties at the moment. If he were to walk out, he might even cause women to scream.
        At this moment, Ying Hongyue seemed to be thinking about something.
        "If hou Xiaochen wants to come to the central continent, just let him come. There's no need to interfere," he said slowly after a while.
        "As for Li Hao ..."
        After thinking for a while, he said,"white moon City is powerful. We can't move it easily. Unless I go back ... I'm afraid it'll be difficult to make any achievements. Instead, we'll continue to lose people. The gains do not make up for the losses." It's best to ignore Li Hao for now. In fact, don't even send anyone over ... We'll only have a chance to deal with him when he's unable to improve in Silver Moon and enters the central continent. "
        This time, he had already probed Silver Moon and the others thoroughly.
        If he sent someone now, it might be in line with those guys 'intentions.
        "Also, Purple Moon, tell orange moon to drop the mission to kill Yuan Shuo and go to Silver Moon!"
        Ying Hongyue smiled and appeared extremely gentle."Be more sincere. I know what they want after capturing Ziyue. Ask chengyue to hand over 10 mid-stage and three late-stage blood gods. In addition, promise Li Hao that chengyue will no longer pursue Yuan Shuo ... And that he will return to Purple Moon. "
         ,m On the side, the green-robed woman was somewhat envious.  He wanted to say something ...
        But when she turned around and thought about it, she didn't say anything more.
        Perhaps ... This was the charm of Ying Hongyue. He was willing to part with it. He was very willing to part with it for many people. The 13 clones of Blood God were extremely powerful. They were all at the Sunglow level, and there were even late-stage ones.
        Perhaps, it could make the enemy stronger, or even solve some of the enemy's problems.
        But he was still so willing.
        Today, it was Zi Yue who had been captured. If hou Xiaochen had captured Lu Yue and the others instead of killing them that day, he, Ying Hongyue, would have also gone to exchange for them.
        "The leader is wise!"
        The green-robed woman said.
        Ying Hongyue rubbed her temples and chuckled. "There's no such thing as being wise or not. If you're truly wise, you won't underestimate those guys. You clearly know that they're dangerous, but you still let Lu Yue and the others go over. Now ..."
       
        "This is fate!" He shook his head and sighed.
        It was just that he had not expected that so many things would happen in heaven battling city.
        The three parties had dispatched more than 10 people from the rising light, with a few of them in the late stage.
        He had already been on guard against hou Xiaochen. According to his judgement, if hou Xiaochen didn't want to unseal himself, he wouldn't have been able to cause so many losses. There must have been some other reason for all the experts from the three great organizations to have died.
        Otherwise, hou Xiaochen, Kong Jie, Yu Luosha, and the others wouldn't be able to escape unless they were all unsealed.
        "That's because hou Xiaochen is cunning ..."The green-robed woman hurriedly said.
        "Devious?"
        He glanced at Blue Moon and sighed,""Don't always belittle the enemy. It makes me feel like I'm useless. There's nothing wrong with admitting that the enemy is strong. If the enemy is strong, I'll suffer heavy losses, and it'll appear that I'm just unlucky. If you say that the enemy is useless, it'll only make me look stupid. "
        “……”
         Blue Moon was speechless.
        However, he wasn't really afraid. He just felt a little helpless. Recently, the leader's mood wasn't too good. If he had said this in the past, he wouldn't have explained it in detail.
        "It's also my fault. I've let you guys go too much over the years. "
        Ying Hongyue shook her head again,"I always feel that women don't need to be so strong." Women were not born to fight. Fighting was a man's business. As a result, I've left you with a bad impression. After stepping into the rising light, everyone gave you face and did not dare to touch you for no reason ... In the end, I was given a head-on blow this time, reminding you of Silver moon's old friends. Each one of them is more ruthless than the other!"
        He seemed to be a little bitter and helpless as he shook his head again.
        Blue Moon didn't say anything.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Ying Hongyue continued,"back then, out of the six of you, Yu Luosha ran away. Peacock and goddess were killed this time around. Spider and you are still alive. When Spider returns, you must work harder!"
        After saying this, he looked down the hall and said slowly,""Send a message to the Duke dingguo's mansion. Li Hao has killed Xu Feng, and the light sword is about to rebel. The Xu family should think about it."
        "Yes, sir!"
        Below, people quickly disappeared. As for whether the news was true or not ... Since the leader said so, then it must be true. No one doubted it.  ,m "The light sword ... Has betrayed us?" Blue Moon asked again.  "Yup,"
        Ying Hongyue sighed and said,"I can't raise a Silvermoon Martial Master well!" "The Xu family used the wind chasing boots to keep the light sword in suspense for so many years. It promised that as long as Xu Feng entered the transformation stage, the wind chasing boots would be handed over to Xu Feng. The light sword was both a father and a mother, and it wholeheartedly wanted Xu Feng to grow up and quickly take over the wind chasing boots ... Now that he's dead, it would be strange if the light sword didn't rebel."
        "With the light sword's personality, it should have betrayed us a long time ago. Why did it wait until today?" Blue Moon asked.
        "I used to think that she was weak, but now, according to the news, the light sword seems to be very powerful ..."
        "How could the Xu family be so weak?"
        Ying Hongyue chuckled and said,"he's very strong!" "Moreover, the Xu family didn't lie to her. If Xu Feng can really enter the metamorphosis stage, the Xu family will definitely let Xu Feng control the wind chasing boots. At that time, yin and yang will combine ... Don't think that the light sword is old, it's even uglier now ... That's not important. What's important is that at that time, Xu Feng might be able to take the opportunity to obtain pure yang power and step into the sunrise realm in one fell swoop. It's a win-win situation ... Unfortunately, it's all gone now."
        He seemed to know a lot. He laughed and said,""So, let's just watch the fun. It's not that I want to trick this old friend, but I want the Xu family to be more careful. After the trouble is resolved, if they have the energy, help me test Li Hao and silver Moon ... So that they won't be caught off guard by the sword of Light."
        "Oh!"
         Blue Moon nodded. She wasn't young anymore, but she was still very innocent.
        Ying Hongyue just admired them like this and revealed a smile. It was good to be an innocent woman. It was good to be a little more innocent. All these years, she didn't let them participate too much because she didn't want their original intentions to change.
        But ... It didn't seem too good now.
        The inner courtyard was quite harmonious, but going out to do something ... It was difficult. The success rate was too low, and it couldn't even compare to some non-Martial Master superpowers. He wondered if hou Xiaochen and the others were scolding him for raising these Silver Moon martial masters to waste.
        "Leader, don't we also need the wind-chasing boots?"
        Blue Moon asked again, why don't we take the opportunity to seize it?
        Ying Hongyue shook her head."The Liu family's weapons fell into the hands of Duke dingguo a long time ago. There's no need to fall out with them over this. The core of the eight weapons is still the Li family's sword." It's a pity ... I couldn't find it before, but now I've confirmed that it's either in Li Hao's hands or hou Xiaochen 's. "
        "Also, the Zhang family's saber has fallen into Yuan Shuo's hands. The indestructible saber in his hand should be the Zhang family's saber hidden in it."
        After saying this, Ying Hongyue considered it for a while and said,"Hongyue, don't have too much contact with these people in the near future. I also need some time to spread the news that the Li family's sword and the Zhang family's saber have fallen into the hands of Li Hao and Yuan Shuo, respectively! These two weapons both had extremely special effects. The royal family ... Also tell them that the Li family's sword might be able to completely unseal the stellarsky ruins. Don't play dead all day long. If the stellarsky King wants to become the human King, playing dead won't work. He has to take a gamble!"
       
        He laughed with a hint of mockery,""There's no human king who pretends to be dead and win. This has always been the case since ancient times! People like Li Hao not only didn't die at the last moment, but also became stronger and stronger, which means that they are difficult to deal with. They can understand it by studying the information themselves. Do as you see fit!"
        Blue Moon nodded. Seeing that he was about to leave, she couldn't help but say,""Then, why didn't the leader ..."
        Why didn't he personally capture Li Hao?
        Even if Silvermoon was in danger, their leader should be able to deal with his experts, right?
        Hou Xiaochen's departure was an opportunity!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Silver Moon ... I can't go there so easily!"
        Ying Hongyue walked in and said without turning her head,"Silvermoon is starting to recover. I went there that year. Hou Xiaochen was much weaker than me, but he still managed to kill the second generation Purple Moon. Some of Silvermoon's existences don't want me to go there again ... They're all trying to intimidate me. It's difficult!"
        With a soft sigh, he disappeared.
        Seeing him leave, Blue Moon didn't say anything. She looked down and snorted,""Keep an eye on hou Xiaochen's group! Although the leader said not to provoke them for the time being, you still have to keep a close eye on them!"
         "Yes, sir!"
        Ghostface replied perfunctorily and didn't really care.
        The leader had already said so, but you still wanted to show off. Why did you have to?
        However, in the middle of July, the others had died and blue Moon was favored, so he didn't have to refute anything.
        ……
        On this day, some news began to spread as hou Xiaochen and the others left Silver Moon.
        The Duke dingguo's mansion was the first to receive the news.
        In the center of the East, there was a magnificent mansion.
        In a large hall.
        A white-haired old man coughed lightly. As the fourth generation Duke dingguo, he was not young anymore.
        At this moment, he coughed and looked down at the middle-aged men. He sighed,""A white-haired man seeing off a black-haired man. Feng died in Silver Moon. There are no outstanding talents left in the Xu family's younger generation."
        Slightly shaking his head, a middle-aged man who looked similar to Xu Feng said in a deep voice,""Father, little Feng's Death in Silver Moon is definitely related to hou Xiaochen. Now that he's gone to the capital and left Silver Moon, no matter how strong he is, it's not like he can't solve this problem! I'm afraid Huanglong won't let the night patrolman gain a firm foothold. Why don't we ..."
        "Let's put hou Xiaochen aside for now!"  The old man coughed lightly."The light sword should be back soon. Is there any news?"
        "Not yet,"
        The middle-aged man frowned,"light sword ... Hmph!" I suspect that she didn't contribute much this time. Otherwise, with her strength, she would've only explored the ruins and ended up fine, while Xiao Feng died ..."
        Below the middle-aged man, there was a slightly younger man who said slowly,""Big brother, don't be too sad. The light sword is powerful, and the Xu family still needs them ..."
        "That's not your son who's dead!"
        The middle-aged man coldly snorted. As a family with two hundred years of history, there was no lack of internal strife. This younger brother of his would probably wish for him and his son to die together.
        Don't take your anger out on the light sword. If it was your son who died, you wouldn't be so calm.
        With Xiao Feng's death, the ownership of the wind chasing boots became a mystery.
        Her brother was probably very happy.
        "Clang clang!"
        The old man knocked on the table and interrupted their argument. His tone was calm and he was used to it. "Don't argue about this. When the radiant sword returns ... Make arrangements to ambush and kill her! Be careful, she's strong and not easy to deal with ..."
        At this moment, even the middle-aged man was stunned. He looked at the old man and asked,""Father, that's not what I meant. I know that she's powerful and useful to the family ..."
         He was only grumbling and had never really thought of killing the light sword. The other party was very strong, and killing her might cost him a great price. Moreover, she was now working for the Xu family.
        It was painful to lose a son, but ... To lose the light sword, it might be even more of a headache.
        He had not expected that his father would really want to deal with the light sword. It was unexpected.
        The old man looked at the brothers and sighed.""If possible, I don't want the light sword to enter the Xu family and continue to work for the Xu family. But you and your brother should know that not many people can use the Windchaser's boots. I can use it a little, but that light sword ... It's ugly and disdains me for being old ..."
        The old man laughed and shook his head."Xiao Feng is pretty. She's willing to do something. As for me...I'm afraid that old witch won't be willing." He had originally thought of making things difficult for Xiao Feng, but with the help of this old witch, Xiao Feng would also have a capable helper. As a man, he didn't need to worry about this. When the Xu family left the East, they would naturally be able to suppress her! At that time, wouldn't it be up to little Feng's wishes?"
        "But now, Xiao Feng is dead. We can't do anything!"
        The old man got up and sighed,"I don't want to do this either. But that old witch will definitely take the wind chasing boots by force. Let's just kill her and end this!" "These Silver Moon martial masters are unruly and difficult to deal with. They can't be tamed, and the female martial masters of Silver Moon can only be suppressed by some men. With Xiao Feng's death, she's given up on her thoughts, and I'm afraid she won't let it go ..."
        Below, the two brothers looked at each other. They both understood and were a little solemn.
        "Father, it's said that these martial masters are extremely powerful and can unseal their combat strength. This light sword ... Has it also reached this level?"
       
        "Maybe,"
        The old man wasn't too sure either, and he said in a deep voice,""When she revealed her peak combat power, she was at the late-stage of the rising light realm. She didn't reveal it, but it's normal for a Martial Master to hide some of her strength. Mobilize a few generals of the dingguo Army to join forces to kill her!"
        "Understood!"
        The two of them hurriedly nodded and didn't say anything else.
        It seemed that his father was determined to kill the Sword of Light. The dingguo Army ran amuck in the East, and the strength of several generals was extremely strong. One of them alone was probably not weaker than the northern General of the three northern provinces.
        Father's meaning was to mobilize many people to join forces to encircle and annihilate them.
        The old man didn't say anything more. Just as he was about to leave, he thought for a moment and said,""Right, after killing the radiant sword, mobilize some people and go to Silver Moon to test Li Hao's strength. Red Moon has sent word that Li Hao might have killed little Feng ... Also, he might be holding the Li family's divine sword!"
        As for Li Hao killing Xu Feng, since he was already dead, there was no need for him to go to Silver Moon to waste his time.
        However ... It was a different story when it came to the Li family's divine sword.
        It was difficult for most people to understand just how powerful the divine weapons of the eight protector clans were, but as the owners of the Liu family's godly boots, they did know a thing or two. The Windchaser's boots were an inheritance of the Liu family.
         It was extremely magical!
        The reason why the Duke dingguo's mansion was able to help the star royal family rule the world in the early years was actually somewhat related to this pair of boots. Two hundred years ago, the Duke dingguo was known as the land God and Martial Master douqian.
        At that time, there were very few martial masters in the world except for Silver Moon, and the Qian warrior was even more elusive. At that time, the Xu family had a Qian warrior in charge.
        He was extremely powerful, breaking through a thousand by himself. He was a key figure in the imperial family's rule of the world. He was also extremely fast. Even when he encountered a Martial Master who was also a Qian master, the first Duke of dingguo of the Xu family had also killed him. He relied on the wind-chasing godly boots.
        It was only in recent years, as the contents of ancient books were spread and more ruins were excavated, that the Xu family learned that the boots were an inheritance from the Liu family, one of the eight great protector families.
        Originally, the Xu family didn't have much information on these eight great families, but with the exposure of Hong Yue's plans in Silver City, that small border city that no one cared about instantly became the core of some people's eyes.
        The eight great families were actually in this small broken place ... No one had expected this!
        In the end, before anyone could react and lay out their plans, Silver Moon underwent a drastic change. In the blink of an eye, from three suns to a large number of sunguang, the Xu family was caught off guard.
        The Li family's divine sword was the number one weapon among the eight great families. The old man didn't even need to think to know that it definitely had an extremely special effect.
        Hong Yue's message spread to all sides, saying that she was afraid of the Silvermoon martial arts world and a person like hou Xiaochen. Everyone knew what Ying Hong Yue was thinking ... But how could she not be tempted when the treasure was in front of her?
        The old man did not say anything more and turned to leave.
        The light sword ... What a pity!
        It wasn't easy for him to recruit a Silver Moon Martial Master, and he had wanted to strengthen the family's Foundation. Now, he hoped that nothing would go wrong during the ambush.
         ……  In just one day, all sorts of news had spread among the higher-ups and experts.
        For example, when hou Xiaochen had announced the effects of the blood God, Hong Yue had suffered heavy losses in a short period of time. It wasn't until Hong Yue's side had killed many strong people that their decline was slightly alleviated.
        At this moment, the news about the Li family's divine sword was also spreading in the ears of some people.
        The blood God clones were the true top powerhouses. They didn't care too much, because they knew that unless there were a lot of them, the weak blood gods wouldn't be of much help at the current stage.
        Therefore, there were not many top powerhouses who were tempted.
        However, the divine artifacts of the eight great families were only tempting to these top-tier Masters.
        ……
        Silver Moon.
        White moon City.
        In the Nightwalker headquarters, Li Hao had not yet recovered from the shock of hou Xiaochen's departure. He was still staring at Hao lianchuan, both of them having a rough idea about the Nightwalker system. Just then, Li Hao received some bad news.
        Inside hou Xiaochen's empty office.
        A red communication device rang.
         Li Hao looked at Hao lianchuan, and Hao lianchuan looked back at Li Hao. The two of them had just been lamenting the passing of autumn. At this moment, the red communication device suddenly rang ... It didn't seem to be good.
        Hao lianchuan looked at Li Hao and raised his fat chin.""My head hurts, I don't want to answer it. You answer it!"
        Li Hao rolled his eyes!
        I'm still having a headache. I've never taken care of anyone since I was born. When I was a child, I was a class monitor, but I only asked for some sweets. As for the demon hunt squads, it's only everyone who consciously takes care of them.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com But the red communication device rang at this time. Li Hao felt that it was not simple, so he quickly picked it up.
        "Li Hao or Hao lianchuan?" a voice came from the other end of the communication.
        "I'm Li Hao ..."
        Li Hao seemed to have vaguely recognized who it was, but he wasn't too sure.
        "That's good. Don't run around for the time being. You can go after hou Xiaochen and go to the central continent with him, or you can ... Stay in white moon City! There's some news circulating in the central continent that you have the Li family's divine sword, which can open a large number of core ruins, even those controlled by the imperial family ... You know the meaning behind this. As news of the eight great families is gradually being grasped by others, I'm afraid your trouble ... Will only get bigger and bigger!"
        Li Hao was stunned. After a long while, he said,"I'll give it to ..."
       
        "Alright, do you think everyone is stupid?"
        “……”
        Li Hao was speechless. It seemed that no one was stupid. In other words, some people still felt that the starry sky sword was in his hands.
        The most important thing was that the news spread as soon as hou Xiaochen left ... It seemed that it was easy to be targeted without anyone behind him!
        Before, some people had been afraid of hou Xiaochen, so they'd pretended not to know.
        But now, he was no longer pretending.
        Troublesome matters indeed came one after another. Li Hao was helpless. The person said,""It's not just you. Your teacher is in big trouble too. I heard that the Zhang family's saber is in his hands. At first, some people didn't care about him dealing with the people of the Crimson Moon, but now ... They'll probably come looking for trouble with him. "I'm not too sure where the eight weapons are exactly, but even if they're distributed, they're all in the major factions. You and your disciple are the weakest, and you even have two of them. Who else should I look for if not you?"
        "Did Red Moon spread the news?" Li Hao frowned.
        "How did you think of that?"
        Li Hao regained his composure."Forget about me. On my teacher's side, other than Hongyue's men and Ying Hongyue's understanding of the eight great families, no one would have thought that he would use the Zhang family's saber."
         Putting aside his teacher, now that Yuan Shuo was in possession of one of the eight divine weapons, Li Hao was certain that the news was spread by Ying Hongyue!
        "I'll be fine if I stay in Whitemoon city?"Li Hao asked after some consideration.
        "Yes,"
        "Then when I go out...Will Whitemoon city not be able to protect me?"
        "No,"
        Understood!
        Li Hao was just asking. He didn't really care about it. At this moment, he felt a little helpless. The exposure of the starry sky sword meant that some of their previous arrangements had been destroyed. No one was focusing on hou Xiaochen anymore.
        It was fortunate that most people only knew how powerful divine weapons were, and not their actual effects. Otherwise ... They would be in deep trouble!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The only people who knew about this were his teacher, the southern Fist, and the earth overturning sword ... These people wouldn't do anything to him.
        All sorts of thoughts ran through Li Hao's mind. He suddenly understood why hou Xiaochen had wanted him to leave with him. Perhaps hou Xiaochen had already predicted that Li Hao would be in trouble if he stayed in Silver Moon!
        "Thank you for the reminder!"
        Li Hao thanked him and hung up before he could finish his words.
        Li Hao was speechless. Hao lianchuan asked curiously,""Who's that?"
        He did hear the voice and felt that it was familiar, but he could not recall who it was.
        ? Li Hao raised his chin towards the east. Hao lianchuan was stunned for a moment, but he quickly thought of someone."Director Zhao? He has a separate communication channel with the Minister?"  “……”
        Li Hao was rendered speechless."They're both in Silver Moon, and they're the heads of two major organizations. Is it strange that they have their own communication channel?"
        What was the old woman thinking?
        And he was so surprised!
        Hao lianchuan shook his head and said,"no, that old man has always been on bad terms with the department head. Forget about the others, he ... And this old man. Why would he tell you this? what's the meaning of this?"
        "Who knows?"
        Li Hao sighed. Hao lianchuan thought for a while and said,""Does it mean that the trouble is getting bigger?"
        "Probably."
        "What's the use of your Li family's sword? If it's not of much use, I'll just hand it over to the Minister before, so that I don't have to get into trouble ..."
        Li Hao looked at Hao lianchuan and said after a while,""Hao bu, why are you so timid today?"
        He was not as domineering as before!
        Before, even though he knew that the three major organizations had many powerhouses, he was still excited to kill the Crimson Moon powerhouses and take the blood God. But now, it seemed that he was afraid of trouble.
        Hao lianchuan didn't want to talk to him as he lamented.
        Nonsense!
         I'm only at the mid three yang stage. Without hou Xiaochen, who would I dare to provoke?
        'Old hou isn't being honest either. When you were leaving, you wanted me to encircle and annihilate the members of the three large organizations. Great, now you're leaving just like that. You've even taken the entire Wei Wu Army and secret Yu with you ... What am I supposed to do if you leave me behind?'
        Hao lianchuan sat on the sofa dejectedly. He really wanted to smoke a cigarette. He touched his pocket and suddenly remembered ... That he did not smoke.
        A moment later, he pulled himself together.""Forget it, let's not think too much. Fortunately, most of the supers were cleared out in the remains. There are some fish that the three major organizations have missed, but not many. We can only pray that these bastards are not strong and that the rising light will not come to cause trouble, otherwise ... It will be really difficult for us!"
        "In addition, your trouble doesn't seem to be small. Then be obedient and stay in white moon City at ease. You can either wait for the Marquis" troops to return, or ... You can find a place to hide. "
        Without thinking too much, Hao lianchuan continued,"when the hou Department left, they insisted on promoting you. They probably wanted you to take charge of a section. How about this? you'll be in charge of the coastal defense. I'll transfer some supers to you to supplement your defense." As for outside of Whitemoon city, you can't go out as you please ... I'll do it then, I hope I won't be targeted. Anyway, it's still the same as before, I was originally in charge of this. "
        After saying that, he glanced at Li Hao hesitantly and suddenly said,""Li Hao, that ..."
        "What's wrong?"
        Li Hao looked at him suspiciously. What resentment did he have?
        Hao lianchuan said in a deep voice,"don't ignore the coastal defense!" It's true that Silver Moon hasn't been invaded by Pirates, so no one has a deep understanding of them. However, I know that some of the major cities near the North Sea might be raided by Pirates. If you're not careful, once the Pirates step onto land and attack the cities, some cities don't have night patrol branches. At that time ... The people will be in great misery!"
       
        "The coastline of the moon sea is very long! Don't think that it's over just because you've managed to defend Whitemoon city's defensive line. The Pirates probably won't rashly attack Whitemoon city ... It's more likely that they'll attack the surrounding cities. "
        "Out of the 16 cities in yinnan, apart from Whitemoon city, there are three other cities that are adjacent to the coastline. They are Nandu, fenghai, and liuyun. Among them, only Nandu has a night patrolman branch stationed there. Two sunlit men are stationed there ... The other two cities do not have any supers."
        "How did the Wei Wu Army Guard the place in the past?" Li Hao frowned.
        "Don't defend, take the initiative to attack. Every three to five days, they will take the initiative to clear out the enemy!"
        Hao lianchuan said seriously,"the Wei Wu Army has some reputation at sea. Ordinary Pirates don't dare to invade the Silvermoon Sea area. The main reason is that this area is barren. To those Pirates, they might as well go to the North Sea instead of coming to the Silvermoon to seek help. It's richer there." But now that the Wei Wu Army has left, do you think those Pirates will come here to make a profit?"
        Li Hao instantly had a headache!
        Three cities, plus Whitemoon city, four cities.
        And now, he had 50 people under him!
        If Liu Long left, there would be 49 people.
        With so few people, to have him guard four cities ... What a joke.
         Unless he was like the Wei Wu Army and took the initiative to attack at the intersection of the moon sea and the North Sea, directly annihilating the enemy outside, otherwise ... It was impossible to defend this.
        Hao lianchuan was also depressed."Don't look at me. I'll be lucky if I can defend a city on land."
        He had no other choice.
        "As for the garrison and the inspection Division ..."
        Li Hao glanced at him. Hao lianchuan thought for a while and said,""It's not that we can't ask for help, but originally, the night patrollers were the most powerful organization. The coastline and the extraordinary power of the city were all under our jurisdiction. But once we hand them over ... We can't get them back. Actually, I don't have any objections. It's not that we have to fight for power, but we just lost the territory that hou bu has just left ..."
        It didn't make sense!
        "Alright, I got it."
        Li Hao didn't say anything more. He stood up and was about to leave.
        "You're gone?"Hao lianchuan hurriedly asked.
        "What else?"
        Li Hao said gloomily,"let's go back to the Wei Wu Army's camp first. Also ... Give me a few cars. I have to travel by myself every time. It's embarrassing."
        "Alright!"
        This time, Hao lianchuan did not have much to say. It was too simple.
        Li Hao thought for a while, then threw out a bottle.""There are some clones of the blood God inside. Hao bu, use them. It'll be best if you can find the fifth lock. If you don't ... We'll think of another way,"
        Hao lianchuan was stunned."You have a Blood God?"
        He opened the bottle to take a look and took a deep breath. There were quite a few of them, and it seemed like a few of them were at the three yang level.
        "Where did you get this?"
        "I got it from killing people."
        Li Hao laughed."Alright, there's no need for Hao bu to be so pessimistic. There's not much of a problem on land. The main problem now is the sea. I'll be in charge! Just send me a few water descent Espers, I don't think the others will be of much use ... Oh, flying descent or scouting descent will do too. "
        At this point, he was stunned for a moment before he laughed."Just yunyao, Hu Hao, and Li Meng will do!"
        These three were the systems he was talking about.
        It was also a coincidence!
        Li Hao didn't have time to think about this. He suddenly remembered that the three of them had also followed him to white moon City and were now with the night patrollers.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "They?"
        Hao lianchuan was taken aback."They're just dark moons. The defense of the sea is important. What's the use of three dark moons? there's more sunshine on the night patrolmen's side now. There's also the three suns. Old he is also a Water-type and has reached the three-Suns level. I'll send him over to help you ..."
        It had to be said that this fatty was quite interesting.
        At this time, there were only three night watchmen, three suns, and they had to send one to help Li Hao.
        Li Hao shook his head."Forget it. The three suns and the moon are all the same. They're only used as informers. It's a waste to use the three suns. Let's leave it at that. Moreover, they're all my acquaintances, so it's more convenient. Minister he is not familiar with me, but he's a veteran. It's not appropriate for him to be my assistant."
        "That's fine,"
         Hao lianchuan did not say anything else when he saw how insistent he was.  Seeing that Li Hao was about to go downstairs, he followed him and said,""Do you think the Marquis will be able to come back alive after he reaches the central region?"
        “……”
        Li Hao glanced at him. Why do you sound like you're looking forward to him hanging in the central continent?
        "I don't know,"
        "Hey, Li Hao, I'm very dispirited now ..."
        Hao lianchuan sighed."I used to think that the three yang realm is very powerful. However, over the past few days, so many sunguangs and hundreds of three yang realm cultivators have died. I feel that the three yang realm is not safe. However, I'm not talented enough. The fifth Super Lock has not appeared yet. I'm really useless ..."
        "Hao bu, what do you want to tell me?"
        Li Hao was speechless. He had been sighing all this time. What do you want to say ... You can just say it!
        "Ahem, nothing much. I just wanted to say ... That ... Bring me to get rich together!"
        This fatty suddenly broke into a smile, without a trace of the melancholy he had earlier.
        Li Hao was stunned. What did he mean?
        Hao lianchuan made a face."Old hou is gone. Silver Moon is ours now. I heard that ... You killed Xuguang?" I've been sighing for a long time, and you didn't say you'd help me, so I'll just say it. If there's something in it ... I can also do things like murder and arson. That kid Wang Ming is too weak, so how could he be stronger than me?"
        What the hell!
        Li Hao was completely speechless!
        F * ck!
        Where did this fatty hear this from?
        To make a fortune together ... Do you think I'm a bandit?
        Also, when did we become brothers? a few days ago, I called you uncle, but today we're brothers?
        The fatty sighed for a long time. Li Hao had thought that he was really worried, but now it felt like ... This guy thought that he had more room to show off after hou Xiaochen left?
        "Hao bu ..." He said.
        "Call him brother Hao!"
        Hao lianchuan said seriously,"don't be too polite. That kid Wang Ming reached the late-stage of the sun glory realm in a few days. I don't have high expectations. Just call me the next time you have a deal. I'll be fine as long as you get me the peak of three suns!"
        “……”
        Li Hao was completely speechless and didn't say anything else. This guy wasn't very clear-headed and didn't want to say anything.
        He walked away.
        Behind them, Hao lianchuan said telepathically,"actually, Pirates have treasures too. There are many treasures in the sea. If you go out to clear them, remember to call me. Although I'm of the fire element, I can still fight in the sea. There's actually no danger on land, so you'll only have a chance in the sea ... Remember!"
        “……”
        Li Hao Ran away without looking back. He was crazy!
         Li Hao was still troubled by Hao lianchuan's actions, but Hao lianchuan had actually managed to calm down and encouraged Li Hao to take the initiative to Rob the Pirates ... Was this something a human could do?
        Hao lianchuan's voice rang in her ears again,""It's true. Pirates have treasures. If you don't believe me, you can check the information of the Wei Wu Army. There are many treasures in the sea. It is said that in the depths of the sea, there are ruins left behind by the ancient civilization, mineral veins, and even the spring of life. Since no one is paying attention to us now, and everyone thinks that we can only protect Whitemoon city ... Let's go out and do something. I'm sure we can make a fortune!"
        “……”
        Li Hao Ran faster and faster. If he ran any slower, he would be incited by the fatty."I haven't thought of anything yet, but you only think about getting rich."
        "Go back and check the information. It's true. There are a few pirate forces near the moon sea ... Once you're in the sea, it'll be hard for them to find you even if they're looking for you. I remember that the Wei Wu Army also sent a ship that seems to be an origin god weapon. I don't know if they took it with them, but it's highly likely that they didn 'T. Go back and take a look. Don't forget. Be quick. The Pirates of the North Sea will come soon. Let's get rid of these small Pirates as soon as possible ..."
        “……”
        At this moment, Li Hao had completely disappeared from his sight.
        Hao lianchuan sighed and shook his head when he saw him running away so quickly.
        You don't have the guts!
        If I don't make use of this opportunity to do a few things, I'm afraid I won't have the chance.
