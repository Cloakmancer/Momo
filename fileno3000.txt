The brilliant sun Supreme Emperor was shocked as well. The radiant God had arrived so quickly, so quickly that it seemed as if he had been here for a long time.Both Yun Xiao and the light Thearch came quickly.The two level eight venerable sovereigns seemed to have made an agreement.Of course, it was impossible for Yunxiao not to come. If he did not come, Deepsea might be killed by the human King in one strike.Just as he was thinking, BOOM!The saber fell!Heaven and earth shattered!Clouds and mist surrounded the area, and it was as if the cloud Heaven Temple had appeared between heaven and earth. Countless palaces were shattered by this blade!The powerful force swept out in all directions, causing the entire world to tremble!At the end of the world, a man appeared with a long saber in his hand. He had an unruly smile on his face."Yunxiao? Level eight venerable sovereign?"The Lord of the clouds looked very young, and his words were not overbearing, but his voice was a little ethereal.""Human King, why did you attack me?""Why?" the human King sneered. I'm happy to, can I?"Don't you know why?Your cloud divine world is nothing good either.This time, the human King didn't run away. Instead, he walked down from the void step by step. A powerful force swept in all directions. The Yin Yang millstone appeared and locked down the surrounding heaven and earth. He looked at venerable sovereign cloud heaven and licked his lips. "I've killed a level 7, but I've never killed a level 8! Today, I'm going to kill Deepsea for fun. If you don't retreat, I'll kill you as well!"Arrogant!Li Hao didn't expect the human King to be so arrogant.Of course, the more arrogant the human King was, the better.The experts had arrived ... But that was not enough. Whether they arrived or not had little to do with Li Hao. Li Hao looked at the sky, and a sword intent burst out of his body. The powerful sword intent connected heaven and earth!In an instant, tianfang universe seemed to become even clearer.Li Hao laughed."Human King, tianfang world and I are fated ... Today, I'm going to vindicate Level Seven!" You stop these guys and don't allow anyone to enter tianfang universe ... I want this universe!"The human King tilted his head and smiled.  Best novel online free at ùöó0ùöüùöéùöïùöãùöíùöó  His smile was very playful!What was this kid doing?From the looks of it, the borrowed power had something to do with tianfang universe. Was he deliberately opening tianfang universe?What was he after?In an instant, he thought of many things.Do you need me to stop these experts?"Come to think of it, I, Fang ping, have never done a losing business." He laughed openly and unscrupulously."Old man Li, can you guarantee that you'll enter the seventh tier? If I can ... I'll kill until rivers of blood flow ... If I can't ..."His eyes revealed a cold light!Then you little guy, you've caused me a lot of trouble. I'm going to get even with you later!"I'm 80% confident!"Li Hao also laughed. Both sides had a tacit understanding.Meanwhile, Li Hao shouted,""Wushan, help me defend the four directions. After it's done, neo martial will give you what they promised!" When these words came out, Wu Shan, who was about to fly up, cursed.This bastard!Do you have to prove that I colluded with new martial?Of course, it didn't matter now!On the other side, Supreme Emperor Yunxiao's eyes were cold."Wushan!"Are you really going to betray me?Meanwhile, Wu Shan's voice resounded,"realm Lord, today ... I will leave Yunxiao. Yunxiao is still my Yunxiao, and it is also realm Lord's Yunxiao. However ... Just because I'm leaving doesn't mean that I don't recognize Yunxiao anymore. If realm Lord still has some feelings for Wu Shan, I hope that realm Lord can fulfill my wish. If I succeed, I will definitely repay Yunxiao ..." Supreme Emperor Yunxiao did not speak.On the other hand, the deep sea venerable sovereign was furious."Wushan, have you gone mad? What time is it now? are you going to extract the power of the great Dao? You bastard!"You want to leave at this critical moment?"You!" He roared."Help the realm Lord seize the great Dao universe. Once Yunxiao steps into level nine, you'll be the first level eight under the realm Lord!"Wushan ignored him.What I'm after is not the eighth-rank, what does Deepsea know?He didn't care at all and flew straight into the sky. At this moment, the great path universe had completely appeared. However, before the crack was opened, the speed of the fog Mountain sovereign was extremely fast. The surrounding seventh level experts couldn't hold back any longer!Who would wait?All the experts flew up into the sky crazily. As for what the opening of the great path universe had to do with Sword Master ... They couldn't care!Since it had appeared, it was the best result.Li Hao also flew into the sky. Seeing this, the human King's eyes flickered, and he quickly flew into the sky as well. On the other side, the radiant sovereign rose into the air without a word.The cloud master's expression was ice-cold as he also disappeared from his spot.At this moment, it was not important whether Wushan would leave or not. However, Wushan's departure might affect his seizing of the great path universe. This was the key. The Lord of the clouds 'eyes were also cold.Wushan didn't see the big picture!He didn't know the overall situation!At this moment, if Yunxiao could successfully seize it and his great Dao could enter the ninth grade, so what if he let him escape in the future?Do you have to go against me now?He was a little angry!At this moment, extremely powerful auras swept across the entire tianfang universe, making it extremely dangerous.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The Crimson Moon world.The venerable sovereigns were still chatting. Suddenly, the red moon sovereign's expression changed slightly. He looked up into the distance. In the universe of the great path, a faint will spread out."The universe has appeared. Light, cloud, and human King have all descended ... The sword Saint has appeared and killed the Dragon with one strike ..."The message was instantly sent back.Those were the spies left in Tian Fang. They had quickly sent back the news, but they had also paid a great price.

Chapter 3001 The East Doesn't Light Up, The West Does
Two rank eights and one peak rank seven had appeared.Red Moon master's expression changed slightly, and she quickly rose into the air. In an instant, her voice spread."Quickly!"Soon, the experts arrived one by one.This included the four rank seven venerable sovereigns from the three great worlds. The endless sky World had two rank seven venerable sovereigns.The Sen LAN sector Lord and AI Hong sovereign also appeared.Six rank seven venerable sovereigns!Red Moon master did not say much and quickly said,""The tianfang universe has appeared!"So fast!It was so fast that he was a little surprised. He was also secretly glad that he didn't listen to AI Hong and attack the three worlds. Otherwise, he definitely wouldn't have finished subduing them. By then, he would be in big trouble and could only give up on Tian Fang.As for the forest orchid sector Lord, his warning wasn't bad. He knew that time was of the essence, so he quickly said,""Aihong will stay behind to protect the Crimson Moon ... And the other three worlds!"As he said that, he glanced at the forest orchid sector Lord.He didn't feel at ease with the other party staying behind.After all, they hadn't completely fused together.He quickly said,"Senlan, tianlan, cangjiang, and Yueming, the world Lords, will set off with me. Lanyue will stay behind and work with aihong to protect the three worlds!"The moment these words were spoken, the heart of the forest orchid sector Lord trembled.Ëâπ!This was big trouble!How did this happen?They had agreed to take the venerable sovereigns of the three worlds with them, but at the critical moment, Red Moon master changed his mind. Did he find something, or was he just taking precautions?The three worlds also felt that Red Moon master's decision was good.Otherwise, they would not be at ease leaving two seventh level Crimson moons behind. Now, they had left behind a seventh level venerable sovereign from the three major worlds, as well as AI Hong, which was in line with everyone's interests.It wasn't that Red Moon master didn't trust sector Lord Sen LAN, it was just that ... He was a new person, after all. He was worried that he would have a conflict with AI Hong.In addition, there were no rank-7s left in the three worlds, so there might be some discooperation.Since that was the case ... He would bring Sen LAN along and leave the other rank-7 from the endless sky World behind.In any case, both parties had already signed an agreement.As for sector Lord Sen LAN...At this moment, he was helpless. He was in deep trouble."If I leave, I won't be able to quickly split the Crimson Moon great Dao universe, nor will I be able to shake the entire Crimson Moon universe. At that time ... Once Li Hao and the others return, they won't have to face a half-crippled AI Hong, nor will they need my help. They'll be able to quickly finish off the other party.They were two level Seven venerable sovereigns at their full strength!Even if Red Moon master did not come back, how could they expect venerable sword and the others to deal with two level Seven venerable sovereigns at full combat power?Previously, he was still wondering if he would eat meat ... But now, he was really in trouble.This was too unexpected!Sector Lord Sen LAN didn't say anything, his face was calm, but ... He was about to cry in his heart. He followed beside Red Moon King, so he couldn't say anything. Silver Moon King, I didn't expect such a change.Red Moon master didn't care much and said,""There's no time to lose ... Let's set off quickly. Everyone, act according to the situation! "Aihong, lanyue, both of you have to be careful. After all, the new martial arts land has yet to emerge. However, with the two of you overseeing it, even if they appear, as long as we resist them, we will return soon!""Don't worry, my Lord!"Sovereign AI Hong was happy to not go to Tian Fang. After all, it was very dangerous there. Judging from the situation, a large number of Level Seven and level eight experts would be gathering there.Even among the new martial artists, only sun god and Emperor Cang were at the seventh rank.Two against two, it was much safer than that side.The endless sky world's Supreme Emperor LAN Yue was a rare female advanced Supreme Emperor. At this moment, she also nodded slightly. She was the endless sky world's realm Lord, and the Dao master was the endless sky Supreme Emperor, so she was slightly stronger than her.At this moment, they were far away in the sky. The power of the world was limited, but the power of the great Dao was infinite. The Dao master was more suitable for long-distance battles, and she was more suitable to stay behind.Previously, when the Crimson Moon master had wanted to take all of them away, tianlan had actually agreed.And now, it was even better to let her stay.After all, it was hard to say whether they could take over Tian Fang, but they still had to guard their base."Senlan, you don't have any objections, do you?""Everything happened so suddenly," Red Moon master said in a deep voice."You haven't completely merged with the red moon. I'm worried too. Once I leave, there'll be no one to suppress the great Dao. You'll be easily injured. Following me is more suitable for you to merge with the great Dao universe ...""Milord is right, I have no objections!"Sector Lord Sen LAN laughed,"to be able to witness a battle between experts is something I've been dreaming of!." "That's good, I thought you wouldn't be happy ..."He said."How could it be!""Then I won't say anything more. You guys follow behind me. I'll Cover You with a bed and teleport. I'll try to arrive at tianfang as soon as possible!"After saying that, he opened up his great Dao universe. The seventh level venerable sovereigns were tempted, but before they could see anything, the five of them disappeared in the next moment!As the Crimson Moon universe covered the area, the venerable sovereigns disappeared in the blink of an eye!Not far away, the venerable sovereigns who had gathered ... Especially King Huai, saw this scene and his heart skipped a beat.I'll go!Did this Red Moon sovereign sense danger, or ... Were all eighth rank sovereigns the chosen ones of chaos? they had agreed on this, but at the last moment, something happened!They thought that the three worlds and the Crimson Moon would become their pillaging grounds. In the end, they left behind two stage 7 experts who weren't on their side, while sector Lord Sen LAN was taken away!King Huai was also secretly worried. This was going to be troublesome.Not far away, Supreme Emperor Yan Fang's heart was also thumping. He actually knew some inside information. The realm Lord had been taken away!What was this good?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, Tian Fang was in complete chaos!Everyone soared into the sky and flew in the direction of the great path universe. Auras swept across the world. Li Hao was also approaching the great path universe quickly, waiting in secret for the arrival of Red Moon master!It'd be best if he could do it within a minute. Otherwise, it would be a little troublesome.As a level eight great cosmos Lord, it was actually very fast for him to descend. As long as the experts of the Crimson Moon were here, they could arrive very quickly by walking through the great Dao universe without considering the consumption and price.And the truth was just as Li Hao had expected.Not long after the explosion, everyone sensed a powerful force gathering. In the distance, near the regional wall, a venerable sovereign suddenly exploded with a bang!The power of the Crimson Moon spread in all directions!In the next moment, even the expressions of the two level 8 powerhouses changed slightly.At this moment, a total of five venerable sovereigns appeared near the regional wall.As for Li Hao...He turned his head, and his expression changed.Why would Senlan be here?Logically speaking, monarch Senlan had yet to fully integrate and needed to quietly cultivate in seclusion. In addition, the red moon had at least two rank-7s to keep things under control, so it would not be so fast to conquer the three worlds ...But now, did five venerable sovereigns represent that the three great worlds had been subdued?So fast?In other words, there was also a seventh-rank combatant from the three worlds who stayed behind. There were also two seventh-rank combatants with the red moon, AI Hong?'I ...'Li Hao suddenly felt like cursing!This change had come too quickly. Best novel online free at nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  The perfect plan was slightly ruined. As expected, the plan was not as fast as the changes. In an instant, thousands of thoughts emerged in his mind. The presence of two seventh rank venerable sovereigns was definitely a bad thing!However, it would be a good thing if he succeeded. Two level 7s would be a huge gain. The key was that ... It would not be that easy to take them down!If it was just one, that was still alright. With the cooperation of the Senlan realmlord, things would be much simpler.The two of you ... Are really seeing ghosts!Li Hao thought quickly, but he soon adjusted his mindset. Senlan's arrival might not be a bad thing!The East does not light up, but the West does!Sen LAN, Wu Shan, the human King, himself, and even the radiant God and brilliant sun Thearch ...This was also an extremely powerful force, right?Li Hao and Kong Ji were the key people in this situation!Maybe ... He could severely injure the Crimson Moon here?Or perhaps ... He looked up at a person ... Wu Shan!"Old Wu, tianfang is a dead land, after all. How about ... I take you to the three worlds to have some fun? the Crimson Moon is hard to take, and the three worlds are not as good as tianfang, but together, they're not bad!At this moment, Li Hao had many thoughts.He would take it one step at a time. Anyway, things had already come to this. After paying such a huge price, he had to reap some benefits.In the distance, sector Lord Sen LAN also looked at Li Hao for the first time ... Or rather, Li Hao, who was pretending to be sword venerable. His eyes flickered. 'Luckily, you're still here. You saw me coming. If you have to give up, then give up!'

Chapter 3002 I've Struck It Rich (1)
Give up?Li Hao wouldn't give up at this point.It was normal for there to be changes to the plan. He did not expect everything to go as planned, so he just had to adapt to the situation.When the five venerable sovereigns appeared, even the Lord of Light's expression changed, and his face turned slightly ugly. Apparently, he did not expect that the red moon could persuade the major cosmos absolute beings so quickly.This wasn't normal, it was too fast.Of course, they didn't know that Red Moon master had signed a great Dao covenant without hesitation. The light Master and cloud Master wouldn't agree to this easily, as the restrictions were too great.They weren't as anxious as Red Moon master, and they weren't as anxious as he was. Naturally, they wouldn't casually sign a Primal Chaos lightning tribulation covenant with other worlds.So, when these people arrived, everyone was actually shocked.The neo martial King looked sideways ... And recognized the red moon master at a glance. In fact, the two sides had never met before. The bosses of the two worlds had never met before.The human King wandered around the Crimson Moon world for a long time, but he did not go there. He said that he was lost ...Tian Fang was so far away, but he didn't see him getting lost halfway.However, he was lost for a long time near the Crimson Moon.In those years, he had been cleaning up some of Crimson moon's allies, including The Dark World and the Elysian world, which were actually Crimson moon's early allies. He had also cleaned up some chaos itinerant cultivators and the like.He had killed countless people.However, they had never reached the Crimson Moon.This time, he recognized the red moon master at a glance. She was a rank eight master, and the power of the red moon permeated the air.Then, he looked at Li Hao ... Was it your purpose to attract this person here? Best novel online free at nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  You want to dig out his lair?The old man's hope of advancing was in his lair, right?You went through so much trouble and even opened up tianfang universe just for this, right?At this moment, the human King understood everything!When the red moon master appeared, he completely understood what the new king of Silver Moon was up to. Of course, it was also related to his understanding of venerable sword.However, the next moment, Ren Wang raised his eyebrows slightly. It was just that ... Five venerable sovereigns had come, and they were all advanced venerable sovereigns. This was probably not within your expectations, right?The new king of the Silvermoon Kingdom seemed to have made a mistake in his plan.The corner of his mouth rose slightly. It was normal. He had been making plans since he was weak. Up until now ... All his plans had never gone smoothly.He grinned.The new king of Silver Moon was too young. If he had been training in neo martial arts for a few years, he would have understood that all his plans were actually nonsense ... The process of planning was not necessary, only the result was needed!From the looks of it, it was unexpected that so many people had come.He wanted to see how the Silver Moon King would deal with this.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, Li Hao continued to float up without saying a word and headed straight for the heavenly boundary.Where to open the door, I have the final say!This was the initiative!Those in front of you, no matter how fast you run, is there any use?If the Dao universe doesn't open, can you force it open?If he had the ability, he would have forcefully opened it long ago. As he calculated in his heart, he was not in a hurry.The situation was not out of control yet!It was just a few more venerable sovereigns than expected ...As Li Hao soared into the sky, a crack seemed to appear in the great path universe. In the distance, a venerable sovereign attacked forcefully, but he hit nothing. He did not touch the great path universe at all.A seventh level venerable sovereign's expression changed. He turned his head and shouted,""The crack is at the sword saint's side!"He didn't need to say anything, everyone had already seen it.Even Wu Shan couldn't help but curse!Ëâπ!Didn't we agree to open the door in my direction?Why did he go to your side?What the hell was the Silver Moon King doing?Could it be that it was all a pretense, and this fellow wanted him to enter?Back when they had reached an agreement, the Silver Moon King had been very weak, but he wasn't weak now. Just looking at his aura, he had already reached the seventh step. Perhaps he also wanted to monopolize Tian Fang.He quickly changed his direction and headed straight for Li Hao.This bastard!He even wanted to curse!Behind them, the light Master and the cloud Master also changed their direction quickly. Further away, the five venerable sovereigns crossed the boundary wall and headed straight for them. Red Moon master was also delighted.,m Just in time!The great Dao had just appeared and had not yet been completely opened. This was good. He thought that he had come a little late. He did not expect that the crack had just opened. Was the heaven waiting for him?BOOM!At this moment, a huge crack appeared in the sky. It quickly shrank and gradually formed the shape of a door.At the same time, in the dark Demon Ridge below.Suddenly, a ray of light mixed with extremely powerful Emperor pressure shot into the sky.It was as if he had been summoned!The pressure of a rank nine venerable sovereign spread out.The radiant sovereign and the others were all shocked!The next moment, a chessboard full of chess pieces appeared in the sky."Dao chess!"Someone exclaimed,"a ninth-grade Emperor weapon! It's actually in the dark Demon Ridge!"At this moment, he seemed to have vaguely understood something.The opening of tianfang universe might have something to do with the ninth-rank sovereign weapon. At this moment, many people were excited, even the seventh-rank venerable sovereigns who didn't have much hope were excited.This was because it was rumored that Dao chess was also forged by an eighth-tier universe.This meant that there wasn't just a ninth-tier universe here, but also an eighth-tier universe!This ... Was a pleasant surprise.Even if a few level-eights had taken away the Dao universe, they should at least get a share of the loot from the Dao chess, right?

Chapter 3003 I'm Going To Be Rich (3)
At this moment, a dark aura flickered on Li Hao's body. He sneered and said in a loud voice,""You guys give up! This world, this world, this chess piece, they are all mine!""I've already inherited some of the inheritances left behind by the master of Tian Fang. If not for that ... How could this great Dao universe be opened so easily? Today is the day that I, li Changsheng, will reach rank seven ... If you want to snatch the treasure, you'll have to ask the sword in my hand if it's okay!"With that, the chess piece headed straight for Li Hao!In an instant, the chess piece penetrated the void and appeared beside Li Hao.The venerable sovereigns were shocked!No wonder!"Wushan, give me a hand. When I take down the great path universe, I'll reward you with this piece of chess. It'll help you get rid of the control of cloud heaven and become an eighth-level universe master on your own!"Wu Shan quickly came through the air and didn't respond at all.'You brat, you're lying. Just pretend you didn't hear me. You even played a chess game. What are you trying to do?'What do you want to do?Li Hao went straight into the Dao universe and shouted,""Radiant God, human King, and Wu Shan, help me block the others. Wait for the crack to close. When I come out of the universe again, it will be the time of death for these people!"As soon as he finished speaking, he rushed straight into the crack and instantly entered it.,m In the next moment, Wu Shan was the first to arrive.His expression changed slightly.Should I ... Enter?According to his agreement with Li Hao, now that the red moon Lord was here, he didn't need to guard the crack and could just enter. But ...Red Moon master's arrival, along with many venerable sovereigns, had obviously ruined some of the original plans.Then do I still have to stay here?Li Hao clearly had such thoughts.After hesitating for a moment, Wu Shan gritted his teeth and blocked the crack in an instant. A powerful force swept out, turning the whole world into a sea of clouds and mist. The expressions of the venerable sovereigns who were rushing in from behind changed.The Masters of the great Dao attacked one after another!BOOM!The heavens fell and the earth cracked.At that moment, the cloud Master also shouted,""Wushan, just what are you doing? The universe of the great path is right in front of you. Even if you want to leave, this is your chance. You're actually guarding the door for a sixth-tier cultivator?"Wushan was really guarding the gate!Damn it!It was embarrassing.What right did the sword Saint have to make the second most powerful person in the cloud world guard the door?Wushan, what's in your head?He was furious!Even if Wu Shan had left and fought for the great Dao universe, he would have felt that it would have been better than now. Wu Shan was not willing to work for him, but in the end, he was working for a sixth-tier cultivator? Bastard!This was simply a slap in the face!The light God's eyes flickered, but he didn't say anything. He frowned slightly. The sacred central crypt had asked him to stop the cloud Master ... But what was the situation now?He was a little confused.They weren't the only ones. In fact, Wu Shan couldn't understand it either. Li Hao had entered the Dao universe ... This was very strange. Best novel online free at nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"Senior, if we imprison all these people, will they be able to seize the great Dao universe? Or should I directly break through the Dao universe and leave?"Li Hao quickly asked.A voice came from the chess piece,"all?" There are more than a dozen seventh rank venerable sovereigns outside, and several eighth rank venerable sovereigns ... With so many venerable sovereigns, they are extremely powerful. If they work together, they can still break through. After all, the great Dao is dead now, not like it was in the past!"It could be broken!The premise was that they had to join forces.Obviously, this great path universe was indeed powerful."And ... Do you want me to teleport you out of here? It's possible ... But it will consume even more energy. Even the level-six cultivator you have isn't enough. It's very difficult to pass through the boundary wall of the great Dao universe ... It's enough outside, but it's definitely not enough to teleport you out from inside!"Dao Qi had also seen through Li Hao's plan. Locking the person in and teleporting him away ... It was a good and beautiful idea.However, the difficulty had increased exponentially.This was also why Li Hao had not wanted to enter before, but now he had taken the initiative.If there was a slight change in the situation, he would change it slightly.One more thing, Li Hao's time to borrow power was almost up.In fact, a long time had passed. One minute was a long time for top-tier experts, but now that the red moon Lord had appeared, Li Hao's time was almost up.According to the original plan, one minute would have been enough. Li Hao should have been blocking some people outside instead of entering this place and wandering the great Dao universe.BOOM!Outside, a battle had already broken out. Some people were trying to force their way in. Venerable sovereign Wu Shan was blocking the door and fighting with others. However, in the blink of an eye, he was forced to retreat because there was more than one seventh-rank expert.It was obvious that monarch Wu Shan was no match for them.Light and the human King didn't make a move. It was unknown whether they were waiting for an opportunity or simply didn't take what Li Hao and the others had discussed seriously.At this time, the plan seemed to have been completely messed up.These powerhouses couldn't be controlled at all. They couldn't fight whoever Li Hao wanted them to!Although Cloud Master didn't make a move, no one stopped him. Red Moon master and his men arrived quickly, but no one stopped them ... Everyone stopped quickly and looked at Wu mountain as if they were waiting for something.He was waiting for the Lord of the clouds!As an eighth-grade master of great Dao, he had a choice at the moment. He could either help Wu mountain or suppress Wu mountain directly. The power that Wu mountain extracted came from the cloud universe.

Chapter 3004 I'm Rich (3)
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the universe of the great path.Li Hao quickly moved forward, not caring about what was happening behind him. He had also sensed that the human King and the others had not followed his plan ... He felt a little regretful, but he did not take it too seriously.These people were obviously not under his command.This strengthened Li Hao's belief ... He couldn't rely on anyone, not even the human King. It wasn't that the human King was doing this on purpose, but the timing wasn't suitable for the human King. Who would he attack?To deal with the red moon Lord?Even if he could match Red Moon master, there were still four rank Sevens.Thus, they had their own judgment ... Those who were not Li Hao's subordinates would not carry out his orders completely.The two of them were waiting for the right moment.Li Hao heard the voice of the mysterious man again.""They don't seem to be planning to attack now ... Why don't we close the door of the great Dao? if they can't enter, we'll just endure it. These people won't be able to open the great Dao universe for a while."Li Hao ignored Dao Qi and continued to fly into the void.The speed was extremely fast!He didn't seem to care about what was going on outside. He followed his senses and moved forward. After a while, his strength began to fade. Li Hao was slightly weak, but not too weak.One minute was up. In this one minute, the power of the seventh step seemed to be of no use, except to display the power of a sword venerable. It was a waste of this borrowing of strength.The mysterious man sighed in his heart ... He was still too weak.Time cultivators might be powerful, but they were still weak at the moment ... There was nothing they could do.It was a mess!Li Hao's eyes lit up. He had already seen a world flickering with a faint light."Senior, this is the Silvermoon world!"I know! Best novel online free at nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  And then?It's a middle-level world that's isolated from the rest of the world, and there's not even a venerable sovereign in it.What's the point of finding the Silvermoon world?"The Silver Moon dual Dao universe is here!""Senior, can you do me a favor?" Li Hao quickly asked."Speak!""Slightly conceal the great Dao fluctuations. I'm going to descend from the dual-Dao universe!"The mysterious man was stunned. What did he mean?Where would it descend?"Can senior do it?""Tianfang world?""Yes,""Alright then!""Alright!"Li Hao did not say anything. He quickly approached the Silver Moon world. In an instant, he seemed to have entered a universe of the great path. Even Dao chess had entered it. In an instant, Dao chess sensed something unusual.Two Dao universes ... Interesting.Although Li Hao said so, it was the first time the mysterious man had seen it.However, he was very weak.A third-tier universe. It's useless even if you control this place.At this moment, a time star was quickly conjured by Li Hao. The two universes seemed to have merged in an instant. Stars appeared in the void, and Li Hao quickly locked onto one.In the next moment, it headed straight for the star.In any case, Dao Qi didn't understand what this guy was going to do.Li Hao quickly approached the star. The star flickered, but it wasn't too strong. It gave Dao chess the feeling that it wasn't at the venerable sovereign level. Of course, it was close, but not even at the venerable sovereign level ...At this moment, Li Hao's River appeared and began to excavate the planet ...The mysterious man was puzzled,'you want to descend into this person's body? This person is very weak. After you descend, your strength will be greatly weakened. You ... Weren't too strong to begin with ..."What are you doing?"Senior," Li Hao quickly said,"help me conceal the fluctuations later. Also, help me hide Silver Moon so that no one can find him ... I don't need your help with anything else!"This was also the condition he had mentioned before, so the mysterious man didn't refuse.In tianfang universe, concealing the Silver Moon wasn't a big problem.It was just that ... They had watched helplessly as Li Hao excavated that planet as if he had dug out a tunnel. This guy didn't exit from the place he had come from, nor did he open another door. Instead, he came here ... It felt like an unnecessary move.What was he doing?The mysterious man didn't understand ... But he couldn't be bothered.The mysterious man watched as Li Hao merged with the star bit by bit. At this moment, he seemed to have become one with the star. This surprised him. Interesting. This weak star could actually withstand Li Hao's energy.They seemed to be ... From the same source?Was he Li Hao's successor?The illusory figure thought about it and helped to cover up the fluctuations. The fluctuations were not too strong. When a battle broke out in the outside world, the battle between the seventh and eighth-rank spiritual beasts would not be so obvious."Your successor?""My master!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe mysterious man was speechless. Your master?Your master ... Hasn't become a venerable sovereign yet? F * ck!It was really beyond his expectations.No wonder the energy was so harmonious. However, what's the use of you landing on your master's body?You're only a fourth rank venerable sovereign now. Even if you're stronger than an ordinary fourth rank venerable, you can't borrow strength from others. What can you do if you go out?Li Hao ignored him and gradually disappeared into the void.Soon, the stars dimmed.Dao Qi floated in the air and couldn't help but laugh."Aren't you afraid that I'll directly Annex this world?""Although it's very weak, it's a special dual-Dao universe, after all, and it trusts me enough. Of course, I don't think this level-three universe is worth much.Soon, an aura flickered and covered the entire universe of the great path and the Silver Moon world.The vast void was filled with countless dim stars.Silvermoon did not stand out at all.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the outside world.Yuan Shuo and the others were picking up scraps. In fact, the scraps weren't big. Only a little of Li Hao's energy had leaked out after killing a few venerable sovereigns. The remaining scraps were the aftershocks from the battle between some top venerable sovereigns. They didn't dare to absorb them because they were too strong.

3005 Chapter 493
He was like a rag-picker!Yuan Shuo, who was also a member of this broken Army, was picking up scraps everywhere ... He looked miserable and in a bad mood. He recognized Li Hao and saw him enter the great Dao universe. He also heard Li Hao's voice, asking the human King and the others to attack.In the end, it was only Wu Shan who made a move ... Yuan Shuo cursed in his heart.They felt that the human King was not giving them face!Li Hao had offended Red Moon, not because of him, but because of neo martial, but the human King didn't give him any face at all ... Just as he was cursing in his heart, his expression suddenly changed.Without saying anything, he quickly found a place and sat down cross-legged. Soon, his aura became stronger, and in an instant, the aura of a venerable sovereign appeared ... And then disappeared.In the next moment, Yuan Shuo seemed to feel a little uncomfortable, and his own voice appeared in his mind,""You bastard, what are you doing coming out of my body?"What was this kid doing?Fortunately, my physique is not bad. Otherwise, you, a fourth level venerable sovereign, coming out of my Dao Meridian ... It's going to kill me. If it weren't for the fact that our energy is so compatible, he, a Heavenly King, would have exploded in an instant!"Teacher, shut up!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùUnfilial son!Treasonous!Who should he shut up?Yuan Shuo cursed in his heart, but he still kept his mouth shut. Was Li Hao going to run away?This time, he didn't seem to have any gains. Now that the door to the great Dao realm was still open, wasn't he losing the great Dao universe? Best novel online free at nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Or should I lock it up first and then run?In the sky, Thearch Wushan could not hold on any longer. He was also cursing. 'I can't hold him back anymore. He's going in. Whether the others can enter or not ... He can't care anymore. He said that the neo martial King and the God of Light would help, but in the end ... He didn' t!'Wu Shan was already preparing to enter!At that moment, the cloud Master, who had been quiet all this while, suddenly snorted. Wu Shan felt his aura fluctuate for a moment. With a loud bang, he was hit by a venerable sovereign and was instantly covered in blood!He turned his head to look at venerable Emperor Yunxiao. The latter looked indifferent and did not say anything.Yes, he was suppressing the mist Mountain!Monarch Wu Shan didn't say anything. He should have been prepared for this. However, he had underestimated the realm Lord. He had thought that even if the realm Lord were to fall out with him, it would be the time for him to leave.As it turned out ... There was no need to wait until then. The other party had made the first move!It was rapidly snatching away his great Dao's power.The Lord of the clouds did not say anything. 'You're leaving ... How can I agree to you leaving with the energy? leave the power of the great Dao first.'Although the power of a great Dao was very difficult to strip away from the peak tier 7 Wushan ...But at this moment, a fierce battle was taking place on Wushan, and it was just the right time.If it was another time, it would not be easy to clean up.He had forcefully stripped it off and damaged the foundation of the great Dao universe.Monarch Wushan was not sad. He laughed bitterly. "It's a little early ... That's normal!"After all, I was about to leave. Only, I had originally been a little naive in thinking that you would at least care about our old friendship. As you can see, this is actually a very suitable time for me to leave. I didn't leave because I was actually worried that the radiant sovereign and the others would target you.Unfortunately ... Cloudsky seemed to think that he was the one who couldn't escape at this moment.Wu Shan sighed and quickly recovered his smile. The next moment, a boundless energy shook the world and swept in all directions. The powerful energy spread in all directions, and a universe seemed to appear in the sky!The cloud master's expression changed slightly. At that moment, his cloud world was revealed.Among them, a huge star flickered directly. Sovereign Wushan looked at him from a distance.Yunxiao ... This time, he really had to say goodbye!"I'll only strip 70% of my power and return you 30% of my Crimson Moon Power ... It won't be too much of a loss for you to keep the power of a newly-advanced level Seven!""If you try to stop us by force, we will only suffer more losses. Yunxiao, let's part on good terms!" Wu Shan's voice was like a great Bell.The cloud master's expression was ice-cold!He looked at him and said in a low voice,"you left the clouds at this moment. Is this considered a good ending?" You know how important the tianfang great Dao universe is to me, and you also know that I, Yunxiao, don't have an advantage in the Four Realms ... But you have to leave now. Wushan, is this your so-called peaceful parting?"Wu Shan sighed."Everyone has their own aspirations ... I've said that only extracting 70% of my power is not a big loss for you. After this, if the opportunity is right, I can kill a tier 7 expert ... The power of the great Dao that I've seized will all belong to you. Even if it's not enough to make up for all the losses, it's not much of a difference! What else do you want me to do? It's been so many years, and I've done everything you told me to do. It's not one or two years, I've reached Level 7 for 300000 years, it's too long. All these years, you all went into closed door cultivation, you all cultivated, I did almost everything in the inner realm ... Isn't that enough?""Hmph!""Hmph!" The cloud Master snorted."That's because he thinks highly of you. Don't you know what's good for you?""But I ..." Wu Shan chuckled."I clearly rejected him. I said I wanted to rest for a while."The cloud Master ignored him and continued to look at him coldly.He knew that the human King, Red Moon, and light seemed to be waiting for this opportunity. However, he knew that Wu Shan would not give them this chance. He just looked at Wu Shan and said,""If you strip away your seventh-rank power now, I might die Here, and Yunxiao might be destroyed!"

Chapter 3006 I'm Going To Be Rich (3)_5
He wasn't afraid of anything. He understood Wu Shan.At this moment, he revealed a smile.""Wushan, it's not impossible for you to force your way out. Just like you said, it wouldn't matter much if you took away 70% of the shares. Do you ... Wish for cloudsky to be destroyed?"He stretched out his hand and pointed at the people outside. He sneered,""They're like vicious wolves. Once they see that I'm weak, they'll definitely take advantage of the situation and attack me! But now, it's already very difficult for us to co-exist ... Wushan, give up all your power and I'll give you a chance. I'll let you leave, or preserve your power of the sixth step. This is my bottom line!"Tier 6!Although it was only a difference of one rank, it was a world of difference.Under such circumstances, preserving strength of the sixth step could be said to be ... Practically the rhythm of courting death.Wu Shan looked at him."I'll tell you the truth." The cloud Master remained calm."Before this, I transferred a large amount of energy from my great Dao to deep sea. Deep sea is about to reach the peak of Level Seven! Right now, I'm barely at rank 8. If you force yourself out and take away my power, I might drop in rank ..."As soon as he said that, the venerable sovereigns 'faces changed.The radiant sovereign and the others were all rather surprised. Was this for real? Best novel online free at nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Behind him, Deepsea suddenly exuded a powerful aura. She no longer showed any signs of nearly collapsing after being slashed by the human King. At this moment, she looked at Wu Shan with a complicated expression."Wu Shan, the realmlord ... Is right! If you forcefully leave now, the realm Lord's cultivation level might drop. The realm Lord trusts you very much. He believes that you won't kill Yunxiao!"Wu Shan was stunned.He looked at the two of them. At this moment, the venerable sovereigns who were attacking around them had all chosen to stop. For a moment, many people were looking at Wu Shan.He didn't expect to see such a big show here.He wasn't suppressing it by force, but ... He was using the safety of the cloud world and the cloud world Lord's rank to gamble on Wu Shan's conscience.Some venerable sovereigns even wanted to laugh.Is he crazy?To expect a peak rank seven venerable sovereign to have a conscience ... Was the cloud Master crazy?At this moment, everyone was no longer in a hurry.Although venerable the sword had already entered, the universe of the great path was still quiet, as if there were no signs of recovery. In addition, level eight venerable sovereigns were guarding nearby, so everyone could only take advantage of the chaos and rush in!The choice of Wu Shan ... Was a very interesting matter.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"Shameless!"Yuan Shuo suddenly cursed under his breath as a voice appeared in his mind,""Is this Lord of the clouds using morality to restrain that Wushan? If it were me, I would never accept such a threat. Kid, what do you think?" I want to leave!You've dropped a level, so you'll die. It's none of my business! As long as I have no morals, no one can restrain me.There was also the deep sea venerable sovereign. It seemed that the cloud sky had reached an agreement. Wu Shan could leave, but he could not take away the power of the seventh step. The power of the great Dao had to be left behind. The master of the cloud sky had used Wu Shan's power to do a favor and obtained the support of the other venerable sovereigns.Otherwise, although Wushan was quite popular, it was useless. To a seventh rank venerable sovereign, the benefits of sharing the power of a seventh rank venerable sovereign ... Were far more important than friendship!"Good news!"Li Hao smiled and said telepathically, teacher, the heavens are on my side!What was going on?"The heavens are helping you, my ass. I think even the heavens are against you. This person seems to be in cahoots with you. If he really gives up his peak tier 7 power ... It'll be difficult for you to do anything. Out of all the powerhouses here, only this person still listens to you."Wushan is a man of honor. He will give up his power!"Li Hao quickly said,"he and I reached some agreements, and he carried them out faithfully every time. He's always like this to outsiders. To the cloud world, although the cloud Master is disgusting, Wushan won't really let him drop in realm. This is the reason why the cloud Master is fearless! They understand Wushan. I've only had a brief encounter with him, but I can already tell, let alone them ..."Therefore, Wu Shan could be considered an honest man, even if he was very smart. But sometimes, it wasn't a matter of intelligence, but that there were some bottom lines in his heart that couldn't be broken!The Lord of the clouds had used a very disgusting method, using the life and death of the cloud world to threaten him ... Even if he knew, Wu Shan might still choose to give up!At this moment, Li Hao quickly used the chess Dao imprint and sent a message,""Kong Ji, don't wait any longer ... Quickly go to Wushan and think of a way to convey to the light Emperor that the conditions have changed. When Wu Shan relinquishes his power...You take Wu Shan away!"In the distance, Kong Ji was also stunned.Had the plan changed?He didn't say much and quickly flew into the sky. At this moment, he didn't hide his aura. In front of this group of experts, it couldn't be hidden. Many people looked down and didn't care too much.Some people recognized his aura, such as Red Moon master. Her eyes were cold, but she didn't say anything.The radiant sovereign was still here!As for the radiant God, he turned his head to look at his son...And frowned slightly. This place wasn't suitable for his son to come. Since he had hidden himself, he should have done so more cleanly. Now that he had been suddenly exposed, had his plan been foiled?"Father ... When Wushan relinquishes his power ... Save his life and force an attack to break the current stalemate ... As for the rest, let father do as he wishes. Just leave Wushan alive!"Was it that simple?The radiant sovereign didn't say anything. This was easy.

3007 Chapter 493
At that moment, Supreme Emperor Wushan looked at Yun Xiao and the others, then at the interior of the great path universe. His expression gradually calmed down. Everything was more disgusting than he had expected.Yunxiao, the master of the world, actually used the safety of the world to threaten him, a person who was about to leave the world. How ridiculous was that?,m He understood!It was very clear!But ... He smiled and looked at Yunxiao and then at Deepsea.""It seems like cloudsky's internal department has reached an agreement. They don't want me to take away any energy, right?"The two of them were speechless.It was like this!"Actually, Yunxiao, even if I forcefully break away from you, you might not lose your level. If that really happens, I'll just take back the power of the great Dao that I've given to the deep sea. I believe you have a backup plan and won't really bet on my conscience ..."He then looked at the deep sea."In fact, you also know this. However, you came out. In fact, you are also telling me that if I take the energy away, you will not be able to reach the peak of the seventh rank. In this way, our old friendship has turned into hostility, right?"Deepsea's expression was complicated, but she did not say anything.Yes!But I ... Also want to reach the peak of the seventh step!"AI!"Wu Shan sighed with some regret. In the end, he had still overestimated these guys. I thought that you would use a harder method. I overestimated you."It's not worth it to work for you people for so many years!"Shaking his head, he chuckled and said with some contempt,""I've had this thought for a long time. Now, it's proven that my choice to leave was correct. Because ... You're not worth me paying so much for you!""Today, I'll return everything to Yunxiao. From now on, I don't owe you anything. No, I don't owe you anything in the first place. It's just that the Yunxiao world gave birth to me and raised me ... In that case, I'll return everything that Yunxiao has obtained to Yunxiao!"The words fell.BOOM!With a loud bang, the sky collapsed and the earth cracked. The star that was about to escape suddenly exploded inside the cloud heaven great Dao universe. A powerful energy instantly surged into the great Dao!The Lord of the clouds and the venerable sovereign of the deep sea quickly absorbed the power of the great DAOs.As for Wu Shan, his body was covered in cracks, and his aura instantly withered. In an instant, he fell from Level Seven. He didn't care. He just turned his head to look at the great path universe behind him and sighed.The cooperation ended here!"I have a beautiful dream ... But the reality is not so beautiful. This is the result of working for others for hundreds of thousands of years. Without freedom, you will always be so humble! Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã  Silver Moon King, it looks like ... We've all failed this time!The venerable sovereigns around them sneered.Foolish!He didn't feel that Wushan was great, he only felt that he was too stupid. At this point, even if I fell out with him, I still wouldn't really give up on taking away my power. You had the power of a peak rank seven, so the cloud Lord wouldn't dare to easily fall out with you.What an idiot!The next moment, the cloud Master suddenly reached out to grab him!At this moment, a blade and a huge sun suddenly appeared.The human King and the radiant sovereign suddenly attacked at the same time!The human King laughed."Old man, you're not bad. Come to my new martial. New martial welcomes you!" A saber that slashed the heavens and earth!He had taken a fancy to Wu Shan.Even though he had lost his power, so what?The seventh-tier comprehension and Dao were still there, but it had lost its energy. Although it would be very, very difficult to recover ... As long as he seized a seventh-tier great Dao universe, this Wushan could instantly become a seventh-tier!The human King had high hopes for him!As for the radiant master, he had made a promise to his son and had made his move as well. Two top-notch powerhouses had made their move at the same time, causing the cloud master's expression to change instantly.Damn it!"You guys, I'm cleaning up Yunxiao's rebels ... You dare!""You're too noisy!"The human King's Blade instantly descended!BOOM!The heavens fell and the earth cracked!However, it was not Cloud Master who made a move. Instead, it was red Moon master who made a move behind him. At that moment, several venerable sovereigns charged at the human King at the same time. The powerful power of the great Dao made the human King's expression change.F * ck, a group of people bullying one, do you have any shame?Alright, I'm used to being ganged up on!The new silver Moon King had asked him to attack, but he had ignored it, and because of this ... Red Moon was obviously staring at him. If he attacked, it would be when the other party attacked to kill him. He didn't feel too apologetic to the Silver Moon King or the human King. At this time, they should each take care of their own matters. You've provoked a lot of people.Not so easy to deal with!As for the radiant master, he threw out a punch as well. The radiant God fist was unparalleled in its power. With a single punch, the heavens and earth shattered, and it suppressed the cloud master's attack.The deep sea Thearch had also made his move!The huge palm headed straight for the mist Mountain. At this moment, Thearch Yao yang made his move and snorted coldly."Although Wushan is stupid, he's not someone you can kill!"Earlier, Wu Shan had found fault with him for no reason, causing him to lose face.He was very unhappy!However ... No matter what, he and Wu Shan were also known as the two strongest Level 7s in the tianfang region. Yun Xiao, Wu Shan, and Guang Yao yang were both equally famous.The deep sea?Was he worthy of being equally famous as her?BOOM!The experts attacked one after another. When the cloud Master saw this, he instantly frowned. He didn't care about it and instantly withdrew his hand. In an instant, it moved towards the crack of the great Dao.The trouble in Wushan had already been resolved.With one less problem, how could he be in the mood to compete with them at this moment!The sword Saint had been in there for a while. If he didn't enter the great path universe now, when would he?Wushan, without power, was just a piece of trash. If he wanted to kill him, he would be able to do so sooner or later.

Chapter 3008 I'm Going To Be Rich (3)_7
He instantly teleported away. Seeing this, Deepsea also hurriedly escaped from brilliant sun ...At this moment, the other venerable sovereigns saw this and rushed straight into the crack of the great Dao. As for venerable sovereign Wu Shan, he glanced at the sky and quickly fell from the sky without saying a word. Everything has nothing to do with me!Seeing this, the radiant God and the brilliant sun Thearch also rushed into the universe of the great path. Since Yunxiao had entered, he had to enter as well.On the other side, the human King was in a sorry state.He turned around and ran. He was already having a hard time dealing with Red Moon master alone, let alone five ... However, he was not in a hurry. He laughed and said,""You still F * cking hit me? if you keep hitting me, these guys will go in and seize the great path universe. You're dead!"Red Moon master looked at him coldly, but did not rush in. Instead, she continued to attack him, as if she wanted to force him into it as well!The human King understood and sighed."You're really afraid of death ... You're afraid that you won't be able to come out for a while after you go in. I'll deal with Hong Yue?" Do I look like that kind of person?"You are!Red Moon master did not say anything. That was the truth!At this moment, his combat strength was extremely powerful. The power of the Crimson Moon swept through the world. If the human King didn't enter, he didn't dare to enter rashly. Otherwise ... If the human King really ran away, he would turn around and kill the Crimson Moon. This fellow's combat strength was extremely strong, having the ability to kill a seventh rank in seconds!This was extraordinary!When the human King saw this, he sighed. 'This is troublesome. This grandson is forcing me into this!'He actually didn't really want to go in ... But after weighing the pros and cons, he laughed coldly and suddenly charged into the rift.Seeing this, Red Moon master was relieved. She sneered,""Enter!"All of a sudden, the venerable sovereigns flew toward the crack at the same time.The fight for the great Dao universe could wait until after he entered. If he didn't find the core of the daosource, it would be difficult to control the great Dao universe.In the blink of an eye, these people entered one after another.Only sovereign Wushan was powerless at this moment. He was caught by someone, and it was empty.Wu Shan's face was calm. He only glanced at the empty silence and sighed."Our cooperation is over, let me down!"Kong Ji ignored him and looked at the sky. Seeing that the red moon's people had already entered, he instantly sent a message,""If anything happens to Hongyue, you can create your own weapon immediately and find an opportunity to seriously injure yourself ..."These words were directed at the last venerable sovereign Sen LAN.Supreme Emperor Senlan was slightly shocked. You still haven't given up?But at this moment, he couldn't think about it.At this moment, Supreme Emperor Senlan suddenly looked back ... The crack in the great Dao suddenly began to close up and was closing up. In front of him, the red moon Supreme Emperor and the others also felt it. The red moon Supreme Emperor frowned slightly but soon stopped caring about it.So what if it was closed? the powerhouses had already come in anyway!Moreover, if they really wanted to go out, they could naturally go out if everyone worked together or if they controlled the great Dao universe.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The moment the crack closed, Yuan Shuo flashed and appeared beside Kong Ji.Yuan Shuo grabbed Wu Shan, but Wu Shan only looked at him coldly.At this moment, he heard Li Hao's wild laughter."Hahaha, we're rich!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùWu Shan felt that he had gone crazy.Also, when did this guy come out?While he was thinking, Li Hao laughed crazily."Hurry, hurry up ... We're really rich this time. Although it's still a little troublesome ... We might be rich!"He was overjoyed!At this moment, the long river mudra flickered. The tianfang universe was also in the tianfang world. There was no need to pass through the boundary wall of the tianfang great Dao. Although the Dao chess body had left, it still had the ability to transfer.The newly killed Supreme Emperor Hui long was quickly used as fuel by Li Hao.Li Hao emerged from Yuan Shuo's body, his eyes filled with ecstasy. He looked at Wu Shan as if he had found a treasure and gritted his teeth. "I'm going all out, old senior Wushan. This time, you have to put in more effort!"What?I'm already crippled!"The four great Dao universes ... Are waiting for us!"Overjoyed, Li Hao was about to start the teleportation when he suddenly raised his head. A man appeared and looked at the closed gate. He frowned and looked at Li Hao."Open it again, I'm going in too!" Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã  Li Hao was stunned. You're still here?I thought you ran away!Lizhu!"Senior wants to go in?" "Yes,"Li Zhu nodded, feeling a little regretful. These bastards didn't fight outside and ran in. What a pity.He had waited for nothing!Li Hao glanced at him, then at Wu Shan ... And hesitated for a moment."Senior, are you interested in ... Doing this somewhere else?"I'm afraid that one Wushan is not enough.This time, there were three more worlds, so it should be enough to split."What?""Red Moon!""At least two level 7 ones ..." Li Zhu frowned.If I follow this group of experts, I might still be able to eat some meat. If I follow you, isn't it just courting death?He then looked at Wu Shan, slightly startled, as if realizing something. He then glanced at Li Hao ... The next moment, he instantly dove into Li Hao's River. Li Hao was stunned. Weren't you leaving?"Let's go!"Li Zhu said. I'm not asking for much. I just need one of the three universes. Fellow Daoist Wushan, you can split it with me ... I can drag one out of the two level 7s!" Li Hao hesitated for a moment, but he soon gritted his teeth and nodded.Although the requirements were not low, the other party had taken the initiative to ask for a tier 7 ... Forget it, let's do it! It was better to be more stable!Wu Shan was still in a daze, while Li Hao instantly activated the teleportation.In an instant, Wu Shan realized that he had been dragged into a teleportation channel. At this moment, he was struggling."Where to ..."I'm already crippled, so why are you guys still dragging me along?Li Hao gritted his teeth."Later, you can stall a level Seven venerable. It doesn't matter if we kill him or not. Li Zhu and venerable sword can deal with one, and we ... Can kill the other venerable sovereigns. We've made a big profit today. If you can reach Level Seven, you can come back and help the human King and the others!"Wushan is still yanshen, but I'm crippled!'This guy, does he understand what I'm saying?I said, I'm crippled!I'm a cripple now!Damn it, are you deaf?But Li Hao didn't seem to hear it at all.Crippled?Stop your nonsense!Hurry up, or else you'll drag on for too long. How am I supposed to reverse time for you? you've only been crippled for a short while, so it's fine. It'll be more troublesome if you drag on for too long.At this moment, Li Hao was overjoyed. As expected, even the heavens were helping him!He hoped that the human King would not be killed so quickly ... After all, Red Moon had a few Level Seven demons with her!"Human King, hold on!"Li Hao secretly shouted. I'm also helping you by seizing the four great cosmoses ...The dimensional passage quickly spread!He headed straight for the Crimson Moon!In tianfang world, some weak venerable sovereigns had not been able to enter the great Dao universe. At that moment, some people had sensed something different and were a little puzzled. However, tianfang great Dao universe was still here ... Very soon, no one cared.At this moment, they were all looking forward to a chance to fish for some benefits.If a few of these experts died in the Dao universe, there might be a large amount of great Dao power overflowing.Under such circumstances, Li Hao's group quickly arrived at the place where the spatial teleportation had taken place."Faster, faster!"Li Hao raced against time and headed straight for the red moon. He kept shaking the life and death Star to tell Lin Hongyu that he had arrived.It was only at this moment that he remembered that his teacher had also been brought here. He didn't bother to say much and only quickly urged,""Teacher, don't run around later. Enter the boundary and find a place to hide!"Yuan Shuo was speechless and did not say anything.Not long after, venerable the sword arrived with his men. For a while, both sides met. Venerable the sword glanced at Lizhu and frowned slightly. He was too lazy to pay attention to him. Lizhu ignored him too. Although both sides were from neo martial, it was interesting that they ignored each other at this moment."Hurry up!"Li Hao didn't care about that. He quickly led everyone toward the red moon.They sped up crazily, and the Crimson Moon was already in sight!

Chapter 3009 The World Is Very Exciting!
Let's watch it together tonight.The Crimson Moon world was right in front of him.At this moment, the four great worlds seemed to be surrounding each other. Tianlan, cangjiang, Yueming, and Hongyue. There were two seventh rank venerable sovereigns in charge. Hongyue's AI Hong and tianlan's LAN Yue were in charge of the two worlds.There were more than two advanced venerable sovereigns in the four worlds.The key was that they were all macro worlds. There were hundreds of venerable sovereigns on Hongyue's side and Senlan's side. In the other three macro worlds, the number of venerable sovereigns added up to more than a hundred.This was actually a major world of five regions!In the chaos, it was actually very rare for the five major worlds to gather together.It wasn't just a matter of two tier 7 beings.As for Li Hao and the others, they had only been scheming against high-leveled venerable sovereigns. One could only say that the skilled were bold!Some sixth rank peak venerable sovereigns were not as powerful as seventh rank venerable sovereigns, but if a monster like venerable the sword appeared, it would be terrifying."In the four worlds, apart from the 30-odd venerable sovereigns in Senlan, there are close to 200 other venerable sovereigns. Among them, there are at least 10 level six venerable sovereigns, dozens of level four and five venerable sovereigns, and hundreds of low-rank venerable sovereigns!"At this moment, Li Hao looked around and said in a deep voice,""The first stop, Crimson Moon! "We'll take Hong Yue first, then break the three worlds. Hong Yue is a level Seven ... And there's another level Seven. If they come to our rescue, they'll be very fast ... The other venerable sovereigns will be slower and may not come to our rescue!""We've killed six Type 6s, but there are still many Type 6s left. Some of them are at the peak of Type 6 and are trying to reach Type 7!"And looking at his side ...There were actually quite a few people.On new martial's side, there were venerable the sword, Lizhu, and celestial pole.On Silver moon's side, Li Hao, Hong Yitang, Lin Hongyu, Qian Wuliang, Heibao, and Xun RUO ... Yuan Shuo could be excluded as he was too weak. In fact, there was still er Mao, but Li Hao was not included.

Even if the people from Sen LAN didn't help, without the Sen LAN realm Lord, the possibility of them helping was very low."Senior Wushan!"Li Hao looked at Wu Shan."Supreme Emperor Ai Hong is not weak. Are you confident in killing her quickly?" he asked."I ..."I am a cripple!He wanted to say more, but Li Hao shouted,"senior, go all out. At your peak state. In the Crimson Moon world, in the enemy's lair, do you have the confidence to quickly kill the enemy?"Wu Shan's heart trembled as he quickly replied,"I can, but it'll be very difficult!" It's very difficult to kill a rank seven ...""Then how about you, venerable sword, join forces?"Join forces?He glanced at venerable the sword and was not sure about his strength. Venerable the sword said indifferently,"it's not a big problem to cut him a few times ..." "It's about the same as the one I used to kill Hui long with one strike,"Li Hao explained.That would be very strong!"If that's the case ... As long as he doesn't run, we can join forces. If I recover my peak battle prowess, I can kill him very quickly!" Wu Shan quickly said.Very quickly!"How fast?""This ... It'll take at least 30 seconds, and the opponent doesn't run ..."Li Hao nodded. 30 seconds. The major worlds were now almost connected. If another level 7 venerable sovereign came to help, he would be very fast. For a level 7 venerable sovereign, a flash was enough to cover a very long distance.Probably, at most, 30 seconds.If he could really kill the other party in this period of time ... The other seventh-rank would not be of much use.Li Hao quickly said, I want Thunder to cover the red moon! Kong Ji, you will help me recover, and I ... Will turn back time and help senior Wu Shan recover. Senior Li Zhu, help me guide the lightning. Use the realm of underhand to guide my aura into the red moon world!"He quickly made arrangements.‚Äã "Qian Wuliang, senior uncle Hong, you two, suppress the world with your great Dao to prevent the Qi of the Crimson Moon from leaking out and the Masters from escaping. You two are in charge of suppressing the riot!""Lin Hongyu, you are in charge of absorbing life and death. If anyone dies in battle ..."He looked at everyone and said,'then absorb their origin of great DAOs and wait for their resurrection! Kong Ji, other than helping me recover, you have to keep an eye on senior Sword Saint. If there's a problem, you have to quickly consume your energy and help him recover!"Everyone nodded in agreement.At this point, even Lizhu and venerable the sword didn't say anything. They knew that at the last moment, there could only be one voice.In fact, neither of them was very clear about the plan this time.They didn't know much about the others.Li Hao understood everyone very well.Whatever he ordered, they naturally had to do as he said. At this time, if anyone still tried to seize the right to speak ... They might anger Li Hao, and they would break up. None of them would get any benefits!However, venerable sword still frowned and said,"don't forget about the hundreds of venerable sovereigns!" Hundreds of them is not a small number. With so many venerable sovereigns working together, they can kill a seventh rank!"Don't take these people lightly.These people were all experts.Did they really think that they were vegetarians?Li Hao looked at the sky. There was no sky in the chaos, only chaos. He smiled and glanced at Li Zhu."It's alright, senior Li Zhu. We'll see today whether your sky-stealing sun-shifting technique is powerful or not! I want to destroy the great Dao with Thunder, break the world, and suppress the venerable sovereigns! If we can't draw enough lightning to bombard the Crimson Moon ... Then we'll be struck to death together!"Li Zhu was speechless.I've seen the domineering arrogance of the human King before, and I've only just met this fellow twice. Why do you ... Have an arrogance that's different from that of the human King?
