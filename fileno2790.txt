Qian Wuliang was scared and didn't think it was that simple."Lord Marquis ... Is ... Is there any problem?"Li Hao nodded."That's because I haven't learned how to weave the Dao. I'll weave it for you. If I can't continue, your Dao will be ... Tangled.""This ... Will there be any serious consequences?"Li Hao nodded."Of course. First of all, it'll be more troublesome for you to train. Second, if you can't figure it out for a long time, you might explode after cultivating for a while. Third, thousands of DAOs shake the world. This time, you'll definitely use up all the power of the great Dao, and it'll take a long time to recover ... But you can make up for it by killing more venerable sovereigns. "Qian Wuliang wanted to cry but had no tears.I knew it wouldn't be that simple. It's all my fault for being so talkative and saying such a thing.Of course, even if he didn't say it, Li Hao might have done it."There's no time to waste!"Li Hao explained to him what he was going to do and why he was going to do it. After that, he didn't care whether Qian Wuliang agreed or not. Qian Wuliang would definitely agree."We have to act quickly before that rank-7 arrives!"Li Hao smiled."I don't have the boldness of the neo martial human King to directly explode a great Dao universe. But I ... Can also do something. At least, I can make people really believe that Tian Fang's great Dao is recovering!""Let's go! I'll bury the corpses of the 16 venerable sovereigns in some places in tianfang. With these corpses as the boundary, your great Dao universe only needs to cover these areas!"Qian Wuliang obediently followed Li Hao back to the tianfang world.Li Hao didn't dare to delay for too long, because the venerable sovereign would be here in four or five days. The sooner, the better. He could solve the problem as soon as possible and attract the attention of the level Seven venerable sovereign, so that he wouldn't be hunted down.……This time, Li Hao had also put in a lot of effort.Other than the rank six venerable sovereign's corpse, or rather, the energy from the corpse, he had abandoned everything he had obtained from the other venerable sovereigns.Not leaving a single trace!There was only gain when there was loss. If he wanted to make people believe him, how could he not spend a lot of money?In this way, even if Red Moon wanted to make a move on neo martial, he had to consider it. They did not care about Tian Fang. If Tian Fang really had a ninth-grade opportunity and it was obtained by the Lord of Light or the Lord of cloud, what would he do if either one of them entered the ninth-grade?A level nine venerable sovereign was definitely more powerful than a level eight venerable sovereign.At that time, his battle with neo martial would become a joke.Now, these rank 8 worlds were actually restricting each other. Without an absolute Overlord, they could be free.…… Just as Li Hao was setting up.With Tian Fang as the core, the people from both sides were rapidly rushing towards Tian Fang.There was only one person on one side. It was sovereign Wu Shan from the cloud world. He was a seventh rank sovereign, a true advanced sovereign. At this moment, his face was cold. It was obvious that he was very unhappy that Chi Yun, a sixth rank sovereign, was killed.This was a provocation!On the other side, there was a group of venerable sovereigns, all of whom were at the middle level. There were about 20 of them! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  These people were led by Hui long and the other three rank six venerable sovereigns. At this moment, they were all somewhat solemn.They were currently rushing towards heaven pole and the others. On the way, they had used some special means to obtain some information. Something had happened to Tian Fang. They were not sure how big the matter was, but they knew that the Tian Fang great Dao universe seemed to have appeared.Not only that, but there seemed to be some changes in the Hui long field. Venerable Emperor Chi Yun, who had taken over the Hui long temple ... Might have died.This was extremely shocking!A sixth level venerable sovereign was the strongest group of people below the advanced level venerable sovereign. These venerable sovereigns, except for some who had been killed by neo martial recently, almost no one had died. However, neo martial was still fighting with Red Moon.In the end, a rank six venerable sovereign from the great world had died.The venerable Emperor of the Hui long sect looked even more worried.Huilong temple was his base camp.If the sixth stage venerable sovereign was dead, what about the rest?Moreover, there was still the Son of God of light there ... In fact, even if the Dragon returning Temple was destroyed, it would not matter. The only fear was that it was done by Kong Ji. If it was done by Kong Ji, it meant that a war between the cloud heaven world and the divine light realm, two eighth-rank great worlds, was about to break out.For them, the outbreak of a level eight World War was an extremely terrifying thing. When the time came, high-level venerable sovereigns would participate in the war. It would not be like the guerilla warfare between neo martial and red Moon now. Both sides were superworlds, standing in the chaos.Once it broke out, it would be a head-on battle. A battle between advanced venerable sovereigns might affect the entire tianfang region.If he could consider it, the other venerable sovereigns obviously could as well.He was worried, but ... At this moment, someone asked,""The appearance of the tianfang great Dao universe, is it real or fake? Didn't they say that only sixth-level venerable sovereigns in universes without the great Dao and those who advanced to the seventh level could have a chance of drawing it out? Or ... Someone has advanced to the seventh step?""Who knows? right now, there are only bits and pieces of information. It's already not easy to send them here. We still have to go to Tian Fang to see the details.""Could it be a conspiracy? New martial arts's plot. They know that we are going to deal with venerable sword ... So they deliberately lured us back?""Nonsense, the great Dao universe was created in tianfang ... If it was really done by neo martial, it means that high-level venerable sovereigns like the neo martial human King or the sun god were involved. With this effort, wouldn't it be easier to kill us directly?"There was nothing wrong with this.If even Tian Fang's great Dao universe was involved, then it meant that there might be Level Seven experts involved. If they had the time to plot, it would be easier to kill them directly.

2791 Chapter 461
Although there were a few level six venerable sovereigns and many middle-rank venerable sovereigns here, it might be difficult to kill all the true high-rank venerable sovereigns in one go. However, as long as one or two level six venerable sovereigns were killed first, the rest would not be able to survive.This was an advanced venerable sovereign. He alone was enough to kill all of them.Previously, Li Hao's power of the seventh step had only been a fake one.They didn't know if it was true, but at this moment, they still wanted to go back and take a look.Sword Master, medium-level world, joining the great path universe ... These were all good things.However, compared to entering Level Seven and controlling the tianfang great Dao universe, those were nothing.They were also eager and excited.If it was true ... This time, he had to go back no matter what. Could being a mercenary be better than controlling a great Dao universe?Even a fool would know what to choose.Even if they were not sure, no one was willing to miss this opportunity. Otherwise, venerable Dragon Emperor would not be in such a hurry to return. If he did not return, the others would have to return as well. No one would continue to follow him to hunt for new martial artists.…… p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The Crimson Moon world.In the huge Hall.Although they were far away, Red Moon master had actually received some news at that moment. Who in the Outlander world had not made arrangements?Under normal circumstances, high-level worlds would have arrangements for a level nine world.It was necessary to plant people.Not long after the tianfang incident, Red Moon master received information, including the emergence of the tianfang great Dao universe, which seemed to have been ignited by the power of fire, and that something seemed to have happened to the red Cloud Thearch in the sky ... He had received all these information.At this moment, the powerful red Moon master was also lost in thought.What a coincidence!Recently, he had been preparing to kill the neo martial artists and weaken their strength. He even had the intention to kill the Supreme martial artists of the neo martial arts. In the end, something happened to Tian Fang.To care or not to care?He was not short of people to let the weak venerable sovereigns take a look. The key was that once the real tianfang great Dao appeared, even a level Seven venerable sovereign would not be able to secure it. If the tianfang great Dao universe really appeared, he would go to tianfang, Yunxiao, and Guangming would definitely go.All the rank eight Lords would go.Most of the seventh level venerable sovereigns would also rush over. Whoever was late ... Would have to be careful of others snatching away their opportunities."Tian Fang has been silent for millions of years ... It seems like there have been two changes recently."At that moment, there were very few people in the hall, but they were all very strong. An advanced venerable sovereign with an extremely strong aura said in a charming voice,""My Lord, is there a conspiracy? "It's neither too early nor too late. It just so happened that when we were in conflict with neo martial, something happened to Tian Fang ... Did someone want to take advantage of the situation and even did something to neo martial, hoping that Tian Fang in front of us would attack our native world?" What a coincidence!He had to consider this.Otherwise, once the red moon master left, the neo martial human King would be extremely powerful. With the neo Martial Emperor Cang and the two of them as one, no one below the eighth rank could resist them.Red Moon master nodded slightly."It's not impossible ... But we can't treat it as a conspiracy. Otherwise, if it's true and we miss the opportunity, it'll be even more troublesome if cloud sky or light takes the initiative!""At the moment, I'm still unable to determine its authenticity. The tianfang great Dao universe had appeared twice in a row ... It might not necessarily be fake! How about this, Ji Huo, go to Tian Fang first and investigate. If there's really a possibility of a great Dao awakening ... Report back to me!"The female venerable sovereign who had spoken earlier was a little embarrassed, but she didn't hide it and said,""My Lord, if it's a conspiracy ... I'm worried that new martial arts might have set up an ambush on the way. It's to make me, a Red Moon advanced venerable sovereign, move out and ambush them! The whereabouts of the new martial human King are unknown. If I encounter him alone, I'm afraid I will be in danger of dying. "This was true.Red Moon master hesitated.There were five advanced venerable sovereigns in the Crimson Moon world. Apart from him, there were four seventh-rank venerable sovereigns. Apart from Ji Huo, one of the remaining three was still in contact with the Lords of a major world and had yet to return.There was another one who was in the red moon with him. This was also a precaution. If something unexpected happened and someone needed to leave, a high level venerable sovereign would be needed to guard the land.The last one was outside, and his target was Heaven's Fate and the others.Of course, the celestial pole was only a small fish.The big fish wasn't the two small fish from Heaven's Fate. It was the sword Master, the blood Emperor, and the Silver Moon King who might meet up with them. At a critical moment, the Silver Moon King could also burst out with fifth or sixth rank power.These were the big fish in his heart.The sword venerable was powerful. Without a rank seven, he might not be able to take down the other party easily.At this moment, who should he mobilize to leave?It would be safer if at least two seventh-tier Warriors were together. Even if he encountered a neo warrior king, it would be one against two ... Even if the neo warrior king was really powerful, it would take some effort to kill two seventh-tier Warriors. By then, he would be able to arrive.Tapping the throne lightly, Red Moon master said,""Then let Hongyu follow you!"He turned to a venerable sovereign beside him and said,"Hongyu, go with Ji Huo!" As for the void underworld race, it's best if we continue to keep an eye on those two newbie martial artists. We might be able to catch a big fish. If we can capture the Silver Moon King and take over the Silver Moon world, we'll be able to deduce the exact location of the yin-yang world. That would be a great victory for us in the entire war!"

2792 Chapter 461
Therefore, the venerable sovereign couldn't be moved easily.Beside him, an extremely young man nodded slightly.""My Lord, I understand. Then I'll go with Ji Huo. If a universe of the great Dao really appears in tianfang ... Light and cloud will definitely not leave it alone. If a conflict occurs ..."Red Moon master was extremely calm."If I can really take over a level-nine great path universe and comprehend master Tian Fang's spatial path, so what if I start a multi-faceted war?" No one will give up, so let's just have a conflict!"No one would give up!Hearing this, the two of them had no more objections. If there was a conflict, it would be a war. The benefits were big enough, and they would not consider anything else.Red Moon master reminded him again,""The premise is that the tianfang great Dao universe is real and not a trap. Furthermore, it's the kind that will recover very quickly and not in a state of Nirvana. It'll be very difficult to seize it quickly. If that's the case, a long-term war will drag us down."The two advanced venerable sovereigns nodded without saying anything.They were also very efficient. After a simple discussion, they quickly left and rushed towards Tian Fang."New martial ..."After they left, the red moon master muttered,"could this be a trap you guys made?"It might not be!There was a high probability that neo martial didn't have such energy.He did not know the exact location of the new martial human King, but he knew that he was within the red moon region. If a top venerable sovereign who was close to rank eight really left, he would still be able to sense it.However, at this moment, he still had a vague feeling that that fellow was circling nearby.As for the new martial sun god and Emperor Cang, he roughly knew their whereabouts. He paid close attention to these advanced venerable sovereigns. Not long ago, someone had discovered Emperor Cang's whereabouts in another direction."If it's not neo martial ... Could it be Yunxiao or light? "But these two parties are eager for us to start a war with neo martial immediately. They won't set such a trap at this moment to divert our attention ... So, it's true?"He kept thinking.Cloudsky and Guangming probably wouldn't do this kind of thing because they were fighting with neo martial. If they did this kind of thing at this time, they wouldn't be the ones who would benefit.He couldn't figure it out for a while.Unless ... The tianfang great Dao universe had really recovered.He didn't know if that would be good or bad for him.He was entangled with neo martial and was a little further away from Tian Fang. He might not have any opportunities to compete with Yunxiao and Guangming.……At the edge of the Crimson Moon world.At this moment, Empyrean terminus and King Huai gradually slowed down.Heaven's Fate could sense the location of his clone. It wasn't too far away, but at this moment, the other party didn't seem willing to get close to him. When the distance between them closed, the other party would distance himself.Obviously, it was still the same as before-wait!Empyrean terminus's original body wasn't in a hurry. He slowed down and wasn't in a hurry at all.  p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  ……At this moment, Lin Hongyu, the celestial pole clone, Hong Yitang, and the church, who had joined them, were all hiding in the chaotic darkness. They did not dare to move forward and waited for Li Hao's notice.The time when Lin Hongyu was injured would be the time for her to start learning new martial arts.Tian Fang's huge commotion had nothing to do with them.They didn't have any channels to know what had happened to Tian Fang. Feeling uneasy, they could only wait for Li Hao's orders. Even though they knew that Tian Ji's original body was right in front of them, they didn't dare to approach them.Li Hao's guess that Hong Yue was watching them was correct. However, Li Hao's guess that it was only a middle-stage venerable sovereign was wrong. Hong Yue didn't have any middle-stage venerable sovereigns watching heaven pole's group.There was no need for that.The other party had sent out a high-level venerable sovereign, who was hiding in the dark, waiting for some big fish.At this moment, there were more than just these people in this area.Many people were waiting.,m Hong Yue's seventh stage venerable sovereign was nearby, so was venerable sword, celestial pole and the others, and silver moon's several venerable sovereigns. Everyone seemed to be waiting for an opportunity.At the core were the celestial pole and King Huai. They were existences on the surface. This kind of bait thrown on the surface was extremely dangerous, but as long as it didn't explode, it was extremely safe.Everyone knows you're here, but no one will be the first to make a move.……In the darkness.Swordmaster didn't get close to celestial pole and the others. At this moment, swordsman's keen senses made him feel some danger.As a sixth-rank swordsman and a powerful swordsman, he was very sensitive to danger.Heaven's Fate and the others might have been targeted by a powerful existence.Only advanced venerable sovereigns could make him feel danger.The longevity sword frowned slightly.At this moment, he was alone.Once the other party made the first move to kill Heaven's Fate and the others, he would have no choice but to act. At that time, there might be some trouble. Of course, the other party was also waiting, waiting for the Silver Moon King.Venerable the sword knew that the other party might want to capture the Silvermoon world.At this moment, he could only hope that this Silver Moon King, whom he had never met before, wouldn't be stupid enough to suddenly appear here and really come into contact with celestial pole and the others. The bait that the Grandmaster had arranged was originally meant to catch a small fish ... But now, it might have caught a big fish. The key was that it was too big, and he might not be able to eat it."Can Fang ping be contacted?"At this moment, the sword Saint transmitted a message. The jade pendant on his body only emitted a faint light after a while. His voice was transmitted,"No, he might have run far away again."

2793 Chapter 461
The longevity sword felt helpless. It was always running around!If he ran too far, he wouldn't be able to contact him, which was trouble.After a while, a voice sounded in his ear,""Let's wait and see. There seems to be some changes in Tian Fang! Perhaps ... There's still a chance. "Tian Fang?An unforeseen event?At this moment, longevity sword was a little confused,"where did Fang ping go?"If not for that ... What could have happened to Tian Fang?"Don't keep thinking that Fang ping is the one behind the accident ... He probably didn't go there. "Was it?The longevity sword couldn't help but think that if he wasn't the one who caused the accident, could it be someone else?Who could stir up more trouble than this chaos?He stopped thinking about it. "Then let's wait a little longer. I can feel danger ... It might be a seventh rank venerable sovereign nearby. If that's the case, I can't do anything unless the Silver Moon King appears. Otherwise, it'll be too dangerous. You can just let Heaven's Fate and Huai King pray for themselves!"“……”Zhi Zun didn't reply. What was he saying? could they really wish themselves well?"There's no rush. Tian Fang might bring us a chance ... If there's really a grade-7 nearby, let's see if we can eat it!"His words were also ruthless.If he really attracted a Grade 7, he would think of a way to eat him.However, it was not enough for now.On Tian Fang's side, the commotion wasn't big enough. Although it was said that a ninth-tier great path universe might have appeared ... It was only hearsay. In any case, the new martial arts side had not received any specific news.Neo martial naturally had some arrangements in tianfang, although it did not have as deep a Foundation as other great worlds.So far, no news had been sent back, obviously because it was still uncertain. The new martial artists had limited manpower, and they would not easily send back uncertain news unless they were more than eighty percent sure.At this time, the Supreme martial artist really hoped that Tian Fang would really make a big move.With the appearance of a level-nine great cosmos, Red Moon master would definitely be unable to sit still.That would be the opportunity for neo martial arts.Perhaps, neo martial should be arranged ... But it would easily attract the support of Red Moon, cloud sky, and light. The distance was too far, and Zhi Zun was a little worried.……All parties were waiting for Tian Fang's matter to be confirmed.In the land of the Outlander world, some venerable sovereigns were also constantly investigating. Some venerable sovereigns had even begun to carefully move toward the return Dragon field.The unforeseen event seemed to have come from the return Dragon field.The Masters of the small regions in the southern region, as well as some middle-stage venerable sovereigns, were all heading in this direction.Originally, other than the Hui long zone, there were nine other zones in the South. Since the Tianhe Supreme Emperor had been killed, the two Supreme emperors closest to the Hui long zone had joined him. The remaining six zone leaders were a little further away.However, at this time, these middle-stage venerable sovereigns also began to move carefully, wanting to see if there was an opportunity. At this moment, they had returned to the sky above the Dragon field.There were some stars shining and the great Dao vaguely appearing, which shocked countless cultivators of the Hui long field.Recently, there seemed to be a lot of activity back in the Dragon field.Some people didn't understand, but some people's expressions kept changing. It was as if the universe of the great path had appeared once again. It was faintly discernible and shocking.Was tianfang's universe of the great path really going to recover?In the next moment, in the Dragon field, some cultivators were shocked."Look!"At this moment, some Taoist connotation that had been silent for many years suddenly burst out. The power of the great Dao spread in all directions, and countless cultivators were shocked.The strong power of the great Dao ... Was not much for a venerable sovereign.However, for those below venerable sovereigns, the powerful power of the great Dao made them go crazy.How did this happen?Why did he suddenly release so much Taoist connotation and so much power of the great way?Could it be that ... Tian Fang was about to awaken?This was a type 9 world!In an instant, countless people went crazy and flew towards some Taoist connotation. Some people simply flew towards the sky, hoping to enter the Dao universe as soon as possible. However, the Dao universe looked like it was in the sky, but in reality, it wasn 't. No matter how high they flew, they couldn't enter the Dao universe.The power of great DAOs also started to sweep through the regions near the Hui long region.A middle-stage venerable sovereign nearby was also shocked. He looked up at the sky. The power of a great Dao! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Was the universe of the great path really going to recover?After the shock, it was madness and excitement.Now, a few peak middle-stage venerable sovereigns had left tianfang world. They were not here. Did this mean that tianfang was taking care of them, the remaining venerable sovereigns? their chance had come!If I can control the tianfang great Dao universe ... Then ... Do I still need to fear those World Masters?A great amount of great Dao power swept across the entire South.It was still spreading out in all directions.The power of 16 venerable sovereigns 'great DAOs was unimaginably powerful for others.At this moment, some people were also shocked.For example, the giant pincers.He knew a little about the situation, and when he felt the dense power of the great Dao ... He suddenly thought of something and was a little surprised. This Silver Moon King was really willing to give up.,m Obviously, this should be the power of the great Dao released by the killed venerable sovereigns. At this moment, the power of the great Dao swept through the world. How much power of the great Dao would be consumed?The giant pincer actually did not understand.He felt that it would be better to find a place to cultivate in seclusion with the power of great DAOs than to waste it. However, it was precisely because he couldn't understand that he felt that Li Hao was even more unfathomable.When he looked up at the sky again, the stars seemed to be getting brighter."What?" someone exclaimed,"is that ... A great Dao star?"

2794 Chapter 461
Previously, when tianfang universe had appeared, only two stars had lit up, and they had been very weak.But this time, there seemed to be a lot of them, even though they were all very weak.Just as everyone was exclaiming in shock, more people were shocked the next moment. At that moment, in the sky, in the illusory universe of the great path, a River of the path seemed to appear, and 10000 paths started to gather.Then, some of the weaker ones felt their vision go black as if the world was spinning!The world barriers in all directions suddenly shattered.The inverse the universe!They seemed to be in a different world. Many people were still in a daze when they suddenly realized that the sky and earth were spinning, and the world was folding. The huge city even changed in an instant.In a city that was originally located on the side of the mountain, the next moment, when the people in the city woke up, they were so shocked that they lost their minds. Their city had appeared in a completely unfamiliar place in an instant, as if it was another domain! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  This scene caused countless people to be excited, afraid, fearful, and crazy!They seemed to have recalled some legends. It was said that the master of Tian Fang back then seemed to major in the Dao of space!……At this moment, some venerable sovereigns who were close to the return Dragon field also changed their expressions.It was true!Tian Fang's universe of the great path seemed to be really starting to recover.At that moment, they had also felt the transformation of heaven and earth. It was as if they had been included in heaven's will, included in the great Dao. Thousands of Dao converged, and the legendary Dao domain seemed to have appeared!As the sky and earth spun, even a first stage venerable sovereign's position changed. It was shocking!At this moment, Li Hao, who was hiding in the dark, was already panting.He had used up countless great DAOs and the power of 16 venerable sovereigns. His goal was to make everyone believe that Tian Fang's great Dao universe had officially begun to recover.It might still be weak at this moment ... But it would become stronger and stronger very soon!Who wouldn't be interested in this?He hoped that on Red moon's side, they would quickly leave neo martial and come to tianfang to compete with the other great worlds.The bigger the commotion, the better!More and more stars appeared in the sky, and some people even started to scream,""Dao! It's the accumulation of the great Dao ..."At this moment, some people even felt the sound of the great Dao.Listening carefully, it was as if he could hear the Dao of fire, the Dao of the physical body, the Dao of water, the Dao of darkness, the Dao of Nirvana, the Dao of life, the Dao of death ... The sound of all Dao!Some venerable sovereigns were also listening attentively, but in the next moment, they were all stunned and shocked.The sound of the great Dao!Ten thousand DAOs resuscitated!The sound of the great Dao was incomparably profound. It definitely didn't come casually.In fact, these sounds of the great Dao were not simple.There were some of Li Hao's own insights, as well as some of the great DAOs he had learned from Tian Fang.These were the insights of some top venerable sovereigns, which were extraordinary. Of course, Li Hao wasn't a fool. He would cover up the key parts and not directly transmit his Dao ... He had paid a huge price just to make everyone believe that tianfang great Dao had really resurrected, not to let these people really comprehend the Dao of an advanced venerable sovereign.And this was not enough.The commotion was not big enough.The last step was the most crucial. It needed to be presented as a chess piece to show its true invincible power.A moment later, Li Hao used the mark of Dao chess in the river of Dao.An illusionary figure appeared indistinctly.He looked at Li Hao in confusion.You didn't come in before, but now you're coming in?"Senior, can you display the might of the master of Tian Fang in my Dao universe ... Even if it's only for a moment ... I'll use up this opportunity to comprehend."The mysterious man was stunned for a moment. He looked at Li Hao for a long time and said,""You're crazy!"Wasting such an important opportunity just to display a moment of pressure?Do you know how good of an opportunity you've wasted ... Fine, he knows, it's not like this guy has never been to go."Or are you hoping ... That Kong Ji will waste an opportunity for you? Even if he finished the first round and comprehended more than 4000 squares the first time, he won't start all over again and will start from the 5000th square. He shouldn't be able to reach the 7000th square and will only have two chances to raise conditions ... Do you think he will waste one for you?"Li Hao seemed to be treating the weapon of a level nine venerable Emperor as a joke.Just to fake it?Did you just waste so many opportunities?Is there something wrong with your brain?"If you have the energy and time, you can go and try out the game of chess. After a hundred years, you might be at the sixth or seventh level, you idiot!The shadow naturally saw through Li Hao's purpose.It was quite realistic to fake it.Ordinary venerable sovereigns wouldn't be able to tell without the presence of an advanced venerable sovereign.A normal person would not do such a crazy waste. If he really released some special pressure, these guys would probably not doubt him."Senior ... Can you agree to it?"The mysterious man was silent for a while, and then said,""Have you thought it through?""I've thought it through!""Forget the essentials and pursue the trivialities!" The mysterious man sighed. Li Hao didn't say anything.Abandoning the essentials and pursuing the trivialities?Perhaps ... He was."However, compared to an opportunity, I hope that I can successfully take everyone away from the gazes of the major worlds, including celestial pole and the others ... As for the plans of neo martial, it's not in his consideration for the time being.Besides, diverting Red moon's attention would reduce the pressure on neo martial arts.

2795 Chapter 461
"Alright!"The shadow didn't say anything else."It's your choice. Compared to letting Li Hao enter enlightenment, it will still consume the power of the Dao chess. Releasing the pressure once isn't a big deal."In the next moment, an overwhelming pressure covered the entire world.Not only that, the pressure spread out and even out of tianfang world.At that moment, the expression of monarch Wu Shan, who wasn't too far away from Tian Fang, suddenly changed. He looked into the distance, where a vigorous pressure suddenly appeared, making even the rank seven venerable sovereign's heart palpitate.At this moment, the hearts of all the experts in tianfang shook.At this moment, special messages were sent out one after another. They even destroyed extremely important treasures to send out the messages through various means."Tianfang world is called the recovery of the bed universe. An invincible might appeared, and the power of the bed overflowed from the world. The might covered the sky, and billions of stars appeared. The sky and earth could be vaguely seen spinning. It seems that the space is called the bed, and the stars are moving ..."At this moment, none of the cultivators in Tian Fang doubted him. They were all excited and terrified.He was excited because the tianfang great Dao had appeared.What they were afraid of was that it might attract countless experts. An unprecedented war might break out in Tian Fang. The battle of advanced venerable sovereigns might not be uncommon.……"Many thanks, senior!"In the river, the imprint did not dissipate, and the shadow was shaking. It glanced at Li Hao and said,""If that void is willing to give you a chance, you can still use it ... If you are not willing, then our fate ends here!""I understand.""What a pity!"The shadow disappeared. Li Hao's shadow was a little hard to see through, not because of his strength, but because of his mind.What was this guy thinking?If you have the time and energy, why waste it on these trivial matters?Li Hao, on the other hand, chuckled and looked up at the sky. At this moment, the entire Outlander domain was filled with a powerful pressure that was rapidly dissipating. However, that was enough.This is all I can do."Let's go!""Let's go," Li Hao said and ran toward the realm gate."It's time to run. If the venerable sovereign of the cloud realm is nearby, he might arrive soon. I should run this time!"In an instant, Li Hao disappeared.In the sky, the universe of the great path gradually began to disappear.Qian Wuliang was both shocked and scared. Fortunately, no one was rushing to the Dao universe crazily. Otherwise, he would have been scared to death. At least seven or eight middle-stage venerable sovereigns were in the coverage of the Dao universe.It was too terrifying!Any one of them could kill him. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  In an instant, Li Hao fled tianfang world with Qian Wuliang and Heibao. He couldn't stay here any longer. If he stayed any longer, he might be besieged by many Level Seven or even level eight Supreme emperors.Running away was more important!In the chaos, Li Hao sped up his escape.Less than half a day after he escaped, a figure appeared. It was monarch Wushan. He sped up and as soon as he got close to Tian Fang, his brows twitched. What a dense power of the great Dao!Countless people in the entire tianfang world were frantically searching for the great Dao universe. In an instant, Supreme Emperor Wushan entered tianfang world.Following that, more and more people entered Tian Fang.All of them were top-notch experts from all over the primal Chaos, and they were all extremely excited.,m On this day, the news of the recovery of the tianfang great Dao universe spread wildly in all directions. The nearby great world Lords and medium-level world Lords were all rushing over.Even if he couldn't seize it, coming to take a look at a ninth-tier great Dao universe might also be an opportunity for him.

2796 Chapter 462
In the chaotic void, Li Hao had already left.As for whether Tian Fang could hide from some strong cultivators and attract the attention of the red moon, he was not sure. He could only wait.As a third rank venerable sovereign, he could not do anything more.If that was the case, he still could not hide it and could not attract the attention of the Crimson Moon experts. He could only give up contact with the new martial artists and not give Lin Hongyu and the others the order to start. He had them continue to wait.As for himself, he would find a way to bring them back. As for the two guys who were exposed in the spotlight, neo martial would think of a way.At this point ... Li Hao felt that he had already done enough.New martial might have their own plans.He didn't have to do anything. If it weren't for the fact that they were acquaintances, Li Hao wouldn't have bothered with them. After all, his celestial pole's avatar had helped him many times.Li Hao sped up in the air. Qian Wuliang also followed him quickly. Beside him was a dog that looked like a Black Panther, but it was bigger and had a part of its body that looked like a bull."Lord Marquis, where are we going now?"Qian Wuliang asked."Let's go and see ... If there's a chance to deal with Hui long and the others. "Qian Wuliang was a bit confused. Now that he had used up his chess chance, was he still going to deal with Huilong and the others? p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao saw through his confusion."It might not be Huilong. Huilong and the others are in a hurry to return. They might leave behind a group of level four and level five Supreme emperors ... Or they might be too slow and be left behind.""You want to deal with these guys?" Qian Wuliang asked.Li Hao nodded."All the resources have been used up, and the great Dao universe still needs to be strengthened. It's difficult to deal with the strong, but it's possible to deal with the weak. If I'm lucky, I can still get rid of a fourth-stage venerable sovereign ... Of course, that's not necessarily true. I'll just give it a try!"Li Hao was worried that he would alert the enemy while dealing with Hui long. It wouldn't be a good thing to attack rashly before he was discovered.Moreover, it was not a good thing to use force when attacking.He could try to kill some Grade 4 ones.Also, he had used the chance to play chess, but whether he could use it again ... He had to give Kong Ji some time to play chess. Kong Ji definitely couldn't leave now, as he was still comprehending the way of life and death."Then, shall we ... Set up an ambush?""It's not an ambush. Just pretend to be a chaos Ranger and be careful. If there's no chance, we'll head to the Crimson Moon and get them back as soon as possible.""Understood!"Qian Wuliang stopped asking.A group of two people and a dog carefully headed in the direction of the red moon.……At the same time.Tian Fang.Venerable Wushan landed at the Huilong temple. In this place, except for the venerable sovereign, no one else was dead. When Li Hao arrived, time was frozen, and everyone was frozen. He also took some unimportant treasures.The cultivators below venerable sovereign were still alive. The moment Thearch Wushan landed on the ground, he extended his consciousness and sensed his surroundings. Soon, he looked in the direction of the dark Demon Ridge and frowned.But he didn't go to the dark Demon Ridge.Soon, he disappeared.After a while, he appeared out of thin air near the abandoned fire element mountain.Thearch Wushan looked young, but he was extremely solemn. He looked up at the sky and scanned his surroundings. He reached out and a faint aura appeared in his hand.He closed his eyes and sensed for a while. A scene seemed to appear in his mind. It was not real and seemed a little illusionary."A Taoist connotation appeared in the fire element mountain. Chi Yun brought people here, but they were killed by a fire-element cultivator while they were comprehending the Taoist connotation ...""Daoist fireslayer?"He suddenly opened his eyes, which were cold and sharp. Soon, he frowned.That was impossible!Daoist huoyan had disappeared for countless years. If he made a move, it would mean that Tian Fang had returned. If the other party really wanted to kill a rank six, there was no need to do so. With Tian Fang's return, who would dare to provoke the nearby area?Why kill a rank six venerable sovereign!"Fire element ... It didn't take an instant to kill Chi Yun. He fought for a while ... It wasn't a rank 7, it was a fake rank 7!"Wu Shan murmured. Fake rank seven venerable sovereign.The fire-type power had some characteristics of the fire divination power.Was he a cultivator who had inherited the fire Yan Dao element?Or could it be that someone had used some special means to borrow some of the power of fire divination ... How could he borrow the power of fire divination?There were countless Daoist techniques in the universe.Or perhaps, it was possible to imitate it.He looked up at the sky again. In the void, there was a special great Dao fluctuation. It seemed to be a fluctuation that appeared from the great Dao universe. The power of the great Dao in the surroundings was overflowing everywhere. It was very dense."The great Dao universe ... Chi Yun ... Hui long temple ... Huo Yan ... Tian Fang ..."Were these things related?Had Tian Fang's great Dao universe really appeared?The surroundings were turned upside down as a chaotic spatial force erupted. However, sovereign Wushan frowned slightly."Is it space or Dao domain?"He murmured.No matter what it was, it would be troublesome.If it was caused by the real spatial power, it meant that the great Dao universe had really appeared. If it was fake and was the power of Dao domain ... It meant that a seventh-rank venerable sovereign had participated, because only seventh-rank venerable sovereigns had Dao domains.The domain of Dao!Ordinary venerable sovereigns might not understand this, but as a rank seven venerable sovereign, he understood it all too well."Someone activated the fire element mountain and attracted Chi Yun over, killing the Hui long sect Thearch and Chi Yun ... In the end, the fire element mountain might have triggered the appearance of the tianfang great Dao ... The tianfang great Dao universe is still in a dormant state ... This power of the great Dao ... Might not necessarily belong to the tianfang great Dao universe. It might belong to those who were killed ..."

Chapter 2797 Wushan (2)
If that was the case, it meant that the person who killed Chi Yun did not want the power of the great DAOs. What was he trying to do?The tianfang great Dao universe might have really recovered.It was just that ... There seemed to be some human factors involved.What was his purpose?Killing and reviving the universe?He was slightly moved, and he looked around again. He remembered some information from the last time, which said that signs of the great path universe had appeared near the Tianhe zone.Thinking of this, Wu Shan instantly left.……After a while.He reappeared where the Tianhe zone had been. The water element had been completely destroyed."When the Taoist connotation was destroyed, the universe of the great path was created ...""Using the remaining old power here to induce the appearance of the great Dao universe ... Is this some kind of special method?""The last time, the person who killed someone here said that he was the neo martial Swordmaster ... This time, the person who killed Chi Yun might be the same person as the previous time!"It was the same method, which was to borrow the power of the Taoist connotation.As for Tian He's death, some people later said that it was the Silver Moon King's doing.What about this time?Or the Silver Moon King?The Silver Moon King was probably still in the primordial chaos.Of course, this possibility could not be ruled out.At this moment, Li Hao didn't expect that someone would link the appearance of the Dao universe last time to the appearance this time. The previous one was actually very vague, and the two were completely different.However, monarch Wushan did not care about this at all.No matter how big the difference was, they were both in the Taoist connotation, so there were still some similarities.It was just that whether or not he was the Silver Moon King was still up for discussion.He didn't care if it was the Silver Moon King or not ... Red Moon wanted to take down the Silver Moon, but yunwu didn't have such a need. Whether it was the Silver Moon King or someone else, it didn't make a difference to him. This person must exist!As for who exactly it was, it was actually not that important. It was fine as long as it was not someone from the divine light plane. Otherwise, this time around, the divine light plane might have a conflict with the cloud world.With a wave of his hand, the entire broken land of the heavenly River was flattened.When he thought of this, he returned to Mount Huoxing once again and wiped out everything.It removed all traces of these existences.Silver Moon King?It didn't matter whether he was or not.The important thing was that this person was special. He could guide the power of the Taoist connotation and open the universe of the great path.Tian Fang's great Dao universe had indeed recovered ... Even if it hadn't completely recovered, it had really been drawn out. Furthermore, it had a great relationship with the murderer. If they found this person, the Tian Fang great Dao universe would definitely be revealed!"Borrowing the power of the Taoist connotation and the power of the heavens ... How did you do it? The power of heaven has dissipated for a million years. No wonder the great Dao universe can show the power of a million years ago ..."He thought of something.The dark Demon Ridge!  In an instant, monarch Wushan disappeared again.The next moment, he appeared in the Dragon returning temple and in the blink of an eye, he was in the dark Demon Ridge.In the dark hall.At the door, Kong Ji, who was in seclusion to comprehend, had a slight change in expression. The next moment, he opened his eyes, floated up, and disappeared from the dark Shrine. He instantly reappeared at the foot of the dark Demon Ridge.At the foot of the mountain, someone was also looking at him."Greetings, monarch Wushan!"Kong Ji bowed slightly.Rank 7 venerable sovereign!No matter where he was, a venerable sovereign like him was a strong and powerful existence.Even if the divine light realm and the divine cloud realm were at odds, at least they had not started a war yet."The Son of God of the sacred central crypt."Wu Shan slightly nodded.Ming Tang, Kong Ji's original name.As one of the only two rank eight worlds in the tianfang region, he naturally knew Kong Ji, but he had never seen him before. The last time he had seen him was six hundred years ago. This person had broken through to rank four and become a middle-stage venerable sovereign. The Lord God of light had been overjoyed and invited everyone to a banquet.He had seen it that time.At that time, Kong Ji's power of light was obvious, but it was completely different today.Wu Shan glanced at him and smiled. "You're so capable, Divine Child! Giving up the light and receiving the darkness-like power, this was Nirvana? Or something else? In such a short period of time, he had entered the fifth rank again. It seemed that the sixth rank was not far away, and he even ... Felt a sense of death? Interesting!""Senior Wushan, you've got a good eye!" Kong Ji furrowed his brows.When he discussed this with Li Hao, he was rather Frank and had nothing to hide.However, Wu Shan was a senior and could be considered half an expert of the enemy force. He saw through it with a single glance and directly pointed it out. It wasn't for the sake of discussing Dao, but rather to intimidate.Wu Shan didn't say much. He sized her up and said,"The Son of God hasn't gone out recently?""What does senior mean?""Son of God, you don't know about the changes in the outside world?""I didn't know!""That's interesting. "Wu Shan smiled."Your friend, venerable sovereign Hao Yue, returned from the chaos. He killed the other venerable sovereigns of the Huilong temple and killed Yunxiao and chiyun. Do you know about this, Divine Son?"Kong Ji frowned,"senior must be joking, my friend is only at the 1st rank ..""Whether I'm joking or not, the Divine Child knows better than me.""The Divine Child was able to give up light and cultivate another Dao, advancing instead of retreating. His talent is unparalleled!" Wu Shan said indifferently. However, Haoyue and new martial are too closely related, while new martial and Crimson Moon are too deeply connected. Be careful not to attract a powerful enemy for the divine light plane. " p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Haoyue killed me, Red Cloud Cloud, he's very bold," he added.Kong Ji frowned slightly.It was actually very strange that Wu Shan was so certain that it was Li Hao. Even if it was just a guess ... It was still unusual for him to be so certain.Why?"Divine Child, don't misunderstand, I mean no harm!" Wu Shan continued.

Chapter 2798 Wushan (3)
His face was calm,"as for evidence, or anything else, I don't have any. Only, I'm certain that this is Haoyue's doing!""So you're framing me?" Kong Ji chuckled."If you think it is, then it is. If you don't think it is, then it isn 't!""I have no intention of making an enemy out of the divine light plane," Thearch Wu Shan laughed. "This is the right of the realm Lord. Even if it was a deity who killed him, I will only suppress him and not kill him. Whether or not I kill you will depend on the realm Lord!""Senior Wushan, please don't wrongly accuse me. At the very least ... I'm not someone that you can casually accuse!""Is that so?" Wu Shan laughed. There were some remnants of the power of Nirvana near the southern realm gate. Was it not the doing of the Divine Child? The power of Quietus might have appeared there ... Why was it like this? It's said that every time venerable sovereign Hao Yue uses more power than his own, he will trigger the primal Chaos lightning tribulation ... It's normal. It's unusual for a new venerable sovereign to be able to use such a powerful force and not be targeted by the primal Chaos lightning tribulation. ""Therefore, if it's him, there will definitely be a chaos lightning tribulation ... And in tianfang world, there are no traces of chaos lightning Tribulation destruction, so it can only be in the chaos. If there is a chaos lightning tribulation in the chaos, it will definitely cause a huge commotion. However, no one seems to see the commotion ... That means someone is hiding it.""Who can conceal the primal Chaos lightning tribulation?" Wu Shan chuckled. Before I met the Son of God, I was very confused. Who could do that? After seeing the Divine Child, I knew that there was someone who could do it. A Nirvana sovereign who was close to rank 6!"He was silent.He sighed in his heart. This was Wu Shan, a seventh rank venerable sovereign with sharp eyes, one of the people who determined the fate of the divine world.The cloud Master had sent him here because he believed that even if Chi Yun died and left, this person would be able to solve many problems. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Did the Silver Moon King escape?"As he spoke, he looked at the temple and smiled,""It can't be here, right? Also, how did the rank nine pressure burst out ... Could it be related to this place?"He was silent.The more you do, the more mistakes you make.He had advised Li Hao to do less. If he had enough time, he might be able to hide many things, but there was too little time. At the moment, there were many things that could not be done. If he did, this Level Seven venerable sovereign would definitely find out something when he came."If the Silver Moon King suddenly makes a big move in the sky ... Does that mean that the Crimson Moon's gaze will be on the sky?"“……”It was still empty and silent.However, Wu Shan smiled."It seems that Chi Yun died unjustly ... Of course, it's not exactly unjust. Huilong and the others went to deal with neo martial and summoned them back at the same time. The key is to attract the attention of the Crimson Moon world ... Previously, it was said that he would meet up with Heaven's Fate ... Now it seems that he turned back to heaven's side and created a commotion, hoping that the Crimson Moon would no longer pay attention to him, or that he hoped to meet up with neo martial Heaven's Fate, right?""Senior, what's the point of bringing this up?" Kong Ji looked at Wu Shan."Why would it be meaningless?" "Of course!" Wu Shan laughed."You can record my words. If there's a chance, send it to the Silver Moon King!"Kong Ji didn't say anything.A seventh level venerable sovereign was really different.He was indeed secretly recording it with a special technique. He hoped to pass on today's scene to Li Hao and let him understand that advanced venerable sovereigns were not ordinary people, especially someone like Wu Shan, who was famous for his sharp eyes.The Tao technique he cultivated seemed to be very special, but Kong Ji was not sure why."If I came early, I would be able to see some clues, but if I came late, I might not be able to see it!" "Even if the other rank seven venerable sovereigns came, the Silver Moon King still left behind some clues ... He himself didn't notice it, and you might not be able to either. I, on the other hand, did. However, in a few days, there would be no problem when other people came. As for Chi Yun's death ... And the venerable sovereigns 'deaths in the Hui long temple, are you willing to accept them?""What do you mean, senior?" Kong Ji raised his eyebrows."You killed him!""If that's the case, no one will care about why we killed Chi Yun and the others," Wu Shan said with a calm expression.Kong Ji kept thinking. I killed him?"They're only peripheral forces. Chiyun is only here to befriend Huilong in private and doesn't represent the great cloud world! "Therefore, it's fine if he's dead. However, if the Divine Child kills someone, the world of light will compensate for some losses. That's fine!"p Kong Ji looked at him with some fear. "It's interesting for senior to say this! I took the blame for killing Chi Yun and the others, and lost some things for no reason. Senior, it seems that you have the intention of exonerating the murderer?"Why did this person want to help Li Hao?Strange!'I'm the one who killed him. The great Dao universe is real. If Wu Shan continues to act like he's looking for the great Dao universe here ... It might really make Hong Yue pay attention to this place quickly, and even attract an eighth level venerable sovereign to come personally. 'Why did he do that?What was he after?Knowing Li Hao ... Bullshit!If Li Hao knew him, he wouldn't have run away.Wu Shan laughed."Cultivators should focus on cultivation. They'll cultivate their entire lives and fight their entire lives. Whether they're Level Seven or level eight, they're all staring at Tian Fang. What's their goal?" Wasn't it all to strengthen himself? In tianfang world, the universe of the great path is silent, and no one can open it. For a million years, countless methods have been used, but there is no way. ""And now, someone has used the power of Tian Fang to revive the universe. However, the great Dao universe has disappeared once again. It seems that without the Silver Moon King, it will be impossible to revive it!"

2799 Chapter 462
"The divine son's destructive power is strong. Perhaps he has really entered that destructive universe of the great Dao!"Wu Shan smiled."With the recovery of the universe, perhaps ... The godchild also has hope of reaching the heavens in a single bound and entering Level Seven!" It's said that the second generation of cultivators has a higher starting point but a lower ending point. Among the countless descendants of venerable sovereigns, including high-level venerable sovereigns, world Lords, and great Dao Lords, there are five or six levels, but no one has ever seen a seventh level!""The godchild will give up on light and take another path. Once a rank nine world recovers and the destruction is restored ... The two poles will merge and there will be hope for a rank seven godchild!""Senior ... You're really frightening!" Kong Ji exhaled.What a terrifying fellow.Wushan!He knew this man and was very vigilant. This man was not a boor, but a famous advanced venerable sovereign in the cloud world. That was why he warned Li Hao to run away.This man was different from the other venerable sovereigns. However, it was only at this moment that he truly felt the immense pressure.He vaguely understood what she meant and said in a deep voice,""Senior, just say it!""Simple!"Wu Shan's face was calm."I've lived for too long. To be honest, the death of a sixth rank venerable sovereign is not enough to move me!" No matter how strong the Silver Moon King is or how many people he has killed, it's not enough to move me. However, there are two things that I care about. ""First, the Dao he cultivates is too unique. Every time he does so, he'll trigger a chaos lightning tribulation.""Second, he was able to lure out the tianfang universe. This is very important! I don't care what he wants to achieve, what he wants to do, who he wants to meet up with, or who he wants to scheme against!""In fact, I don't even care what it is that triggered the level 9 Emperor's might. It's either a tianfang universe or a tianfang weapon ... Is it the legendary Dao chess?"He smiled."Actually, I've heard of Dao chess before. It's a treasure for enlightenment, but it's not that useful to me. Dao chess is of some help to those below the seventh rank. To me, it's of limited help."The desolation was even more afraid."Furthermore, divine weapons have spirits. Even if I take it, I might not be able to take it away ..."At this point, Wu Shan smiled, revealing a carefree smile."I can help you with whatever venerable sovereign Hao Yue wants to do. With the endorsement of a seventh rank venerable sovereign, it's easy for him to attract the attention of the Crimson Moon experts! "As long as I act nervous and even seal off the tianfang world, the Crimson Moon will not care about anything else and will focus on searching for the Dao in tianfang. The Divine Child's job is simple. All she has to do is contact the divine light plane and tell them that a tianfang great path universe has appeared here. A level Seven venerable sovereign has come from the divine light plane ... The Crimson Moon will definitely pay great attention to this!""Senior, what do you want?" Kong Ji exhaled."What do I want?""Isn't it obvious?"Wu Shan smiled. The Silver Moon King was very special! It's so special that the tianfang great Dao universe seems to have been opened for only one person ... But what I want is simple. I want the tianfang great Dao universe!" Kong Ji frowned."At my level, there's actually very little that I want," Wu Shan said calmly. First, advancement! Second, he would no longer live under someone else's roof! You could ask any advanced venerable sovereign, who would really want to live under someone else's roof? It's a pity that I can't open my own Dao universe. I lack this ability and don't want to start from scratch. Since that's the case, our goal is to seize a Dao universe. ""We don't care about ordinary seventh-tier great Dao universes, so it's better to stay in eighth-tier universes. This way, we can only take a fancy to special seventh-tier, eighth-tier, and even ninth-tier universes!""Since only Hao Yue can open Tian Fang, I naturally don't want him to be captured and killed by Hong Yue ... Wouldn't that be cutting off the hope of opening Tian Fang?"Kong Ji took another deep breath.This guy ... Was terrifying.At Level Seven, the other party naturally wanted to leave the clouds. It was not that he had to betray, but that at this level, there was still a master above him who could deprive you of your power of the great path at any time ... Because the other party was the master of the great path, which made some people very afraid.Why were experts from tier 8 great cosmoses willing to work for those Dao Masters?Level Seven and level eight were both high levels. If they met each other in the chaos, it was fine to ignore them. However, in this world, once you were not a Dao master, you might be deprived of the power of your great Dao.The other party was the Dao master! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Therefore, when Wushan said that they all wanted to leave at this point, it wasn't a lie. At this point, no one was willing to have a father above them."Senior, all of this is just your guess!" Kong Ji said calmly.Wu Shan nodded,"yes, a guess!" But this was enough. At this point, do we still need evidence?"He laughed,"just a guess!" "I might not be able to find the Silver Moon King. He should have run away ... But do you think I can find him if I go to the celestial pole now? The whereabouts of the celestial pole and King Huai were clear! Even if the new martial artists have their own plans, if there's an additional tier 7, or even more than one, do you think the Silver Moon King can escape?"“……”Kong Ji felt helpless.Yes, there was no need for evidence.What evidence do you need?My guess is correct.These advanced venerable sovereigns were so confident that they didn't care if they had something to use against them."Can you contact the Silver Moon King?" Wu Shan asked with a smile. If you can ... Please help me convey my message that I want the tianfang universe!"
