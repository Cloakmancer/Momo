, he had exchanged for about 1000 cubic meters of five elements energy for Li Hao. Li Hao had recently absorbed about half of it.
 He had absorbed about 500 cubic meters of the five elements energy.
 He still had about 500 cubic meters left, and some attribute-less mysterious energy.
 Among them, there were about 100 cubic meters of metal-type.
 It should be enough.
 Under normal circumstances, it was impossible for a Dark Moon to absorb 100 cubic meters of mysterious energy. This was a one-time absorption. It was difficult to absorb all of it in one go even for the sunlit continent, but it was not a problem for the three suns.
 Li Hao didn't say anything. He reached out his hand and made a grabbing motion. Metal-elemental mysterious energy surged into his body. At the same time, a faint sword energy emerged from the small sword.
 He had absorbed a lot of it at the entrance of the ruins last time, but he had consumed a lot recently. He felt that it was not as rich as before.
 The sword energy fused with the metal-type mystic energy and rapidly began to peel it off.
 In the blink of an eye, a golden energy was extracted. It was the purity of gold!
  This energy quickly rushed to his lungs.
 Metal attribute strengthened lungs.
 Li Hao didn't absorb it. Instead, he quickly circulated his inner strength, wrapped this energy, forced it out of his body, and sent it into the training room.
 ……
 In the training room.
 Wang Ming was apprehensive, and no one came in. Just like that, energy poured in, and he could cultivate?
 He didn't understand the process.
 Now, he could only wait and see.
 Just as he was thinking, a golden light suddenly appeared in front of him ... Yes, he could feel the existence of the golden light. In the blink of an eye, the Golden energy was coming toward him.
 Wang Ming was still thinking about what this thing was and whether it was dangerous or not.
 Before he could finish his thought, his eyes trembled violently!
 What?
 Under the circumstances that no one else could see, that golden energy quickly surged into his body. In the blink of an eye, this energy fused with the mysterious energy in his body. With a boom, it seemed to have a catalytic effect, and the mysterious energy in his body fluctuated violently.
 It was as if it was going to explode!
 The mysterious energy in his body surged wildly in all directions towards the superpower locks.
 Superpower cultivation was about breaking the superpower lock.
 The superpower lock that everyone broke might not be the same.
 For example, the first Super Lock Wang Ming had opened was a Super Lock in the lung area. He didn't know much about it, but after that, he had awakened the metal power.
 The second time he broke the superpower lock, he broke one on his right arm.
 According to the nine superpower locks that had been discovered so far, there was one in each of the five organs, one in each of the four limbs, and one in the head. However, no one had found it yet, and it was speculated that the tenth superpower lock should be in the head.
  At this moment, the Golden elements that surged into his body initially carried a large amount of mysterious energy and headed straight for his lungs.  Wang Ming was scared out of his wits. The internal organs were very fragile, even for superhumans.
 He didn't dare to let the energy enter his lungs.
 The next moment, he forcefully activated the energy absorption technique, which was also a method of guiding superpower, and instantly directed the energy to his left arm.
 He found five superpower locks. There was one in his lungs, followed by his arms and legs. As for the rest of the five organs, he had yet to sense the superpower locks.
 This time, he was going to direct this powerful energy to attack the Super Lock on his left arm.
 BOOM!
 A muffled sound came from within their bodies. At this moment, Li Hao and Yuan Shuo could even hear the rumbling sound of a breakthrough!
 Outside the door, Yuan Shuo did not speak. His lips were trembling. "He's trying to break through the superpower lock! The cultivation of superpowers is easier than ours. Even if you go to sunlit, you don't need to comprehend any force. As long as you can unlock the superpower lock, you will be able to advance!"
 Li Hao nodded and continued to extract the Golden elements, which surged into the room.
 Wave after wave of golden energy gushed into the room.
 Wang Ming, who was in the room, let out a miserable cry of pain.
 This time, the mysterious energy didn't hurt as much, which was out of Wang Ming's expectations. However, breaking the superpower lock was also a painful process.
 Of course, this was already pretty good for Wang Ming.
 In the past, the process of breaking the superpower lock was not the only painful process. The mysterious energy impact was also an extremely painful process.
 The pain was reduced by half!
 His eyes were also filled with excitement. He didn't know how Li Hao and Yuan Shuo had done it, but it was common for many people to collapse because they couldn't bear the pain during the process.
 At this moment, he felt that his chances of breaking through had greatly increased!
 A small chain appeared on his left arm.
 It was even somewhat materialized!
  In the field of superpower, there was a saying that the superpower lock was a chain that locked up the human body's potential. When you break this chain and release the potential, that was the reason why you could become stronger.
 Of course, Yuan Shuo had also said last time that the Super Lock might be a kind of protection ... But at this point, Wang Ming didn't care anymore and decided to advance first.
 Waves of golden energy kept attacking the superpower lock!
 The energy this time was gentler, but the impact was better. It seemed that the impact was more powerful.
 Hualala!
 At this moment, there was even the sound of chains. The chains on his left arm were constantly being washed away by the Golden energy, becoming thinner and weaker.
 Wang Ming's expression grew even more overjoyed!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He felt that the chances of success this time were especially high.
 Just as he was doing his best to wash himself again and again, outside the door, Yuan Shuo was silent for a long time before he suddenly said,""If you trust me, when the Super Lock breaks, fuse the chain fragment into another Super Lock!"
 Wang Ming was shocked!

 Merge with other Ultra-Lock?
 In that case, it would be more difficult to break through the other ultra-power locks. The ultra-power lock was a kind of shackle and a special energy. Under normal circumstances, it would dissipate immediately after being broken.
 Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, allowed him to merge with the other remaining superpower locks.
 At that moment, countless thoughts quickly emerged in Wang Ming's mind.
 There were even some thoughts that were not good.
 However, this thought lasted for a while before it disappeared. He said with difficulty,""Okay ... Thank you, teacher!"
 He didn't know if he was right or not.
 However, Yuan Shuo had no reason to harm him.
 As for how difficult it would be to advance in the future, that was a matter for the future. After entering the glorious sun, who knew how long it would take to reach three suns?
 There were quite a few Silver Moon sunlit night watchers, but there were only two from the three suns.
  He was still young. At most, he could slowly grind it down in the future.
 He continued to attack.
 This time, it was slightly different from before. Previously, he wanted to break through it directly, even if the superpower lock was broken.
 At this moment, he controlled himself a little.
 He locked the opening of the Super Lock in one position.
 This way, after breaking the ultra-power lock, not much of it would leak out, and the rest could be integrated into other ultra-power locks.
 This way, the other locks would be even more difficult to break.
 However, since he had already trusted Yuan Shuo, he couldn't be bothered to brush him off. Otherwise, he would have just blended in a little.
 ……
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Outside the door.
 After Yuan Shuo said this, he let out a sigh of relief.
 He had said all he could. He wouldn't interfere with Wang Ming's decision. Wang Ming wasn't li Hao. If he were Li Hao, he wouldn't have tried to persuade him, but would have forced him to do so.
 At this moment, Li Hao was still extracting.
 30 cubic meters, 40 cubic meters ...
 Not long after, he had already withdrawn 50 cubic meters of mysterious energy.
 This speed was extremely shocking.
 Under normal circumstances, Wang Ming definitely wouldn't have been able to absorb so much mysterious energy.
 But now, Wang Ming was also being consumed very quickly inside, and the sound of the impact and the vibration of the chains was still there.
 Li Hao could only continue.
 "Hualala ..."
 The vibration of the chains continued.
 Wang Ming once again howled in pain.
 At this moment, Li Hao was deep in thought. Was a normal breakthrough that painful?
 However, in his mind, breaking through was a natural process. For example, when his teacher and Liu Long broke through to the Dou Qian class, it was not painful at all. Instead, it was an extremely comfortable process.
 In theory, Dayao and douqian were of the same level.  Breaking the superpower lock was so painful every time. It really felt like going against the heavens.
 Just as he was thinking about this, Wang Ming suddenly roared from inside,"Give me more at once. I'm going to do one last full-power attack!"
 Li Hao didn't say anything, but he sped up the extraction.
 He poured all the metal elemental energy into the room in one go. The more he poured in, the more metal elemental energy he let out. However, he did not care about it at this moment.
 "Hualala!"
 The sound of the chains vibrating was getting clearer and clearer.
 Inside, Wang Ming's pained howls grew louder and louder.
 Just as Li Hao was about to run out of the 100 cubic meters of metal attribute, Wang Ming suddenly roared.
 "Gah!"
 A crisp cracking sound was heard.
 In the next moment, Wang Ming's pained wail was heard, and in the next moment, a burst of metal element Energy suddenly erupted in the room.
 Yuan Shuo waved his hand and opened the door.
 At this moment, Li Hao could see it clearly.
 He saw a chain break, and the moment it broke, a powerful force emerged from his left arm, which fused with the energy in Wang Ming's body and instantly grew stronger!
 The mysterious metal energy in his body seemed to have absorbed a lot of energy. In the blink of an eye, it started to become stronger!
 In Li Hao's eyes, Wang Ming instantly turned from a bright moon to a small sun.
 The broken chain also appeared in Li Hao's eyes.
 He saw the chains begin to dissipate.
 At that moment, Wang Ming gritted his teeth and activated his mysterious energy. In the blink of an eye, all the broken chains were pulled into his legs, and two chains actually vaguely appeared in his legs to lock him up.
 After merging with the broken chain on his left arm, the two chains seemed to become a little clearer.
 Wang Ming didn't care about this. The mysterious energy in his body quickly exploded and grew. A lot of energy seemed to have been sealed in his left arm, and at this moment, it all gushed out and became one with him.
 Wang Ming became even more resplendent!
 He was in pain but also excited, so excited that he wanted to roar.
 He had actually succeeded!
  It was just an attempt, but the Golden energy that came out of nowhere was beyond his imagination. There was no pain, only dominance. It broke through the superpower lock rapidly. The process of breaking through this time seemed to be much easier than when he entered Dark Moon.
 Wang Ming continued to absorb the energy, as well as the energy that was about to disappear from the surroundings.
 The mysterious golden energy in his body started to grow.
 This process was very fast.
 Not long after, the energy in the surroundings dissipated, and even his left arm returned to normal, no longer feeling like it had exploded with energy.
 Wang Ming's eyes were golden. At that moment, he let out a long breath and opened his eyes, the excitement in them hard to describe."Teacher, Li Hao ... I ... I advanced!"
 Sunlight!
 It was broken so easily.
 Yuan Shuo did not offer any congratulations. He only sighed and said softly,""So be it!"
 When Wang Ming had broken the Super Lock just now, he had also seen some things, and the more he thought about it, the more he felt that the Super Lock couldn't be rashly broken.

 After breaking the Super Lock, Wang Ming's left arm overflowed with a lot of energy.
 Wang Ming had absorbed all of it, and he had quickly grown to the radiant sun level.
 He had indeed become stronger ... But Yuan Shuo had the feeling that Wang Ming's potential had been further exhausted.
 The chains were more like a nurturing mechanism.
 It nourished the human body!
 Although his left arm was unable to display much of its strength before, there was a special power within it. What if the chain was not broken by force but was removed naturally?
 Would he be able to burst out with more powerful strength?
 As for martial masters, would they also have to come into contact with the superpower lock to advance further? of course, it would not be broken by force, but the superpower lock would be removed naturally. Would they be able to erupt with greater potential and strength?
 Yuan Shuo fell into deep thought and did not feel happy that the other party had entered the glorious sun.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, smiled.
  Wang Ming bared his teeth and laughed heartily.
 "I'm ... 20 years old. I'm probably the youngest in Silver Moon province to ever be in daylight!"
 He might have broken a record!
 Li Hao also laughed."Then I have to congratulate you even more. The youngest, Wang riyao!"
 "It's alright, it's alright!"
 Wang Ming was overjoyed. He glanced at Yuan Shuo, and as if he knew that Yuan Shuo wasn't as happy as he appeared, he grinned and said,"Teacher, I know that you may think that becoming a superpower is not the right path, but I'm also thinking ... The right path and future in your eyes may be very far away! It was even more powerful than the three suns, even more powerful than the three suns! But can I reach that step?"
 "Today, there are already powerhouses above the three yang realm. My dream is to catch up to them! He didn't care about the future, he only wanted the present to be brilliant! "If that day really comes, if there's a way to make up for it, it might be easier for me to make up for it with my powerful strength. If there's no way to make up for it ... Then I won't regret it in my life. At least I've been brilliant!"
 This didn't sound like something Wang Ming would say.
 Li Hao's mind wandered. He only wanted the excitement of the present ... But the future ... Was so far away!
 Would the carefree Wang Ming have such an understanding?
 It was beyond Li Hao's imagination.
 As for Yuan Shuo, he was slightly taken aback as well. He glanced at this in-name disciple who didn't seem to care much.
 He only wanted to shine now, not his future.
 "You ..."
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Yuan Shuo suddenly laughed, but it was a different laugh. He nodded."Well said! 'I'm the one who's stuck in an endless loop. That's right, it's exciting now. Sweeping the world doesn't seem too bad! For example, when a normal Martial Master breaks through a hundred, his internal injuries will accumulate. The stronger he is, the more serious his internal injuries will be. When I was at the peak of breaking through a hundred, my internal injuries accumulated, and I was unable to enter the Qian battle stage ... Did I not think about it before I broke through a hundred? Don't you know that the more you fight, the more internal injuries you have?"
 Of course he knew!
 But even if he knew, didn't he, Yuan Shuo, still go around challenging people?
 At that moment, he thought of himself, and then thought of how he had advised Wang Ming and the others ... He suddenly felt that it was a little ridiculous.  They were still young!
 As someone who had been through this, he felt that this should not be the case. However, after thinking about it carefully, who had not been young before?
 As for the regrets left behind, he could make up for them in the future. Even if he couldn't make up for it, he wouldn't lose anything.
 "Xiaoming, that's a good idea!"
 This time, Yuan Shuo smiled and nodded in approval.
 Wang Ming also chuckled.
 "You ... Said that?" Li Hao asked in a low voice.
 “……”
 Wang Ming's face darkened, and after a long while, he mumbled,"No, Minister hou said so. I'm borrowing it for a while. Some people said that he was injured a few years ago and delayed his future, so he shouldn't have forcefully taken action back then. Minister hou said that he was once brilliant, and even Ying Hongyue had to bow her head in front of him ... That's enough, and he never regretted it!"
 She was one of the leaders of the three great organizations. She had once faced hou Xiaochen in Silver Moon province and lowered her head. She didn't kill the enemy who had captured her. This was one of Hong Yue's rare losses.
 As for hou Xiaochen, he was also left with internal injuries. Some people thought it wasn't worth it, but hou Xiaochen thought it was worth it. He had once suppressed Red Moon, not in the branch, but in the headquarters!
 When Yuan Shuo heard this, he fell into deep thought and did not speak.
 Li Hao laughed."That's more like it. Old Wang, how can you say such bold words?"
 Wang Ming was speechless,"why can't I? Li Hao, I'm now a solar glory expert!"
 Li Hao looked at him and smiled.
 What's wrong with sunlight?
 Having just advanced to the next level, sunlight didn't have the force of a Martial Master. Li Hao actually wanted to test how strong the other party was.
  He was not afraid!
 In Li Hao's opinion, when it came to the levels of douqian and sunlight, douqian was more terrifying, while the sunlight was only more powerful.
 Yuan Shuo saw the two of them arguing and laughed,""That's enough, little Ming. You've just advanced, so your main task is to control your powers. Don't let them leak out!"
 "Have you mastered the breathing technique I taught you last time?" he asked after some consideration.
 "En!"
 Wang Ming hurriedly nodded. That was just a simplified version of the breathing technique of five birds, which was easy to practice; he had learned it long ago.
 "You've been using this breathing technique 24 hours a day for the past few days. Although it's not as good as my breathing technique of five birds, it's still better than your energy drawing into the body technique. If you keep using it, you can absorb the overflowing mysterious energy and suppress the supernatural fluctuations. If you're not particularly strong or paying special attention to you, it'll be hard to notice that you've advanced."
 Wang Ming was startled. It had been running all along?
 Supers didn't need to be like this.
 Yuan Shuo said in a deep voice,"remember, keep it running!" It had even become a muscle instinct, a human body's instinct. Even if he was unconscious or dead, his body would still circulate the breathing technique! This is something a Martial Master must do. You are not a Martial Master, but ... I hope you can do it!"

 Li Hao hurriedly nodded and said,"old Wang, this is good!" If you keep running it, it'll have the same effect as breath control, and if you keep running it instinctively, it'll strengthen your body and keep you on guard at all times. "
 Wang Ming nodded."Got it. I'll keep trying."
 "You'll stay here for the next few days. When you can control the overflowing mysterious energy like before, you'll go out to avoid being detected. It's necessary to hold back!"
 Yuan Shuo's ears twitched as he glanced at Li Hao.
 Li Hao also looked at his teacher. He had also heard some noise.
 It might be Liu Yan.
 It was a good start tonight. Lao Wang had successfully advanced. If Liu Yan had also advanced to the late-stage of over 100, then the weakest member of the group that was going to the remains would also be at the late-stage of over 100.
 Li Hao even wondered if their small team was strong enough to compete with some organizations.
 Two warrior of the thousand world, one of the sun glory, he had broken through a hundred perfection, and now there was a late-stage hundred ... He was still very powerful.
 "I'm going out for a bit!"
  Li Hao greeted him, and Yuan Shuo nodded.
 Wang Ming was just about to speak when Yuan Shuo said in a deep voice,"You just stay here! In addition, absorb some of the other four elements!"
 As he spoke, he threw down an energy storage box.""There's a bit of the other four elements in there. Absorb it in small amounts."
 Wang Ming was puzzled. I'm a metal element, so why would I absorb other elements?
 It would cause a conflict between the powers.
 "You can just absorb it!"
 Alright, Wang Ming didn't say anything else. He didn't dare disobey Yuan Shuo. Even if they were all on the same level now, killing three suns was as easy as drinking water for him, but he couldn 't.
 ……
 Outside the house.
 Li Hao opened the door. It was indeed Liu Yan.
 Liu Yan entered and looked into the room. She said in a low voice, "Who's here? I can feel a sharp super power overflowing from far away. A solar flare powerhouse?"
 "You guess!"
 Li Hao smiled.
 Liu Yan considered for a moment and said in disbelief,""He really advanced?"
 Everyone knew that Li Hao had said he would help Wang Ming absorb the blood God.
 But ... Did he really advance successfully?
 This was too unbelievable!
 "En!"
 "That's right!" Li Hao nodded and chuckled."This way, we'll have more assurance in going to the remains!"
 Liu Yan also revealed a look of joy.
 The stronger the team was, the more confident they were.
 However, she gave Li Hao a strange look.""You're the same age as him, and even a few months older than him. Li Hao ... Are you really not jealous at all?"
 Sometimes, she actually felt that it was strange.
 Was Li Hao really that indifferent?
 Li Hao had broken through a hundred levels, and had actually been ahead of Wang Ming before. But now that Wang Ming had advanced and was even a little younger than him, Li Hao had taken the initiative to help him advance. Had he not thought that he would be surpassed?
 Li Hao laughed,"why are you jealous?" Sister, everyone's path is different, and they pursue different things. More importantly, at least Wang Ming isn't a bad person; he's just a bit loose-lipped, and ... He's my Junior Brother in name!"
 What was there to be jealous about?
 Li Hao really had never been jealous of Wang Ming. There was no need to. He thought of that sword strike that day ... He wouldn't even be jealous of Wang Ming entering three suns, let alone sunshine.
 What about the three yang? what about those above the three yang?
 There was only one outcome for those who encountered that sword-death!
 What he was working hard to pursue was to be able to slash out this sword one day!
 Liu Yan took a deep breath and didn't say anything else.
 Li Hao was very low-key, so low-key that not many people knew that he had already broken through 100%. But compared to being low-key, what was more terrifying about Li Hao was his high-profile.
 So what if it was sunlight?
 Since he said he wasn't jealous, he must be telling the truth. Otherwise, he wouldn't have helped Wang Ming advance.
 As for Li Hao, he didn't say anything else and led Liu Yan into another room.
 Compared to separating the powers, the fusion of the blood God with the sword power was actually much easier. After swallowing the blood God, he would pour in a bit of sword power. There was no need to separate the powers and they could naturally fuse together.
 A Blood God at the radiant sun realm, coupled with the sword energy, was enough for Liu Yan to absorb and digest for a while.
 Li Hao directly made Liu Yan swallow the blood God. Liu Yan looked at it for a long time and was speechless.
 She had guessed that Li Hao had called her here because he had detained a few Blood God's ... But she hadn't expected that it wasn't just a few, but an entire one!
 In that case, Wang Ming hadn't used this at all for his promotion.
 Liu Yan lowered her head and didn't say anything.
 After a while, he swallowed the blood God in one gulp and said nothing.  Demon-hunting squad ...
 Liu Yan thought of many things. She thought of Liu Long and the others.
 There were very few people in the demon hunting squad, but everyone was very in love.
 Liu Long was a very heartwarming Captain. Although he appeared cold and arrogant, Liu Yan knew that was only on the surface. When he found out that li Dahu was in the remains, Liu Long had already decided to kill him to take revenge for Liu Yan.
 It wasn't just for Liu Yan. If this happened to anyone else in the team, Liu Long would also do the same. He didn't say anything and only took action.
 Liu Long would silently take care of everyone and keep their secrets.
 But today, from Li Hao, she suddenly felt the same feeling as Liu Long.
 He was trustworthy!
 As for Liu Long, in the hearts of the entire team, he was irreplaceable and worthy of their complete trust. All the secrets might not be known by others, but Liu Long knew them all. He would never take the initiative to reveal them to the outside world. Instead, he would try his best to help everyone.
 After swallowing the blood God's spawn, Liu Yan's expression was a little complicated. She looked at Li Hao and suddenly said,""Don't be so nice to me in the future. I'm afraid that I'll fall for you ... My heart ... Can't hold you anymore!"
 Li Hao was stunned.
 This sentence didn't seem to be a joke.
 Her heart could no longer hold him ...
 Li Hao didn't think much of it, but ... It seemed like she was saying that she had someone else in her heart?
 Li Hao glanced at her but didn't say anything.
 Liu Yan smiled. She smiled very happily, but at the same time, she felt a little lonely.
 In his mind, a figure gradually emerged.
 He was always so cold and arrogant, and unreasonable ... But the more one understood him, the more one understood that he was a true man of indomitable spirit!
 However, she had never taken the initiative to say it. She had never even revealed it.
 She was very affectionate to many newcomers. She was so to Li Hao, to Wu Chao and Chen Jian back then, and to some of her dead teammates ... She was rarely so charming to him.
 The more he cared, the less he would do so.
 Liu Yan closed her eyes and stopped thinking about it.
 Li Hao seemed to have thought of something. He said carefully,""Boss ... Does he have a wife?"
 He really didn't know about this.
 Liu Yan suddenly opened her eyes and glanced at Li Hao. After a while, she said,""He's dead!"
 “……”
 Li Hao didn't ask any more questions. Liu Long was also single?
 This was normal.
 Could it be that Liu Yan's heart was filled with boss?
 Li Hao wasn't too sure about this.
 The outside world had previously said that the two of them had something going on ... But after joining the team, Li Hao discovered that there didn't seem to be any special relationship between the two of them. Liu Long took such good care of everyone.
 He didn't show any extra concern for Liu Yan.
 He stopped thinking about this. If Liu Yan really liked boss ... Li Hao felt that it was actually quite good. Captain was a good person. Apart from wearing a trench coat all day long and acting cool, he didn't seem to have any shortcomings.
 He just didn't know if he disappeared for one day or half a day every week because he went out for something.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com To satisfy a man's needs?
 Who knows!
 Well, he was a single man. He was already a few decades old. If he really was, it seemed normal.
 Li Hao stopped thinking about this and injected some sword energy into Liu Yan's body.
 After that, there was nothing else for him to do.
 He watched silently and waited.
 ……
 After more than an hour, Liu Yan opened her eyes.
  "I'm almost there. In the later stage, I have to release the internal force from the head. I have enough external force. Next is the recovery period, mainly the eyes ..."
 When Li Hao heard this, he told him about the method Yuan Shuo had taught him to nourish his tear glands.
 Soon, there was a crying woman in the room.
 Li Hao quickly left.
 It was really hard to explain when a woman was seen crying in the middle of the night.
 Outside the door, Yuan Shuo gave him a meaningful glance.
 "She seems to be ..." Li Hao said in a low voice helplessly.
 Yuan Shuo nodded slightly and smiled,"that's normal. Liu Long ... He's actually quite charming. It's just that his brain isn't very good. Other than that, it's hard to say if there are any other problems."
 Li Hao laughed dryly.
 In his teacher's eyes, everyone's brains were probably not working well, and perhaps he was the same.

 It was a quiet night.
 Wang Ming and Liu Yan each consolidated their realms and adapted to the new energy.
 Li Hao and Yuan Shuo didn't rest, either. They were both reading books, not martial arts books, but books on general knowledge.
 Of course, Li Hao seriously suspected that the books in the third row were hidden under the cover of his Teacher's Book.
 In the morning, Liu Yan left first. Wang Ming didn't leave and continued to stay here to consolidate his realm.
 ……
 In the study room.
 Li Hao and Yuan Shuo had been reading all night, but they did not fall asleep.
 The moment Wang Ming had opened the Super Lock, it had actually affected both of them.
 After reading for the whole night, Yuan Shuo seemed to be thinking about something. In the morning, he suddenly looked at Li Hao and said,""Wang Ming saw five super locks on the limbs and lungs, which means he's activated a metal power."
  Li Hao put down his book and looked at his teacher.
 Yuan Shuo continued,"if we're looking at it from a single element, the one that opened the heart's Super Lock should be a fire element super .."
 Li Hao nodded. He felt the same way.
 Yuan Shuo gently knocked on the table and said,""What if I open all five elements?"
 Li Hao was suspicious. Five elements?
 "Let's talk about you now. Are you strengthening your five internal organs? if someone finds the five super locks on your five internal organs and opens all of them, what will happen?"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao thought for a while, then said,""The five elements are neutralized and then balanced? Turn it into inner strength?"
 At this point, Li Hao laughed!
 However, Yuan Shuo was extremely calm and said indifferently,""Why not?"
 Li Hao was stunned. What did he mean?
 Yuan Shuo knocked his head and fell into deep thought. After a moment, he said,""After the five elements are neutralized, even if it's not inner strength, it shouldn't be a simple superpower!"
 "After I entered the thousand warrior realm, I also felt the inner strength in my body, which strengthened my five internal organs!"
 He looked at Li Hao and was caught in a dilemma. "There's no way to go above thousand warrior tier! What is a ten thousand man enemy?"
 "I'm thinking that a Martial master's weakness lies in their internal organs ... If my internal organs are strong to the extreme ... I can nourish them until the five organs 'super locks open naturally like superpowers. Will a powerful force appear and transform me both inside and outside, allowing me to enter a new realm?"
 Yuan Shuo could clearly sense the energy explosion when Wang Ming unlocked the Super Lock on his left arm.
 The human body itself was a treasure!
 He didn't want to open the SuperLock by force. He didn't want his inner strength to be devoured and the external force to take over his body.
 However, if it was nurtured to the extreme, the internal organs would be strong enough to unlock the superpower lock. What kind of scene would that be?
 He looked at Li Hao."You've been nourishing your five organs. Do you think that the five organs lock has become stronger or weaker?"  "He's even more powerful now!"
 Li Hao answered honestly. After some consideration, he said,""I used to be able to feel the existence of the superpower lock, but now I can't ... I have a feeling that the bucket is deeper! It can store more energy, so it's harder for my five viscera Super Lock to appear now. "
 "Does the superpower lock still exist?"
 "It exists!"
 Li Hao nodded again."It definitely exists. If it doesn 't, I can sense it."
 "What if your five internal organs are strong enough to open the superpower lock? Do you think you'll be able to explode once?"
 Li Hao fell into deep thought this time. This was unknown, and he couldn't say for sure.
 From his personal feelings ... Li Hao gave a fair answer.""It's possible! 'My five internal organs have absorbed too much essence of the five elements, but they've only become a little stronger. Then, all the mysterious energy I've absorbed ... Could it have all been spilled?' That was impossible! Therefore, there must be a place in the five internal organs that stores energy, and all my energy is stored inside!"
 "This is also my guess!"
 Yuan Shuo revealed a smile, and after a moment, he slowly said,""The so-called five internal organs store essence and Qi without leaking, so it can't be full."
 Li Hao understood what she meant.
 According to the ancient records, the five internal organs were the places where essence Qi was stored, and it was stored without leaking out.
 "The five internal organs are often related to the six internal organs. The five internal organs are full but not solid, while the six internal organs are real but not solid ..." Yuan Shuo said after some thought.
 He fell into his own thoughts.
 After a long while, he said,"let's not talk about the six internal organs first. The six internal organs are more abstract!" The five internal organs were more practical. The five viscera, also known as the five viscera God, was the five divine viscera. As for Qian battle, it contained spirit! The spirit connects the five internal organs, the five internal organs appear in the spirit ..."
 He thought of many things. At this moment, he suddenly said,""I'll use the five birds to contain the spirit! Five birds God, five viscera God ... One God and one viscera! Do you think I have a chance of breaking the superpower lock and nourishing my five spirits?"
 At this moment, Li Hao quickly thought.
 He understood his teacher's meaning. His teacher was saying that the five types of power in the five birds technique could be used to break the five super locks on the five internal organs. It could be absorbed or nurtured. It was not a simple break.
  Once again, he merged the power of the five birds, and the God of five birds stepped into a new realm.
 Was that even possible?
 Li Hao didn't know, but he did know that it might be very dangerous.
 The unknown path was always like this. Every step forward was extremely dangerous. However, it was also accompanied by huge gains.
 If his teacher succeeded, what realm would he reach?
 The zhenwan that teacher mentioned?
 No!
 Absolutely not!
 The divine ability of five birds broke the five viscera lock, which was equivalent to breaking five super locks. Breaking five super locks was the fifth level of the Super domain, above the three yang.
 Therefore, it was very likely that his teacher could directly skip the three yang level and step into the three yang realm.

 Of course, that was based on superpowers.
 After all, a Martial Master was different.
 Li Hao looked at his teacher. Yuan Shuo laughed and said,"I think we can try! How would one know if it would work if one did not try? This time, I heard that sun Yifei will be going. With my current strength, I might not be able to defeat him, or rather ... It's almost impossible!"
 He laughed and didn't feel embarrassed. He sighed and said,""He's at the late stage of three yang, and I had to risk my life to kill Qiao Feilong, who was at the early stage of three yang! "If I were to fight him ... I might die. It was fine if he lost to others. The thing I can't tolerate the most in my life is to lose to the person I defeated back then!"
 "I've said it before. Those who are suppressed by me will be trampled on by me for the rest of their lives. I don't want to be trampled on by those who were defeated by me in the past when I'm old. Sun Yifei can't do it, but as for Ying Hongyue, if I have the chance, I'll take revenge sooner or later!"
 "Teacher, have you decided?" Li Hao asked in a deep voice.
 "I've decided!"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Actually, I've been thinking about it since you were nourishing your five internal organs," Yuan Shuo said slowly. "It wasn't until last night when Wang Ming opened the Super Lock and showed me how powerful the power inside was that I made up my mind to nourish my five internal organs! It just so happens that my five birds technique is the most compatible and suitable!"
 "The five internal organs contain the five Forces and the five spirits ... When the five spirits emerge from the internal organs ... I will either die or advance to the warrior power level!"
 He looked at Li Hao and said,"heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney. Tiger, bear, deer, ape, bird. One internal organ and one bird!" Heart fire ape, the heart controls fire, the ape's attribute is fire! Heart monkey! The bear's attribute was earth, and earth contained the spleen and stomach, while the spleen contained the bear! The Tiger works for the kidney, strengthening the kidney and strengthening the body ... Birds work for the lungs, deer work for the liver ..."
  Yuan Shuo said a lot, talking about his own thoughts and ideas.
 He would place the five spirits aside and nourish the five internal organs, and then break out of the internal organs ... No, break out of the lock.
 Li Hao listened carefully.
 He knew that his teacher was afraid that if something happened, the inheritance of these things would end.
 The five internal organs contain the five spirits, am I right?
 If the ancient people had a path, they would definitely not have walked it this way.
 There was no other reason. It was impossible for everyone in the ancient times to practice the five birds technique, and it was impossible for everyone to practice the momentum of the five birds. Thus, his teacher's path must have been created by him and was unique.
 Perhaps the general direction might be similar to that of the ancient people, but in terms of the details, it must have been his teacher who had walked the path himself.
 Putting everything else aside, Li Hao might not be able to learn or use the five Forces even if his teacher managed to master them.
 But at least, this was a path!
 At the end of his sentence, Yuan Shuo revealed an unruly smile,""Little Hao, I want to accumulate the spirit of my five internal organs right now! In terms of strength, there shouldn't be any changes for the time being, but if my five internal organs don't appear, I'm afraid I won't be able to improve any further! Thus, I thought about it ... I'll use the fire energy I got from killing Qiao Feilong first to see if I can cultivate a heart fire ape. "
 Li Hao quickly said,"teacher, this is what I should do!" We still have 400 cubic meters of the five elements power and about 200 cubic meters of attribute-less power ... Teacher used them all!"
 Yuan Shuo glanced at him and said softly,""I originally wanted to leave it for you to use in the future to quickly strengthen your five internal organs, but now ... Forget it. If I succeed, I naturally won't lack it! However, I still need a portion of the sword energy ..."
 "Teacher, you can choose whatever you want!"  Li Hao took out the small sword and handed it to the teacher.
 His teacher might encounter a strong enemy this time. The late stage of the three suns was strong, but if his teacher really went all out, with the stone blade and the blood Blade technique, he might not be completely defeated.
 However, if he came to the three suns above, his teacher would definitely be defeated and die!
 If he could produce the spirit of one of the five internal organs, he might have a way to deal with it. Of course, it might be better if he produced all the spirits of the five internal organs.
 However, it might be too late now.
 The heart fire ape might be the first to go for the five viscera God.
 "I'll try to accumulate the spirit of one organ first," Yuan Shuo continued."If I fail, you'll have to accumulate the spirit of the five organs if you have a chance later!"
 "Balancing the five internal organs might be the best result. Strengthening one internal organ first might also have drawbacks."
 Li Hao said seriously,'don't worry, teacher. I'll keep everything in mind!' If teacher fails ... I'll use my five internal organs to manifest and kill all of teacher's enemies before paying my respects to teacher!"
 Yuan Shuo burst out laughing!
 Are you disheartened?
 Not at all!
 There was only comfort.
  Well said!
 That was how it should be. He should take this path first. If he failed, he could leave some experience for Li Hao. When he succeeded, he could kill all his enemies and offer them to him. That would be a good story.
 "I'll keep the sword and the saber first. Also, I'll keep the mysterious energy first. "
 "According to my calculations, there should be some results within five days," Yuan Shuo said. "You should go back first and come see me in five days. If you succeed, you'll head to the crosscut Valley that day. If you fail, your heart will be shattered ... Take everything you have and give the real sword and saber to hou Xiaochen. He'll protect your life!"
 A real sword!
 Obviously, he felt that hou Xiaochen had guessed that Li Hao's gift last time was fake.
 If he failed, no one would be able to protect Li Hao, not Liu Long. In the entire Silvermoon province, the only person who could protect Li Hao was hou Xiaochen.
 "Teacher!"
 Just as Li Hao was about to speak, Yuan Shuo laughed and said,""Go! "On the path of martial Dao, teacher also wants to carve out a path. Today, on a whim, I've determined the direction, so I'll try. Whether I fail or succeed, I won't feel guilty!"
 He patted Li Hao's shoulder and smiled.

 Li Hao lowered his head and didn't speak.
 "Master ... Then I'll ... Go back!"
 Master ...
 When teaching in the martial arts world, he was both a teacher and a father.
 It was just that Li Hao was used to calling Yuan Shuo "teacher," because Yuan Shuo had taught him the way of literature, not martial arts.
 Li Hao was already used to calling her that when he was teaching her martial arts.
 But today, Li Hao had changed the way he addressed her.
 Because this might be the last time.
 The master and disciple were not indecisive people. The master had already made his decision, and Li Hao knew that he could not stop him, nor was he qualified to stop him.
 He knelt on the ground and kowtowed."Master, I'll wait for you to come out of seclusion! If you fail, I'll go to white moon City and keep a low profile for a few years. When I succeed, I'll kill all my enemies in this world!"
  "Hahaha!"
 Yuan Shuo laughed and waved his hand,""I still hope to do it myself!"
 "Then you and I, master and disciple, shall kill them all together!"
 "You're too murderous ... Get lost!"
 Li Hao stood up and left.
 Yuan Shuo watched him leave and smiled.
 A moment later, he gently exhaled. Five internal organs, heart fire ape ... Then from today onwards, I'll accumulate this heart fire ape.
 They all say that I, Yuan Shuo, am like a baboon.
 Very good!
 When I, the heart fire ape, come out, I'll let you see the real baboon.
 Sun Yifei?
 Late three yang realm?
 If you want to take revenge on me, bring it on!
 A few decades ago, I beat you until you jumped off a cliff to commit suicide. At that time, it was also the transverse Canyon. This time, it's the same transverse Canyon. Don't think that you can do anything just because you have Ying Hongyue. Ying Hongyue was also defeated by me back then!
 ……
 At the same time.
 At the edge of Silver Moon province.
 One of them was walking on the ground. He was tall and had a long stick on his back. He looked to be at most 40 years old. His hair was slightly white, but his eyes were exceptionally sharp. He did not look old, but his hair was unkempt and draped over his shoulders.
 And behind this person, there were several young people.
 "Master, we've arrived at the Silver Moon province!"
 Someone saw the boundary stone and revealed a happy expression.
 He had finally arrived!
  The Qi Mei staff King, who was walking in front, glanced at the boundary stone and revealed a smile.  It had been twenty years!
 It had been 20 years since he left this place. This was the first time he had set foot in his hometown in 20 years.
 He had lost to demon Yuan back then. For twenty years, demon Yuan had been trapped in the Silver Moon. He thought that he would eventually break through the hundred realms. He did not expect that when he was old, that guy had actually entered the thousand warrior realm and killed three suns.
 That's good!
 He disdained bullying the weak.
 Revenge, he thought.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, he disdained to kill a person who was about to die.
 Ying Hongyue was determined to kill Yuan Shuo not just for revenge, but also for other purposes, such as forcing out the contents of some ancient books, the location of the ruins, and the breathing technique of five birds.
 However, sun Yifei didn't care about that. He only came here to kill Yuan Shuo and tell him that he was back!
 Not only that, he also brought along a few of his favorite students.
 This was because he had heard that Yuan Shuo had made a move for his last disciple, Li Hao, who was also the person Hong Yue wanted to capture.
 It didn't matter!
 He didn't care. He had brought his disciples here to kill Yuan Shuo's disciples. Furthermore, these disciples were all martial masters and not superpowers. They were Martial Master inheritances that he had specially cultivated for the past twenty years!
 If he were to kill Yuan Shuo so easily ... That might not be fair.
 He wanted his disciples to kill Li Hao and prove that the eyebrow-raising stick was stronger than the five birds technique.
 One was at the peak of beheading ten, one was at the peak of beheading a hundred, and one was at the perfection of beheading a hundred.
 He didn't know what realm Yuan Shuo's disciple was currently at. He might be very weak, but his weakest disciple was at the peak of ten cuts, so this time, he brought his weakest disciple.
 If Yuan Shuo's disciple couldn't even win against the weakest, then sun Yifei couldn't be blamed for using his strength to suppress him.
 "Master, are we going straight to the crosscut Canyon? Or are we going to Silver City directly?"
 Behind him, the man with a cultivation base of over 100 said softly,""With master's strength, I don't think anyone in the entire Silvermoon can stop you. If you don't want to waste time, why don't you head straight to the Silver City and kill Yuan Shuo and his disciple, cutting off his five birds technique inheritance!"
 Sun Yifei turned around and glanced at him. After a while, he said,"Do not underestimate Silver Moon! Back when our leader came to Silver Moon, he suffered a loss as well. "
  "Yes, this disciple understands! I heard that it was the leader of the Silvermoon Nightwalker, hou Xiaochen, who made a move, but it was because a strong person from the central continent came that the leader had to leave. Hou Xiaochen only took advantage of the people from the central continent ..."
 Sun Yifei glanced at him and calmly said, "It's not that simple! When hou Xiaochen made his move, the leader was there. Why didn't he stop him? Just because he has a high status, he's waiting for hou Xiaochen to finish killing before fighting him?"
 Young people always thought of things in a simple way.
 He placed more importance on these Martial Master disciples than the Super disciples.
 Superpowers ... He actually did not like them, even if he himself was a superhuman now.
 However, in the path of superpower, the master's teachings were not too important. Other than some superpower skills, there were not many techniques. It was just absorbing energy, breaking the superpower lock, and then learning some superpower skills.
 There was a huge gap between him and a Martial Master.
 It was easier for a master and disciple to develop feelings and impart their experiences, battle techniques, and skills.
 Therefore, he did not really care even though a few of his disciples had already stepped into the solar illumination realm.
 Back then, he had no fate with the warrior of thousands and was defeated when he broke through 100. His force was destroyed and he had no choice but to advance to a super to delay his decline. In the end, he was unable to return to the path of a Martial Master.

 Therefore, he hoped that some of his disciples would be able to enter the thousand warrior realm.
 For example, the eldest disciple who spoke. The eldest disciple of the path of martial masters had already grasped the initial stage of force and had the potential to fight a thousand. He valued him very much.
 "Mo Xian, don't underestimate Silver Moon!"
 Sun Yifei really valued this first martial disciple. At this moment, he said in a serious tone,"Silver Moon has always been located at the border and has been a prosperous place for martial arts! Twenty years ago, before the appearance of superpowers, Silver moon's martial masters were world-famous!"
 "In those years, Silver moon's martial masters roamed the world's 99 provinces and dominated the world! Later, when the Heavenly Star dynasty unified the world, there was a period of time when the Silver Moon martial masters were in chaos, and they had no choice but to ban martial arts!"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com " 20 years ago was the last period of the Silver Moon martial forest, but there were still many masters, including an old demon like Yuan Shuo. Although he wasn't a warrior, he was famous for killing many God-favored priests during the early stage of the rise of supers!"
 "The Silver Moon martial arts world has a deep foundation. Who knows which corner might have a Qian warrior hidden in it?"
 "There aren't many conflicts between the martial masters and the supers. Some of the older martial masters have either retired into the mountains or hidden in the dark, waiting for the right time. Some have even changed their appearances and become the leaders of some superpower organizations," sun Yifei said in a deep voice.
 "Of the three great organizations, the red moon's leader is from the Silver Moon ... In truth, the leaders of the flying Yama and flying Yama families are more or less related to the Silver Moon! In your eyes, the central region is powerful, and there are many experts, but so what?"
  Speaking of his hometown, even though he had enemies here, sun Yifei was still full of emotions.
 There were still experts.
 There were many experts from the Silvermoon martial forest, such as Ying Hongyue. Although she was hostile to the government, Ying Hongyue was still a leading figure, and he was one of the Silvermoon people.
 Therefore, even though Silver moon's position in the supernatural realm had gradually declined, his name still resounded throughout the star dynasty.
 This dynasty that ruled the land, even if it was declining day by day, had not completely fallen. It was difficult to say whether Ying Hongyue would be able to lead Hongyue to occupy a place.
 "Yes!" Sun moxiian nodded hurriedly."I understand!"
 Next to sun moxian, there was a young woman carrying a long staff on her back. Her hair was tied up, and she looked extremely capable. At this moment, she also asked,""Master, I've heard that Silver Moon martial forest is powerful. However, there has been no warrior of the thousand class in recent years. Instead, there are many in the central region. Some of them are active in the superbattlefield. It is even said that there are warrior of the thousand class who have the potential to reach beyond the thousand class. Why did they decline so quickly?"
 She had heard that the Silver Moon martial forest was powerful. It wasn't just her master who had said it, but some of the older martial masters had also said it.
 However, as far as she knew, Silver Moon had not produced a warrior of the thousand tribes for many years. In the central continent, while it was rare to see a warrior of the thousand tribes, it was not as if they did not exist. She and her master had visited a few of them before, but none of them had come from Silver Moon.
 "The decline of Silvermoon martial arts ..."
 Sun Yifei shook his head helplessly and said,"Actually ... It's not really in decline! To be honest, it has something to do with us, which accelerated the decline. Back then, many of Silver moon's martial masters had the chance to advance to the thousand warrior class ... Many, not just one or two!"  "Back then, he was also hailed as the last madman of the Silver Moon martial forest! Be it me, the leader, or that Yuan Shuo, we were all extremely brutal during that period and killed many martial masters who had broken through the 100th level ..."
 "The Seven Swords of the Silver Moon, the three Spears of the Silver Moon, the Fist of the North and south, the King of Blades, the Thunderbolt kick, the mountain axe, the iron cloth ..."
 He gave examples of the Silver Moon elites from back then. Almost all of them had broken through 100 perfection, and even if they weren 't, they were almost there.
 Many, many times!
 It was a brilliant era, the last crazy era before the rise of the superpowers.
 Silver Moon martial forest was about to rise, but in the end ...... Sun Yifei sighed,"In the end, three of the seven Swords of the Silver Moon died at Yuan Shuo's hands, two of the four direction blade Kings were killed, and tie Buyi's physical body was destroyed by his five birds technique ..."
 Sun Yifei laughed and said,"this old man killed half of the Masters in the martial arts world!" As for the rest, me, the leader, and a few others, we've killed almost half of the powerhouses in the martial arts world ..."
 Thus, the Silver Moon martial forest declined!
 The few of them were dumbfounded!
 They really didn't know much about this.
  In the end, Silver Moon martial forest had been destroyed by them.
 "Then ... Then why hasn't Yuan Shuo been able to enter the Dou Qian class?"
 "He's too big-hearted!"
 Sun Yifei said coldly,"that guy cultivated the five birds technique and the momentum of five birds. Since ancient times, most martial masters focused on cultivating one force. He didn't cultivate the momentum of five birds and even fused the five birds!" I'm not surprised at all that this guy entered the warrior dimension and killed the three suns! If he could, he would definitely be at the top of the Qian warrior class. I think it's only natural that he could kill three suns with the five birds integration!"
 He thought highly of Yuan Shuo, or rather, no one dared to look down on the martial masters who had left the Silver Moon martial forest back then.
 He was an existence who had killed half a martial arts expert.
 A fellow who had fused the five birds and five Forces!
 Even Ying Hongyue, who was now high and mighty, would be slapping her own face if she were to ask him to say that Yuan Shuo was a good-for-nothing since he hadn't stepped into the Qian warrior stage.
 Who could break the hundred-fold fusion of the five birds and five Forces?

 Hou Xiaochen didn't protect Yuan Shuo just because he could explore the ruins. He also had a glimmer of hope that Yuan Shuo could advance to the warrior Qian level and not destroy the last hope of Silver Moon martial forest.
 "The five birds and five Forces ..."
 Sun moxian was a little speechless,'he really succeeded? I can't even fuse the second force, let alone the fifth force!"
 At this moment, he somewhat understood why his master was so serious.
 Such a person, even if he hadn't been in the Qianqian battle for many years and only entered the Qianqian battle today, should not be underestimated.
 He was at the great circle of the 100th level, so he deeply understood how difficult it was to step into the universe of fighters with one force.
 Don't even mention the five Forces!
 "Master, so when he killed the three suns, it was also true strength and not a trick?"
 "Of course!"
 "How could it be a trick?" sun Yifei replied in a deep voice. Without hard power, there was no such thing as trickery! Some of the supers in the central continent were arrogant and conceited. They thought that Yuan Shuo killing Broken Sky was a complete coincidence, an accident, a sneak attack ... Bullshit! Those guys, after obtaining power by luck, dare to look down on martial arts experts. Those people will not grow!"
  Even though he was a super, his words were full of disdain.
 He looked around and said in high spirits,""If I have the chance, I want to become a Martial Master! A Martial Master who had surpassed a thousand-man warrior! What late stage of three yang, so what? Mo Xian, remember this, a Martial Master has a much brighter future than a super!"
 A three yang advanced stage superpower saying such words would probably shake the superpower realm if it was spread.
 Sun moxian hurriedly nodded, but he couldn't help but ask,""Then ... Master, you ..."
 "Are you worried that I'll be killed by him?"
 Sun Yifei laughed,"I'm not an ordinary three suns super. Don't forget, I was also a Martial Master who almost became a Qian warrior!" In the central region, I've also killed a late stage three yang super ... It's not worth mentioning! In my eyes, Yuan Shuo is strong, but he's wasted so many years. I'm actually more eager to fight him with me. If he's strong enough to fight me, it'll be a real pity if he's killed by me easily!"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com His fighting spirit was lifted.
 He was looking forward to a battle with Yuan Shuo!
 "Master, who do you think is stronger, Yuan Shuo or Grandmaster yunshang?" sun moxiian asked again.
 Grandmaster yunshang was a top-notch Martial Master expert from the central region.
 On the supernatural battlefield, he killed a powerhouse at the peak of the sunlit realm and fought with a three-sun powerhouse. Although he did not kill the opponent, he injured the opponent and allowed the three-sun to escape.
 He was one of the few top martial masters in the central continent who could defeat the three suns, which gave some martial masters in the central continent a lot of hope and expectation.
 "Above the clouds ..."
 Sun Yifei thought for a moment and said,"a few years ago, Yun Shang attacked and injured that guy. After that, he has been in seclusion. Some people say that he might have found the way to go above thousand-fighting." As for Yuan Shuo, he has just entered the Dou Qian class not long ago, and his strength might be comparable to Yun Shang from a few years ago. Now, Yuan Shuo should not be his match. "
 That's good!
 Sun moxian was relieved because Yun Shang had only injured the early stage of three yang, but his master was in the late stage of three yang, and had even advanced to the Martial Master realm. In this case, Yuan Shuo might be strong, but he would probably find it difficult to defeat his master.
 The few of them stood beside the boundary stone and talked about the martial arts world. The cultivators of the central region also appeared in their mouths one by one.
 Three suns were the mainstream in the battle of thousands.
 Sunlight rarely mentioned it, and it was also rarely mentioned above three suns.
 After talking for a while and telling his disciples about his glory days, sun Yifei continued to step into the Silvermoon world.
 At this moment, he was heading straight for the transverse Canyon.
 He didn't go to the Silver City. He wanted to defeat or even kill Yuan Shuo in the Hengduan Canyon. He had lost there that year, and today, he wanted to climb back up in the Hengduan Canyon and get back his face.
  ……  White moon City.
 Hou Xiaochen sat in his office chair as he read through the messages. A moment later, he saw a message: "Sun Yifei and his three disciples have entered the Silvermoon Jie!"
 "Sun Yifei ..." He said.
 It's here!
 Hou Xiaochen furrowed his brows slightly. This was not someone to be trifled with, and he wondered if Hao lianchuan had the confidence to deal with him.
 As for Yuan Shuo, he had only been promoted for a short period of time, so he probably couldn't beat sun Yifei. Even if he had made rapid progress and reached the so-called peak of the thousand warrior realm, it would still be difficult for him to beat sun Yifei, who was also a Martial Master.
 On the other hand, Hao lianchuan had a higher chance of defeating or stopping sun Yifei with the fiery phoenix spear.
 Just as he was thinking, someone knocked on the door and Chief Steward Yu entered,""Minister, there's a message from the central. There's a riot in the neighboring beige province. The situation is urgent. We hope that Minister can take the origin divine weapon and go to beige province to suppress the riot!"
 Hou Xiaochen's eyes sharpened, but he quickly regained his calm and said,"Send a message back. Tell them that Hao lianchuan is leading a team to explore the ruins. There's no one in Whitemoon city, so I can't leave!"
 "Alright!"
 Chief Steward Yu responded and said in a low voice,""Yama's reincarnation King, Scarlet moon's purple Moon, hope to have a discussion with the Minister outside of Whitemoon city."
 "What are they afraid of?" hou Xiaochen chuckled.
 "I'm afraid the Minister will secretly attack!"
 Chief Yu smiled."They know very well how powerful the Minister is. So, they're trying their best to hold the Minister back and prevent him from appearing in the remains."
 This was how powerful hou Xiaochen was!
 The Samsara King and the red moon's leader, Zi Yue, had come together to stop hou Xiaochen from leaving the city.
 "Alright, tell them that I'll be waiting for them at the peak of white moon Mountain. Don't be afraid!"
 "Where's the half of the mountain?"he smiled.
 Fei Tian also had a leader in Silver Moon. He called himself Banshan and was extremely mysterious.
 "There's no information on Banshan. He hasn't appeared in front of anyone for a long time ... He's either injured and in seclusion, or ... He's about to advance!"
 Chief Steward Yu made such a judgment.
  Hou Xiaochen nodded his head slightly. There was indeed a chance of advancing.
 "Forget it, let's not care about him. If he has advanced, then there's nothing we can do. Fei Tian's way of doing things is even stranger than the Crimson Moon. He's indeed hard to grasp."
 After saying that, he looked in the direction of Silver City.
 After a moment of silence, he didn't look at it again.
 This time, Yuan Shuo's appearance had caused him to change some of his plans. He did not know how much of old demon Yuan's style Yuan Shuo still had.
 The old demon Yuan who had nearly exterminated the Silvermoon martial forest had now become more low-key.
 He could not judge Yuan Shuo's actual strength.
 Hou Xiaochen laughed, then looked towards the central region. The central region was in a mess, and even the night patrols were in a mess. Some people supported starting a war, some didn 't, some people wanted to defend, some people wanted to attack ... It was really chaotic!
 He didn't know if the star dynasty could still continue.
 If it completely collapsed, the 99 provinces in the world would be in chaos.

 Time passed by day by day.
 Silver City.
 Li Hao had been immersed in martial arts these days, practicing all night. He rarely went back to the big courtyard, and spent most of his time in the law enforcement building, practicing day and night.
 Ninth refinement, five birds technique, Shadowless Sword.
 He had been repeatedly cultivating these three secret skills. The nine-refinements force had now entered the fifth fold of layering. However, it was still not enough. When Liu Long had broken through to the perfection of 100, he could even reach the ninth fold.
 Liu Long's father had also been able to achieve nine-fold.
 Li Hao felt that it was far from enough. He was still far from it. Five stacks were really too little.
 Also, he was trying to figure out how to quickly switch between Shadowless Sword and the ninth-refinement force.
 Especially the ninth refinement force!
 When he used the nine forging force, he needed to use the nine forging force breathing technique. This also meant that the five birds technique and Shadowless Sword could only be used as a foil and could not be used together.
  This was not in line with Li Hao's expectations.
 At this moment, Li Hao was very concerned about each move. He pondered how to use them together.
 After an unknown amount of time, Li Hao thrust his sword forward and quickly drew it back.
 In the next moment, his breath turned into a sword and he spat out a mouthful of white smoke!
 The moment he exhaled, Li Hao tried the nine-fold forging technique, hoping to stack the five sword Qi He spat out in one breath. After the first sword Qi was successfully spat out, Li Hao instantly changed his breathing technique, but the second sword Qi exhaled a lonely breath.
 "Still no!"
 Li Hao frowned. The key was the lungs.
 If his lungs were strong enough to unlock the Super Lock, would he be able to store more Qi and continue the second sword?
 Now that he had formed a sword with his breath once, it was a little difficult to continue.
 The main problem was that his lungs were not strong enough.
 "Teacher said that the lungs are good for the spirit, and the bird spirit is good for the bird ..."
 In the five birds technique, the bird's force was related to the lungs and was of the metal element.
 "The five birds force corresponds to the five internal organs ... It's not necessary. It's just that teacher's five birds force has been fully mastered, so this is the best choice."
 Li Hao thought of himself.
 He had mastered a trace of the Earth's momentum. The earth belonged to the earth, and the earth corresponded to the spleen, which strengthened the qi and blood.
 Now, he began to hope to master the sword force. The sword was of the metal element, and metal should be the lung.
 Using sword force to replace bird force, was it the same principle?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Although he was thinking about it, Li Hao didn't dare to try it now. The sword was too sharp, and he would die if he was not careful.
 Moreover, he had not even entered the warrior's instinct.
 At the moment, what he needed to do more was to strengthen the terrain and condense his sword force. He didn't need to fuse the five Forces like his teacher. As long as the force of the earth and the sword force were fused, Li Hao would be satisfied.
 When the two forces were combined, Li Hao would be able to enter the thousand warrior class and even surpass Liu Long, who was also only formed by one force.
 Moreover, Li Hao's sword momentum was extraordinary.
 Up until now, he had only used his internal strength to form a sword. He hadn't actually succeeded in creating the real sword force yet. Li Hao was clear that the real sword force could only be created when blood was drawn!
 There was no sword without blood!
 Therefore, he had a chance to complete the condensation of the sword force in the ruins this time.
 With many thoughts in mind, Li Hao practiced for a while. He looked at the clock on the wall not far away, packed his things, and walked out of the basement.
 It was already dark outside.
 It was 12 o' clock.  12 am.
 His teacher had said that he would look for him in five days. It was the fifth day now, and it was already August 26th.
 The date for the relic exploration was set for August 28th.
 ……
 The yuan family.
 Li Hao didn't enter the house. He just waited in the yard.
 He looked on silently.
 It had been five days!
 His teacher wanted to nurture the heart fire ape. Would he be able to come out today?
 In the room, Wang Ming walked out yawning. He had been staying here for the past few days, mainly because he had merged the breathing technique into his instinct. He had circulated the breathing technique day and night without leaving.
 Wang Ming wanted to say something when he saw Li Hao, but Li Hao waved his hand and didn't say anything.
 Seeing this, Wang Ming could only remain silent.
 Over the past few days, he had come to know that Yuan Shuo seemed to be cultivating in seclusion. He had not even eaten his meals and had not left his study.
 Li Hao hadn't been here for a few days. He had suddenly come today, so he might be coming out of seclusion.
 The two of them sat in the courtyard and waited silently.
 The sky was still dark.
 There was no movement in the room. There was no inner strength or superpower. There was only silence.
 After an unknown period of time, the sky gradually brightened.
 At this moment, Liu Long arrived.
 p He brought Liu Yan along.  It was already the 26th, and the transverse Canyon was still thousands of miles away from the Silver City. They couldn't drive all the way there, and it would take at least a day to get there. If they didn't go now, they might miss the relic exploration.
 Seeing that Li Hao and Wang Ming were waiting in the courtyard, Liu Long nodded at them and silently stood to the side, waiting.
 Yuan Shuo had not appeared for a few days, and Liu Long had guessed that he might be searching for a way to break through.
 In this regard, Liu Long could only look up.
 He had just entered the universe and was still far from the next realm. Yuan Shuo, who had advanced only a few days earlier, had already begun to advance to the next realm.
 Unknown realm!
 The four people in the courtyard were all deep in their own thoughts as they waited for Yuan Shuo to come out of seclusion.
  ……
 In the room.
 Yuan Shuo, however, felt as if he was in a furnace.
 Indistinctly, a large ape appeared in his heart, extremely violent and struggling madly!
 Heart fire ape!
 With the heart as a furnace, the ape of the five birds was integrated. The ape was agile, but also violent.
 Divine intent had divine intent, which actually meant that Shi already had some consciousness.
 Under such circumstances, it would be extremely difficult to subdue the ape of the five birds and make it willingly take root in the heart.
 Yuan Shuo's heart was pounding.
 It was beating faster and faster!
