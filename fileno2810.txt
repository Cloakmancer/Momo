A smile appeared on his face. At this moment, he seemed a little unusual."In this chaos, there are life and death cultivators. Unfortunately, I've encountered too few of them. Fellow Daoist, how about you pass on a sense of life and death to me, and I'll give you another opportunity?"Frowning, Li Hao looked at the man and said while sitting cross-legged,""Senior, you want to understand my life and death? What kind of opportunity can senior give me?""Sky-stealing sun-shifting art!"The cultivator laughed."If you use life, death, Nirvana, or any other Daoist technique, you'll easily trigger the chaos lightning tribulation. This isn't a good thing and you're too big a target. I have a technique that can deceive the chaos!"The cultivator suddenly spoke arrogantly,"even in the chaos, it is difficult to detect!" Of course, chaos was too strong, and this technique was not strong enough. It would be difficult for it to be effective after the sixth rank. Furthermore, with every deception, the next one would be accumulated! If you don't go through one lightning tribulation, the next one will be the double lightning tribulation. If you don't go through two, then the third lightning tribulation will accumulate. One day, the lightning tribulations will overlap and break my spell. They will descend directly and kill you!"The sky-stealing sun-changing technique?Li Hao was surprised.He was also a little surprised.This person ... Was strange!I was cultivating well in the primordial chaos when a cultivator suddenly appeared out of nowhere. From the looks of it, he's most likely a sixth-rank cultivator. When I met him, he wanted me to teach him life and death, but he didn't teach me anything and instead taught me a technique!However, to be able to deceive the chaos ... This was at least a top-grade Dao technique.He could even deceive the primal Chaos lightning tribulation. Was that possible?"Fellow Daoist, you don't believe me?"The cultivator laughed. Suddenly, he waved his hand, and a wave of magical fluctuation headed straight for Li Hao. "Let's see if I can conceal my heaven pilfering power!"Li Hao originally wanted to avoid it, but his heart skipped a beat.Suddenly, he was enveloped by a special force.In just an instant ... The Tribulation lightning in the sky seemed to have lost its direction, and Li Hao seemed to have sensed a special domain fluctuation. This ... This was not daylight thief, but a special Tao technique domain!Dao domain!Li Hao was shocked. Up until today, he had seen many venerable sovereigns who knew this kind of Dao domain technique. In fact, there were some, such as the empty Nirvana world, the dark Demon territory of the dark Demon Ridge, and his own five elements domain ...Other than these, he didn't seem to have seen anyone else use it, not even the Tier 6 Scarlet cloud.Even if his domain wasn't perfect enough, it wouldn't be able to hide from the primal Chaos lightning tribulation.This person's Dao art had actually managed to conceal some of the primal Chaos lightning tribulation.This was still an external power. If he cultivated such a domain himself ... Perhaps he could really cover up the chaos.Li Hao's expression changed slightly.Cover the chaos!Terrifying!This person, even if he was at the sixth step, he was probably a peak existence among the sixth step. Where did this powerhouse come from?"Little fellow Daoist, are you interested in exchanging?"Li Hao looked at the man for a long time before he said in a deep voice,""If senior is interested, of course I'm willing!"Was it worth it?Of course it was worth it!The other party seemed to need the Dao of life and death, while he ... Not only needed a Tao technique, but also a Tao technique of a special domain. Li Hao needed it very much, but it was a little strange. It was very rare for him to change Tao techniques upon meeting.Even though this was the first time he met Kong Ji, he did not exchange these top mantras with him. Li Hao said,"it's just that my current state of advancement ...""I'm fine, I'm fine!"The Daoist smiled and said,"it's just a mere fourth-rank chaos lightning tribulation. Little Daoist, you can break it with a snap of your fingers after cultivating such a great Dao!" I'll wait for you!""Of course," he continued,"if you feel that it's too weak and that it's boring to pass the Tribulation, you can learn my Dao first. You can Steal the Sky and change the sun to accumulate lightning!"Li Hao laughed,"for what?"Wasn't he asking for trouble?The Daoist laughed again,'the lightning tribulation is used to kill people! I said, my Dao art is to steal the heavens and change the sun! Since it could be avoided, it could also be exchanged! As soon as you release your domain, you'll be able to resurrect your opponent and throw it over his head. If the primal Chaos lightning tribulation can't find you, can't it find someone else?"Li Hao's heart moved.It can even transplant flowers into trees?Then this Dao art was really not simple."Senior, what is the source of this technique?"Li Hao couldn't make a judgment. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The cultivator chuckled,"the Dao of origin?" The root of the problem is to ... Hide!"Li Hao was stunned.The cultivator laughed."In the early years, in order to hide myself, I thought hard and cultivated the Dao to hide myself. After a long time, I naturally learned it. The Dao is also created by man!""Whatever Dao people say it is, it is. If I say it is a hidden Dao, it is a hidden Dao."The Dao was created by man!Li Hao was stunned.This person ... Was another void ... No, another Daoist cultivator!He had been searching for a Daoist cultivator, but it was hard to find one. In the end, he met a void. Not long after, he met another one in the chaos.The Dao was created by man.This sentence gave Li Hao a different understanding. It was useless to say it without thinking. The key was that the other party seemed to have created a Dao himself, and it was this special Tao technique. He said that DAOs were created by humans, and when combined with Tao techniques, Li Hao instantly had many ideas."What do you think of the name?" the man asked with a smile."Name?""Yes, hide. Is the name unpleasant?"Li Hao was a little embarrassed. Was it unpleasant? It was unpleasant to hear!However, this seemed to be an original great Dao technique. It was not ordinary. Even though this person was at level six, Li Hao felt that he was extraordinary. He had encountered level six experts before, and he had never felt this way.It was dangerous!He was an extremely dangerous person!"Nice!"Li Hao smiled, and the cultivator smiled again.""It's good that it sounds good. Are you going to change your Tao technique now or after the tribulation? "Change now, I'll cover it up for you ... I don't dare to provoke a powerful divine retribution, but this is just a rank 4 divine retribution. I'll cover it up for you for a while, and you'll soon be able to comprehend some of my heaven pilfering sun changing technique. This will allow the divine retribution lightning to dissipate, and when you need it next time, you can accumulate it."

Chapter 2811 A Coincidental Encounter (3)
Thousands of thoughts ran through his mind.Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"senior, are you in a hurry?" If you're in a hurry ... You can first change your Daoist magic. ""I'm quite anxious!"The cultivator laughed,"I have many things to do. I'm busy. Someone doesn't want me to rest. It's very troublesome!" I have to go to Tian Fang's side early and see if I can find an opportunity. If I find it, I'll have to go!""Then ... You can change now."The Daoist didn't say anything. The power of a great Dao swept toward Li Hao. Li Hao was still a little hesitant, but soon, he chose to let go and let the power of the great Dao enter his body.In an instant, he seemed to have received countless messages.Sky-stealing sun-changing!This cultivator actually gave it to him just like that.He was so confident that he wasn't worried that Li Hao wouldn't give him the Enlightenment of life and death.Li Hao sensed for a while and made a general judgment. As someone who had sensed the path of a rank seven venerable sovereign, he could tell whether it was true or not. A moment later, a star appeared above Li Hao's head. It was the life and death Star!Above the star, the power of the two great DAOs merged and intertwined. Soon, a black and white River appeared in the void.The power of the great Dao emerged and gushed toward the Daoist.The middle-aged cultivator allowed the small river to flow into his body. He sensed it and frowned. Li Hao was alarmed. What's going on?He didn't fake it."It's alright ... Just a little lacking in flavor!"The cultivator shook his head and said,"it's barely alright!" "However, life and death ... Is a bit worse than what I expected. That's right. After all, you just entered rank four. Life and death isn't that simple. It's not just about reincarnation ... Of course, I don't cultivate this Dao, so I don't know much about it."After saying that, he smiled,"it's not bad. You've solved some of my urgent needs!" If I can reach Level 7, I'll come and talk to you again. If not ... Then forget it!"Then, he smiled."I'll be leaving now. You'd better leave immediately. There seems to be a group of sixth level venerable sovereigns rushing this way. Also, there seems to be two seventh level venerable sovereigns of the Crimson Moon who are passing by this way ..."Li Hao was both surprised and delighted. The red moon sovereign had come, and two level 7 ones at that!"Let's go!"The cultivator disappeared in an instant without any hesitation. Li Hao was slightly surprised.""May I ask for senior's name?""We've just met by chance, why are you asking for my name!"The cultivator's voice reverberated through the air, but he had already disappeared into the chaos.Strange!Li Hao was confused. He looked in the direction the Daoist disappeared in and felt even more puzzled. The other party didn't seem to be following him on purpose, and there was a high chance that they had truly met by chance. However ... The other party seemed to recognize him. This wasn't surprising, as it wasn't surprising that he would be able to recognize him after the primal Chaos lightning tribulation.However ... This kind of understanding didn't seem to be limited to just his identity. He changed his Tao technique and left.This daylight thief technique was extremely suitable for him. Most importantly, this Daoist technique was definitely not simple. It was a special Daoist technique similar to that of a Dao domain. It was even the kind that could allow one to reach rank seven!He's giving it to me?Life-and-death mantras were not simple, either. However, as that person had said, Li Hao was still too weak and did not have a deep enough understanding of life-and-death, so he had not yet perfected it. A true life-and-death mantras could even reach level nine with just the life-and-death Dao."Lord Marquis, let's go!"At this moment, Qian Wuliang was shocked. A group of level six cultivators! They must be venerable Emperor Hui long and the others.However, Red Moon and two other seventh-grade cultivators were here ... Why didn't they hurry and run?As for the fact that the person had left, he felt a lot more at ease. At that moment, he actually wanted to see through the person's heart. In the end, before he even looked at that person, it was as if his inner thoughts had been seen through. It was extremely terrifying!Li Hao nodded slightly, and a special Taoist connotation appeared on his body.In the blink of an eye, the dark clouds above them seemed to have lost their target. Even though Li Hao had only used the Taoist connotation a little, it was still covered."Absorb!"Li Hao took a deep breath and looked in the direction where the man had disappeared. He frowned in confusion. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  What a special Tao technique!At this time, second cat looked over and suddenly said,"He knows me!"Li Hao was stunned.He nodded slightly and said,"maybe!" This man ... Could he be a neo martial cultivator?"Qian Wuliang was surprised, a neo martial cultivator?How was that possible?If he was a neo martial cultivator, he wouldn't have introduced himself. Since he recognized Li Hao, he knew that the neo martial Silver Moon was one entity. Why didn't he reveal his identity directly, instead of his name?Second cat nodded his big head and said,"I don't know him, but it seems ... He might know me or big cat! He didn't reveal his identity ... I'm not sure who it is, but maybe it's a guy who doesn't fit with the mainstream neo martial arts?"Li Hao was slightly dazed for a moment. He glanced in that direction again and said after a long time,""He said that he had been hiding his strength. In the end, he comprehended this Tao technique ... If he was a neo martial artist, he should be at the sixth stage now. He should not be a nobody, but a well-known top venerable sovereign in neo martial arts!"At this time, he recalled the time when he followed Zhang an to travel around the new martial era and suddenly thought of someone.Li Hao felt a little strange."Is this ... The guy who has been opposing the Supreme human King?" he asked."Who is it?"Qian Wuliang was curious. Unlike Li Hao, he didn't know much about new martial arts.He wasn't too sure about these top experts.

Chapter 2812 Coincidental Encounter (3)
"A ... Strong person who's hard to say."A name appeared in his mind-Li Zhu!In the neo martial era, the biggest opponent of the human King in the early stage was the son of the Emperor of the earth, the king of the catacombs, Li Zhu!He had been hiding his identity and strength. Together with his father, the king of earth, they turned the entire yin-yang world into an experimental field to test some things. In the end, they raised an extremely powerful kun, which was the human King!When he killed new martial's last enemy, the heavenly Emperor, he died in battle with his father, two brothers, and four kings. In the end, he seemed to have been resurrected by the human King.This person was in neo martial, and the controversy was actually not small. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  It was not good to say whether it was right or wrong.As the human race's first great enemy, the king of the catacombs, countless humans had died because of him. However, in the end, he had died at the last moment to save the human race by killing the celestial Thearch ...He had never been on good terms with the Supreme martial artist and the others.Even after being resurrected, it was said that they were not very harmonious. The two sides were only United on the outside, but they did not like to pay much attention to the Supreme martial artist and the others on the inside.He had been wandering in the chaos.Was it him?He looked a little familiar ... But he was not quite the same as the king of the catacombs in his memory.However, he only saw the past and not the present. He wasn't sure if it was that person.At this moment, the lightning tribulation above Li Hao's head actually dissipated.Even Qian Wuliang was surprised by this powerful Tao technique.He had just taught it to Li Hao, and Li Hao had only learned a little, but the chaos lightning tribulation had immediately dissipated. This ... Was inconceivable.Everyone in the primordial chaos feared the primal Chaos lightning tribulation.Li Hao said,"it didn't dissipate. It just accumulated until the next one. However, an expert is coming. It's best not to undergo the Tribulation here. Let's go!""Lord Marquis has advanced in rank?""Soon!"He still hasn't advanced?Qian Wuliang was surprised. Li Hao explained,"Just one more step!"​ The last step.Life and death, merge and recover.The fusion of two stars!At this moment, he had not officially transformed yet, but it was almost there. With the Dao techniques that this person had imparted to him, he could be braver and directly merge with it. However, if there were experts passing by, he would avoid them first.He quickly left with his men, not daring to stay any longer.……At the same time.The cultivator who had disappeared earlier was now rushing towards the sky. Death Qi emerged from his body and he smiled."The aura of death is too strong ... I'll convert as much as I can, but there's too little life force. I might need some life force to make up for it!"No matter what, even though the new king of Silvermoon was too weak and his comprehension of life and death was insufficient, he was still able to resolve his current urgent situation.Not bad!The martial King had asked him to look for him, but he didn't have to go out of his way to find him. He was considered lucky to have met him.Of course, there was no need for more contact. A guy who had quickly entered the 4th rank, did he need to say anything?I'm only at the sixth step!"When I'm sleepy, I'll give you a pillow!"The Daoist laughed, and the power of death dissipated a lot. It was a good thing that something happened in Tian Fang. Tian Fang's great Dao universe might not be real ... This Silver Moon King might be here because of Silver moon's great Dao.Of course, this was not important."The important thing is that a group of world Lords will rush to Tian Fang. As for me ... I might be able to enter Level 7 here!As for going to the light ... Go to the light, my ass.Just wait here!He would wait until the experts of the divine light plane arrived. If he couldn't wait, then so be it. Wasn't the Son of God of light here?He could make contact with it."Target, kill a rank-7!"The Daoist said quietly. The next moment, a smile appeared on his face. In an instant, his aura disappeared. The moment he approached tianfang, he was like dust and suddenly merged into tianfang world, leaving no trace.……On this day, a large number of experts were rushing to the sky.Li Hao, on the other hand, was the exact opposite. He left Tian Fang and headed toward the Crimson Moon region.We'll talk about other things after we pick up those people.After a long time away from Tian Fang, Li Hao sat down cross-legged again. Only now did he have the energy to comprehend more things, including the Tao technique that he had exchanged with the Daoist."Stealing the sky and changing the sun ...""This ..."The more Li Hao comprehended, the more surprised he was.This Dao art was not ordinary.In the past, he had never come into contact with it. It was not as simple as breath control or concealment. Li Hao knew these too, but he couldn't have used them to cover up the chaotic mysteries of heaven.However, this method could.Li Hao sensed it carefully and came to a conclusion. This mantra ... Did not originate from the source world. No wonder Li Hao could not sense the aura of the source. He was familiar with the aura of the source.This Daoist magic ... Was rooted in the primordial chaos!"This person is a rogue cultivator!"Li Hao was a little surprised. Was this the Li Zhu he had guessed?If so, wasn't Lizhu an origin realm cultivator?However, this technique seemed to have been separated from the origin. It was not rooted in the great Dao of the origin universe, but in the great Dao of chaos, forming a Dao domain. It was somewhat similar to Li Hao's River ... A self-created River. Of course, there might be some differences.However, their general goal should be the same as Li Hao 's.He created the world and his domain.The daylight thief technique used this characteristic to conceal one's connection with the chaos, isolating one from the chaos and cutting off one's connection with the Dao of chaos, thus avoiding the chaos lightning tribulation."The root of the lightning tribulation is that I have a connection with chaos?"

2813 Chapter 464
Li Hao thought for a moment. It should be.Back in Silver Moon, he had also been struck by the lightning tribulation, but it had not been so frequent. He had been struck as soon as he used time.At that time, the Silver Moon was struck by the lightning tribulation, and the Stargate was about to open. Some of the lightning had infiltrated the Silver Moon, causing the chaos lightning tribulation to enter.In other words, it was because he had formed a connection with the chaos at that time, causing the power of time to overflow into the chaos, so he was struck ..."Does that mean that as long as I completely block time within my domain, the lightning tribulation won't actually strike me?"Many thoughts appeared in his mind.The other party's mantras were powerful, but more importantly, they reminded Li Hao of something deeper that allowed him to avoid being struck by the chaos lightning tribulation.It was still a problem of the overflowing power of time in the long river.Back then, he had used second cat and the Stargate to block both ends. It seemed to be able to cover it up.However, it was not enough.The entire River was seeping out, and the isolation was not tight enough."Therefore, the long river is still not closed enough! I should merge my domain into the river and comprehend the Dao of all kinds of divine text. The divine text should become my domain and completely seal the entire River!""It just so happens that I need to comprehend more DAOs so that more stars can appear. 360 DAOs aren't enough. I need to comprehend more DAOs to revive the great destruction and strengthen it. At the same time, I need to perfect the entire Chang He heaven and earth!"This person's mantras made Li Hao firm up his decision. This was also his previous plan, but he had not been sure whether it could really isolate chaos.Now, he had proven to Li Hao that he could!As long as you cut off the connection with chaos, the lightning tribulation would not find you. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "If it's really the one from neo martial arts, then it's interesting. The Tao techniques of these top powerhouses of neo martial arts are not as weak as imagined!"Li Hao was still a little surprised.Neo martial had broken some of his own ideas.Not to mention the neo martial human King, in the eyes of outsiders, the neo martial powerhouses did not have a deep enough understanding of the Dao.However, the Supreme Being's book of Dao was the unification of 10000 DAOs.It was the longevity sword of the sword Saint, the integration of 10000 DAOs!The neo martial human King was at least a Yin Yang integration!Also, if this person was Lizhu ... He would have been separated from the neo martial origin and entered the chaos to cultivate the chaos mixed Dao. He would feel like Li Hao, who was perfecting his own small world. Dao domain!This person's Tao technique was definitely not weak. It was much stronger than the level 6 spells that Li Hao had seen.This ... Wasn't it said that the strong practitioners of neo martial arts couldn't comprehend the great Dao?Li Hao shook his head and looked at second cat, then Qian Wuliang, and finally black Panther ... Who said these guys couldn't do it?He had yet to see the blood Emperor and the others.These people might not be ordinary.The neo martial world was really unusual.Not to mention Level Seven, these people had entered level six. According to the time, they had entered the chaos for more than a thousand years. Kong Ji was also a thousand years old. Didn't that mean that they were about the same age as Kong Ji? "The heavens have misled me!"Li Hao suddenly said.The feeling that celestial pole gave him was that neo martial's venerable sovereign's comprehension of the great Dao was very bad. There was no special great Dao Comprehension. It was just a reckless and reckless one!Of course, he had traveled to neo martial arts before and had a little similar feeling.But at this moment, Li Hao's thoughts changed.What he saw might not be true.What's more, he had only followed Zhang an's past to see it. Zhang an was just a small figure at that time, and there were some things that he couldn't see through.Including his perception of the neo martial human King, perhaps he was also wrong.The feeling that neo martial human King gave him was impulsive, reckless, and crazy ...However, the integration of the Dao of yin and yang was not something a crazy cultivator could do.Perhaps, he still had some prejudice.There was also the sun god ... Back then, before neo martial appeared in the chaos, it was probably close to rank-7. Now that it had reached rank-7, it might have its own extraordinary power.And in Li Hao's eyes, these people were all boorish.Was that really the case?Many thoughts surfaced in Li Hao's mind, but he stopped thinking about it. They would meet sooner or later.At this moment, Li Hao had officially entered the fourth step.The Nirvana domain emerged.In the river of life and death, the two stars began to merge. At the same time, a special physical force emerged from Li Hao's body, and Chi Yun's corpse beside him began to shatter. The already shattered corpse's condensed energy also began to shatter and fuse with the river.Completing his official advancement with the power of the sixth step would save Li Hao a lot of time.A large amount of fire-elemental power merged into Li Hao's great Dao.In his mind, there was also a saying that said awkwardly,"created by man."Didn't this mean that time was actually created by humans?Be it time, space, life or death ... Were all created by humans?Wasn't it something he was born with?Li Hao kept thinking. It wasn't because he thought of a scheme, but because he thought that his Dao of time might really be incomplete and lacking in many things. This might just be a Foundation.Some people had comprehended time and laid a Foundation. As for how they would build the building next, it would be up to them.The foundation was very important, but how to build the building, how to build it, whether it would be a villa or a bungalow, whether it would be a high-rise building or a small thatched house, it all depended on oneself.Whether it was life or death, or other things, they were all foundations. He was perfecting them bit by bit, building a house bit by bit."Compared to them, I'm still lacking by a lot!"Compared to Lizhu, Wushan, and even Kong Ji, he was still lacking.

Chapter 2814 Coincidental Encounter (3)_6
If these people were to go to Dao chess, even the weakest one, Kong Ji, might be able to go more than 6000 steps. Needless to say, Wu Shan, and the Daoist just now might not have gone any less than Wu Shan. These people might all have the chance to enter the seventh step.But the current Li Hao was actually not enough.He was still a little lacking.He had a lot of perception of Dao, but it was not deep enough, and his Foundation was still lacking. It would be difficult for him to reach Level Seven now, and the fire elemental power he borrowed earlier made Li Hao even more certain that he was only a pseudo-Level Seven!A true grade 7 was definitely not like that.In the long river, the two stars intertwined and gradually began to merge. A large amount of energy was consumed, and a part of it spilled out. However, it wasn't wasted at all. Black Panther and Qian Wuliang didn't refuse any of it, and they ate as much as it spilled out.The power of a sixth stage venerable sovereign was a great treasure to them.Even though Li Hao had expelled the impurities, they still enjoyed it.After a long time.BOOM!A loud sound rang out, and the river trembled violently for a while. The stars shone brightly, and the broken bridges of life and death were successfully built one by one, quickly recovering.The length of the river also expanded rapidly.It seemed to penetrate the world!In the river, the power of destruction and the power of death seemed to blend, but the power of recovery was somewhat weak. At least a blade of grass could grow out of the void, but Li Hao tried ... But he couldn't even grow a blade of grass.The power of recovery entered his body ... Li Hao tried, but the next moment, he shook his head.He had used up his resuscitation ability to recover the other energy he had used, but it was not as good as he had expected. It was far from what Kong Ji had done last time, when he had used up his rank 5 power and could only recover the power of a pseudo-rank 7."I still haven't comprehended enough ... I need to continue getting stronger!"Li Hao thought to himself. Last time in Dao chess, he had comprehended many great DAOs. Last time, he was afraid that he would bite off more than he could chew. This time, he should condense more great Dao stars.Then, they would be gathered into Holy prose, creating a huge comprehensive territory in the long river.This was the embryonic form of a world!"DAOs are all created by man. The world ... Is also created by man! The Dao universe is also ..."He understood this more than Kong Ji.Even if this sentence came from Wushan's mouth and he had never heard of it before, it did not matter. He knew that the universe of the great path was born from the comprehension of people. This was because Silver moon's universe of the great path and the current dual-path universe were most likely from the sword venerable.At least, a part of it came from the comprehension of the sword venerable.The other part ... Might be from Zhan Tiandi!For example, the most important part, time. Li Hao suspected that Zhan Tiandi's enlightenment might have condensed into a time star. The reason why two cats kept holding it was not just to recall the past, but also to sense something.As for the long river of the great path, it should have been formed by the comprehension of Sword Saint.These people were not ordinary.Li Hao's comprehension was all in the river of life and death, but there was a huge gap between him and the universe of the great path. Even though venerable the sword was only at the sixth level, Li Hao had already reached the fourth level. Li Hao increasingly felt that his comprehension of the great path might not be as deep as these people.His only strength was that his Foundation was not bad, and he was deepening his foundation bit by bit.After a while, Li Hao's body shook!A majestic power swept out in all directions, but it was quickly swallowed by the Nirvana domain and quieted down.His powerful physical strength merged into the river of life and death.The power of the river started to surround Li Hao again.The river that was outside suddenly disappeared. The next moment, it merged into Li Hao's body and ran through it like a blood vessel. The two stars of Life, death, and Nirvana that had just merged separated again, and a vague connection was established.The two stars suddenly appeared in Li Hao's eyes, one on the left and one on the right.The left eye was life and death, while the right eye was resuscitated.Qian Wuliang looked at Li Hao again ... And his heart palpitated even more.  p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The Black Panther, on the other hand, was very excited. It had sensed Li Hao's change.Soon, Li Hao's aura changed from vigorous to faintly discernible, similar to that of the cultivator from before.It was more mysterious and didn't seem to be mixed with the chaos."Tier 4!"Li Hao laughed and let out a long breath.Even though it wasn't a Yin Yang advancement, he was still extremely satisfied.Middle-stage venerable sovereign!In this way, he had more confidence. Even without the power of time, he could barely stand on the chaos. As long as he did not provoke those high-leveled venerable sovereigns, he could at least run away if he encountered a sixth-level venerable sovereign, not one like Lizhu or Kong Ji.……Just as Li Hao had officially entered the 4th step and was rushing toward the red moon ...The Skylands world.Two powerful pressures spread out outside the world. The two high-level venerable sovereigns from the red moon had arrived.On the other side, there was also a powerful pressure that appeared, like the light of the sun.The divine light plane had also sent a top-notch venerable sovereign!There seemed to be other Lords of major worlds around, but they did not show their might. Most of them came from seventh-rank major worlds. Under normal circumstances, a seventh-rank major world could produce one or two seventh-rank venerable sovereigns, world Lords, or great Dao Masters.Three were born in the neo martial world. The rank seven sun god was considered special. In a rank seven world, he had walked his own path and became an independent rank seven who was the master of the world and the great Dao."Wu Shan, open the realm gate!" Someone suddenly said.The voice came from the light Supreme Emperor on the other side. He was not the Lord of Light. The moment the voice rang out, all the top powerhouses knew that it was the brilliant sun Supreme Emperor of the divine light realm.He was also the venerable sovereign who had fought the most outside battles in the world of light. The light path of the world of light was different, there was more than one type. This person's light path was more inclined to the great sun radiance, and it was mixed with many offensive paths.Within the Skylands world.Wu Shan smiled. Yao yang was here.On Hong Yue's side, Ji Huo and Hong Yu came. Around them, there were several seventh rank venerable sovereigns from other great worlds.At this moment, they were all waiting for him to open the realm gate.In addition ... There seemed to be a sixth level venerable sovereign who had come earlier. His means were not weak. He had actually integrated into the wall of the world and hidden within it. He did not know what kind of divine being he was, but he could not be underestimated.Tian Fang moved, and sure enough, everyone appeared.He looked at these venerable sovereigns and didn't say anything. He wasn't in a hurry to open the realm gate either. These guys could break through it, but they just didn't want to fight with him now.Wu Shan was thinking about something.In the barrier of the macro world, a cultivator who had turned into dust was also scanning the area. Finally, his eyes fell on Hong Yue and the other venerable sovereigns. Soon, he looked away.The rank seven opportunity wasn't with these two.He had to find a Type 7 world Lord!At the same time, in the dark Demon Ridge, a person hurriedly walked out. His aura was still somewhat chaotic, and his Tier 6 strength had not yet stabilized. He looked at the sky and laughed.Something interesting was about to happen!Senior brilliant sun had also come ... Unfortunately, Li Hao had left. But even if he hadn 't, this wasn't his battlefield anymore. Here, Tier 6 players could try their luck, while tier 7 players were the main force. Tier 8 players might come.The sixth rank was only the entrance to this turmoil."I didn't get to Level 6 so quickly in vain!"Kong Ji laughed and quickly flew towards a realm gate. Since Yao yang was here, it was better to meet up with him. A group of Level 7s was a little scary.Although the tianfang great Dao universe won't open ... I can still observe the destruction of a great world.This time, if a few rank seven masters didn't die, they would be letting everyone down.

The sky shook.Li Hao didn't care about this anymore and moved forward.He continued forward. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ This time, he avoided everyone, no longer hunted any strong men, and no longer cared about venerable Dragon Emperor and the others. There was only one purpose for this trip, and that was to bring the other venerable sovereigns back.If they could bring back Heaven's Fate and King Huai, then they would. If they really couldn't ... Then there was no other way.He had tried his best!​ In order to meet up with neo martial, he had already done everything he could.Perhaps neo martial didn't need to do this, and Supreme and the others might have their own goals, but Li Hao didn't care. He only knew that he knew Heaven's Fate, and the Heaven's Fate clone had helped him a few times.Since that was the case, if the other party was in danger, he would still have to find a way to save them.She did her best and had no regrets.Tian Jian and the others were scattered in tianfang, but he knew their whereabouts. Lin Hongyu and the others were scattered in the chaos, and he had arranged for them to leave ... Li Hao still had to bring them back.As for whether they would split up or act together after they were brought back, that would be up to them.A fourth stage venerable sovereign was not considered weak.Besides, Qian Wuliang, Heibao, and ermao were all second level venerable sovereigns. If they could join Lin Hongyu and the others, they would have more venerable sovereigns.With a large number of experts being led away, as long as they did not encounter experts from major worlds or medium-level worlds, they would be able to fight with all their might.The speed of a fourth stage venerable sovereign was still extremely fast.Last time, it had taken him a month to reach the place where Silver Moon had appeared.This time, he had even cultivated for a few days in between. However, it had only taken him 12 days to reach the place he had been at the last time, and it had only taken him seven or eight days to travel. This was the difference between a Tier 4 and a Tier 1. The difference in speed was huge.Of course, it was almost impossible to see in the chaos. The chaos was boundless, and no matter how fast you were, you would only be moving like an ant from above.He couldn't tear space here.The chaos was a huge space, and there was nothing that could be torn apart. Even a seventh level venerable sovereign could only travel in this space.It wasn't like in the small world where he could tear space apart and instantly travel.These were all just the inner parts of the world.Chaos was a single entity.There was no left or right, no North, South, east or west ...Of course, with cultivators and living beings, all of this was naturally there. At least, it was on the map.Li Hao headed north.The Crimson Moon region was located in the North.……It was a battleship that was moving very slowly.His speed, which was originally comparable to a rank four venerable sovereign, was now extremely slow. Empyrean terminus and King Huai didn't even chat much.Heaven's Fate sensed the message sent by his clone ... It was better to wait, to continue waiting.In fact, Heaven's Fate himself also felt the danger.King Huai was the same.The strength of the two weak venerable sovereigns was a little weak, but they had survived from the complicated environment of new martial arts until now. They were not the direct descendants of the human King, but they could still live well. These people, without exception, were all human elites.Li Hao, who had wandered around new martial arts before, knew very well that new martial arts 'environment was much worse than Silver Moon' s.Those who opposed the human ruler were almost all killed ... Anyone who could survive was not simple. Those who were not from the direct line of descent could survive and advance to venerable sovereign ... They were even more extraordinary.These days, King Huai had not said a word, but it did not mean that he was waiting to be killed.The atmosphere seemed to be a little depressing.He had already determined that there might have been a mistake. Zhi Zun's original plan might have been to catch some small fish, or to catch some sixth-rank ones. That would have been good enough. After all, seventh-rank ones were not as common as cabbages.There were only five advanced venerable sovereigns in the entire Red Moon, including the red moon master.But now, Silvermoon had kept them waiting and refused to meet up with them.There was no news from the Grandmaster's side either. The so-called document that the celestial pole had brought to the Silver Moon King had also not moved ... This meant that the Grandmaster was also making them wait!Seventh rank!At this moment, King Huai made a judgment in his heart. We might have been targeted by a seventh step.On new martial arts 'side, the human King was alone outside, looking for opportunities. He might not be nearby.Emperor Cang brought along a great world and could not appear casually. The moment he appeared, he might face a thunderous attack.The sun god was the only mobile Force among the tier seven neo martial artists.Everyone knew this, and since they all knew ... Sun god might not be able to escape now. In addition, he had been injured by the red moon master many years ago, so sun god was still recovering most of the time.The Supreme martial artist might have gone too far this time.However, under normal circumstances, a few small fries like him would not have lured a seventh level venerable sovereign to watch over them. There were too many things to do for a seventh level venerable sovereign, and it was actually very dangerous to take the risk of watching them.Was he not afraid that neo martial would kill one at all costs?So, the change might have come from Silver Moon.Otherwise, why would Silver Moon make his side wait?"Silver Moon ... Great Dao universe ... Silver Moon King ..."It was possible that Silvermoon's great Dao universe had been exposed!He thought to himself that a great path universe was enough to attract a level Seven. In addition, Silver Moon was a new martial artist. If silver Moon appeared to be close to them, it was very likely to attract the attention of the Crimson Moon."The Silver Moon King ... There's a high chance that someone managed to figure out his whereabouts and purpose while he was approaching us. He even caught the attention of the Crimson Moon ... That's why we're waiting here!"King Huai had countless thoughts.He glanced at the celestial pole. The celestial pole looked lazy. King Huai knew that this old senior of his was actually very nervous.

2816 Chapter 465
He was the son of Emperor Xi, a Heavenly King expert who appeared in the early stages of the new martial era. The other Heavenly Kings were almost all killed, but this one had become an Emperor. At that time, his father was rumored to be dead, and no one was protecting him.He was acting crazy and even the human King was too lazy to kill him.It was said that the celestial pole was lazy, afraid of death, and timid ... King Huai had never thought so."Senior celestial pole ... We might have to save ourselves."He sent a voice transmission and even encrypted it."A Supreme martial artist might not be reliable!"“……”Heaven's Fate didn't make a sound or respond. These words were overheard by the Supreme martial artist. We're all going to be in trouble. We won't do anything to you on the surface, but we'll definitely torment you in secret."There's a high probability of a tier 7 stalker!"There's nothing wrong with that!In fact, Heaven's Fate thought the same way."We're bait on the surface, and it's hard to escape ... The fish caught by a Supreme martial artist is a little too big. We only have two sixth-rank martial artists on our side at the moment, and the Supreme martial artist's clone ... Is at most sixth-rank! There might be one more behind us. Even if there wasn't one before, there might be one now. The only one who would dare to fight against a seventh-rank expert with the strength of a sixth-rank expert is venerable the sword!"Heaven's Fate still didn't respond, but it agreed with his judgment.Neo martial artists knew neo martial artists. There was a huge difference between a sixth-rank and a seventh-rank, and to be able to fight against a seventh-rank, there was a high probability that not even Sword Saint could do it. However, to be able to hurt a seventh-rank and fight with a seventh-rank for a short period of time, among the sixth-rank, except for Sword Saint, there was almost no one who could do it head-on.It was a frontal attack, not a scheme.In terms of calculation, a Supreme Master had many tricks up his sleeve. It was even possible for him to reach the sixth rank. However, in a direct attack, only Sword Master could do it."In the early years, Sword Saint couldn't last long. Even if he is better now ... He can't keep bursting out. Therefore, he should be able to fight against a seventh-rank for a short time, but he can't do it for a long time.""At present, the Supreme martial artist shouldn't be able to mobilize any manpower to hunt down the seventh-rank beasts. Otherwise, he would have taken action long ago! Something might have happened. The human King is not nearby and Emperor Cang can not leave. Sun god might be in seclusion or has gone out ... In short, we can't deal with a tier 7 now!""I know. Cut the crap and get straight to the point!""Run!"King Huai sent a voice transmission,"we can't wait anymore. We have to run!" Right now, this Type 7 powerhouse was not making a move. It was possible that he was waiting for the Silver Moon King! It's either for the great Dao universe or for the Silver Moon world ... The red moon is waiting for them to meet up with us. The moment the Silver Moon appears, it's the moment the level 7 experts attack!""You and I both know that they're not far from us."Tian Ji's expression didn't change. It wasn't far, but his clone was actually quite close to him.But how could he run?We're a stage two and a stage three, and we're clearly existing in the chaos. There's nothing to hide in the chaos, so unless there's a world around, they don't dare to enter rashly. Otherwise, they'll be walking into a trap. Under the eyes of a tier 7, it would be very difficult to escape."If we run, that Level 7 will definitely make a move ... Or follow us!""If I could run, I would have done so long ago. Do you think you're the only one who thought of running?"Who are you looking down on?I also want to run!King Huai didn't care what he said and continued to transmit his voice,"The sword Saint can hold them off for a while. Once we run, that person will attack, and the sword Saint will also have to attack ... We will quickly gather with the Silvermoon world. The Silver Moon King and the others were able to get close to us without being discovered, so there is a high chance that they did not bring the Silvermoon world with them!""Maybe it's just a venerable sovereign-level cultivator ... The great path universe shouldn't be here, but if it's a Dao master, there must be a Dao River. Let's quickly merge into the Dao River and expel the origin aura from our bodies ... The origin aura is too strong. This is the key to locking us in.""After we merge, we'll escape together ..."Tian Ji frowned. It sounded simple, but the premise was that venerable sword could block the other party for a while. Secondly, they could escape the following pursuit.There was also another point. The Silver Moon world had to have a great path universe. The Silver Moon King had to be here. Otherwise, without a Dao River, there would be no way to fuse the origin aura of the neo martial arts. Because the great path aura of a level Seven top-tier great path universe was very rich, it was not something the Silver Moon could compare to.If the aura of the origin was not completely eliminated, it would be very difficult to escape his pursuit.King Huai didn't care. He continued to transmit his voice,"We can only abandon your clone and let it drive the warship away! Even if the other party repels venerable sword and continues to pursue us, we still have a 50% chance of survival if we choose one!""That thing on your body might be a clone of a Supreme martial artist. If you really ... Leave your clone behind, we'll have to choose one out of the three. Our chances of survival will be as high as 70%!""What about the target?"Heaven's Fate asked.King Huai transmitted his voice."This is near the Crimson Moon world. Recently, because the human King killed the Master of Darkness, I don't know exactly how many major worlds there are in the Crimson Moon region, but I know that there are as many as nine. After destroying two, there are five other major worlds besides new martial and the Crimson Moon! And now, four of them are near the Crimson Moon, and there are many medium and small worlds there. Let's ... Go there!"The celestial pole was gasping. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ F * ck!Is he crazy?He understood what King Huai meant.It was hard to hide in the chaos.What to do?He could only go to the enemy's belly. Many worlds had been surrounding the Crimson Moon world recently, and there were many great worlds.The other world was surrounded by more people, cultivators, and venerable sovereigns ... In order to win over allies, the Crimson Moon world also gave up using the Crimson Moon great Dao universe to cover all the other worlds.

2817 Chapter 465
Otherwise, it wouldn't be an Alliance but a rule.At the very least, he had to make his intentions clear.I, Red Moon, am here to form an alliance with you, not to rule you.Moreover, once they went into that world, whether they escaped into the world or wandered around the chaos near the world, it would be difficult for Hong Yue to track them. This was because Hong Yue's venerable sovereigns could not easily enter other worlds, otherwise, it would be an invasion.We're here to form an alliance, not to be invaded by you.There was indeed an opportunity for survival.However ... Once the Alliance was officially formed, the red moon might do a large-scale investigation, and the Alliance worlds might loosen their restrictions. By then, they would be walking into the trap!"Are you sure?""I'm sure!"King Huai nodded with certainty.Heaven's Fate was speechless and only replied after a long while,""Alright, to be honest, I actually agree with your idea! However, I'm more afraid of something ... You know what?""I know."King Huai sighed."You're afraid that the human King will suddenly come. He won't have time to distinguish anything. He'll come with a blade, and a blade will create a world. If we hide in any world...We'll be gone with a crack!" Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ That's right. There were definitely threats on Hong Yue's side, but Hong Yue usually wouldn't do anything rash at her doorstep.What was there to be afraid of?He was afraid that the human King had arrived. The human King had always been nearby. Now that many worlds had gathered, the human King might have smelled it and found an opportunity to charge in. With a single slash, who knew who would be killed?Heaven's Fate was also helpless. 'Yes, I'm actually afraid of this too.'"We can only gamble!"King Huai transmitted his voice again."The gambling human King isn't nearby. Otherwise, with a seventh-tier cultivator watching us, he would've killed his way here long ago if he was very close. Why would he wait until now?"The two of them were discussing. At this time, they began to discuss whether the human King was nearby.We'll be safer if he's not here.The human King's ability to steal was still extremely powerful.As for getting lost, that wasn't important. As long as he saw the enemy's nest, he wouldn't care which nest it was. He would kill it first. The human King didn't believe in alerting the enemy, but that there were only so many enemies. Killing one meant one less enemy.He wasn't afraid of beating the grass and alerting the snake!One less person meant one less danger."Let's put aside the general strategy and general direction for now. The human King believes that it's impossible for you to give birth to countless experts out of thin air. I've killed one, but you'll definitely need a long time to be born."Alright!"The celestial pole didn't have any other choice. It wasn't that they didn't trust the Autarch, but because they did, they had chosen to act as bait. However, the fact that the net had not been pulled in could only mean that something had gone wrong.With the appearance of a level Seven, neo martial artists were not prepared to kill a level Seven venerable sovereign ... Or they might have the capital, but they might have gone to other places or set their eyes on other great worlds. In any case, they could only put their side aside for now.Since that was the case, he would save himself.As for whether or not the plan would be broken, it was not important. New martial arts did not have a fixed plan. They had to adapt to the situation. As long as the higher-ups did not give orders that they had to complete it, they could do whatever they wanted. If something went wrong, Supreme would bear the consequences himself."I'll think of a way to send a message to my clone and have them get ready to meet up at any time! After we meet up, we'll head straight for the Crimson Moon world!"Celestial pole quickly transmitted his voice."A Supreme Being's clone ... If it really exists, then throw it away. It's even more dangerous to bring it along!"King Huai nodded.Not bad!He had to lose it. Otherwise, if the aura was too strong, and it was only a clone, it would be easy for experts to lock onto it."In addition, as far as I know, after the destruction of The Dark World, a few major worlds gathered around the Crimson Moon. One is the Dark Moon world, the other is the endless sky World, and the other is the cangjiang world ... These major worlds are still extremely dangerous.""However, there's a trashy great world ..."Heaven's Fate understood.Which great world was trashier?Of course there was.The worst was that before the human King killed the Master of Darkness, he had been tracking the human King. Later, he killed a Dao master of a major world, who was only a sixth stage venerable sovereign, but he was killed by the human King.​ There were only two top tier 6 combatants in this world. One was a path master, and the other was a world Lord. In the end, the path master was struck to death. The world Lord was so frightened that he hurriedly took the world and ran toward the red moon.The world was still there. Although the master of the great Dao had been struck to death, the great Dao universe probably still existed ... But it was probably badly injured. Now, the world Master might be repairing it.This place was the least heavily guarded and also the safest.Because the great Dao universe was damaged, even if he hid in the other party's world, the other party might not be able to detect him in a short time. Furthermore, there would definitely be many outsiders.Why?The great Dao universe might still exist, but a sector Lord only had the power of a peak stage six. Would some stage six experts be tempted?He would definitely move!Of course, because he was talking to Hong Yue about the Alliance, ordinary people didn't dare to act recklessly for fear of being targeted by Hong Yue. However, even Hong Yue herself might be targeted. Now, it depended on whether this sixth-level master of a major world would choose to integrate into Hong Yue directly or if Hong Yue would support him to Annex the great path universe and repair it. Whether he could advance to the seventh level and become Hong Yue's loyal little brother.However, Heaven's Fate and the others believed that this place must be very chaotic.There were many outsiders.They were not sure about Tian Fang's side. Even if they knew, they felt that many people would not dare to go because the level there was too high. The people fighting there were a group of advanced venerable sovereigns. On the other hand, there might be some rank four people who wanted to take advantage of the situation.

"You mean the forest world?""Right!"King Huai's eyes revealed a hint of a smile."This is the one! It was a weak macro world to begin with, and its Dao master had been killed by the human King. Even if the great Dao universe was not destroyed, it was still in turmoil. All sides coveted it, and it was in chaos! In the world, the world Lord must be stabilizing the great path universe, and the other venerable sovereigns were also affected. Going to their house at this time was equivalent to opening their doors ... In order to win them over, Hong Yue would not search directly, at least on the surface. Otherwise, how could she win over allies? Even if they know we've entered ... They won't send too powerful existences to search for us!"Heaven's Fate nodded again.It made sense.There's nothing wrong with that!The premise was that the human Emperor didn't go. Yes, with this premise, nothing else was important.This place was a good place to hide."Then let's go there?""Go to this place!"The two of them instantly had a direction in mind, but ... Would Silver Moon be willing to run with them once they met up?'What I'm afraid of is that the new king of Silver Moon is too confident and wants to fight a tier 7, only to be killed in an instant ... Forget it, if that's the case, we'll run on our own and not take them with us.'Young people were easily impulsive. He couldn't be tricked to death by them. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ However, since the clone had told him to wait, it must have known that it would be in danger. It shouldn't be that foolish.In the vicinity, it was not easy to run or hide anywhere else. Only the area near the Crimson Moon world, although it looked dangerous, was actually the safest place.As for waiting for the opportunity ... Wait my ass.One should save himself.Powerhouses who didn't save themselves wouldn't live long. If they waited for others to arrange things, they definitely wouldn't have a good end. The two of them knew this very well.……Heaven's Fate and the others began to plan their escape.He had even set a target.At a place not too far away from them.The venerable sovereigns were all hiding in the dark.They didn't dare to get close.At this moment, the celestial pole clone suddenly transmitted his voice to the surroundings,""There seems to be something strange about my main body. It has accelerated a little and is approaching us! I've already told him not to come close, but he's still coming. He might've sensed the danger and wanted to escape. "He understood himself.​ The celestial pole clone quickly added,"with King Huai around, he must have encouraged me to escape immediately. He must have some plans. He probably judged that there was a seventh level venerable sovereign watching him. He might make use of the new martial artist's arrangements to temporarily shake off the seventh level venerable sovereign and join us."Hong Yitang was a little surprised.Surprisingly, it was very difficult to communicate in the chaos. It was almost impossible to communicate over a long distance. As for the celestial pole avatar and the main body, before they met up, they were too far apart, so it was impossible to communicate directly.As for this clone ... It truly understood him well.There was another surprising point. Could celestial pole's original body and the legendary King Huai really judge the situation?They had limited information. Could they determine the danger?Now that he was approaching his side ... Did he have a plan, or did he just want to join forces ... He was a little hesitant.If they met up rashly, they might die. Li Hao hadn't sent any message for them to meet up yet, which meant that he didn't think it was safe enough.The celestial pole clone looked at him. Hong Yitang and Lin Hongyu were the ones in charge here.At this moment, there was no news from Li Hao. Should they gather or not?In the chaos, it was impossible for everything to wait for arrangements. One had to adapt to the situation, or else it would be too easy to miss the opportunity.The other three venerable sovereigns who had come to seek refuge had no right to decide.Hong Yitang fell into deep thought.Should we gather?Was it dangerous?It was definitely dangerous.Li Hao didn't send a message ... Thinking of this, he said,""Senior celestial pole, come with me and get close to them. Hongyu, you guys leave this place first. I'll go and help them!"He still had to go.They had to gather.However, they could not go together. It would be troublesome if Lin Hongyu and the others were dragged in.Lin Hongyu frowned slightly and said telepathically,""You'll go? Senior uncle Hong, you've gone over and received them. How are you going to meet Li Hao if you leave me behind? Without me, he won't be able to lock onto everyone's position. The others can choose not to go, but I must go!"Hong Yitang was stunned and helpless.This was true.The chaos was too big.Without Lin Hongyu, it would be difficult for Li Hao to find them even if he wanted to. Without Lin Hongyu, Li Hao couldn't meet up with them.Although Qian Wuliang was also there, he was a weakling with stage two strength. His perception range was very close, and it was too difficult to find their whereabouts. Otherwise, one of the three venerable sovereigns who had come to seek refuge would have entered the void Dao universe and sensed their location.However, Qian Wuliang's perception range was too small.Lin Hongyu smiled and said,"let's go together!" Since senior Empyrean terminus's true body has come, there's no harm in taking a risk. Since he dared to come with his true body, he must have some degree of confidence. "Since celestial pole was such a person who was afraid of death, the fact that his main body dared to gather here meant that he had a certain level of confidence.Everyone understood the underlying meaning of these words.As for the celestial pole clone, he did not comment.There was nothing wrong with this.If he wasn't confident, would his true body dare to come?He definitely wouldn't dare!Since we're here ... Let's give it a try.After some consideration, they decided to go together and meet up with the two venerable sovereigns of new martial arts. Lin Hongyu and the rest also had other thoughts. No matter what, they had to pass on the Enlightenment of the ultimate Yin way first.Even if it was a little risky, what did it matter?If they continued to wait ... Now that celestial pole's original body was moving, if they didn't move, there might be an accident. These two neo martial Supreme emperors who were afraid of death might run away by themselves, and it would be difficult to find them again.

2819 Chapter 465
……There was still no news from Tian Fang.Li Hao, who was on his way, slightly raised his eyebrows."Lin Hongyu and the others didn't move before. It looks like they were waiting. Now, there's some movement. It seems like they're moving. Something might have happened here!"He sped up his pace and took Qian Wuliang and the others into the river. "I'm going to pick them up ... However, where to escape to is a problem. If the other party is really targeted by a seventh-tier cultivator ... The imprint doesn't seem to have any fluctuations on the path chess. Kong Ji might not have played the path chess anymore and went out."He felt a little helpless.Emptiness, he probably went out.Otherwise, based on Li Hao's understanding of him, he would definitely fight for this opportunity if he reached the 5000th square. Sometimes, Kong Ji didn't seem very reliable.Of course, big brother didn't say anything about second brother. He could only say that the situation in Tian Fang was changing very quickly.It was possible that many seventh rank venerable sovereigns had appeared, or perhaps even the seventh rank venerable sovereigns of the divine light realm, and Kong Ji had gone out to meet up with them.I don't care!Li Hao thought to himself. Let's pick up the person first.As for where to escape to ...The chaos was boundless. If he picked up someone, it would be difficult to run elsewhere. Li Hao looked around ... And then looked in one direction and fell silent for a while.Perhaps ... He could only go near the Crimson Moon.It was said that there were many large worlds gathered there, as well as a large number of small and medium-sized worlds. It had formed a prosperous area in the chaos.If he went there, he would still have a chance.Li Hao stopped thinking about it. Now that he had gathered his people, he could only go there.At this moment, Li Hao still didn't know that the human King and the others had run to Tian Fang, while he had run from Tian Fang to the Crimson Moon. The two sides had changed directions. One went straight to Tian Fang, while the other made up his mind to escape to the circle of the Crimson Moon World Alliance first.……At this moment, the speed of the battleship increased, and there were signs of escape.In the dark chaos, a powerful existence was observing from a distance. Suddenly, he frowned.It accelerated!What was going on?Should he escape, or should he meet up with Silver Moon?It was hard to judge this venerable sovereign.However, he still had to follow them. He couldn't let these two little guys escape from his sight.In an instant, the advanced venerable sovereign also moved.On the other side.The white-haired old man looked into the distance, and his eyes flickered. Heaven's Fate and the others had moved. These two guys were as smart as ghosts and should know the danger. It was somewhat unusual for them to suddenly speed up.To escape?He couldn't judge."Celestial pole and the others are about to escape!" A voice sounded in his ear."Are you sure?""Definitely!""There's a seventh-rank here this time. It was actually an opportunity, but unfortunately ..."The Grandmaster's voice rang out. "The sun god has left," he said."It's hard to deal with the rank Sevens here. Otherwise, we could have tried.""Why don't you come personally?""Me?""It's not like I can deal with a seventh-rank,"Grandmaster said with a smile."Ha!"Zhi Zun laughed again."Don't laugh. I have other things to do. Not only me, but big cat also has to follow us ... We can only give up on this seventh-rank demon. If celestial pole and the others want to escape, we can only let them escape. We have to create an opportunity for them to escape!" Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  "I've given up ..."Venerable the sword pondered for a moment. It seemed like the martial Kings had other goals that might be more important than this rank seven.He was too lazy to ask what it was.However, if they were willing to give up on the grade-7 on this side, it would definitely be the other side that would gain more."We can actually wait ..."At this moment, the Supreme martial artist suddenly said,"there seems to be a big change in Tian Fang. However, I don't know how long we have to wait. It's hard to judge at the moment. Tian Fang is missing a trigger. Fang ping is still uncontactable. Otherwise, we could use him as a trigger to ignite the flames of war in Tian Fang!""Then should I make a move now?"Venerable the sword was too lazy to pay attention to him. He was not interested in these arrangements. He just needed to do his job well. As for the other things that required thinking, he would leave them to those who had more brains.The entire neo martial was in this state.Those who used their brains were in charge of using them. Those who didn't use their brains were responsible for killing. This included the human Kings. If they could not use their brains, they would not be bothered to use them. They focused on cultivating ... Killing. Otherwise, they would not have reached this level so quickly and were about to enter level eight."Let's wait and see if we're really going to escape ...""How do we know if they are really escaping or if they are still in a hurry?" venerable the sword asked.I can't tell.These two guys 'brains were not on the same frequency as his.Their tacit understanding was not that deep.Only the old cunning one could match their frequency."Simple ... We'll see if they'll throw out the documents I sent them.""Your clone?""A half clone, not a complete clone.""It contains some neo martial Dao. It's a gift for our first meeting. Of course, it also has a certain level of strength ..." The Supreme martial artist's voice sounded.Alright!You're always doing such immoral things. Venerable the sword didn't want to say anything more.If he left them, it meant that the two of them were really going to run away. Then, he would have to make a move and create an opportunity for them.It was a pity.If there was a chance, it would be better to kill a seventh grade venerable sovereign. Since this person had been lured here, for some reason, he had suddenly given up. Did the martial King really not consider killing a seventh grade venerable sovereign?He had definitely considered it.What kind of goal would make him give up on killing and let him stop a Grade 7?
