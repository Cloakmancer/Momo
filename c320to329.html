        He did not watch the battle live, but he came to a conclusion in an instant.
        "The next time you meet him, don't worry about anything. Just use your speed to suppress him!" The heavy earth element has very strong attack power, but it has a weakness. There is a slight pause between the attack and defense. As long as we find this opportunity, it is not difficult to kill him!"
        He didn't blame her for anything.
        "I ..." Huang Yun was still embarrassed."Department head, there were experts from the large organizations watching the battle. I ..."
        "It's fine!"
        "Who do you think they'll choose to side with just because of the battle of sunlight?" hou Xiaochen laughed. If you're close to the three major organizations, it means that they've already planned to do so. You're not important. "
        Huang Yun felt a little more at ease when he heard this, but then he felt a little uncomfortable.
        'I ... Am unimportant?'
        Hou Xiaochen seemed to feel that it wasn't right to say this, so he added, "It's not that it's unimportant. It's that even sunlight isn't important ..."
        These words were even more hurtful!
         Hou Xiaochen coughed lightly,"it's a bit unpleasant to hear, but it's the truth." In the middle, above the three suns. Hao lianchuan and I are still with the Nightwatchers. They'll think it over. This time, Yuan Shuo will be going as well. Although I won't be going, the few families will think about what they should do to avoid being destroyed. "
        "Although the small and medium-sized organizations are a little weak, it doesn't mean that they are fools. If they rashly participate in the battle between us and the three major organizations, even if we destroy them, it will only be a branch. If they really attract the powerhouses from the central region, do these people still want to live?"
        ,m Hearing this, Huang Yun felt a lot more at ease.  "Minister, then I ..."
        "You can just stay there. They won't do anything now. Hao lianchuan will be there in a few days."
        Hou Xiaochen thought for a moment before continuing,"Tiger soul ... Tiger soul has passed ... I understand!"
        He hung up the call, and the face on the screen disappeared.
        Huang Yun was speechless. What did you understand?
        However, after hearing what the Minister said, he felt a lot more at ease. That's good. It wouldn't affect him too much. It seemed that he had overestimated himself.
        That's good!
        The Head of the Department was good at comforting people. If it were Hao bu, he might have scolded people.
        ……
        At the same time.
        White moon City.
        Hou Xiaochen rapped the table and thought for a moment before pressing a button.
         After a while, the slender Butler Yu walked in.  "Minister."
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "How's the investigation of the Qiao family that I asked you to investigate last time?"
        "There aren't many clues, but according to the Qiao family's security captain's betrayal and escape to Yama, the Qiao family might have some connection to Yama. But it's been too long, and some of Qiao Feilong's whereabouts before he returned to Silver City are still uncertain."
        After saying that, Chief Steward Yu continued,"however, it's not like we've come back empty-handed. Qiao Feilong might have hidden his strength, or he might have secretly raised some strong people. A few years ago, a few merchants in Silver City went missing or died in an accident. They all had some conflicts with Qiao Feilong in business. We found out that one of the merchants who died had a person with a cultivation base of over 100 in his house!"
        "How long ago was that?"
        "It was five years ago."
        Five years ago!
        Five years ago, the Qiao family could have killed a person who was over a hundred.
        Thinking about this, hou Xiaochen made a quick decision. He then thought of something and said,"Get patrol officer si musen to pass on a message to Liu Long. This time, the Yama sent a RI Yao expert to the remains. He's an expert of the heavy earth element, nicknamed Tiger soul, and his real name is li Dahu. He just defeated Huang Yun, and his strength is unfathomable!"
        "Alright, Minister, are there any other arrangements?" chief Yu nodded.
        Hou Xiaochen hesitated.
        After hesitating for a moment, he added,"in addition, tell mu Sen to tell Yuan Shuo that the red moon is missing a powerful cultivator in the central region. His whereabouts are unknown."
        "Silver Moon?" Chief Steward Yu's expression changed slightly.
        "It's possible. "
         Hou Xiaochen nodded,"just tell him the truth. Tell him that he might still know the Martial Master who disappeared. He's the same Martial Master who left Silver Moon twenty years ago, the eyebrow-level staff King, sun Yifei." As for now, based on the information we have so far, his strength should be at the late stage of the three yang realm. "
        Chief Steward Yu's expression changed and he was in disbelief.""Late stage of three yang?"
        "Yuan Shuo killed an early three yang heaven blessed priest," hou Xiaochen said calmly. "Do you really think that Hongyue will send someone in the mid-stage to suppress him?" Even if Yuan Shuo's killing of duantian was an accident and a sneak attack ... With Ying Hongyue's understanding of Yuan Shuo, she knew that Yuan Shuo was sinister and cunning. Ying Hongyue knew better than us that he would definitely come to the late three yang realm ... If it wasn't for the fact that the battle situation didn't allow it, Ying Hongyue would have come to kill Yuan Shuo herself if she knew that he had entered the Qian warrior realm!"
        The late three yang realm had surprised her, but hou Xiaochen's words made her want to laugh.
        Sinister and cunning?
        Was this the department head's comment on Yuan Shuo?
        Moreover, from what the Minister said, the leader of the red moon, the strong man who surpassed the three suns, seemed to think so too.
        "Department head, what about the central region ... They didn't manage to stop them?"
        "Stop them?"
        Hou Xiaochen laughed,"the situation in the central region is quite tense. They're happy to have one less late three yang cultivator. As for Silver Moon, let them come. They're more than happy to see them come. I'm still here, aren't I?" I still have the origin divine weapon here. No matter how much trouble that guy causes, he won't go to the extent of turning the world upside down. I'll save them some trouble and just treat it as me going to support them. Do you think they'll stop me?"
       
        "But ..." Chief Steward Yu was a little angry.
        "Alright, that's enough!"
        Hou Xiaochen waved his hand."Just pass the message. As for sun Yifei ... Just tell Yuan Shuo about him. He'll be prepared. As for whether he can deal with him, we'll see."
        Chief Steward Yu had no choice but to withdraw and go convey the message.
        After she left, hou Xiaochen fell into deep thought.
        Sun Yifei, late stage of three yang realm.
        The Silver City was not a big city with a population of only a million people. It was already rare for it to have Yuan Shuo, and Martial Master douqian had even killed a Third Sun ... Could he kill a second one?
        No, could he kill the third?
        Yes, the third.
        If she could kill sun Yifei, Hong Yue would suffer a great loss this time.
         And Liu Long, did he also enter the warrior of thousands?
        Hou Xiaochen thought to himself.
        A moment later, she pressed another button. After a while, Hao lianchuan entered the room.
        "Minister, you were looking for me?"
        "Follow me!"
        Hou Xiaochen didn't say anything and led him straight to the innermost part of the office, where there was a suite.
        Hao lianchuan was a little confused. Enter?
        Why?
        The suite in the minister's office was his private resting place. He usually didn't receive guests.
        Even though he thought about it, he still walked in.
        The first thing he saw when he entered ... Was a spear that was casually thrown on the table. The look in his eyes changed. He sensed it and was shocked again!
        It was true!
        The origin god weapon was the most important treasure on Silver moon's side, the Phoenix spear.
        "Practice a little."
        Hou Xiaochen lay lazily on the sofa and pointed at the gun,"You should get used to it in the next few days."
        "Minister, this ... Isn't appropriate, right?"
        Hao lianchuan was a little embarrassed,"if you really leave, I won't be able to stay in Silver Moon province!" Why don't we ... Get the higher-ups to arrange for someone else to come over?"
        Hou Xiaochen looked at him in surprise.
        After a while, she understood what he meant.
        "You ... Can't wait for me to leave?"
        "I didn 't!"
        Hao lianchuan felt a little innocent. How could it be?
        "You want to become a full-time employee?"
        "Absolutely not!"
        Hou Xiaochen glanced at him."Even if you think about it, it's useless. I didn't say I'm leaving. If you leave, I'll probably still be here."
        "That ... That origin god weapon ..."
        "Take him to the ruins!"
        "This time, a few three suns might appear," hou Xiaochen said calmly. "There might even be people from other regions coming to help. In order to make sure nothing goes wrong, you should take the fire Phoenix spear."
        "That won't do, Minister. If we lose this thing, we'll cut off the source of new generation ..."
        "Cut the crap!"
        "Just do as I say," hou Xiaochen replied. You just happen to be of the fire element, so you'll be able to use it very quickly after you get used to it. Just like that, take your guns and leave. "
        "Then ..."
        Hao lianchuan was really hesitant. He couldn't just take this thing.
        Once it was lost, or lost, it would be a big problem.
        There was only one origin god weapon among the night patrollers in the entire Silvermoon province, and many people were eyeing it.
        Hou Xiaochen waved his hand impatiently.
        Hao lianchuan hesitated for a while before picking up the fire Phoenix spear. At that moment, the moment he touched the fire Phoenix spear, it was as if he had really seen a Phoenix spitting out flames and burning the void.
        Terrifying!
        The moment he held it in his hand, it actually produced such a huge change.
        With some hesitation, he still left with the gun. If he didn't leave, the Minister would kick him out.
        ……
        The events at the transverse Canyon and Whitemoon city were signs of the danger of exploring the ruins.  Li Hao also received the news very quickly.
        Liu Long's office.
        Only Li Hao and Liu Long were left.
        Liu Long, who usually didn't smoke, actually lit a cigarette and smoked it silently.
        Li Hao had been waiting.
        After waiting for a long time, Liu Long let out a long breath,"Two pieces of news. First, a master from the red moon, sun Yifei of the late stage of the three yang realm, came from the central region. I know this person, he was known as the Qi Mei staff King, and his prestige is not small. He is also an existence who has broken through a hundred perfection in the path of martial masters. Your teacher must know that he might go to the ruins!"
        Li Hao nodded, not too surprised.
        He couldn't say anything. This was his teacher's enemy.
        "Second ... Li Dahu is near the ruins."
        "Li Dahu?"
        "The guy who killed Liu Yan's husband. Today, he defeated Huang Yun. You know Huang Yun."
        Li Hao frowned.
        He looked at Liu Long, and Liu Long calmly said,""I'm thinking, what should I do? I'll go to the remains and find a way to kill this guy. What I'm hesitating about now is whether I should bring Liu Yan along. What do you think?"
        "Boss, I ... Why are you asking me?"
        Li Hao was a little conflicted. This was hard to say.
        Liu Long laughed,"I'm asking you what's wrong?" You're the Deputy Minister, isn't it normal for me to ask you? I wanted Liu Yan to kill that fellow with her own hands ... But I was afraid that she would die there! You're so cunning, give me some ideas. "
        Go to hell!
        You're the one who's sinister and cunning. Why would the captain have such a huge misunderstanding about me?
        Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"ask sister Liu herself. She's definitely going. In fact, you don't have to ask." Boss isn't at a loss about whether to bring her along, but whether or not he can kill li Dahu. If he can't kill him, it'll be even worse, right?"
        Liu Long slightly nodded.
        That's right, he wasn't confident. Even if he had killed sunlight, the fact that he was able to defeat Huang Yun meant that he was also very strong.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Moreover, this was a group operation, not a one-on-one battle.
        The Yama also sent experts. How to kill li Dahu in this situation was the problem.
        Of course, he might be killed by li Dahu, but this was not mentioned.
        Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"go, I'll go too!" "My teacher is going too ... I think that the ruins can still be opened. There's still a chance. It's dangerous, but it's also an opportunity. Sister Liu isn't a child, and she knows that sometimes, boss, there's no need to be so hesitant. "
        "AI!"
        Sighing, Liu Long didn't say anything else.
        Was he hesitating?
        However, too many of their comrades had died, and they were more or less indecisive, especially when it came to the members of the demon hunting squad. It wasn't easy for them to survive until now.
        "Boss, did the news come from Whitemoon city?"
        "Yes."
        "Mu Sen passed it on," Liu Long nodded.
        Li Hao frowned slightly and said after a long while,""They specifically told us ... Boss, do you think the higher-ups know something?"
        "What?"
        Liu Long was slightly stunned. After a moment, he frowned and said,"You know that I've advanced?"
        "It's possible!"
        Otherwise, he wouldn't have told Liu Long and the others about something completely unnecessary.
        Liu Long thought for a moment and suddenly laughed."So what if I know? I didn't break the law. I'm also the head of the night patrolman branch. So what if I know?"
        "Alright, I'll think of a way to deal with Liu Yan's matter. Your teacher's side is the real problem. I'm afraid sun Yifei is really here to find him. If I remember correctly, your teacher seems to have some enmity with him."
        Li Hao was already used to it.
        Teacher has so many enemies!
         Ying Hongyue might only be the strongest. There might be a lot more others.
        As for whether his teacher could deal with a late-stage three sun realm expert, it would probably be very difficult. He had already had a hard time dealing with an early-stage three sun realm expert. Even if he had absorbed a three sun realm Blood God's clone, he would not be able to deal with a late-stage three sun realm expert in a short time.
        This, he had to think of a way.
        Moreover, Li Hao also realized that this trip to the ruins was not going to be simple. Even a late-stage three-sun cultivator had come. Who knew if a greater three-sun cultivator would suddenly appear?
        It would be even more dangerous then!
        Li Hao walked out of the office with some frustration.
        In addition, he was also concerned about the attitude of the White moon City side. By passing this news over, did he want us to go or not?
        The advanced stage of the three suns realm had already come, so it seemed normal that his teacher didn't want to go.
        "Hou Xiaochen ..."
        Li Hao mumbled. He didn't know the man's personality and character, but he hoped to know more about him. After all, that man was his boss.
       
        After knowing that many experts had come to the remains, Li Hao began to pay more attention.
        In the yuan family's courtyard.
        Li Hao briefly explained the situation. He couldn't help, so he could only study hard and strive to enter the Qian warrior realm as soon as possible. Only then would he be qualified to participate in the battles between the strong.
        In the yard, Li Hao began his martial arts training again.
        His inner strength was currently changing into the shape of a sword.
        This was a long process. In fact, it was a long process for Li Hao. Under normal circumstances, it would take a few months, but for many martial masters who had surpassed 100, this was just a transition period. It was not difficult to endure at all.
        In a few months, he would truly be able to break through 100. Who would be in a hurry?
        Li Hao was anxious.
        Beside him, Yuan Shuo was leaning back in his chair, deep in thought.
         The rattan chair creaked.
        "Sun Yifei, the king of the eyebrows-raising staff. He's good at staff techniques. He used to beat all of Silver Moon with his eyebrows-raising staff and was almost unrivaled!" Yuan Shuo suddenly said.
        "Back in the day, there were seven Swordsmen in the Silver Moon world who practiced the sword. The one who practiced the spear was the Silvermoon three spear strikes. The north and south fists were the ones that practiced boxing. The only one who practices the rod ... Is the Qi Mei rod King!"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "A spear for a lifetime ... It's easy to get a stick, but hard to master! The eyebrows-abrest rod King Sun Yifei's rod technique is superb. Not counting the Qian warrior, he's really strong when it comes to breaking through the hundred level!"
        Li Hao didn't interrupt. He continued to practice his fist technique and listened in silence.
        His teacher rarely talked about the past, but this time, he was interested and wanted to hear it.
        "I didn't have any grudges with sun Yifei back then. In terms of grudges, there wasn't any at first ... But I'm a bit younger than him. He has a disciple who's about the same age as me. "
        "Which Martial Master wasn't impulsive when they were young? One time, I had an argument with his disciple over some trivial matters. At that time, I was in my outbreak period, and my punches were too heavy, so I killed that guy with three punches. "
        Yuan Shuo sighed,'it's actually quite common for martial masters to kill people when they attack, so the authorities were right to ban martial arts back then. Because of this, sun Yifei and I became enemies. After that, we agreed to fight at the Hengduan Canyon. There was a Hengduan bridge there and we agreed that whoever leaves the bridge would be the loser. "
        "Sun Yifei was about 10 years older than me, so he was young and strong. I was at my peak at that time, so I had the upper hand as soon as the battle started. I used Tiger fighting technique to break his arms and his eyebrows-reaching rod ... Sun Yifei couldn't bear the humiliation and jumped off the bridge. The bridge was hundreds of meters away from the canyon ... I thought he was dead."
        Yuan Shuo sighed."I didn't expect him to join the red moon. It seems that after Ying Hongyue was defeated by me, she established the red moon. She might have roped in some of the martial masters I defeated back then."
        Li Hao couldn't help but feel curious.""Teacher, Ying Hongyue wasn't even as good as you back then. How did she manage to establish such a large organization like the Hongyue?"  Twenty years ago, he was even worse than her teacher.
        "I'm not too sure. I fought with him about 25 years ago. At that time, I was almost 50 years old. That guy was a little younger than me. He probably thought that I was going downhill and wanted to use me to make a name for himself ... But at that time, I had already comprehended the five birds aura, but it hadn't fused yet. Even so, that guy was still beaten to his knees by me ..."
        "Teacher, you've always cut the weeds and eliminated the roots. Why didn't you kill anyone that time?"
        This was also what Li Hao found strange. Why did he leave behind so many enemies?
        Yuan Shuo was speechless,'I don't just kill anyone! You speak as if I'm a devil. When I kill people, I usually can't control it during a battle. They're either too weak, too strong, or they're evenly matched. "
        So he killed them.
        Li Hao thought for a moment and was somewhat dumbfounded.
        The strong and the weak were evenly matched, but you killed them all ... Then ... Aren't you still a devil?
        "There were actually other reasons why Ying Hongyue and the others didn't die back then. They were tactless and took the initiative to surrender when they saw that they had lost. If not for the fact that the other party's injuries were heavy and mine wasn't light either, if they continued to fight, both sides would be injured. Otherwise, there's someone behind him ... It's not good to kill him. "
        Yuan Shuo laughed."Ying Hongyue is the latter. There's someone behind him, but I don't know who it is. However, during the competition, I could feel that someone was locking onto me and staring at me. Now that I think about it ... It's either someone who has broken through a hundred perfection or someone in the thousand-fighting realm!"
        "I'm not a fool," he said with a smile."The other party might have the intention of toughening Ying Hongyue. If I really killed him, I'd be in trouble too."
         Alright, I understand now.
        Sun Yifei did jump down, and the teacher thought that he had fallen to his death.
        Back then, Ying Hongyue had someone backing her up. There was an expert standing behind her, so his teacher didn't dare to kill her.
        Li Hao began to practice his swordsmanship. He changed his fist to a sword, and with four waves of inner strength, he broke through the air with one sword!
        Yuan Shuo frowned and said,"don't make any air-piercing sounds. Do you think that's cool?" To an expert, when your sword strikes through the air, he has already locked onto the position of your sword. As long as it's not a one-sided battle, and the sound of your sword striking is heard, you're defeated!"
        The sound of the sword being drawn was actually very simple.
        To a Martial Master, it was very difficult to strike a sword without making a sound.
        A Martial master's inner strength was extremely powerful. When the inner strength exploded, it could break through the air resistance and stab out with a speed that exceeded the speed of sound. Naturally, it would produce some air-piercing sounds.
        The only way was to maintain this speed and surpass the speed of sound. By the time the sound was heard, the sword would have already been out.
       
        Thus, if one wanted to make no sound, they had to either be extremely fast or extremely slow.
        Li Hao attacked again, and the sound was still there.
        Without inner strength flowing out, there was no sound when he stabbed the sword, but the lethality was shockingly weak.
        Li Hao frowned slightly.
        It was difficult to draw a sword without making a sound!
        "I'm not too proficient in the sword,"Yuan Shuo added. However, whether it was a punch or a sword, the logic was the same. If I didn't do it quickly, I would have finished by the time you heard the sound. Why don't I slow down? I'll be so slow that you can't feel it and I'll hit you. "
        Li Hao nodded. He had also considered this.
        "Teacher, I'm still a little short of breaking through the speed of sound ..."
        "Then slow down!"
        Li Hao unhurriedly drew his sword, feeling a little awkward.
         Yuan Shuo was helpless."It's not this kind of slow method. I usually use the five animal technique. Did you see it?"
        "Yes, health fist is very slow ... But when teacher fights, he moves very, very quickly. He's not slow at all."
        Li Hao still couldn't understand.
        "You still don't understand. Speed doesn't necessarily have to be fixed."
        Yuan Shuo explained,"I'm slow in punching, but I'm fast in explosiveness!" For example, I'm 5 meters away from you now. In the first 4 meters, my punches were very slow, so slow that you didn't even care. When I'm only 1 meter away from you ..."
        With that, he stood up and slowly punched at Li Hao without making any sound.
        When he was less than a meter away from Li Hao, Yuan Shuo's fist suddenly moved faster than the eye could see. In the blink of an eye, Li Hao's hair flew up. Yuan Shuo's punch had broken many of his hair.
        "Did you see that?"
        Bang! Bang!
        At this moment, the air suddenly exploded with a Sonic Boom.
        "Duels and battles are the process of creating killing intent!" Yuan Shuo replied sternly. We don't want to look good in the battle. We want to have a goal, and that is to kill the opponent!"
        "Or rather, the entire process of the battle is in preparation for the final sword strike and the final punch! Everything in front was just laying the foundation and creating opportunities. Until the last moment, when you achieved your goal, you would kill with one strike! This is a real battle!"
        This was a true Martial Master, a true killing technique!
        In Yuan Shuo's words, the entire process of the battle was just a foreshadowing process. Everything was for that final strike.
        During this process, you have to send your fist and sword to the place where you should send them. At the last moment, you have to explode instantly and complete the killing.
        Whether it was a secret skill or a superpower, the ultimate goal was to kill.
        "Li Hao, you must remember that the ultimate goal of all battles is to kill! There is no such thing as sparring, do you understand? There was no such thing as stopping at a certain point! From the moment martial arts were invented, from the moment superpowers appeared, your extraordinary strength was used to kill!"  Li Hao nodded.
        "What martial arts to strengthen the body ... That's all nonsense. The idea of superpowers benefiting society was nonsense. Without extraordinary powers, there was no way to benefit society? There's no way to strengthen your body? "Thus, there is only one purpose for extraordinary power, and that is to kill!"
        Li Hao nodded again solemnly.
        "You're going to the ruins with me this time ... You'll definitely see blood!"
        "And it's different from before," Yuan Shuo said in a deep voice. "Previously, you could hide, hide behind me, and plot against others. You could do anything ... But this time, you might have to fight alone, face danger alone. I have many enemies and too many people who want to kill me. Even if you just go, before you even enter the ruins, you might face life-threatening danger. "
        Li Hao looked suspicious."They're already making a move?" he asked."We haven't even entered?"
        "It's hard to say,"
        "It depends on the situation," Yuan Shuo replied uncertainly. "Everyone knows that you're my last disciple. If a Martial Master insists on following the rules, you might have to fight a few battles for me ... It might not be them, but a student, a disciple, or a successor. "
        "Even though the rise of superpowers and the decline of martial masters, if there are really martial masters who want to talk to me about rules, there are some rules ... That I have to talk about ... I can ignore them when there are no people around, but I can't when there are people around."
        Then, he suddenly said,"I don't want you to go. But if you don't go, I'm worried about your safety if you stay in the Silver City. Why don't I send you to the White moon City?"
        He felt that he wasn't the only one in danger. Li Hao was in danger as well.
        When there was no one around, Yuan Shuo would not follow the rules.
        However, there were many people present, even those who had surpassed him. At this time, you had to follow the rules, because the rules were actually used to protect yourself.
        Li Hao shook his head.
        Yuan Shuo was helpless.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He knew, but he still wanted to try.
         This time, Li Hao refused, and he did not mention it again.
        "Alright, you can continue to practice martial arts. Try to complete the integration of inner strength before you set off. Only then will you truly be able to break through 100 perfection ..."
        However, he might not have enough time.
        Thinking of this, he said,"I know you too well. My strength far exceeds yours. I can't give you the stimulation you should have. You should go find Liu Long and have a real battle!" Tell Liu Long, as long as he doesn't kill you, it's up to him. "
        Li Hao inhaled.
        The captain might really be ruthless.
        "Teacher ..."
        "Cut the crap, go!"
        "Also, I'll tell you the basic information about the remains when you come back in the next few nights," Yuan Shuo added."You'll also need to collect some basic information about the night patrollers. Know yourself and your enemy, and you'll never be defeated."
        "Understood!"
       
        Li Hao didn't say anything else. He thought to himself, if I go to the captain, I'll have to reveal my full strength. It seems that I can't hide it anymore.
        As expected, even the heavens wanted to go against low-key people.
        ……
        At the law enforcement building.
        Liu Long was busy with something. Hearing Li Hao's words, he was a little distracted."Sparring with me?"
        "No."
        "No!" Li Hao shook his head and said seriously,"I'm asking for your guidance, boss!"
        Spar? how can I spar with Dou Qian?
        He only gave a few pointers.
        "I'm busy!"
         "Where are your eyes?" Liu Long said unhappily. I'm very busy! If you want to find someone to spar with, you can choose anyone from the entire team!"
        You're just an early-stage one hundred. Who in the team isn't stronger than you?
        Of course, Li Hao might have eaten the blood God's spawn and broken through the mid-hundredth level.
        Was that why he was floating?
        However, so what if he had broken through the middle 100-stage?
        Couldn't Liu Yan do it?
        Although he hasn't reached the middle stage yet, he has rich combat experience and is enough for you to fight.
        If it didn't work, he could look for Wang Ming!
        p Thinking of this, he added,"go find Wang Ming. It just so happens that you'll gain some experience fighting supers. You can't always encounter martial masters. You know too little about supers."  "He can 't!"
        "Why?"
        Liu Long was curious.
        Li Hao thought for a moment."He ... He's not suitable to pressure me to improve. He has too little combat experience."
        Good fellow!
        Liu Long was stunned. You're saying that Wang Ming has little combat experience?
        In any case, he had carried out a lot of missions and killed people, including riyao ... Although it had always been said that Wang Ming didn't have much experience, that was only when compared to those old martial masters. In the field of superpowers, he really wasn't bad, except for having a little less experience than those guys who licked blood on their blades.
        Li Hao actually despised her!
        "I don't have the time ..."
        Seeing the captain refuse again, Li Hao could only say,""Boss, my teacher asked me to come."
        “……”
        Alright, Liu Long had advanced to the battle Qian stage because of Yuan Shuo.
        Now that Li Hao had mentioned his teacher, he was helpless.
        But he was really a little busy.
        Thinking of this, Liu Long secretly made up his mind. 'Little brat, I told you to find someone else, but you had to find me. Fine, I'll let you know why flowers are so red.'
        After giving Li Hao a good beating, the kid would naturally not dare to come to him again.
        "Alright, now then! When you're done, I'll be busy. You can do what you need to do. "
        Li Hao smiled.
        This was good.
        "Boss, let's go to the basement. This place is broken ..."
        "Alright!"
        Liu Long agreed readily. Just you wait.
        Let's end this quickly and get rid of you in an instant. I'll let you know that you won't be able to gain any experience points if you come to me.  The two of them walked down to the basement.
        ……
        In the basement.
        The others were not here, but Yun Yao was.
        This woman usually stayed in the basement. He didn't know what she was busy with.
        Li Hao wanted to invite her out for a walk, but unfortunately, yunyao didn't even look at them. When she saw them, she went straight into her room and went to work on something.
        Liu Long didn't have any intention of driving him away.
        He wanted to end the battle quickly.
        He didn't even take off his windbreaker and said directly,""Let's start!"
        “……”
        Li Hao felt humiliated. Boss, you should have at least taken off your windbreaker.
        Forget it, I'm weak.
        Before he could finish comforting himself, Liu Long said,"Are you alright with some external injuries? Your teacher won't say anything, right?"
        Good fellow, he really thought of himself as a young master.
        Li Hao was completely speechless.
        He didn't say anything. He walked to the side and took out a sword. His own sword was too sharp, so he didn't dare to use it recklessly.
        "Boss, I'll use a sword!" He said, holding a long sword in his hand.
        "As you wish!"
        Liu Long really didn't care. Was there a difference between using a sword and a fist?
        It was all a matter of one move.
        Li Hao took a deep breath. The person in front of him was a warrior of thousand-degree combat, and it was only right for him to look down on him. He wasn't angry at all, but he felt that he could take advantage of Liu Long because he underestimated him.
        As for getting beaten up even more after taking advantage of him, perhaps this was what the teacher wanted to see.
        If he didn't get serious, how could he force himself to improve?
        "Boss, be careful!"
        Li Hao attacked with his sword. His inner strength burst out, and the long sword let out a whistling sound.
        Liu Long took a look at it and thought,"it's alright, it looks decent ... That's all."
        He didn't even use the ninth-refinement force. It was just a simple burst of inner strength. He didn't even use force, because if he did, it would be too powerful for Li Hao and he was afraid that he would kill him.
        A flat punch!
        There was nothing fancy or special about him. He knocked Li Hao down with a punch.
        Li Hao's sword was already approaching.
        Halfway through, he suddenly retracted his sword.
         Liu Long's fist had already struck out, and his sword was originally about to hit Li Hao. Now that Li Hao suddenly pulled back his sword, Liu Long was slightly caught off guard.
        He was too perfunctory.
        At this moment, Li Hao once again struck out with his sword. This time, his movements were slow, but his feet were as agile as an ape 'S. He dodged his opponent's fist and lightly stabbed out with his sword.
        The sword was silent.
        Only when the long sword neared Liu Long did his hair stand on end!
        At this moment, Li Hao's slow sword suddenly became extremely fast. Like lightning, it went straight for his throat.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao knew that it would be difficult to kill a warrior of thousand hands if he didn't plan to kill.
        However, he wanted to let his Captain know that underestimating him was a mistake.
        Underestimating anyone was a mistake!
        At this moment, Liu Long actually felt a sense of danger. His originally indifferent attitude instantly changed. With a loud roar, he instantly punched back. His right arm trembled, and a huge wave erupted. With a loud bang, he punched out heavily, and his body quickly retreated.
       
        Li Hao, on the other hand, burst out with his inner strength. Layer after layer of inner strength was added to his long sword. In the blink of an eye, the fourth layer of inner strength was added.
        Clang!
        After all, Liu Long was a warrior of thousands, so his punch was extremely fast. When his fist hit the long sword, a metal-colliding sound was heard.
        However, before he could rejoice, Li Hao was still waving his sword. He stomped his foot, causing the ground to shake. Liu Long was as still as a mountain, but he was also slightly shaken by the ground.
        Liu Long's face was full of surprise. He changed his fist into a claw and grabbed the long sword, trying to pull Li Hao over.
        This ordinary sword would not be able to hurt him.
        Just as he was about to pull his sword back, Li Hao suddenly abandoned his sword and grabbed Liu Long's arm. The force from the fingers of his right hand burst out and grabbed Liu Long's arm tightly, even leaving five bloody holes.
        Liu Long felt a sharp pain in his arm. He immediately released his inner strength.
        With a bang, Li Hao flicked his finger.
        Li Hao instantly withdrew his hand and pounced on him. He used the Black Tiger Steals Heart and aimed at his heart.
         Liu Long was still hesitating as to whether he should use his explosive force and the ninth refinement force ...
        While he was hesitating, Li Hao's eyes suddenly flashed.
        He glared at Liu Long and opened his mouth slightly. In the next moment, a roar that sounded like a tiger's roar reverberated in all directions!
        "Roar!"
        The sound wave exploded. With a boom, Liu Long was shocked by Li Hao's gaze. It wasn't that Li Hao was too strong, but ... Li Hao's inner strength had filled his eyes. This was a sign that only someone in the late stage of the 100th level would have.
        And that tiger's roar was just right.
        At this moment, Liu Long couldn't care about anything else. Li Hao ... Had succeeded!
        No, half a step to perfection.
        He had grasped the embryonic form of force and was only a step away from integrating it with his inner strength. However, he could no longer underestimate Li Hao like before.
        Liu Long's ninth refined force erupted.
        At this moment, it was no longer his arms, but his chest that heaved up and down like a giant wave. He released his inner strength, and the waves stacked on top of each other. With a bang, his inner strength collided with Li Hao's palm. The powerful inner strength directly shook Li Hao's palm, causing blood to spray out.
        Li Hao, on the other hand, stomped his feet again, causing the earth to shake as if he didn't feel anything.
        He used both his fists and legs!
        At this moment, Liu Long was actually forced to take a step back. He still hadn't used his full strength, but even so, with his experience and strength, even if he had underestimated Li Hao and was caught off guard, being forced to take a step back by Li Hao was still a shocking result.
        "Boss, you can 't!"
        Li Hao suddenly spoke, his words stimulating.
        Just as Liu Long was about to open his mouth to say something, a loud roar rang out once more.
        "Roar!"
        Liu Long growled in a low voice, somewhat angry. This time, he punched out again, extremely fast and fierce. His fist hit Li Hao's palm that had just grabbed him. With a bang, Li Hao's palm seemed to be split open.
        Liu Long subconsciously threw a punch, but he regretted it the moment he did so. He had hit too hard!
        In the end ... Just as he was about to stop, Li Hao suddenly struck out with his palm. With a plop, this claw directly tore Liu Long's trench coat to pieces, and once again struck Liu Long's arm, leaving five bloody holes and even five long bloody marks.
        This time, Liu Long's expression changed completely.
        He quickly took a few steps back and dodged Li Hao's next attack. He said in disbelief,""Perfect ..."
        A hundred percent completion!
        ܳ!  Am I crazy, or is Li Hao crazy?
        "Boss, again!"
        Li Hao ignored him. He suddenly stomped his foot, and the longsword flew into the air. Li Hao grabbed it, and the next moment, he recalled that sword attack.
        The sword that could destroy the world!
        He drew his sword!
        Hurry up!
        This time, what he pursued was speed. With a single sword strike, the enemy would have no way to escape.
        Before he could even make a move, the longsword suddenly shattered. Li Hao suddenly stopped and frowned.
        On the other side, Liu Long's hair stood on end again as he couldn't help but shout,"Stop!"
        He suddenly looked at Li Hao."You're going to use your sword ...? What kind of sword technique is this?"
        He hadn't even drawn his sword yet, and it had actually shattered.
        Although it was just an ordinary sword, it might have been kept here, but its quality was still good.
        In the end, it seemed like it couldn't withstand the killing intent and directly shattered.
        Li Hao helplessly said,"my teacher taught me. He wanted me to fight with boss. He wanted me to combine my internal strength into a sword."
        "No... That's not right!"
        "Don't ... Don't you have the earth melting force?"Liu Long shook his head.
        I'm confused.
        Why did he have to fuse inner strength into a sword?
        "Attack and defense in one!"
        Hearing this, Liu Long understood and was a little surprised. This guy wanted to fuse two types of Shi.
        He lowered his head and looked at his arm. There were ten bloody holes on it. Li Hao had scratched him twice.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com His windbreaker was already in pieces, and Li Hao's first attack was very abrupt, leaving a small bloody mark on his chest.
        Liu Long was completely speechless!
        He looked at Li Hao. Li Hao's palm had split open. It seemed that Li Hao was in a better state than him. He was a Qian warrior, but he had been forced into this situation ... Even if he had underestimated Li Hao and didn't care about it.
         "I've underestimated you!"
        Liu Long sighed and soon became serious,"I was wondering why you kept asking me to practice with you. So that's why. You want me to force you to complete the integration of inner strength, right?"
        "Right!"
        "If you had said so earlier, I wouldn't have looked down on you ..."
        "I'm afraid that boss won't believe me if I tell you!"Li Hao smiled innocently.
        Damn it!
        Liu Long was speechless. However, he had to admit that it was possible.
        Would he have believed Li Hao if he had said that he had come to him to complete the integration of inner strength?
        Believe my ass.
        Just as he was about to speak, in the depths of the basement, yunyao looked at the two silently and suddenly said,""Let's fight. Stop shouting. You can't keep quiet!"
       
        p Then, he turned around and returned to his room.  In his heart, however, there were stormy waves.
        Li Hao ... Had actually forced the captain of the battle of thousands to retreat and get injured. Although she knew that the captain had underestimated Li Hao, who was Li Hao?
        A month ago, Li Hao was just an ordinary person who was sent flying by Chen Jian with a slap.
        In the end, in the blink of an eye, the other party had actually started fighting with the captain of fighting thousand.
        "Genius? A monster? Or ... Is the bloodline of the eight great families really so magical?"
        Yun Yao entered the room and couldn't calm down for a long time.
        At this moment, he thought of many things, many dusty past events.
        Could this team really develop?
        Could he really be that powerful?
         Originally, it seemed impossible.
        It had been established for more than three years, and more than 20 people had died. The strongest had broken 100, and the others had only been killed by 10.
        He was too weak!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com In Silver City, it might be okay, but in Whitemoon city, it was just the smallest operation team.
        In the central region ... They were the village guards.
        That's right, all the villages in the central region were able to bring out such forces. During the chaos of war, the guards of the villages that could survive were stronger than this.
        However, after Li Hao's entry, in less than a month, the team's strength had undergone a shocking change.
        At this moment, yunyao was confused.
        ……
        Meanwhile, outside.
        Li Hao was a little embarrassed. Was he roaring too loudly?
        Forget it, I won't shout later.
        The captain was prepared, so it was useless to shout.
        He didn't care about this and looked at Liu Long,"boss, show me your true ability!" How are you going to force me to risk my life with this?"
        "Alright!"
        Liu Long smiled this time."I've underestimated you. Li Hao, you're even more ... Terrifying than I thought!"
        It wasn't strength, but the speed of improvement.
        Since that's the case, I won't be polite.
        I'll let you understand that a thousand is not something that a hundred can compare to.
        The next moment, he punched out, and a huge wave surged.
        He had even used force.
        Li Hao suddenly felt that he had been locked onto and suppressed.
        However, he had endured Yuan Shuo's aura before, so this bit of aura was not enough to suppress him.
        Standing on his two feet, Li Hao released the force of the earth, his internal strength, and his vitality. He was like a long Dragon. He stomped his feet and stood still like a mountain.
        After stabilizing his body, he leaped up and pounced at Liu Long.
        Four hands and two pairs of fists collided rapidly at this moment.
        Li Hao attacked head-on!
        Liu Long was surprised again.
        I'm a warrior of thousands, and you're actually attacking me?
        But at this moment, what Li Hao used was not the power of five birds. There seemed to be sword Qi on his fist.
        Yes, when the sword was broken, Li Hao thought of using himself as a sword.
        His body was still very strong.  His punch was like a sharp sword. With a plop, Li Hao's fist was cut open, revealing his white bones. Liu Long was also hit by that sharp fist ... Yes, his fist was actually sharp!
        After this punch, Liu Long's fists were also bleeding, and his white bones could be vaguely seen.
        "A sword?"
        Liu Long was even more surprised. What kind of secret technique was this?
        The destructive power was too strong!
        Not only that, the feeling ... Was suffocating.
        Yuan Shuo knew such a sword technique?
        Never heard of it!
        "Break!"
        Liu Long growled and swung his fist again. At the same time, he kicked out, causing a huge wave to rise again.
        At this moment, Li Hao also brandished his fists like swords.
        His fist went straight for the huge wave, and in the next moment, his fist turned into a claw. He wanted to copy Yuan Shuo's move and directly capture Liu Long.
        "How dare you!"
        Liu Long was so angry that he laughed, I'm a Qian warrior!
        Your guts are going to ascend to the heavens.
        With a bang, the huge wave exploded in Li Hao's hand. A powerful inner strength burst out, turning Li Hao's palm into a sieve. Blood dripped down.
        Li Hao also felt the power of a thousand-man combat suit.
        Of course, he was very happy.
        It was not that he was impetuous, but he just wanted to test how strong Dou Qian was and how strong his force was.
        Now, he knew.
        Very strong!
        The scene he saw that day appeared in his mind again.
        Breaking the heavens, breaking the earth, breaking the longevity!
        What power? with one sword, everything was destroyed.
        At this moment, sword intent appeared in his eyes. His inner strength burst out and condensed into a sword. He slashed out!
        Buzzzzzz!
        The sound of something breaking through the air was heard, and by the time it appeared, the sword Qi had already slashed out and hit the Dragon wave. The Dragon wave that had just exploded Li Hao's palm was directly destroyed by the sword that released internal energy.
        The waves were extinguished.
        Li Hao seized the opportunity to attack. He held the sword of inner strength in his hand and was about to strike again when a fist came flying over with a bang, directly shattering the sword of inner strength.
        Li Hao almost vomited blood!
        As for Liu Long, he didn't pursue and attack. Instead, he silently looked at his palm. There was also a bloody mark on his palm.
         Liu Long looked at Li Hao again. After a while, he suddenly said,""From today onwards, you will spar with me for an hour every day! Forget everything, forget your fist, forget your five birds technique, use your inner strength sword and spar with me!"
        "An hour?"
        Li Hao was stunned for a moment. Liu Long frowned.""Too many? "It's not too much. You ... If you can persist for an hour a day, I believe that you will be able to officially step into the consummate level by the end of the month and become one with your inner strength!"
        To a Martial Master, an hour was actually very long.
        Battles usually ended in a few minutes.
        Li Hao, on the other hand, laughed."Boss ... Why don't we ... Beat him until he's exhausted? what do you think?"
        "Are you sure?"
        Liu Long calculated for a moment. Breaking through the peak of a hundred, beating until he was exhausted ... Was actually about the same as an hour.
        "It's all the same!"He nodded.
        Li Hao smiled. You said it.
       
        As for collapsing ... How could that be?
        Sword energy was invincible!
        I want to absorb the sword energy and continue fighting with the captain, who is a Qian master. A free Qian master sparring partner is too good.
        "Boss, let's start now!"
        "Now? You can still fight?"
        "Of course!"
        "Alright then!"
        Liu Long didn't have any objections. At this moment, he didn't need to be busy. What was there to be busy with?
        Wouldn't it be more important than anything else when Li Hao broke through the 100-point threshold?
        The next moment, the two of them exchanged blows again.
         Not long after, with a bang, Li Hao was punched and lay on the ground, unable to move. Liu Long heaved a sigh of relief. Of course, he had used up some energy, but it was still okay. He had used up 20% to 30% of his energy. However, after fighting for so long, he was also tired. Finally, he had beaten this kid to the point where he had no more energy.
        He was just about to rest for a while when Li Hao, who had just been lying on the ground, suddenly stood up.
        The next moment, Li Hao charged forward in high spirits!
        Liu Long was stunned ...
        There was no time for him to be dazed. Li Hao's attacks were extremely crazy, and each of his sword strikes was actually very powerful. Liu Long felt that if he had not advanced to the warrior Qian level, with his previous state, he would have been killed by Li Hao's sword if he was not careful!
        Although Liu Long was a Qian fighter, he couldn't go all out in case he killed Li Hao.
        It was extremely tiring to collect energy like this.
        After an unknown amount of time, he sent Li Hao flying again, and there were a few more bloody wounds on his body. Li Hao's injuries were much more serious than his.
        In the end, in less than a minute ... It came again!
        "Boss, continue!"
        ……
        Again and again, Li Hao seemed to have discovered a new continent.
        He was very happy that he could find a Qian warrior as a sparring partner. He didn't keep it, but only knew to fight.
        He couldn't kill Liu Long anyway!
        Bang Bang Bang!
        From one in the afternoon to five in the afternoon, the noise continued in the basement.
        Six, seven ...
        When yunyao came out again, she said angrily,""It's not over yet? Are you not eating? Aren't you going to rest? From 1 p.m. To now, we've been fighting for seven hours!"
        "Phew ..."
        Liu Long panted heavily. He was Dou Qian, and after fighting for seven hours, he was also a little exhausted.
        Li Hao was also panting heavily, somewhat confused.""It's ... It's been seven hours?"
        That was fast!
        I thought it had only been an hour or two.
        Yun Yao looked at the two covered in blood. Forget about Li Hao, Liu Long's windbreaker was gone, and now, he was only left with his underpants. She was a little speechless.
        The team leader was douqian ... How did he end up like this?
        Moreover, there were many bloody wounds on Liu Long's body. Many of them were still bleeding.
        Liu Long panted a few times and said,"Today ... Can't we just let it go like this?"
        He had to rest!
        There was something wrong with Li Hao, a very serious problem.
        He had been fighting for seven hours for a breakthrough of 100 points. If he were to break through 100 points normally, he would not even be able to release a fart, let alone inner strength.
        Li Hao, on the other hand, felt that he could still fight!
        Li Hao's mouth was dry, and he nodded.""Okay ... We'll continue tomorrow ... Boss, do you ... Want to heal your injuries? Will he recover by tomorrow?"
        "A small problem!"
        "That's good ..."
        Li Hao gasped for breath and raised his thumb."Boss, you're ... Amazing!"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Liu Long smiled slightly, but it was a bitter smile.
        So, it's over with just a 'powerful'?
        I've lost my mind, I actually agreed to fight with you every day!
         "Boss, I'll come earlier tomorrow morning ... How about 6 O' clock? we'll play for the whole day ... I'm not satisfied today ..."  Then, Li Hao turned around and walked out.
        Behind him, yunyao waited for him to open the door. When she saw Liu Yan and the others outside, she said lightly,""I'm almost out of clothes. Are you happy to be taken advantage of by that shameless person?"
        At the door, Liu Yan crossed her arms and sized him up. She smiled like a fox. "It's alright, but it's bleeding. Otherwise, it would be white and tender. It should feel good to the touch!"
        Li Hao glanced at her helplessly, but he didn't feel embarrassed."So be it. Don't I still have underpants?"
        He turned around and went back to change into a new set of clothes.
        At the door, Liu Yan looked on silently for a while before her smile disappeared. She then looked at Liu Long and said after a long while,"Boss, after you're done with him, you'll fight with me!"
        “……”
        Go to hell!
        Liu Long's face darkened as he went in to change his clothes.
        Fight my ass!
        Clearly, Liu Yan had been provoked.
        Looking at Liu Long's condition, it was clear that Li Hao's strength might have exceeded everyone's expectations.
        Liu Yan didn't say anything. She walked in and looked at the situation in the basement. Many places had been smashed into pieces. After making a judgment, she was a little shocked.
        He was too strong!
        She looked at yunyao again, walked over, and whispered,""What's his strength?"
        "Perfection!"
        Yunyao glanced at her, threw out these two words, and went straight into the house.
        Liu Yan, on the other hand, was stunned on the spot.
        Perfection!
        A hundred percent completion!
        She had thought that even if Li Hao broke through 100, his improvement wouldn't be that fast, but ... Li Hao had perfected it!
        At this moment, she suddenly felt a little depressed, a little jealous, and a little envious.
        The next moment, she suddenly rushed into yunyao's room, gritted her teeth, and whispered,""You and I will fight tonight! I've broken through the peak of the early 100th stage, and you, moonlight waning moon, are on the same level. Do you want to improve?"
        Yunyao wanted to say something, but Liu Yan lowered her voice and said,""It's too slow to absorb the mysterious energy normally. I can only absorb it quickly by fighting to the death! I've long found you an eyesore. Hitting you ... I think I can be ruthless!"
        "Same!"
        Yunyao wanted to refuse, but when she thought of everything that had happened today, she suddenly agreed.
        He snorted and said coldly,"I'll beat you up!"
        Liu Yan puffed out her chest and sneered."I'm afraid that you won't explode even if you get hit. Instead, you'll grow bigger. I'll fulfill your wish!"
        At this moment, the glint of blades and the shadow of swords filled the small room.
        ……
        Li Hao, on the other hand, changed his clothes and ran.
        He was so, so hungry!
        He felt like he could eat an entire cow.
        Bull, I'm not eating anymore.
        When he went back to eat the power of the five elements, he felt that he could absorb another 100 cubic meters tonight!
        I'll stuff myself to death, then go to the inspection Office tomorrow morning and continue to fight with the captain.
        It felt so good!
         Li Hao was overjoyed. He missed the feeling of his fists hitting the flesh. It felt so good. So fighting was like this. It was much better than scheming.
        Not only that, Li Hao felt that if this continued, he would be able to integrate inner strength into his body in a few days.
        Under normal circumstances, that would take a few months.
        However, no one would be like him, playing for seven hours straight and still being at his peak.
        As for his opponent, his sparring partner, he had also sparred with him for seven hours straight. This was an opponent that ordinary people would find difficult to find.
        ……
        At this moment.
        In the law enforcement building, Liu Long sneezed and suddenly felt a little worried ... Would they really have to fight until they reached the remains?
        He was afraid that he couldn't handle it.
        In the end, douqian was still human.
       
        Time passed day by day in the battle.
        Li Hao's daily routine was to compete, absorb sword energy, absorb the power of the five elements, sleep, compete ...
        This cycle continued.
        He enjoyed it.
        He was happy, but Liu Long wasn't happy at all. He was really tired.
        He couldn't use his full power to kill Li Hao.
        He couldn't be too careless either. If he was even a little careless, he might be counterattacked by Li Hao and be riddled with wounds.
        However, Liu Long's pain was also accompanied by some happiness.
        He had seen Li Hao's strength, and he was delighted. He could see that Li Hao was getting stronger day by day, and the progress of integrating his internal force was also obvious.
        All the night patrollers in Blizzard Silver City had been immersed in cultivation.
         Liu Yan and Yun Yao would fight for half a day every night until both sides were bruised and swollen. The next day, they were unwilling to come out and see anyone. They would hide in their rooms to reduce the swelling and wait until night to continue the battle.
        Wu Chao and Chen Jian also knew that their Captain and Li Hao were sparring, and that Liu Yan and Yun Yao were sparring. They had just broken through 100 levels, and their strength was about the same. Thus, they also started sparring every day.
        In the law enforcement tower, the internal department was bustling all of a sudden, but it was cold and quiet on the outside. Other than a little movement on the day of its establishment, there was almost no movement after that. They did not even come out of the law enforcement tower.
        This made many people who paid attention to the night patrolmen speechless.
        Are Liu Long and the others not working anymore?
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com In the entire Nightwalker division, apart from Li Hao who went to and from work as usual, Wang Ming and the others were the only ones who would go out sometimes. Sometimes, the purpose of going out was just to go shopping ... Yes, Li Meng had even gone shopping.
        That was real shopping!
        Someone stared at them for a while and felt extremely depressed. For a moment, he couldn't understand this group of people.
        ……
        The law enforcement team.
        Wang Ming had been very carefree these days, and he didn't have anything to do, so no one cared about him. Liu Long had been busy sparring with Li Hao these days, and after that, he had no energy to care about others.
        At this moment, he was walking back and forth in the hall on the first floor.
        When he saw someone come in, his eyes lit up and he hurried forward.""Li Hao!"
        "Old Wang!"
        Li Hao was full of energy and had just ridden over from home.
        "Is there something?"
        He was busy looking for the captain to spar.
        These few days, he felt more and more that his inner strength was transforming into the shape of a sword. If this continued, he would be able to complete the true integration at any time. His inner strength would merge with the force and become a genuine one hundred percent completion.
        Wang Ming wasn't in a hurry to speak, but instead sized him up before saying,"Chief Liu has been looking like he's going to die for the past few days. He has dark circles under his eyes and doesn't seem to be sleeping well. How are you fine?"
        "Li Hao," he said, a little curious,"you just broke through 100. You didn't gain much from sparring with chief Liu, did you?"
        He could understand why the others were sparring.  He didn't quite understand Li Hao and Liu Long's sparring.
        To be honest, he would not gain much from sparring with riyao.
        What was the point of Li Hao doing this?
        Liu Long had actually accompanied them all this time, which was really strange.
        "It's alright!"
        Li Hao walked upstairs. When he saw Wang Ming follow him, he couldn't help but say,"Why are you following me? Is there a problem? You and Hu Hao can also spar ..."
        "What sparring?"
        Wang Ming shook his head."Hu Hao is from the soaring Department, Li Meng is from the eye of truth, and I'm from the main attack department. We're not from the same system, so there's no way we can compare notes. It's different from martial masters."
        He wasn't slacking off, but he was really useless.
        For example, if he fought with Hu Hao and Hu Hao flew directly into the sky, what would he do?
        Looking up from underground?
        Shooting a flying sword from the ground and shooting Hu Hao down?
        Are you kidding?
        He then added,"supers like us are mainly absorbing mysterious energy at this stage. Actually, it's not that bad. I've made some progress recently. Previously, I've divided quite a lot of mysterious energy. I think that when I'm done absorbing all of it, I might be able to step into the full moon level."
        He was currently at the full moon stage. For a super, from full moon to full moon, there was no need for the cooperation of any Shi, nor was there a need to sense it.
        Even the sunshine powerhouses did not have much influence.
        The cultivation methods of both parties were different.
        Otherwise, it would not have been so easy for a superpower to step into the realm of sunlight.
        Li Hao had some knowledge of the superpower system, but he was not very familiar with it. He smiled and said,""Then congratulations!"
        "Don't be in such a hurry to congratulate me!"
         "It's like this. Last time, you said that with the help of the Scion of the blood God, the absorption of the mysterious energy will be even faster. Is that true?"Wang Ming said hurriedly.
        "What? you don't believe me?"
        "It's not that I don't believe you ..."
        "Blood God," Wang Ming explained,"there aren't many left with the night patrollers. If it's really useful, I'll pay a high price to get a few to try. But if it's useless and I get it, wouldn't it be a waste? I've asked around. There's only one at the glorious sun rank and three at the Dark Moon rank left among the night watchers. That's all of them!"
        That's four!
        Originally, there were still 9 left, but most of them were awarded to the Silver City.
        Li Hao was a little surprised, but also a little taken for granted. It seemed that Minister hou hadn't killed Red moon's men for a long time.
        "You're quite capable to be able to find out about this. "
        "Isn't that normal?"
        Wang Ming chuckled."I'm a genius, after all, and it's recorded in white moon city's records. I'll just ask how many blood deities we have and how to exchange them. The higher-ups won't deliberately hide it from me. It's not an origin divine weapon, so why would they keep it a secret?"
       
        In fact, Li Hao had always had a doubt in his heart.
        Now that Wang Ming had mentioned it again, he couldn't help but ask,"Old Wang, you've always said that you're a genius. What is the definition of a genius by a super?"
        He was very curious about this.
        Only those who improve quickly are geniuses?
        Some people had more mysteries, and some had less. It also depended on their family background. Those who had money and power could get more mysteries, absorb more, and improve quickly. Was this a genius?
        Wasn't that genius a little too rash?
        When Wang Ming heard this, he was a little anxious."Are you suspecting me?"
        "No, I'm really asking."
        Wang Ming snorted in dissatisfaction, but he knew Li Hao didn't understand, so he explained,"Supers, the definition of genius can be simply divided into a few aspects. First, the efficiency of the absorption of the mysterious energy. "
        "For example, if I absorb a cube of mysterious energy, I can store 0.7 cubic meters of metal-type mysterious energy and distribute 0.3 cubic meters."
         Li Hao raised his eyebrows slightly.
        Conversion efficiency!
        This one was really amazing, being able to preserve 70% of it.
        Li Hao knew that the mysterious energy was dispersed. He absorbed the mysterious energy as well. With the help of the sword, he could save it quickly, but without the help of the sword, he could only save about 50 to 60 percent of it even if he used the breathing technique of five birds.
        As for the others, they didn't use the breathing technique of five birds, so they kept even less.
        For example, Liu Yan and the others could only absorb twenty to thirty percent.
        Wang Ming could actually convert seventy percent. Just from this point alone, this guy could indeed be considered a genius ... Of course, he was a genius with good talent.
        "That's the first thing. The second thing is how many super locks have been developed!"Wang Ming continued.
        Li Hao was all ears.
        He really didn't understand this.
        "There are superpower locks in human bodies ... Even the God bless priests have them!"
        Wang Ming explained,"it's just that the divine priest blessed by the heavens" super locks are naturally open, but it doesn't mean that they've opened all of them. At present, the number of super locks in the field of superpowers is classified as nine!" You were born with one Super Lock unlocked, so you can be considered a god tier master blessed by the heavens ... Because you were born with the power of a star light Master, there are no obstacles for you to become a star light Master. "
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "If you can unlock two of the Super locks, you will be able to enter the Dark Moon without any difficulty. You can absorb the mysterious energy directly. As long as there is enough, you will be able to enter the Dark Moon instantly."
        "And so on. You were born with three openings and directly entered the glorious sun ..."
        He said enviously,"this is a heavenly priest!" Among the God's favored priests that we know of, the strongest are those who were born with three unlocked super locks. They entered the glorious sun and started at the glorious sun ... The glorious sun is the end of many people, but it's only their starting point!"
        Li Hao nodded in agreement.  Amazing!
        As a natural-born Sunstrider, one's starting point was the end of one's potential, let alone the future. Even if one didn't make any further progress in the future, one would never be able to catch up to them in their lifetime.
        God tier master blessed by the heavens ... He was indeed blessed by the heavens.
        Wang Ming continued,"and people like us can only slowly develop it ourselves. Super locks don't mean that you can discover nine at the start, but you have to slowly develop them ... Some people can discover three or four at the Starlight master level ... If they can discover three or four, it means that they have hope of entering the solar three suns in the future!"
        "Some people still haven't discovered the fourth SuperLock even after reaching the glorious sun realm. This means that it's difficult for them to unlock the fourth SuperLock with their three suns ... Because they haven't discovered where it is!"
        With just the strength of the sun glory, even at the peak, one couldn't break the seal of the body. It wasn't that there was no way, but that one couldn't find it and didn't know where to open it. Naturally, one would have no potential.
        Li Hao understood what he meant and asked,""How many locks did you find?"
        Wang Ming was a Dark Moon, so logically speaking, he had only opened two super locks. Could this guy have developed three or four?
        "Five!"
        "Amazing, right?" Wang Ming said proudly.
        Li Hao laughed and nodded,"amazing!" However, old Wang, if the power is locked in my body, does that mean that I can say as many as I want? if that's the case, no one can deny it. If I say I found 100, how would others know?"
        "Then you're underestimating the abilities of supers!"
        "It's not that simple!"Wang Ming shook his head. "Of course, it's difficult to investigate using ordinary methods. However, the night watchers will usually conduct an inspection on newcomers. They need to pass the inspection of the origin god weapon. The origin god weapon can confirm how many super locks you have found."
        "What?"
        "Huh?" Li Hao's interest was piqued."How did you find out?"
         "Why do you understand this? you're not a superhuman."
        Li Hao laughed,"who knows, maybe I'll become a super too?" Furthermore, I feel like I have at least 10 superpower locks on me!"
        Wang Ming smiled politely and indifferently.
        Nonsense!
        You can continue talking nonsense.
        Li Hao sounded like he was joking, but he was not.
        10 super locks?
        He felt that it was more than that. There were a few times when he was cultivating when the superpower lock appeared. Just from what he felt, he felt that he had at least 10 organs. There was also a superpower lock on his head and limbs.
        There were too many!
        There were so many of them that Li Hao sometimes even suspected that the heavens didn't allow him to enter the superpower realm. He thought that he had to break all the superpower locks, but now it seemed that one was enough.
