        hen didn't care too much about this. He stood up and said, "Let's go to the nine Dragon Pavilion for dinner. "
         "The Minister's side should be able to sign it very quickly. You'll be the Vice Governor of Tian Xing city soon."
         "What's the use?"
         Li Hao asked.
         Hou Xiaochen walked out and laughed,"Of course it's useful. As long as the dynasty doesn't collapse, it'll be useful. Of course, the prerequisite is that you must be strong enough. Otherwise ... You'll end up like Xu Qing. If you're killed, it won't be of much use. "
         "However, it's still very useful in Heavenly Star City. This isn't the East, but the territory of the nine divisions and the imperial family. If anyone dares to kill a Heavenly Star Vice Governor head-on ... Even if all the families wish for you to die early, they'll still save you. Even if you're killed, I'll still avenge you. "
         Li Hao smiled helplessly.
         Just like this?
         I thought what would happen.
         "There's another benefit. You can get a small house in stellarsky city. Although it's small, it's hard to buy a house in stellarsky city. The location is also very good. It's on Jiusi Street,"Chief Steward Yu said coldly.
          “……”
         Hou Xiaochen wanted to roll his eyes!
         You're talking about this at this time?
         Li Hao laughed,"not bad!" The treatment is alright, can I get the property certificate?"
         “……”
         Hou Xiaochen couldn't stand these two. He felt that there was something wrong with Xiao Yu.
         "Let's go!"
         He stood up and walked out, but Li Hao did not follow him. Instead, he followed Chief Steward Yu and asked curiously,""I'm the Imperial inspector, can I get a carriage?"
         "Yes, I can."
         "When will you give me some?"
         "Tomorrow,"
         "Do you want me to find the driver myself or do you want me to drive?"
         "As you wish."
         "Manager Yu, I've been forgetting to ask, what level are you?"
         “……”
         Steward Yu did not say a word and ignored him.
         You're asking so many questions, aren't you just trying to find out whose level is higher?
         You're even higher, alright?
         Hou Xiaochen was also speechless.
         "Right, where are senior golden spear and the others?" Li Hao asked.
         "They went to patrol the stellarsky city."
         "You should keep a low profile here," Chief Steward Yu said."Be careful. You need a name for everything you do here. If you don't ... It'll be very dangerous!" Fortunately, the night patrolman is currently the only extraordinary law enforcement agency of the Government and has the power to enforce the law. You just have to remember this. "  As for the rest, they were not important.
         Li Hao was deep in thought."So, I can commit crimes. But others can't control me, right?" he asked.
         "Yes,"
         "However, the Marquis has the final say among the night patrollers. If others want to arrest you, then there's nothing we can do."
         "Understood!"
         Li Hao nodded."I know a Deputy Minister called Huang Long. He doesn't seem to be on good terms with the Minister. How strong is he?"
         "He's long since entered the transformation stage. As for whether or not he'll be able to step into the divine power stage, I don't know,"
         Up ahead, hou Xiaochen had already gone downstairs. He calmly said, "Don't take the night patrolman's only law-enforcement power too seriously ... Because it's very easy to be a night patrolman. They're only at the level of a Deputy Minister. If you want someone to join ... There's no need for any procedures. In other words, when someone attacks you ... As long as we say the word, the other party will be the night patrolman!"
         "Of course, if the level is different, if the other party attacks you, it would be an insubordination ... However, that's an internal matter. Everything can only be discussed after the matter. "In short, in the city, keep a low profile when you need to, and don't go too far ... Everything that causes trouble has a purpose, a goal, and not for no reason ... Only an idiot would do that!"
         Li Hao kept nodding.
         "Then, to eat at the nine Dragon Pavilion ..."
         "I know some people, who can't be provoked and who can be provoked. It's considered paying respects to the mountain, so that you don't mess around."
         Li Hao was depressed.
         "I never mess around!"
         "What about the Xu family?"
         "It's just that I struck first! I've killed Xu Zhen, I've killed Xu Feng, and so many of the Xu family's generals have been killed by the holy sword. He won't let us go, and the enemy is so powerful, so of course he has to make the first move!"
         "If it wasn't for the fact that someone went to save you, you would have died for sure for being so reckless!" Chief Yu could not help but say.
         "Not necessarily!" Li Hao shook his head.
         Chief Steward Yu was too lazy to pay attention to him.
         But Li Hao really thought so.
         If you didn't push Xu Qing to the extreme, he wouldn't do such a self-mutilating thing.
          That day, his teacher and the others had been doing something ... In any case, Li Hao felt that he still had a chance to escape.
         Of course, things had changed with the passage of time, and there was not much point in saying this.
         Moreover, his teacher and the others had risked their lives to save him. Li Hao didn't mention this and simply remembered it.
         Li Hao said,"I won't mess around here. Besides, aren't you two here?" I have a sense of security, and you two have some confidence in me. I can unseal it at will, what are you afraid of?"
         He then added,"if you push me too far, I won't be easy to deal with. At most, I'll break the superpower lock and become a superpower. Once I become a superpower, my potential will be released. I'll probably be even stronger than I am now!"
         Completely breaking the superpower lock ...
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Chief Steward Yu glanced at him, but Li Hao didn't take it seriously. What?
         I'm not afraid of my internal organs exploding!
         I'm not afraid even if all of them were to break, let alone one.
         My physical body and five internal organs are top-notch. I won't die even if I don't have the sword energy. If I release the potential in the superpower lock, I won't be able to step into the divine power realm instantly, but I won't be killed by the divine power.
        
         Without confidence, would Li Hao dare to come to stellarsky city?
         He wasn't the kind of person to place all his hopes on hou Xiaochen. Otherwise, he would die without even knowing how he died.
         Hou Xiaochen didn't say anything else.
         The group of three people and a dog walked towards the parking lot. It looked like they were going to take a car.
         As soon as the three of them arrived at the parking area, hou Xiaochen's car drove out. The driver was still the same driver from before. This one never seemed to rest or sleep. Li Hao was actually a little curious. How strong was this driver?
         He should be a pure Martial Master, and his strength was not weak.
         Before the three of them got into the car, Xiao Ye ran over in a hurry from the distance. She was out of breath and hurriedly said,""Minister hou, this is the warrant signed by the Minister ... Are you going out?"
         "Let's go out for a meal!"
         "Oh!"
         Xiao Ye was a little curious, but she didn't ask for more details. Instead, she handed the warrant over to hou Xiaochen.
          Hou Xiaochen chuckled and threw it to Li Hao.
         The three of them got into the car. This time, Li Hao got into the passenger's seat immediately. He picked up the token and looked at it. It had hou Xiaochen's and the Minister's signatures.
         Yao si!
         Li Hao was stunned. What ... Is this?
         "Our boss's name ... Is that?"
         "What's wrong?"hou Xiaochen chuckled. At that time, it would be normal to have these names. "
         Okay.
         Yao si must die!
         This name was not auspicious.
         Holding the token, Li Hao laughed happily. He was promoted!
         p Vice Governor Tian Xing.  Of course, Li Hao, who had seen many things, didn't think there was anything good about it. Be it the inspection Office or the military law Department, they were both very decadent.
         But ... Why not take the money for free?
         If he treated Jiusi as an imaginary enemy, then wouldn't it be great if he took all the money that the enemy sent?
         The small car started to drive away.
         ……
         The department head's office.
         The old man walked to the window again and looked into the distance with an indescribable expression on his face.
         The Vice Governor of heavenstar!
         Hou Xiaochen was quite interesting. Was he so sure that he would approve?
         Li Hao's rank was naturally high enough. Li Hao could even be the Heavenly Star Governor, let alone the Deputy Governor. Of course, that required the signature of the Secretary of the inspection Division. The Deputy Governor, on the other hand, only needed to be decided internally.
         Where to now?
         Hou Xiaochen had stayed in stellarsky city almost all the time, but Li Hao had taken him out as soon as he arrived ... For dinner?
         Where to eat?
         Don't tell me he's not going to the nine Dragons Pavilion!
         "It's getting more and more interesting!"
         The old man laughed and didn't care anymore.
         ……
         The small car drove out of the Nightwalker headquarters and headed towards the end.
         At the end of Jiusi Street.
         The nine divisions were like the eight trigrams, but there were nine of them, which were like long Dragons. The nine Dragon Pavilion was located at the point where the nine Dragons converged ... It was the Imperial Palace!
         That's right, the nine Dragons Pavilion was near the Imperial Palace!  Hou Xiaochen looked straight ahead and casually said,"The nine Dragons Pavilion is a place where the important figures of the nine divisions eat and have fun ... Of course, that's just what they say. In fact, the nine Dragons Pavilion is a place where the nine divisions monitors the royal family, and all the important figures go there."
         "It's close to the Imperial Palace. If you look up, you can even see the interior of the Imperial Palace."
         "The nine Dragons Pavilion has nine levels ... And only the secretaries can enter the nine levels."
         Li Hao nodded.
         "Then who opened the nine Dragon Pavilion?"
         "Hahaha, that's a good question."
         "The nine Dragon Pavilion ... It's opened by the royal family!" Hou Xiaochen smiled.
         Li Hao was stunned.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Are you crazy?
         Opening up a place for people to monitor him?
         However, on second thought, it was quite interesting. Since he knew that Jiusi was worried about him, he would make Jiusi feel at ease. He would open the nine Dragon Pavilion by himself.
         You guys come and monitor me!
         Come at me!
         "Is the royal family very strong?"
         "Yes."
         "Then 80 years ago, why ..."
         "I don't know,"
         Li Hao was a little surprised. There's something you don't know?
         "I wasn't even born 80 years ago," hou Xiaochen replied calmly,"how would I know about this? why did the royal family fall ... Who knows?" No one knows why the nine divisions rose to power. Perhaps only the nine secretaries and the imperial family know. "
         "That's right." Li Hao nodded and continued,"the big shots of the nine divisions don't go to the nine Dragons Pavilion every day, do they?"
         "At least five out of ten days!"
         "How carefree."
         Hou Xiaochen didn't even bother to reply. You call this carefree?
         Alright, it's fine if you think so.
         The small carriage continued to move forward. Jiusi Street was quite long. They drove all the way to the end ... In the distance, a huge object came into view.
         It was incomparably huge!
         It was the star Palace.
         However, it was slightly dark, and the lights were like will-o '-the-wisps. The other places were brightly lit, but the palace was extremely dark.
         The nine Dragons Pavilion was not located inside the Imperial Palace. It was located outside the Imperial Palace, near the eastern gate.
         There was an ancient tower-like building standing there.
         It was a little abrupt.
          This was because there was originally only the Imperial Palace in the middle of the nine divisions. The addition of the nine Dragon Pavilion seemed a little strange.
         At this moment, the building was brightly lit.
         Li Hao opened his transcendence vision and looked into the distance.
         His eyes narrowed.
         He had quite a few superpowers!
         Moreover, they were all very powerful.
         And this was only the power of supers. How could the big shots of the nine divisions not know the disadvantages of superpowers?
         Perhaps many people were still walking the path of martial masters, or perhaps they were like hou Xiaochen and the others, walking the path of superpowers before martial masters. If hou Xiaochen and the others could do it, it was not impossible for the nine divisions to do it.
         In that case, he could only see it when he got close.
         At this moment, Li Hao suddenly frowned. A small mirror appeared in his hand. He had two mirrors. One was the one he had obtained when he killed Qiao Feilong in the Silver City. It seemed to have yet to be unsealed.
        
         One was the one he had obtained from the high Duke's public house, and it seemed to only be a fragment.
         At this moment, the mirror fragment that the high Duke's public house had obtained was trembling slightly.
         Li Hao frowned and looked around.
         Someone was monitoring him!
         Or to monitor this car, that was not important. What was important was that ... It might also be one of the mirror fragments.
         Li Hao quickly put away the mirror fragment.
         He had a sudden realization. Something similar probably existed in this place. If that was the case ... He looked at the Imperial Palace, which meant that someone in the Imperial Palace was also monitoring them.
         Interesting!
         The imperial family didn't build the nine Dragon Pavilion to monitor those people, did they?
         Furthermore, it felt even more concealed.
          This meant that the mirror shard from the imperial family might be bigger and stronger, so Li Hao did not feel anything. However, in the high Duke's public house, Li Hao actually felt something.
         "Does Jiusi know?"
         Li Hao thought to himself.
         He had seen the surveillance footage in the Xu family. It was extremely clear and he could even hear the sounds. Didn't that mean that the other party could know everything that happened here?
         Jiusi might not know.
         Otherwise, with so many people coming to the nine Dragons Pavilion, some news would have leaked ... Of course, to the nine divisions, it was possible that they had deliberately spread some false news.
         Even before he entered the nine Dragons Pavilion, Li Hao could already feel the darkness and schemes of the Heavenly Star City.
         Behind them, hou Xiaochen glanced at Li Hao.
         Li Hao sent a voice transmission, someone is watching us.
         Hou Xiaochen wasn't surprised at all. "It's normal. Whether it's the nine divisions or the royal family, it's impossible for them not to pay attention to the whereabouts of the strong. When my carriage came out, it would naturally attract attention."
         "Minister, don't be too confident. Just speak directly. Be careful not to be spied on."
         "It's not that exaggerated,"hou Xiaochen laughed." If that was the case, I would've sensed it. "
         "What if it's a heaven-peeking mirror fragment?"
         "It shouldn't be ... It's more like an imitation fragment," hou Xiaochen replied after a long pause. According to ancient records, the true heaven peeking mirror is omnipotent and unbelievably powerful. It's easy for it to spy on the entire world ... Even its fragments are not something that people of today can control and use. "
         Li Hao was a little surprised that the Minister knew about it.
         "The thing you just took out is a fragment, right?"
         "Yes."
         "Make good use of it."
         Hou Xiaochen laughed,"others might not be able to refine it, but you might." If I can refine it ... It'll be good for eavesdropping, surveillance, and the like. "
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He had tried, but it didn't work. This thing seemed to be a pure fragment without any spirituality.
         There was no such thing as refining.
         While they were chatting, the car stopped in front of the nine Dragons Pavilion. In an instant, a few female superhumans came up and opened the door for them enthusiastically.
         They were all supers!
         Li Hao's eyes flickered. This was quite a generous move, but it was normal. What was this place?
          The core of the world!  The nine Dragons Pavilion, which was opened by the royal family to entertain important people, had many superpowers such as moonlight and sunlight.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Governor hou's presence brings light to our humble dwelling ..."
         As they spoke, a woman in her thirties walked out. She wasn't enchanting, but had a pure and capable feeling. Pure, usually silly and sweet, but this woman gave people an extremely capable feeling.
         It was a very special temperament!
         As soon as the car door opened, the other party greeted him with a smile. When he saw Li Hao, he was a little confused. This outfit ... Where did this weirdo come from?
         Hou Xiaochen didn't say anything. The three of them got out of the car, and the driver drove off.
         Li Hao looked around and was a little envious. He was so rich.
         There was a huge divine power Stone at the door that acted as a light bulb.
         It exuded a little bit of mysterious energy and was exceptionally pure. It gave people a comfortable and refreshing feeling the moment they came here.
         There were some flowers and plants in front of the building.
         Li Hao took a closer look ... It seemed that there was a surge of energy. These could probably be considered heavenly treasures.
         Hou Xiaochen, on the other hand, didn't seem surprised at all. Even though this was his first time here, he didn't care. He said, "Let's find a place to eat. "
         "Alright, Minister hou, please!"
         The woman smiled and didn't say anything. The security guards and doormen at the door were all superhumans. They bent their bodies and the crystal door in front of them was opened quickly.
         A huge Hall came into view.
         There were some people waiting in the lobby. Some were drivers, secretaries, or officials of the ninth Department of the ninth Bureau of lower ranks. They were all waiting in line to eat.
         When the door opened, the group of people were stunned.
         When they saw hou Xiaochen, they were all shocked. A moment later, many of the members of the nine divisions quickly straightened their bodies.
         Some people from the inspection Office or the night patrol even stood up directly."Hello, Minister hou!"
         Hou Xiaochen nodded slightly and continued walking.
         As for Li Hao, he was holding his small scepter and wearing a top hat. He looked around and smiled.
         His strange outfit caught the attention of many people.
         "Why are you dressed like this?" Chief Steward Yu could not help but ask.
          It was a very embarrassing feeling!
         "Don't you think it's very elegant?"
         "I ..."
         Chief Steward Yu was speechless. Elegant?
         It was very silly, alright!
         Chief Steward Yu didn't bother to say anything more, while Li Hao was still immersed in his own world. Wasn't he handsome?
         It didn't matter if he was handsome or not ... But it was more convenient for him to use his sword.
         You can't be running with a sword on your back, right?
         At the same time, he could also nurture his sword.
         He had already decided that he would be like this in the future. Only by wearing this and holding the starry sky sword's scepter in disguise would it be suitable for him to attack and nurture his sword at the first moment.
        
         His sword nurturing technique had not been able to produce any results. It was just that the time he had spent nurturing it was too short.
         Moreover, he couldn't always show off with his sword, right?
         How good it was now!
         At this moment, the woman who was leading the way in front of him was still enthusiastic. She said,""Minister hou, there are two restaurants. The second floor has more people, while the seventh floor has fewer people. There are also some private rooms on the seventh floor. Minister Huang and the others usually like to dine on the seventh floor ..."
         "What about the 9th floor?"
         Hou Xiaochen spoke, but the woman's smile didn't falter. She continued,"There are dining places on the ninth floor, but there aren't many places. There are only nine private rooms, and they're all reserved. They're reserved for years."
         Nine!
         Needless to say, the Secretary of the nine divisions did.
         "The nine secretaries are all here today?" hou Xiaochen chuckled.
         "No, there are five private rooms that are empty. Minister hou, do you want to use them?"
          The woman didn't stop him and continued to smile."However, once those few distinguished guests arrive ... I'm afraid I'll have to trouble you to make way for us. The meal will not be very pleasant. The scenery on the seventh floor is actually similar."
         "Go to the ninth floor!"
         "The 9th floor is better, the view is better. Let's go to the financial division's private room." Hou Xiaochen smiled.
         The woman's expression changed.
         "Is the Financial Secretary here?"
         "He's not here ..."
         "Then let's do this!"
         The woman seemed to think for a moment before she smiled again.""Good, then hou bu, follow me."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Financial Secretary!
         Li Hao thought of a person. The young man from the rising light family who was killed by Qi gang and the others that day was said to be a member of the Liu family.
         The group of them went into the elevator.
         In the hall, everyone seemed to have heard a sound. They were not deaf, and who here did not have some strength?
         At this moment, many people's expressions changed slightly.
         What was hou Xiaochen doing?
         He even snatched the private room of the ninth Secretary. What was this guy doing?
         "He's too arrogant!"
         In the crowd, there were people from the financial division. At this moment, their faces were unsightly as they quickly left the hall. This matter had to be reported immediately. This was not a matter of the dining room, but a matter of hou Xiaochen's deliberate provocation.
         This is crazy!
         The nine Dragon division had been established for 80 years and had always been a symbol of dignity that could not be provoked. But in the end, hou Xiaochen had gone too far ... He'd actually taken a private room in the nine Dragon Pavilion, and even asked the Financial Secretary to book it.
         This was too surprising!
         ……
         In the elevator.
         The elevator went up smoothly.
         Hou Xiaochen didn't seem to think that there was anything wrong with it. It was just a meal and a private room, what was wrong with that?
         On the side, Li Hao didn't care. Instead, he asked curiously,""This ... Beauty, how much is it for a meal?" he asked.
         “……”
         The woman's smile was a little stiff. This was the first time she had been asked this question since she started working. How much did a meal cost?
         Although she was a little speechless, she still said after a while,""It depends on what our distinguished guest is eating. It'll be at least one divine power Stone, and at most, hundreds or thousands ..."
         Li Hao took a deep breath and said,"you're joking, right?" A divine power Stone can be exchanged for 1000 cubic meters of mysterious energy. I remember that a cubic meter of mysterious energy can be sold for One Million Star dollars on the black market ... A divine power Stone is worth one billion star dollars ... Well, although not many people would exchange it like this, one stone is indeed worth a lot of cities ... You, you actually need at least this much for a meal?"
         “……”
         There was a moment of silence in the elevator.
         The woman only wanted to say,"you're good at math, you're amazing ..."
         The smile on his face couldn't be held back, and he forced himself to maintain it. ""Honored guest, the nine Dragon Pavilion is not an ordinary place. You can see that there is mysterious energy overflowing everywhere. There is even life energy overflowing on the ninth floor ..."
         "Spring of life?"
         "Yes ... Of course, it's just a little bit of the spring of life's energy. That's why the guests are satisfied ..."
         "Absorb!"
         Li Hao inhaled."Then a meal on the ninth floor is more expensive, right?" he asked.
         "Of course ... Under normal circumstances ... The starting price would be a hundred divine power stones."
         Li Hao clicked his tongue. This was the minimum. In other words, the nine private rooms would contribute at least a thousand divine power stones in a day.
         In addition to the other eight levels ... Wouldn't this place earn three to five thousand divine power stones a day?
         And this was the minimum spending standard.
         Under normal circumstances, wouldn't it be tens of thousands a day?
         Oh my God!
         Li Hao calculated for a while."How many years has this place been open for?" he asked.
         " 80 years."
         "When did you start Collecting the Divine energy stones?"
         Are you checking your account?
         The female manager's smile was so wide that her face split!
         It was an extremely stiff smile.
         "It's been ... About ten years,"
         "Is the annual turnover 3 million divine energy stones?"
         The female manager looked at hou Xiaochen with a pleading look. Who was this?
         Your subordinate?
          What was he trying to ask?  Hou Xiaochen didn't seem to hear him. He even turned around and didn't look at Li Hao. Li Hao, on the other hand, was surprised."You can't tell me?"
         "No..."
         "Is there?"
         "No... No, I didn 't,"
         The female manager was on the verge of a mental breakdown. She was a first-class guest, and no one said anything bad about her. She answered everything she knew, but this ... Was really strange!
         This was the first time he had met such a person!
         She had no choice but to say,"we don't make that much. About a million a year. But ... We don't actually make much money. We need to buy some treasures. We've also consumed a large number of divine energy stones and various natural treasures ..."
         "So there should be a 10% profit, right?"
         Li Hao did some calculations."That means you'll earn at least 100000 Yuan a year. In ten years, you'll earn a million Yuan ... Are you going to hand it over to the royal family or keep it for yourself?"
         “……”
         The female manager's expression changed. What did he mean?
         This ... Don't tell me you're thinking of robbing me?
         Where was this place?
         This was the core of the nine divisions, the outer circle of the imperial family!
         Someone had actually asked her how the nine Dragons Pavilion's stock was ...
         She had a mental breakdown, and after a long while, she said with difficulty,""Honored guest's question ... I can't answer. I'm not responsible for this."
         As they spoke, the elevator door opened.
         In an instant, the other party took the lead and walked out. He seemed to have lost his composure.
         So depressing!
         Li Hao, on the other hand, touched the small beard on his chin. Definitely!
         A profit of at least one million Yuan.
         He just didn't know if they were sent to the royal family.
         Even if he did ...
         Forget it, he was just thinking about it. The next moment, he asked again,""Can we put it on the tab?"
         “……”
         "Sure!"
         The female manager gritted her teeth."Department hou can put it on the inspection office's account ... But the amount ... Is a little limited."
         "How many can I hang?"
         "One year ... 1000 Yuan!"
         Li Hao was surprised. So many.
         "Then what about the ordinary Imperial inspector?"
         " 500 yuan."
         "Where's the advanced city Patrol?"
         " 100 RMB."
         "It's only limited to the inspection Office system in stellarsky city,"the woman explained.
         Oh!
         Li Hao calculated for a moment, then looked at hou Xiaochen and smiled. The three of us can charge 1600 Yuan ...
         Hou Xiaochen was mentally exhausted!
         Destroy!
         Destroy this guy!
         "Let's eat first, we'll talk about this later!"
         Hou Xiaochen hurriedly walked towards one of the private rooms, and majordomo Yu quickly followed. At this moment, other than a large hall, the other nine private rooms on the nine floors all seemed to be separate halls.
         And there seemed to be people in four of them.
         On the side of the nine divisions, there were actually four secretaries eating here.
         Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. He looked at a few places with people. The next moment, he felt a sharp pain in his eyes and quickly closed them.
         I'll go!
         There were quite a few experts, but most importantly, not all of them. If some of them were pure martial masters, he wouldn't even be able to see them.
         ……
         Meanwhile, in the other private rooms.
         Someone glanced outside and frowned slightly. Someone looked out of the window at the Royal Palace below. Without turning his head, he calmly said,""Let's go and see who's coming up. Did they bring a heavenly eye cultivator? What do you want to do?"
         "Yes!"
         Very quickly, someone took the order and left.
          Li Hao, who had always been successful, did not expect that he would be detected with just a glance. This had never happened before.
         Hou Xiaochen, who was walking in front, said, "Don't look around. I just brought you here to have a look and get to know you. I didn't ask you to look for trouble. If you want trouble, just keep an eye on one ... If you keep an eye on a few, are you afraid that I won't die?"
         Li Hao understood. It seemed that the financial division was targeting them!
         But ... Can you tell that I'm looking at someone else?
         Old hou seemed to have become more powerful!
         In the past, old hou did not seem to feel anything when he looked at him.
         The next moment, they entered a Hall ... Which was also a private room. Li Hao took a deep breath. This was a private room?
         This must be the Imperial Palace!
         A faint life force emerged! Li Hao felt so comfortable that he wanted to moan.
         This money was really well spent!
        
         This wasn't a private room. At a glance, it was at least a thousand square meters, right?
         In the center of the Imperial City, there were nine such private rooms!
         Everything was available in the private room. There was even a huge screen that was displaying something. Li Hao's eyes flickered when he saw it.
         Television?
         It seemed to be!
         There were some records in the ancient books, but the dynasty had not managed to excavate it. He had thought that the dynasty had not managed to excavate it, but from the looks of it, it was not that they had not excavated it, but ... They had not promoted it!
         Not only that, in the middle of the private room, there was something that looked like a ring.
         At that moment, there were a total of eight waitresses in the room. They were all very good-looking and without exception, they were all superpowers. All of them had the power of either Dark Moon or sunlight.
         "Welcome, distinguished guest!"
         As they entered, the waiters quickly stepped forward to help Li Hao undress ...
          Li Hao hurriedly shook his arm."Don't move!"
         Hou Xiaochen glanced at him, too lazy to say anything, and let the waiters take off his coat. Li Hao also glanced at hou Xiaochen. Was that so?
         I'm sorry, I've never experienced it.
         The female manager beside Li Hao was also speechless.
         Of course, she wouldn't show it. Instead, she explained softly,""The honored guest will have a meal later. It's not convenient to wear too much."
         "What's inconvenient about that?"
         Li Hao wouldn't take off someone's clothes. There was no other reason than the silver armor under the windbreaker. He was extremely terrifying. He was afraid of being ambushed, so he wouldn't be completely defenseless. His armor had always been hidden under the windbreaker.
         The female manager was helpless. The two waitresses beside Li Hao were also helpless, but they didn't say anything.
         In this place, they couldn't afford to offend anyone who could come.
         No matter how country bumpkins they were, they were still big shots.
         Even if he was a driver, he was the driver of an important figure.
         Chief Steward Yu didn't ask them to take off their clothes. He waved his hand casually and sent away a few waiters beside him.
         The female manager didn't say anything else. She led Li Hao to the dining table and introduced him as they walked. She could tell that despite Li Hao's strange appearance, he was actually a country bumpkin and not the leader of fashion.
         "This way please, esteemed guest!"
         "That's the Douluo arena's real-time broadcast ..."She pointed at the large screen.
         "What Douluo arena?"
         "Because there are too many supers in Sky Star City and too many grudges. However, Sky Star City is an Imperial City and it can not suppress these supers limitlessly to avoid causing even greater trouble. Hence, Sky Star City has a huge Douluo arena. All the supers who have grudges can fight in it as long as both sides are willing! Whether it's a Deathmatch or sparring, it's all fine ... And the winner can even get a sum of prize money from the Douluo arena. "
         Li Hao frowned,"what the hell?" Of course, the night patrolmen would be the ones to settle the feud between the superpowers! Fighting in private was illegal! Didn't you learn the law? Did the night patrolman build this place?" This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The female manager hesitated for a moment and shook her head helplessly.""No."
         "Who's the boss behind the scenes?"
         “……”
         She looked at hou Xiaochen, who had already sat down. The manager could only say,"Financial Secretary."
         "No wonder!"
         Li Hao snorted."This is taking away my right as a Nightwalker. No wonder the financial division is so rich. With the Douluo arena, there is no lack of gambling. With gambling, there is profit. With profit, there is fighting ... These places where superpowers fight like wild beasts, the ticket price is a huge number. The profit, can you imagine ... Is it the financial division's turn to intervene in this matter?"
         The female manager did not say anything.
         At this moment, she was a little confused. Who was this person?
         It had to be said that Li Hao instantly pointed out the key point. The profits were too great, very, very great. Fights between superpowers were not rare, but they were usually in the wilderness. The aristocrats in the city would not go to the wilderness to see those life-and-death fights.
         But here, they could watch it live, and the money involved in the transactions would probably be astronomical.
         This business was monopolized by the financial division.
         Li Hao suddenly understood why hou Xiaochen had used the financial division as a stepping stone. Li Hao suddenly laughed,"The inspection Office didn't get involved? This is clearly a violation of the inspector's rights. "
         "I guess they were involved, but I don't think they managed to get it back," hou Xiaochen replied calmly.
         "So cowardly?" Li Hao laughed.
         The two of them were unscrupulous and said these things in front of these people without any scruples. There was no point in saying things that everyone knew.
         Hou Xiaochen picked up his teacup and took a sip. It was Chief Steward Yu who had poured the tea for him. As for the few attendants who wanted to interfere, Chief Steward Yu waved them away.
         Li Hao also sat down. The female manager, who had originally wanted to escape, was now more curious and did not leave.
          These two ... How many people could talk to hou Xiaochen like this?
         At this moment, she was full of curiosity about Li Hao.
         This person was definitely a first-time visitor to stellarsky city ... Could he be a member of Silver Moon?
         Silver Moon ... Who was he?
         He was not old ...
         There was such a person in Silver Moon, but the most famous one was demonic sword Li Hao.
         However, Li Hao dared to come to stellarsky city?
         She carefully glanced at Li Hao. The more she looked at him, the more he looked like him. The nine Dragons Pavilion had Li Hao's portrait, but the person in front of her ... Seemed to be different, but also very similar.
         Seeing that Li Hao had sat down, the female manager didn't ask the waitress to do anything. She personally poured a cup of tea and said in a low voice,""Honored guest, these are tea leaves that have been soaked in the spring of life ..."
         Li Hao took a sip and then said with some disdain,""Stingy! This thing has been diluted a thousand times, right?"
        
         “……”
         Silence.
         The female manager knew that although the man in front of her was uncouth, he had probably taken the spring of life before. Just as he said, a drop of the spring of life was diluted by more than a thousand times.
         The female manager was silent for a moment before she whispered,""It's not that there aren't any complete ones, it's just that ... The price is slightly higher. "
         "You're selling the spring of life?"
         The female manager nodded slightly."I'm not selling it. However, if you need it, I can provide some temporarily."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "How much?"
         " 100000 divine power stones for one drop."
         Li Hao laughed,"are you kidding me?" Doesn't that mean that a cup of tea is 100 divine energy stones?"
         "This is for the private room. It's free."
          "You need to pay for the private room?"
         "Yes,"
         "How much?"
         "The private room on the ninth floor. The minimum price for each use is 500 divine power stones."
         Li Hao smiled. Was it expensive?
         It was very expensive!
         However, if there were really 100000 divine power stones, but there was no way to get the spring of life, would anyone be willing to trade?
         There was!
         Li Hao looked for little tree. Little tree charged him 10000 Yuan for a drop, as well as a large handling fee.
         But here, 10 times!
         Li Hao didn't say anything else. He glanced at the big screen, which was currently playing an image of two supers fighting to the death in an arena. Both of them were from sunlight, and it was an exciting fight.
         Li Hao only glanced at it, then looked at the ring in the center of the private room.""What's this arena for?"
         "If you like, you can get someone to come here and perform a Challenge Tournament. Or if you have some disputes with other noble people ... You can also use this place to fight."
         The manager explained,"the privacy here is very strong. This place is built by the top Espers. There are also defensive barriers set up by Espers with special elements around the ring to prevent the mysterious energy from spreading."
         "No wonder it's so expensive!"
         Li Hao nodded, then looked at the crystal-like tableware on the table.""They're all made of top-grade divine power stones. Aren't you afraid of them being taken away?"
         The female manager smiled."No, they won 't. Those who can come are all distinguished guests!"
         In other words, it was impossible for him to lose face.
          "This thing seems to be a cultivation-aiding energy stone."  Li Hao casually picked up a bowl and said with emotion,""Just this one bowl, if thrown out, even three yang would break their heads! But here, it's just food. The royal family is still rich, and so are the nine divisions. "
         "Why else would everyone fight for power?" hou Xiaochen laughed. This is the privilege of the upper class. Look, aren't you sitting here and enjoying this? Watching superpowers perform for you, eating a meal that costs hundreds or thousands of divine stones ..."
         Li Hao laughed,"I'm just trying to broaden my horizons!" I can't afford to enjoy it.
         "You still lack this little bit of money?"
         "Not bad,"
         Li Hao laughed."I robbed the Xu family's treasure vault and got a lot of money. I got more than a million divine power stones. But here, I've lost a few thousand for a meal. I've lost more than ten thousand for three meals a day ... I'll be bankrupt if I eat for three months."
         Beside him, the female manager was trembling.
         At this moment, she was sure who this person was.
         Li Hao sighed and said,"I thought I was rich enough to rival a country!" However, before reaching Heavenly Star, I didn't know that there was such a high-consumption place in the world. If Xu Qing came, wouldn't he also be a country bumpkin?"
         "That's not necessary!"Hou Xiaochen laughed. The Xu family's Treasury was only a part of the Xu family's wealth. Who would put all their wealth in the family's small Treasury? Do you think that Xu Qing's father appeared out of thin air?"
         "I know. It's safer to hide in the ruins!"
         Thinking of this, Li Hao asked in confusion, did they take the relic's Armory?
         "It's normal. "
         "Let's just talk about heaven battling city. Is there no military warehouse in heaven battling city?"hou Xiaochen explained.
         "There is!"
         Li Hao thought of something. He nodded and said,""But heaven battling city is not easy to seize! There are millions of heaven-battling Army, dozens of golden Warriors, and even more important figures. That's right ... They must be rich!"
         These words made the female manager and the waiters 'scalps tingle.
          In the past, it wasn't like there weren't any big shots who talked about important things in front of them, but ... They never talked about it so clearly. Moreover, they said it plainly, without any restraint, and were extremely direct. They didn't have the subtlety of others.
         The more he heard, the more shocked he was.
         It wasn't like she had never been to such a big scene before. The manager felt that no one had been to more big scenes than she had. Hou Xiaochen actually didn't even rank high in this place. The ninth Division Secretary, the Deputy Secretary, who wasn't higher ranked than hou Xiaochen?
         She also often saw princes and Dukes.
         Who didn't have a higher status than hou Xiaochen?
         But at this moment, as she listened to Li Hao and hou Xiaochen's conversation, she had the urge to turn around and leave. She didn't want to continue listening.
         "Good that you understand!" Hou Xiaochen laughed. So ... You're richer than me, but if you think that just because you robbed the Xu family once, you'll be richer than the ninth bureau chief, richer than the ninth bureau chief ... You're dreaming!"
         "It's true that the Xu family is one of the three high Duke's public houses, but first, you didn't Rob the Xu family's core treasure vault. Second, the Xu family is in charge of the East, but they're not the only one in the East. The Xu family has 10 provinces under their complete control, and the nine divisions have control over all of them!"
         "As for the ten that the Xu family controls ... At least for now, they still have to listen to Jiusi!"
         Li Hao kept nodding. He was more and more aware of the status of the nine divisions.
        
         "Among the nine divisions, the military law Division, the financial division, the administrative division, the merit Examination Division, and the business division ... I understand that these guys are rich, but where did the Internal Affairs Division and the Foreign Affairs division get their money?"
         "I don't even know what the Internal Affairs Division does," Li Hao said, puzzled.
         "You!" Hou Xiaochen laughed. You're a provincial governor? Isn't it embarrassing? Wasn't the nine Dragons Pavilion under the Internal Affairs Division? The Department of Internal Affairs is actually the royal family's external industry. Among the nine departments, the Department of Internal Affairs is actually the spokesperson of the royal family. "
         "I see!"
         Li Hao was suddenly enlightened!
         The female manager wanted to cover her ears. She wanted to hand over the menu and leave, but ... The two of them were still talking and she couldn't disturb them.
         "What about the Department of Foreign Affairs?"
         Li Hao continued to ask.
         "The Department of rites and Foreign Affairs used to face some countries around the dynasty, such as the Li Dynasty near us ... But now, those countries have either disappeared or are blocked by some dangerous places."
         Hou Xiaochen praised Li Hao again,"Therefore, the main function of the current Department of Foreign Affairs is not to deal with the dynasties outside, but to deal with the demons, the three major organizations, and the seven divine mountains. If they send envoys, it is the Department of Foreign Affairs that will receive them."
          "Then how do they earn money?"
         Li Hao was still curious.
         "Isn't this simple?"
         Hou Xiaochen chuckled,"for example, if the demon race has some special products, what do we do if we need something from the human race?" Directly start a fight? The demons weren't idiots at this stage, so they would contact the humans through the Department of Foreign Affairs, and the Department of Foreign Affairs could buy at a low price and sell at a high price! Don't underestimate this point, the profit is extremely high, so high that it's beyond your imagination!"
         "Oh?" Li Hao interjected."Then, if the three great organizations also need to make some deals with the dynasty ... Will the Department of Foreign Affairs be in charge of it?"
         "Right!"
         "Isn't this helping the enemy?"
         Hou Xiaochen looked at him and said,"the three major organizations in your eyes are unpardonable. They're our enemies!" However, to the nine divisions ... The three major organizations were the spokesmen of many forces. Before they were completely annihilated, were they going to cut off all contact with the other party? Li Hao, you have to understand that the people in the eyes of ordinary people and the people in the eyes of the higher-ups are different. "
         "For some people, like the nine divisions, their disputes with other divisions are more serious than the three major organizations! Organizations like the inspector Bureau hate the three major organizations, but that doesn't mean they're all the same, you know?"
         "The night watchers and the three major organizations still have conflicts and grudges ... But do you think the Internal Affairs Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs have any grudges against the three major organizations that can't be resolved?"
         Li Hao kept nodding.
         He's learned something new.
         He had come to heavenstar to see these things. Perhaps hou Xiaochen knew what he was thinking, and was currently explaining and analyzing them to him.
         "So ..."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao paused."So, sometimes, when you kill the people of the three major organizations, you cut off their source of income. Is that right?"
         "You can say that. It's not just wealth. Don't just stare at wealth all day long. There are many other things!"  "Let's talk about the nine Dragon Pavilion. Do you think this is just a place to eat?"hou Xiaochen laughed.
         Li Hao didn't say anything.
         "This place is an important place for the nine divisions and the imperial family to communicate," hou Xiaochen continued. "If there are many things that can't be resolved on the surface, then this is the place to settle them and balance the benefits."
         He then pointed at the female manager beside him."This one, you're treating her as a waitress?"
         "No, this beauty is so pretty ..."
         Li Hao's smile was bright, and hou Xiaochen laughed,"You! Let's put it this way, this person is not only one of the imperial family's intelligence chiefs, but also an important bridge between the nine divisions and the imperial family. "
         The female manager's expression changed slightly, and she forced a smile.""The Marquis is joking."
         "I'm not asking you, so don't interrupt!"
         Hou Xiaochen's voice was calm, but the female manager felt a chill in her heart and didn't say anything else.
         "Information isn't that important," hou Xiaochen continued,"this guy also has other professions ... Like being a broker, understand?"
         "An agent?" Li Hao frowned.
         "Yes, something like that."
         "If there's anything you want to do, find, or ask for, you can get it through the nine Dragon Pavilion!" For example, if you want to buy an official position, or ... The Silver Moon director of the inspection Division ... You can ask her how much it will cost and what the price is ..."
         "That's definitely expensive!"Li Hao laughed.
         "It's not expensive!"
          Hou Xiaochen shook his head."I'm just afraid that I won't be able to take up the post if I buy it, or that I'll die soon after I take up the post. The position of the head of the Silvermoon Nightwalker was once sold here for only 1000 divine power stones. During that time, the Nightwalker kept calling me to stellarsky city, but I rejected him. That's why the person who bought it couldn't take up the post. Later on, there were some who were not afraid of death and wanted to take over ... But they died before they even reached Silver Moon. They were killed by the Pirates of the North Sea!"
         "It must be the work of the Starlight Pirates and the White sharks!" Li Hao laughed.
         "It's almost the same. "
         Drip, drip ... The female manager broke out in a cold sweat. At that moment, she looked at hou Xiaochen with a hint of fear.
         This person knew everything.
         He knew everything!
         How did he get his information?
         Could it be that he still had many spies in stellarsky city?
         As for Li Hao, he also felt that he had opened his eyes. As he spoke, he felt a little hungry. He glanced at the female manager and smiled. "Where's the menu?"
         The female manager suppressed the throbbing in her heart and placed a menu in front of Li Hao. Hou Xiaochen and chief Yu also had their own people serve them.
        
         Li Hao didn't stand on ceremony and directly opened it ...
         It was so expensive!
         "You can even sell this big demon meat soup?"
         "Yes, I can."
         "Aren't you afraid of the big demons looking for trouble?"
         "Some of them were sent by the demon race themselves."
         "Oh!"
         Li Hao nodded and smiled."Great demon Xu Guang's meat is so expensive? A plate of meat for 500 divine energy stones?"
         "There aren't many dawnlights, and they're all very difficult to deal with ..."
         Li Hao looked at the Black Panther at his feet and smiled. The Black Panther shuddered. Li Hao smiled and said,""I have a dog here. It's a descendant of an ancient demon. Its combat power is at the peak of the rising light Stage. Its bloodline is pure. Can a plate of meat be worth more than 1000 Yuan?"
          The female manager was silent and did not respond.
         Black Panther was a little angry and glared at Li Hao.
         He actually wanted to sell dog meat!
         Li Hao continued to read. After a while, he touched his chin and said,""A specialty of the North Sea, the meat of the sea sturgeons ... This thing can't be caught by ordinary people. It must have been caught by the Pirates of the North Sea, right?"
         The female manager was still silent.
         Li Hao said to himself,"it seems that your business is very extensive. You even communicate with Pirates. I remember that there's a Four Seas business group on the sea ... From the looks of it now, perhaps Pirates are the main trading partners?"
         "Do you know that Pirates eat people?" he looked up at the female manager.
         The female manager lowered her head and said softly,"I'm not sure. You may have misunderstood. This is not sent by the Pirates. It was caught by the business group from the sea."
         Li Hao nodded slightly.
         He continued to read and after a while, he smiled and said,""Forget it, they're all trash! Get a pot of good tea and add more spring of life. The price will be set at 1600 divine power stones! As for the rest of the food, just get some ordinary, free snacks. "
         As he spoke, he suddenly thought of something and looked at hou Xiaochen,"Hou bu, is senior golden spear a high rank City Patrol?"
         "Yes,"
         "Where's brother ermu?"
         "That's true. "
         "Then I'll add another 200!"
         Li Hao looked at the female manager."Mark one on the head of the Golden spear of the Wei Wu Army. Mark the other on the head of the Vice chiliarch, Mu Lin."
         The female manager was extremely embarrassed, but she didn't say anything to refuse. She said softly,""Alright, I'll go make the arrangements."
         Li Hao chuckled and didn't stop him.
         Hou Xiaochen was the same.
         At this moment, hou Xiaochen was sitting on a chair, looking down at the huge window that faced the Imperial Palace. He looked down for a while before sighing,"In the past, this place was a little brighter, but now it's almost pitch black."
          Li Hao also looked outside. After a while, he rubbed his eyes."There are quite a few experts."  "Of course!"
         Hou Xiaochen laughed and continued to drink his tea. Li Hao was also drinking his tea. After a while, he said,"What does the Minister want me to do?"
         "You decide."
         "Are there any benefits?"
         Li Hao thought for a moment and said,'I'm not talking about the benefits ... But what are the long-term benefits of doing it? To me, to Silver Moon, to the Minister ..."
         "I'll terrorize the First Division and gain a firm foothold in the inspection Division. I'll let them know that although I'm difficult to deal with, I'm taking other people's benefits and rights ... It's the inspection Division that's strengthening! You and I are both from the inspection Bureau. Li Hao, you have to remember that in this place, you still need to find a backer ... Or someone to take the blame for!"
         "For example, the one in the inspection Office. You only bring him trouble and no benefits ... He won't care about you! However, while you've brought him trouble, you've also brought him great benefits ... He'll care about you!"
         "He doesn't care about the trouble," hou Xiaochen laughed. "What he cares about is what he'll get after this. "You used reasonable and legal means to help the inspection Division fight for something. He's willing to help you within this range."
         Li Hao nodded.
         "Will this be of great help?" he asked after some consideration.
         "It's quite big! At the very least, the old Secretary is in the divine-tier!"
         "This way, it'll be difficult to manage the other divine-tier elites, right?" hou Xiaochen laughed.
         "Right!"
         "But isn't he afraid that he won't be able to get rid of his tail? Besides, we're Silvermoon people. "
         Li Hao looked at hou Xiaochen in confusion.
         "You have to understand that in the eyes of the nine divisions and the imperial family, they're number one!" The second tier consisted of the three great organizations, the seven divine mountains, the three high Duke's public houses, and the Silver Moon. Next, it's the third-grade provinces, the demon territories, the Pirates of the four Seas ..."
         "Seven great divine mountains?"
         Li Hao raised his eyebrows slightly."For example, in sky sword Mountain, only senior sky sword is there. Can he be ranked second?"
         To be on par with Silver Moon and the high Duke's public house?
          Of course, it was true that Tian Jian was very strong.
         "Who told you that there is only sky sword in sky sword Mountain?"
         "If there's only sky sword, what's the point of being one of the seven sacred mountains? what's the difference between sky sword, BA Dao, and Northern fist?" 90% of the swordsmen in the world were in sky sword Mountain! Not only the Silver Moon Martial Master, but also the central continent and the four continents ... A large number of sword cultivators have gathered in the sky sword Mountain. You don't think that the sky sword Mountain only has One Sky sword, do you?"
         Li Hao laughed dryly. He really thought so.
         So that was how it was!
         It turned out that sky sword had almost unified all the sword cultivators in the world. This was not in line with his imagination. He had thought that sky sword was a lone traveler and did not like to do such things.
         As the two of them were chatting, footsteps could be heard from outside.
         It wasn't the female manager 's.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The next moment, under the helpless gaze of the female manager, the door of the hall was opened, and a slightly chubby man walked in with a few officials.
         The chubby middle-aged man looked at hou Xiaochen and smiled,"Little hou is here, let's eat together. It just so happens that I have something to discuss. There's no need to move. Since we're already here, let's go together. "
        
         Li Hao looked at the fat man. He glanced at him, then glanced at him again.
         A moment later, he exhaled.
         They really ... Had many powerhouses!
         Other than the female manager, there were six people. Other than the fat man, the other five were old and young, and none of them were lower than Xuguang.
         And ... He felt that two of them should be in the transformation stage.
         The remaining three were not newcomers to the rising light.
         As for this fatty, he didn't look like much. He was a Martial Master, but he definitely wasn't weak.
         "Secretary Liu!"
         Hou Xiaochen stood up and smiled."I didn't know you were coming tonight. If I had known, I wouldn't have come."
         After saying that, he looked at the female manager and said,""Why didn't you tell us that Secretary Liu was coming? If you had said so earlier, I wouldn't have come in, in case Secretary Liu thinks I've taken his room ..."
          "It's fine, it's fine!"Fatty chuckled. It's just a place to eat!"
         "Let's eat together, it'll be more lively!"He added.
         After he finished speaking, he looked at Li Hao and said with a smile,"this is the famous demonic sword, right?" A fine-looking man!"
         After praising Li Hao, Li Hao stood up extremely "elegantly", bowed slightly, and took off his top hat."Night patrol Li Hao greets Secretary Liu!"
         "You're welcome, you're welcome. Sit down. We're all family. There's no need to be so polite!"
         The fat man chuckled and walked over with a few people.
         Some of the people he had brought with him glanced at Li Hao and hou Xiaochen with hostile eyes.
         Among the three, hou Xiaochen took the main seat, while Li Hao and Chief Steward Yu took the second seats.
         At this moment, are you still not going to move?
         Secretary Liu didn't care about all this. He found a random seat and sat down. He gestured for the others to sit as well. Then, he turned to the female manager."Go, serve all the good stuff. Don't let Minister hou and the others see this as a joke!"
         "Yes!"
         The female manager didn't dare to say anything more and left quickly. When she left, she was sweating.
         "Thanks to you, I'll be able to fill my stomach!" Hou Xiaochen chuckled.
         Secretary Liu laughed,"what are you saying! If little hou is willing to come to the financial division, you can come here every day and find me for as much as you want to eat. You can even move back home!"
         "Of course not!" Hou Xiaochen chuckled.
         "It's just a small matter!"
         After saying that, he looked at Li Hao and said,'devil sword Li Hao ... Not bad, very good! Xu Qing had always had his eyes on the top of his head. It was good that he died! Xiao Li, are you interested in coming to the financial division? The Deputy Secretary probably can't ... But there are many positions below the Deputy Secretary. You come, I can guarantee you, it's second only to the Financial Secretary, Speaking of which, the position is definitely not worse than little hou!"
          Li Hao's face was full of smiles. I heard that the four Seas business group is under the financial division ... Can I be the head of the four Seas business group?"  "The four Seas business group ..."
         Secretary Liu laughed and looked at the dark-skinned middle-aged man beside him."Little Wu, are you interested in giving up your seat?"
         Li Hao was surprised,"this is the leader of the four Seas business group?" I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
         The dark-skinned middle-aged man glanced at Li Hao with a cold look in his eyes, but he quickly returned to normal. "I'm Wu Yong. I've seen the true appearance of the demonic sword. I've been disrespectful!"
         He chuckled and said: "if the devil sword is interested in this position ... I will abdicate my position and give it to the wise man. The Secretary does not need to worry about my thoughts. If I can bring someone like the devil sword to the financial division ... Wu Yong will be overjoyed!"
         Li Hao was overjoyed.
         “……”
         There was an instant silence!
         Li Hao was overjoyed,"then ... Then I can really go over!" I heard that the four Seas business group is as rich as a country! Not only that, Pirates don't dare to mess with the gold coin flag. I've offended many Pirates in the North Sea, and the East Sea pirates want to kill me. If I can control the four Seas business group ... It won't be a problem anymore!"
         Li Hao was extremely excited."If Secretary Liu doesn't mind, I'll issue the appointment letter tonight. I'll be able to take up the position tomorrow!"
         “……”
         Secretary Liu's smile was still there, but it was a little weird.
         They were just being polite!
         Really, they had already said these polite words thousands of times.
         However, this was the first time he had seen someone take his polite words seriously. Furthermore, he was so impatient and ... Excited!
         He, Li Hao, really wanted it!
          If you dared to give it to him, he would dare to take it. Once the appointment letter was issued today, there was a 99% chance that this guy would take over the four Seas business group tomorrow.
         At this moment, Secretary Liu felt that ... An experienced person had met an impulsive and reckless man. It was impossible to communicate.
         Very quickly, Secretary Liu smiled and said,"I would like to ... But I'm afraid the Inspector General won't let him go!" That Secretary of yours, he's really stubborn ..."
         Li Hao's face was full of joy,"it's okay, as long as the Secretary orders it, I will lose my position as an Inspector-General and go directly to the financial division!" As for whether our Inspection Office agrees to it ... Blocking someone's path of advancement is more vicious than killing their parents!"
         Secretary Liu laughed."That's too serious. I really hoped that you would come. But for this matter, you got into a conflict with that stubborn donkey. That's not right!" How about this, I'll go back and talk to your Secretary, if he agrees ... You can come and find me at any time!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com These words could also be considered as giving each other a way out.
         Li Hao was a little disappointed."Then forget it. I've never even met the chief of our Inspection Division, and I'm not familiar with him ... I'm afraid I won't agree." The four Seas business group ... I'm really interested in it! Even as an assistant ... It seems that there's no chance now!"
         Several people from the financial division suddenly felt disgusted!
         That's enough!
         This Li Hao was indeed as the rumors had said. He was a little stubborn and bold.
        
         Before Secretary Liu could say anything, hou Xiaochen chuckled,"Why go to the four Seas business group? it's too far. You've just arrived here, so you should settle down here. You've just become the Vice Governor of Tian Xing. How can you leave so easily?"
         Secretary Liu was slightly stunned, but he smiled and said,"congratulations!" Old Yao actually promoted you to Vice Governor Tian Xing with little Li's arrival. You have great responsibilities ..."
         Hou Xiaochen also smiled and nodded,"it's a heavy responsibility!" I'm going to let Li Hao take charge and set up the Heavenly Star military governor's office, but we lack a base and some manpower ..."
         He pointed at the big screen and said,"this place is not bad!" Secretary Liu, I want Li Hao to be stationed here and transform this place into the Heavenly Star military governor's office. At the same time, I want to take over all these dark industries and nationalize them! Moreover, paying taxes on time will also increase the income of the financial division. What does Secretary Liu think?"
         Secretary Liu laughed and said,"good, good!" But ... It's not easy to handle ... Of course, this is a matter between the inspector and the night patrolman. I can't say much. Little hou, just do as you see fit! I understand what you mean. How about this, let's have dinner tonight and not talk about this. Tomorrow, you'll see how your Inspection Office will decide. I won't get involved in this!"
         Hou Xiaochen nodded,"that's good!" The inspection Office shouldn't have any objections. "
         "Besides, this is within the authority of the star military governor's office. The Secretary won't say anything, and Minister Yao won't object either," hou Xiaochen said calmly.
         "Governor hou!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At this moment, another alluring woman beside Secretary Liu spoke. She was another powerhouse in the transformation stage, Wu Yong.
          She looked at hou Xiaochen and smiled,"Governor hou, the Nightwalker's family has a lot of business. This is just a place for some high ranking officials and nobles to pass their time. If we transform it into a governor's office, stellarsky city will probably fall into chaos!" It's not necessarily a good thing to have a superpower with nowhere to vent. "
         Hou Xiaochen nodded,"I know, so ... I've made preparations!" Those who dared to make a move were directly suppressed! I also want to see if I'll be able to suppress it faster or if the turmoil will come faster!"
         "I heard that the owner of the sky Star Douluo arena is a powerful woman. She's very powerful and even has the strength of a metamorphosized cultivator. I wonder if she'll make a move."
         The enchanting woman smiled but did not reply.
         As for Secretary Liu, he seemed to have thought of something and suddenly said,""I remember now. There are still some matters to be taken care of in the Department ... Little hou, then you guys eat and drink well!"
         Then, he turned around and looked at the female manager who had just entered.""Tonight's expenses will be on my head!"
         "The nine Dragons Pavilion!" He chided,"next time, you should be more careful. It's an insult to our culture to put such things in our private room!"
         After chiding him, he turned to look at hou Xiaochen and chuckled,"Little hou, then I'll be leaving first ... You can handle the matter of the Heavenly Star Douluo arena as you see fit. However, the Heavenly Star City is an important place. Don't make a big fuss. Also, if too many people make a big fuss and you're fired, it'll be troublesome!"
         "Understood, thank you for your reminder, Secretary Liu!"
         Secretary Liu's smile was bright as he turned and left. The others quickly followed.
         The two powerhouses in the transformation stage looked pale.
         This was a declaration of war!
         Yes, a declaration of war!  What was that crazy hou Xiaochen trying to do?
         When he came here tonight, everyone already knew that it was inappropriate, but they didn't expect that Secretary Liu would come personally. Even though they tried to talk him out of it, this person didn't listen. He didn't think that Li Hao would do anything, did he?
         Secretary Liu didn't continue to argue.
         Since hou Xiaochen had already made up his mind ... He would just have to wait and see!
         Hou Xiaochen laughed and looked at Li Hao. Li Hao laughed too."Give me one of every dish ... One drop of the spring of life. That's too much. I'm afraid you don't have enough!"
         Secretary Liu, who hadn't left yet, suddenly turned around and glanced at Li Hao. He smiled and nodded.""The Silver Moon Martial Master ... You live up to your name!"
         After saying this, he left.
         Silver moon's men were truly bold!
         Li Hao chuckled and glanced at hou Xiaochen. He couldn't help but transmit his voice,"Minister, you're not really asking me to do this, are you? I can be your helper ... But I don't dare to do it. Not to mention that fatty, two transformation stage ... I'm afraid of death!"
         Hou Xiaochen drank his tea and didn't reply.
         Of course it's you!
          Could it be me?
         Seeing this, Li Hao's scalp went numb.""I'm going back to Silver Moon tonight ..."
         "It's too late!"
         è‰1!
         Li Hao cried. I just wanted to see how big the world is and whether this place is beautiful or not. I'm not in the mood to fight with those metamorphosing cultivators. If things don't go well, I'll die!
         Old hou thinks highly of me!
         Hou Xiaochen seemed to be in a good mood. When the dishes arrived, he ate without even looking up,"What are you afraid of? Let me give you a guarantee, there won't be anyone who exceeds the transformation stage ... If they do, I'll personally take action and see if I can kill one to give you some confidence!"
         The hands of the waiters who were serving the dishes trembled.
         In an instant, sweat covered his entire body.
