The seventh lightning tribulation descended.The moment the rank six venerable sovereign escaped, Li Hao's rank five power was almost completely dispersed.,m The sixth-tier power of lightning!According to the usual practice, there would be at least nine lightning tribulations.Under normal circumstances, Li Hao could only reverse time a little and borrow some power, and it would probably take nine bolts of tribulation lightning.However, there were only two bolts of tribulation lightning left.Moreover, the lightning tribulations at this time were all at the sixth step.If this continued, Li Hao would be the one to die.At this critical moment, you can't use the time reversal technique, otherwise ... The lightning tribulation will strike you endlessly, because time and the chaos lightning tribulation are at odds.At this moment, a few figures appeared beside Li Hao.The crowd was dispersed by Li Hao.Heibao, Qian Wuliang, and Lin Hongyu, who was still in the process of transformation, were all thrown aside by Li Hao.Lin Hongyu looked at Li Hao while stabilizing her realm. Then, she looked at the eighth lightning tribulation that was about to fall from the sky. Her face turned pale. Li Hao's level five strength was dissipating. If this went on, he would not be able to survive the eighth lightning tribulation!The ninth one was even more dangerous.The power of the sixth step was not something that Li Hao could rival at his current level.Time reversal was powerful, but the aftereffects ... Were extremely dangerous.At this time, if that sixth-rank didn't run, Li Hao would probably be dead.Of course, if they hadn't run, Li Hao might have been able to pull them into the Tribulation camp again, and it wouldn't have been more dangerous.At this moment, Li Hao had separated them. Clearly, he was also somewhat afraid.He was afraid of implicating them."Senior second cat ... Can you absorb a portion of it?"Li Hao quickly communicated with second cat.This cat had the ability to devour everything. It was much stronger than the Black Panther's devouring ability. The Black Panther could only devour some simple matter, so it could not devour chaos lightning tribulations like this at all.In the long river, er Mao, who had always been lazy, was also a little angry at this moment."This lightning tribulation is too powerful ... Can you not always provoke such powerful things?"Second cat was a little depressed and complained,""I can only absorb 30% of the power. Can you block the remaining 70%?"Even if he managed to block it once, what about the last one?The last one was usually the strongest.It couldn't swallow two or even one in a row. Second cat's strength was not bad, but it was only around the second stage, not even as good as Li Hao 's.If not for its special Constitution, it would have been killed by the lightning as soon as it struck. How could it have devoured it?He could not use time reversal now.He had to block it with his true strength!If he used it again, the Tribulation lightning would fall endlessly and become stronger and stronger. By then, the more Li Hao reversed the situation, the faster he would die."Senior second cat devoured 30% of the eighth attack, and the remaining 70% is probably comparable to a fifth-rank attack ... A fifth-rank attack might not be able to kill me ... There's a high chance that it won 't! But the ninth ..."At this moment, Li Hao's expression turned grave. Last time, he had also borrowed the strength of a sixth rank venerable sovereign. However, after killing a fourth rank venerable sovereign, he still had some strength left.But this time, it didn't work. The power of the fifth step was exhausted.He didn't have any energy left to resist the lightning tribulation."I'll go through the eighth Dao first!"Li Hao didn't say much. He decided to take one step at a time and pass the eighth tribulation lightning first.BOOM!As he said that, a huge Thunderbolt struck down like a divine weapon.The chaos was broken!A huge cat swallowed a part of it in one gulp. All the fur on its body was instantly scorched dry. Its entire body fell on the river with a loud bang and sank to the bottom of the river.30% of the strength of a Tier 6 was also enough to make it suffer.The remaining lightning bolts instantly struck Li Hao.Li Hao slashed out with his sword. Life and death emerged, and thousands of DAOs converged. Destructive power burst out in the long river. All kinds of great DAOs, stars, and domains emerged ...BOOM!Everything was shattering.Qian Wuliang and the others all turned pale.He was too strong!The lightning tribulation was too powerful.At this moment, they watched helplessly as Li Hao's body was shattered. His domain, River, stars, and flesh were all crazily shattered.The lightning tribulation seemed to be trying to grind Li Hao to death!Fortunately, second cat had swallowed 30%.After a while, the eighth lightning tribulation disappeared, leaving only Li Hao's skeleton. Soon, flesh and blood grew, and he barely recovered a bit of strength. He looked at the sky and frowned.He had walked through life and death twice, but he could not walk through life and death an infinite number of times.Every time he walked the Dao of life and death, he would provoke the chaos lightning tribulation. Not only that, according to Kong Ji, nine times was the limit. Did he have to walk the path of life and death again for the ninth?However, if he left this time, he would gain nothing.He wasn't in a state of advancement.Right now, he was at the Grand completion of Tier 3. As he had not comprehended the ultimate Yin Dao, he could not enter Tier 4. This time, he would be wasting his time. The previous two times were at least at the stage where he could advance.However, he knew that he would not be able to withstand the ninth lightning tribulation in his current condition.Or, he could use the corpses of two fourth level venerable sovereigns and a few other venerable sovereigns to activate the game and enter it. Perhaps he could avoid this crisis. However, he had also exhausted his opportunity to enter the game this time. He still could not advance and had wasted the opportunity. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Thousands of thoughts appeared in his mind.In the next moment, Lin Hongyu suddenly shouted,""Replace the stars!"Replace the stars?Li Hao was stunned.Replace what?In the next moment, she looked at Lin Hongyu and used her newly-advanced venerable sovereign star to replace Li Hao's life and death Star. Both their stars were in the river of life and death and had the same aura.

Chapter 2741 The Silvermoon King (2)
The lightning tribulation was also aimed at Lin Hongyu. She had just advanced to the life death Emperor realm. The reason why the lightning tribulation was so powerful was partly due to her advancement.Therefore, he could let Lin Hongyu handle the last lightning tribulation.However, she was only a first stage venerable sovereign ... Her life and death Star would be shattered in an instant when faced with the sixth stage lightning tribulation. It would be a problem if she could go through the life and death reincarnation a second time.And he actually had a way.First, the cycle of life and death.Second, Dao chess.He had a choice, but he felt that it was not worth it.However, Lin Hongyu seemed to have sensed Li Hao's dilemma and asked to replace the stars. Perhaps in her opinion, she was just a level one venerable sovereign, so her death was not a big deal. Li Hao might be able to resurrect her, and at worst, she would lose a level.But ... How could he do that?Li Hao looked at the sky, exhaled, and smiled.""Three deaths and three lives ... The third time might be the least worth it, but what does it matter?"The limit might be nine times.However, Li Hao had gone through three cycles of life and death in such a short time. No matter how many lives he had, he couldn't waste them like this.However, at this point, what else could he do?At the very least, he only had one chance to use it as compared to Dao chess. He should be able to go through life and death a few more times. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 In the next moment, Li Hao's River appeared, and his Star of Life and death hung high in the sky.He turned to look at Lin Hongyu and the others."Same old rules. If you can't kill me later ... It's probably about time. I'll go with the flow and walk the cycle of life and death!" If I'm struck to death ... Remember to save my River of Life and death. You can't break it, or I won't have a chance to come back to life. "The Dao of life and death was not without its limits.If an expert was strong enough, he could directly shatter his River of Life and death, and he would not have the chance to go through the life and death reincarnation.The primal Chaos lightning tribulation was not human.Obviously, he didn't have such a consciousness yet. Therefore, after he died, he should dissipate. There was a high chance that the river of life and death could still be preserved. In this case, he would have a chance to walk through the river of life and death again."Let me do it!"Lin Hongyu shouted,"I'm going to face the last lightning tribulation. If I die, you can come and resurrect me. I've only just entered level one. It's not a big loss!"She quickly flew toward Li Hao.Li Hao was obviously not at the first rank. If he was killed, resurrecting him would be more troublesome and waste more resources.Besides, Li Hao had been a little hesitant before. Perhaps he had gone through too many cycles of life and death, which could be troublesome. Lin Hongyu didn't know if Li Hao had gone through this again in the past year ... She guessed that he had.And this was his first time.If he could be resurrected, so what if he had to go a second time?Li Hao waved his hand, and Lin Hongyu was knocked back. Li Hao didn't care about her.As a Martial Master, or as a man ... He did not have the habit of letting women die for him. He would always go through the cycle of life and death. From a cost-effective point of view, Lin Hongyu's death might be more worth it ... But, did he not want his face? A Silver Moon Martial master's face was bigger than the sky.In front of a woman, can I choose like this?If Qian Wuliang could die for me once ... It would be great.Li Hao smiled. He looked at the sky, at the lightning tribulation that was forming, and silently thought about something. This time, a lot of resources would be wasted. He was only a rank three. If he wanted to resurrect the lightning tribulation, he would have to waste at least the power of a rank four Supreme Emperor.However, he had no hope of advancing, so ... He couldn't waste it. Li Hao had some ideas. Perhaps he should try to pry into the essence of the chaos lightning tribulation with this final strike.He would try to comprehend the power of destruction!Otherwise, he would be letting himself down if he was struck so miserably every time.Knowing that he was going to die, Li Hao left the river of life and death, abandoned the firmament sword, and all his treasures, and flew toward the chaos lightning tribulation.I'd like to see how this thing was born.Where was it born?Where did the energy come from?Why did it trigger this lightning tribulation?,m "The primal Chaos lightning tribulation is also a type of law ... But laws are almost all made by humans. I want to know if the primal Chaos lightning tribulation is a man-made law.Li Hao charged at the lightning tribulation.The Tribulation lightning seemed to be provoked. In an instant, all the dark clouds gathered and seemed to turn into a Taoist, who charged at Li Hao like a lightning bolt.In the void.Lin Hongyu and the others 'expressions changed. In the distance, the three venerable sovereigns' faces changed drastically as well. What was going on?The power of venerable Emperor Hao Yue ... Had suddenly weakened, while the lightning tribulation had suddenly become much stronger.Would he ... Be struck to death?Just now, even a rank eight venerable sovereign didn't come to kill him, and a rank six venerable sovereign had also escaped. They had thought that Haoyue had won this time, but how did it turn out like this?BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated through the world. In the next moment, they saw an unforgettable scene. Li Hao was instantly turned into dust, and the river of life and death below him trembled violently.A life and death Star was also shaking crazily, and it even cracked.The Thunderbolts in the air turned into human figures and killed Li Hao on the spot.The Phantom lightning didn't dissipate completely, as if it still wanted to destroy the river of life and death.However, at this moment, a shadow seemed to appear in the river. It seemed to be Li Hao, but it also seemed to have a different aura. He had died once, and all his debts seemed to be gone.The lightning tribulation seemed to have lost its direction. For a moment, it stopped and then began to dissipate.In the river, Li Hao's shadow began to dissipate.

Chapter 2742 Silver Moon King (3)
The world fell silent.In the distance, Yi and the other venerable sovereigns 'faces were changing. He was ... Dead?It was as if he was dead, and the lightning tribulation had dissipated.At this time, Black Panther, Lin Hongyu, Hong Yitang, Qian Wuliang, and celestial pole appeared from Silvermoon's side. Among the five venerable sovereigns, Black Panther was the only second rank one venerable sovereign.Moreover, Li Hao had been injured before.On the Vatican's side, there was still a third level venerable sovereign and a second level venerable sovereign who were not injured.If he made a move ... He might not lose.There was even a chance of winning.If they won, it would be a great opportunity. There were two great Dao universes, one of which was a world Lord, the river of life and death left by Li Hao, the energy left behind by two level-four venerable sovereigns, and many low-stage venerable sovereigns. Whoever could take it away would be completely rich!However, at this moment, the three venerable sovereigns didn't move. They were really scared.Too many venerable sovereigns had died today!Their team, including Li Hao, had a total of 12 venerable sovereigns. Now, only the three of them were left. The four venerable sovereigns of the smoked wind team had been annihilated, and the Crimson Moon's fourth stage venerable sovereign auxiliary armor had been killed.Including Li Hao himself, 14 venerable sovereigns had died in one day!Among them, there were two 4th rank experts, and Li Hao's strength was hard to say. In addition, there were escapees at the 6th rank and half-descended will at the 8th rank ...It was too terrifying!Because of this, no matter how great the temptation was, none of them dared to move at this moment. Besides, they might not necessarily win. The other party still had five venerable sovereigns, and these five venerable sovereigns seemed to be able to merge ...Therefore, even though the three venerable sovereigns saw Li Hao being struck to death, they did not move.In this extreme silence.Hong Yitang and Qian Wuliang didn't say anything. They immediately followed their previous practice and the two chaotic rivers began to construct a ring around the river of life and death.Lin Hongyu's life and death Star was also spinning rapidly, stimulating the life and death aura in the river.The previous two times, Li Hao had only succeeded in the Samsara of life and death because he was still alive.This time, they were all gone.Of course, there was one time before that when he was also struck by the lightning tribulation until nothing was left. That time, he was resurrected by the power of time.This time, it seemed like the power of time had completely dissipated.Everyone was very nervous!They didn't know if they could be resurrected again ... But they should be. After all, the river of life and death was still there.At that moment, the countless venerable sovereigns 'power that had been absorbed in the long river turned into vortexes and began to condense.Everyone heaved a sigh of relief!They knew that Li Hao was about to be resurrected. As for the energy of the venerable sovereigns that they had killed ... No one cared. So what if it was exhausted? it was Li Hao who killed it.In the blink of an eye, a figure seemed to appear in the river and fell into the life and death Star. Lin Hongyu threw the figure into the river of life and death with all her might. The next moment, Lin Hongyu, who thought it was a baby landing on the ground, was stunned.In the long river, a child of six or seven years old appeared, not an infant.At this moment, Li Hao's memory seemed to be intact.He raised his head to look at the river of life and death and frowned slightly. This time, it was not a baby that landed on the ground. Instead, it was a six or seven-year-old.Moreover, the memories were still there.What did this mean?In fact, he vaguely understood something. The next time I walk the path of life and death, I might be born ten years old, or even older ... And the next time, ten years old, and the next time ... Until I reach my original age.He was no longer an infant."Once I reach my original age and succeed in the life and death reincarnation cycle, this represents one thing ... I no longer have the chance to walk the river of life and death. This actually means that my essential life and death essence is being consumed.Li Hao finally understood! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Was it a good thing to be bigger?It wasn 't."If I had always been in the state of an infant, that would have been a good thing. It would mean that I could always be resurrected. But this time, I've grown a lot older ... This clearly tells him that every time you resurrect, you consume your source of life and death.What a huge loss!At this moment, Li Hao had such a thought.Yes, it was a huge loss this time.The Tier 5 corpses were gone, and the Tier 4 corpses he had killed ... It would be good enough if he could preserve the energy of one of them when he resurrected later. There was almost no energy left for those below Tier 4. Moreover, his realm had not advanced, and the primal Chaos lightning tribulation had not noticed anything ...Even if they did not know his exact situation, they knew that he might be the new silver Moon King.As for him ... He had wasted a chance to be reincarnated.What a huge loss!Li Hao was a little emotional. This was the first time he felt that killing someone was such a waste. However, Silver moon's situation had been tense back then, so he had no other choice.It seemed impressive to outsiders, but only Li Hao himself knew how much he had lost.If he advanced to the 4th rank this time, then it wouldn't be a loss.The key was that he didn't advance!He didn't say anything and quickly started to walk through the river of life and death. A large amount of energy gathered and the broken bridge of Life and death quickly began to build. His aura also rapidly increased. This time, he didn't need anyone to help him.He didn't need to.The memories were still there ... But it was not a good thing for Li Hao. This also meant that he would miss the ability to learn certain things in his innate state, such as the power of Nirvana from before. When he put it in, Li Hao could instantly comprehend some things in that state.But now, such an opportunity was almost gone.

Chapter 2743 Silvermoon King (1)_4
The limitations of the Dao of life and death were now apparent ... It was good, but not as good as one might imagine. True immortality was impossible.After a while, an elegant young man appeared.It was Li Hao!However, the energy of the venerable sovereigns he had killed before had almost been used up. At most, he had the energy of a fourth-rank venerable sovereign left. Before leaving Tian Fang, Li Hao had at least a fifth-rank venerable sovereign's corpse.This time, he had really suffered a huge loss.All around, the celestial pole's people appeared one after another, all of them somewhat overjoyed.They didn't see much. They only knew that Li Hao had killed all the enemies and was unbelievably strong. He also came back to life, as if he wasn't injured at all ... Wasn't this terrifying?Further away, the three venerable sovereigns were all frightened.p He was resurrected?How was that possible?Haoyue, was he really undying and imperishable?"Life and death Dao ..."The rank three venerable sovereign murmured in fear. This man really couldn't die. He could even revive after death ... This was too terrifying!The next moment, the three of them looked at each other and, without saying anything, quickly rushed toward Li Hao.Since he was still alive ... Of course, he couldn't leave now.If he left, it might be even more dangerous.Putting aside the fact that they had seen many extraordinary things, even if Li Hao did not kill them, once the level six venerable sovereign who had escaped returned or the level eight venerable sovereign of the red moon came back ... The three of them would definitely be in big trouble.Even if they leaked all the information about Li Hao, the other party might not believe them. They might even think that they were in cahoots with Li Hao and kill them after asking for information.After all, they were only a few low-rank venerable sovereigns and could not affect the overall situation."My Lord!"The three venerable sovereigns, including Yi, were a little scared at this moment.Lin Hongyu and the others did not look too good.It seemed to be Li Hao's group from before ... But seven of them betrayed him. If it weren't for them, Li Hao might not have had to die again. But it was because of their betrayal that Li Hao died again.Li Hao didn't say anything.After Minghao's death, these people were no longer in any danger. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  He looked up and said,"retreat!" After all, this is Hong Yue's territory. The sixth rank venerable sovereign who escaped earlier might come back after seeing the lightning tribulation disappear ... Let's get further away first!"After saying that, the river engulfed everyone. They did not resist and let the river Sweep them. Li Hao's speed was not too fast. With his strength at the perfected stage of Tier 3 and the river of life and death, he could barely reach the speed of some weak Tier 4 martial artists. They quickly began to escape, avoiding the area covered by the Crimson Moon.While running away, Li Hao said,""The Black Panther has devoured a rank three venerable sovereign. Qian Wuliang, you and senior uncle Hong have also absorbed the power of a rank three venerable sovereign and are rapidly digesting their energy ... It won't be too difficult for the Black Panther to advance to rank three. After all, Silver Moon is a medium-level world!""As for the two of you, you're both Masters of great DAOs ... Distribute a portion of the great DAOs you've absorbed to the Silver Moon residents. If you complement each other, you might be able to quickly advance ..."As for Lin Hongyu, he had no choice.Li Hao didn't have enough power of life and death to support Lin Hongyu, not to mention that she had just advanced. It would take time for her to advance again.He glanced at the remaining three venerable sovereigns.It was a referee, which was quite familiar.One of them was Chan Xiu ... He was familiar with her, but he was not too familiar with the other stage three expert. They did not communicate much with each other. However, this time, everyone else had betrayed him, but this one did not. It was strange.It was understandable for Yan and Chan Xiu to be afraid of Li Hao. After all, they had met Li Hao more than a year ago.But what was going on with this person?As if sensing Li Hao's probing, the handsome third level venerable sovereign quickly said,""Lady Hao Yue, my name is Xun RUO, the sovereign of the glimmer world. The glimmer world...Can be considered a subsidiary world of the divine light realm. Of course, it's just a way of saying it. In fact, it was the glimmer world that attached itself to it. The divine light realm has never publicly acknowledged it ..."Li Hao was enlightened."So, you're doing this for the sake of Kong Ji?" he asked."I don't dare!""Sir, you're extremely powerful. Even if we become your enemies, we'll still die!" Xun RUO hurriedly said.Of course, he did not choose to join forces with Minghao and the others because of the void. He did not dare to attack Li Hao for fear of letting the void know. The others were still alright, as he was a venerable sovereign of the glimmer world, which was near the great light world.The others might not know his background, but Kong Ji would definitely be able to find out.She could also find him!Then he would really be waiting for death.Now, he could only be glad.All the venerable sovereigns had died.Li Hao didn't say anything. He turned around and looked at the three of them. Then, he calmly said,""Right now, I don't have the time to put my heart into subduing anyone, and I don't have the intention to do so either. Previously, I still showed some kindness to Minghao and the others ... But now, I'm worried that the three of you might do something. It just so happens that I have a Dao universe here. Why don't the three of you merge your DAOs with the Silvermoon great Dao?"“……”The three's expressions changed slightly, but of course, the referee quickly calmed down and said nothing.She didn't really care.However, the expressions of the remaining two changed. This was because these two masters of the great Dao were only at stage one. According to the situation, they could not surpass the Masters of the great Dao when they fused their Dao. In other words, they could only maintain the strength of stage one at most.

Chapter 2744 Silvermoon King (3 In 1)
To them, going from stage one to stage two and then to stage three had taken a lot of time and energy.Joining the great world was a dream.p The Lord of a great world was at least at the sixth level. To them, this was an opportunity, but ... For this kind of newborn great path universe, if it did not grow up, it would be difficult for them to recover to the second or third level if it was not the master of the great path and the master of the great path advanced slowly!Li Hao said calmly,"they absorbed the power of a stage three venerable sovereign, and the three of them merged with it ... If the two of them still can't advance their great Dao universe, I'll merge all of Ming Hao's power into it ... It should be enough for their great Dao universe to advance to stage two!" Fellow Daoist Chan Xiu, you don't have to worry about anything. As for fellow Daoist Xun RUO, although he might drop a level, he can be considered to have joined the Dao universe. Even if he's a little weaker, at least he's not a rogue cultivator anymore. His power of the Dao is purer. I dare not say that he's taking advantage of you, but at least he's not suffering a loss!"He had fused the power of a rank four venerable sovereign!The two of them were moved, and Chan Xiu said hurriedly,""I can't wait to join. I won't have any objections. I'm just an itinerant cultivator. I can join a great Dao universe ... And I have great potential. I can't be happier. On the other hand, Daoist Xun RUO might be a little disappointed ..."Zhiruo cursed inwardly. Who was he trying to insult?Falling from the third rank to the second rank, wasn't that better than dying?"Moreover, the potential of the Dao universe is great. These two might be able to enter the third level very soon. Won't I recover then?He immediately said,"my Lord, you misunderstand. I'm just worried that we're weak. If we join the Dao universe, we'll waste the venerable sovereign quota of the Dao universe!"He looked sincere."We are weak. If the universe of the great path is weak, the number of venerable sovereigns it can bear is limited. At the current stage, I don't think it can bear too many venerable sovereigns. If it's too much, not only will it not advance the universe of the great path, but it will also explode easily ... The three of us might waste three spots."In fact, he was telling Li Hao that he was only at the 3rd rank, but he didn't want to waste the two of them.Being weak was better than death!Although the great Dao universe would become stronger the more venerable sovereign power it devoured, if the two masters of the great Dao couldn't bear it and couldn't advance for a long time ... It wouldn't be able to accommodate more venerable sovereigns. If there were too many, the great Dao universe would explode.This was the reason why some level-seven and level-eight great path universes could not accommodate too many venerable sovereigns.That was because the Dao master's strength was limited!He hadn't advanced. It was extremely difficult for him to advance to the Dao universe purely by devouring. It wasn't always better to have more venerable sovereigns.Li Hao smiled and said,"there's no hurry for now. If you three are willing, that's great!" I don't want to kill anyone ..."The three of them felt their hearts tremble. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Don't want to kill ... You've just killed more than ten venerable sovereigns, and you said that you've killed more than ten venerable sovereigns in Tian Fang. In total, you've killed almost 30 venerable sovereigns. This is more terrifying than destroying a medium-level universe.This Demon King of killing actually said that he didn't like killing people!A level-seven great Dao universe can only accommodate 100 venerable sovereigns. You've killed nearly 30 of them, which means you've killed one-third of the venerable sovereigns in the great world!How long has it been? Such a terrifying person, such a brutal person ... Even if he was a coward, at this time, he did not feel that li haoshu was in a bad mood ... He was a wolf in sheep's clothing!It was extremely brutal and terrifying!"The three of you, since you've decided, join my Silvermoon world!" Li Hao said slowly.He looked at the three of them and said: "Yi, in my Silver Moon classification, Xun RUO from the glimmer world should be of the truth Dao. Yi, you are somewhat similar to the illusion Dao. Chan Xiu is similar to my Silver moon's physical body becoming a saint ... Then join the truth Dao universe and the void Dao universe."He continued,"senior uncle Hong, Qian Wuliang, you two. It shouldn't be difficult for you to advance from level one to level two by merging the DAOs. From level one to level three, you need to accumulate strength. If it's still not enough, I can merge some of the strength of level four into it. It should be enough!""Lord Marquis, you can keep the energy of that person," Qian Wuliang said hurriedly."No need. Fourth-tier power is useless. There's too little!"Li Hao shook his head. He himself was not weaker than some 4th rank experts, so why would he need these?It wasn't of much use!The power of a fourth-rank could not activate the path of chess. It would be a waste to keep it anyway. A part of it would be used for their advancement. If there was still some left, he would give it to the celestial pole clone to let him enter the level of a second-rank venerable sovereign.He could be considered to have made the best use of everything!He wouldn't be able to advance, but it would be good if these people could.Even though they were only a group of low level venerable sovereigns!However, Silver Moon already had five venerable sovereigns, and with his own six, and these three, there were a total of nine venerable sovereigns.At that time, other than Yi and Lin Hongyu, everyone else would be considered to have entered level two, which was not too bad.This was also the configuration of many weak, small, and medium-level worlds ... If he entered level four, he would meet the requirements of a medium-level world. Some of the medium-level world Lords were actually only level three. Of course, this was generally the kind that had just advanced.Qian Wuliang didn't have any objection to that.The referee and the others were actually a little confused.There were two masters of the great Dao...This great Dao universe was not simple, but why did Haoyue himself not want this master of the great Dao?Li Hao was not the master of the great Dao.Everyone could tell.Although he had fused with them before ... It didn't mean that Li Hao could control the Dao universe. He had only used Time and Stars to fuse with it. If he had personally controlled it, he might have been even stronger.

Chapter 2745 Silvermoon King (3 In 1)
If he borrowed the power of the great path universe, he might be able to reach level four.They could not understand.Under normal circumstances, if there was a rarely seen Dao universe, they would have swallowed it long ago.What was the point of Li Hao creating a fake Dao River?He might as well directly control the Dao universe!Judging from the attitudes of the two masters of Dao, they were quite respectful to Li Hao.Of course, they were both venerable sovereigns. It might be a little troublesome if they gave up their positions as the Masters of the great Dao, and they might die ... But would a murderer like Li Hao care about killing two more level one venerable sovereigns?Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't say anything.He just hurried on. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t   Let's run far away first.The three venerable sovereigns did not dare to waste any time, fearing that they would be killed by Li Hao. Soon, they began to discuss the Dao integration, which was nothing more than opening a tributary of the river of Dao.He had transplanted his own Dao over.The people from the other macro worlds were a little troublesome, but the venerable sovereigns without the power of the great path of the universe were relatively simple.Their DAOs were the DAOs of the primordial chaos.It was a natural process for the DAOs in the chaos to join the great Dao universe.The difficulty was much lower.On the other hand, if the venerable sovereigns in the great path universe wanted to join another side, they had to cut off their connection with the original great path universe first. Under normal circumstances, a great world would not take in a venerable sovereign from another great world.Otherwise, it might cause a war between the two worlds.Li Hao didn't pay much attention to it. At this moment, he only cared about hurrying on his way.And his Dao integration was also smooth.In fact, integrating three venerable sovereigns was still not enough for the advancement of the great Dao universe. After all, three venerable sovereigns were not too strong, and the difficulty of advancing in the great Dao universe was actually higher. It was the limit of the entire great Dao universe's advancement.Li Hao began to merge his remaining level-four power into the great Dao universe.After consuming more than half of it, only then did the entire Dao universe complete a small level of improvement. It was actually very difficult for the two masters of the great Dao to complete the accumulation from level one to level two. It would take a long time.However, with Li Hao's help, the two of them advanced much faster and naturally reached Stage 2.At this moment, Black Panther, Qian Wuliang, Hong Yitang, Chan Xiu, and Xun RUO had all become level two venerable sovereigns. Li Hao didn't bother keeping the remaining energy, and simply gave it to his celestial pole clone.The celestial pole clone also did not reject anyone!Li Hao had returned. He felt that he no longer needed to be the vanguard.Since that was the case, it was a good thing to have more energy and power.At the very least, he had some capital now that he had met his main body.By the time he absorbed all the energy, he had also directly stepped into the second rank. From the first to the third rank, as long as there was enough energy, there was no need for great Dao Comprehension. Moreover, his original body was also at the second rank back then. At this point, Li Hao had one level three, six level two, and two level one venerable sovereigns.In fact, he didn't count the second cat. If he counted them, there would be exactly 10 venerable sovereigns.In a short period of time, Silvermoon had accumulated a lot of power.As for Li Hao, he had some ideas.This many venerable sovereigns was more than enough, and he did not intend to recruit any more. This time, if he had not made a decision before, he would not have taken in these three. He still needed to train Silver Moon Knight!The quota for venerable sovereigns in the Dao universe was actually very limited. If it was given to outsiders, it meant that one of them would have one less quota.Now, the black leopard didn't take up a spot in the great path universe. It was a world Lord, so it was a special type.The celestial pole didn't occupy it either. It was only a clone. Although its power had reached the venerable sovereign level, it was still an origin venerable sovereign in essence.Er Mao didn't occupy it either. It was more special, and even Li Hao couldn't tell what kind of venerable sovereign it was. Was it a venerable sovereign of the universe of the great Dao, a venerable sovereign of the Dao of chaos, or ... A venerable sovereign from another space?Who knows!Lin Hongyu didn't want to take it.In short, there were only five venerable sovereigns in the current Dao universe, two of which were Dao Masters."They're only rank two ... Below rank three, they can't hold many venerable sovereigns ... We can't randomly recruit people, and we can't randomly let people fuse with the Dao. They lack the power of the great Dao ... Then we'll kill them!"Li Hao thought to himself."My overall strength has increased by a lot ... As for me, I should put my ultimate Yin Dao on the agenda. Otherwise, I won't even dare to use my Dao chess ..."If he had comprehended some ultimate Yin Dao this time, he would have chosen to enter the Dao chess to comprehend some great Dao instead of choosing to walk the path of life and death.It was a pity!The Dao of Yin ... He had never encountered it before, but he knew that the yin-yang world was bound to exist. And in the yin-yang world, celestial pole was only a clone. Zhang an was not a venerable sovereign yet, but celestial pole himself ...Empyrean terminus's original body was a fist Dao cultivator and was very powerful.However, there was one person, King Huai, who was said to be extremely sinister and cowardly ... Was treachery considered the most sinister?Li Hao suddenly laughed!No matter what, having an exchange with the two venerable sovereigns from the source world might be of some help to him in comprehending the way of the ultimate Yin.According to the celestial pole's clone, the other party might still have a Supreme Being's clone or a rank six venerable sovereign following him. Perhaps they could have an exchange.Li Hao actually knew that his Supreme Being clone was following him.He had traveled around new martial arts, and that Supreme was everywhere.Countless clones!In fact, Li Hao had always felt that having too many clones wasn't a good thing, as it was easy for him to become abnormal ... But this Supreme martial artist hadn't become abnormal yet. Perhaps he had a way to stop himself from becoming abnormal.Or perhaps, he was already abnormal and he just didn't notice it.

Chapter 2746 Silvermoon King (3 In 1)
"Senior Empyrean pole ... Let's go find your original body!"Li Hao laughed and quickly disappeared into the void.The celestial pole clone also laughed ... His laugh was a little melancholic. 'I've met my main body. Whose memories are the main ones?' please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Or could they all be Masters?Although he felt that it was better to avoid unnecessary trouble and that it would be better for him to integrate with his main body so that he would not be in trouble, he was still a little sad that he had lost the memories of the past few years.Of course ... After the main body fused with him, he didn't need to fight anymore. That wasn't bad either.Heaven's Fate quickly let go again. I'm just a clone ... Who cares!……On this day, Li Hao's group escaped.But soon, the chaos itself was still shaken.The news of Li Hao's murder wouldn't spread so quickly, and it wouldn't be easy to communicate with chaos, either. However, great worlds more or less had their own means.Within the Skylands world.When he returned to the Dragon Temple, a line of words appeared on all the cultivators 'communication tokens."Killed a new king of the Silver Moon. Strength unknown ... It might be between the fourth and sixth rank. Characteristic: erupts with great power and easily causes the attack of Primal Chaos tribulation lightning. May be a life and death cultivator or a Yin Yang cultivator. In addition, he might be good at the sword principle of the sword venerable and has the will of the sword principle. ""The person who successfully hunts it down will receive a medium-grade world, a Grade 6 Emperor weapon, and ten grade 8 Crimson Moon Dao accumulation crystals! In addition, you can join the Crimson Moon world and be allocated the power of the great Dao. ""Other than the above characteristics, there is another point. This person could be a member of Ming Hao's team. Ming Hao and the auxiliary Gu were both killed by him, and Ming Hao's team was annihilated. If there are any survivors, they might be related to this person ..."“……”At this moment, countless people were shocked.The Silver Moon King!​ Fourth to sixth rank?How was that possible?Didn't the Silver Moon just break out of the seal? even if he was sealed, it had only been a few decades, right?How could there be a middle-stage venerable sovereign?Also, Ming Hao's assistant Gu had been killed by him. Ming Hao's small team had amazing strength and was quite famous. More than ten venerable sovereigns had gone out and were all killed?And ... It was said that one of them was a good friend of Kong Ji.……At this moment, the venerable Dragon sovereign did not see the appearance of Min Han.After receiving news from Red Moon and Yun Xiao, he suddenly looked in one direction, and his eyes changed.A member of Minghao's team!From stage four to stage six, he killed Ming Hao, a sword cultivator, triggered the primal Chaos lightning tribulation, the Silver Moon King ...He had suspected Li Hao for a long time, but he was not sure because he was not a cultivator of the Dao universe. However, today ... He realized something.Also, if it was level four to level six ... Then ... Gao Han ... Might have died. It wasn't that he didn't come out, but that he was killed by the other party using some method!His expression changed!Silver Moon King, void!Neo martial, divine light realm!Could it be that these two parties had joined forces?How was that possible?Of course, it was not impossible. In fact, Yunxiao and Hongyue had the intention to join forces. In this case, it was not impossible for the other macro world in the tianfang region, the divine light realm, to join forces with the notorious new martial artists.The enemy of my enemy is my friend.At this time, the face of the venerable Dragon Emperor changed. He was sure that Hao Yue was most likely the Silver Moon King!However, the Silver Moon King was not a venerable sovereign of the great Dao universe. How could he have become a middle-stage venerable sovereign?But if he wasn't a universe Emperor, how could he advance so quickly?Or ... Was this person actually a neo martial cultivator and had long been a venerable sovereign, but had been hiding in the Silvermoon world?For a moment, he was unable to figure out the specific situation.Wasn't the venerable sovereign of new martial arts supposed to be an origin venerable sovereign?Also, the void ...As he was thinking, an empty voice came to his ear."Poor fellow Daoist bright moon. He won't be killed by the Silvermoon King, right? Abbot, when will you start hunting revered sword? I want to leave tianfang to find my Daoist Hao Yue. If I encounter the Silver Moon King, kill him!"“……”The venerable Dragon Emperor cursed in his heart, stop talking nonsense!That Hao Yue was most likely the Silver Moon King, and the more he thought about it, the more he regretted it. If he had known this would happen, perhaps ... He would have stayed.He then looked at the dark Demon Ridge that had been guarded all this time and cursed again. What was there to guard!That person was gone!Not only was Lin Han gone, but all the venerable sovereigns in the dark World were gone too. It was a huge loss.What a good Haoyue ... Just you wait!And this Kong Ji, there was a high probability that he had joined hands with neo martial ... Of course, this guy was not to be provoked. It was best to get rid of him.On this day, the name of the Silver Moon King started to spread throughout the tianfang region.And within the red moon region, the name of this unremarkable Silver Moon King began to spread.He had known about it before, but he had thought that it was only a first level venerable sovereign, so there was no need to pay attention to it.However, the fact that the other party had killed two fourth stage venerable sovereigns with his own hands and received a wanted order from the red moon master still shocked everyone.Silver Moon King, a middle stage venerable sovereign!

Chapter 2747 Return (1)
In the dark chaos.An extremely huge cat was lazily roaming in the void.At this moment, the world within the cat was a huge world that contained countless cultivators and powerhouses.A gentle-looking old man suddenly opened his eyes and smiled. "Silver Moon King!"As expected, the new king of Silvermoon was a little unbelievable.They had lost contact with Silver Moon for more than fifty years and it had only been open for a little more than a year, but this Silver Moon King had actually killed several middle-stage venerable sovereigns.Of course, it was nothing compared to the human King.In the past, when the human King emerged from the chaos, he was not as old as Li Hao. At that time, the human King had already killed a level six heavenly Emperor.But ... It depends on the foundation of the world.The neo martial world was a big world during the heavenly Emperor era. Although the source world was not perfect, the heavenly Emperor, as the master of the great Dao, actually already had the power of the sixth step.The limits of the world were very high.As for Silver Moon, his limit was too low. Under such circumstances, the new king of Silver Moon was able to kill a middle-stage venerable sovereign in a short time. It was still very impressive, even though the old man knew that it must have had something to do with the power of time."It's good, but ..."The old man frowned slightly. However, the Silver Moon King's appearance and fame might disrupt his plans.He hoped that the other party would keep a low profile.First, it was not safe. With his strength, he could be easily killed by the red moon.Second, the Silver Moon King's actions were too big, and it was easy to trigger some of the neo martial's plans. This would lead to Red moon's attention being drawn to him, and some of the neo martial's hunting plans might have some flaws.Heaven's Fate and King Huai had already gone over. Originally, they only wanted to kill some strong people. Now ... It might be a little troublesome. It would easily attract the attention of the strong people of the Crimson Moon, and even the attention of advanced venerable sovereigns!There were not many high-level venerable sovereigns in the Crimson Moon world. The key was that many major worlds in the Crimson Moon region had recently migrated there and reached some agreements with the Crimson Moon. Once the Lords of these major worlds were dispatched, it would be very troublesome."The Silver Moon King ..."After thinking for a while, the old man closed his eyes.……At the same time.On the other side of the chaos.An old man with slightly white hair and sharp eyes was wandering around. Suddenly, the voice of the old man from before, who was also a new martial Supreme, rang in his ears."Good, you didn't go far.""You told me not to stir up trouble, but I haven't been running around recently," the old man said in a deep voice."You didn't run around?"The Autarch laughed."You didn't run around. You killed another medium-level world Lord?" Of course, he didn't say much. Instead, he quickly said,""It's not easy to connect with the primordial chaos, so let's cut to the chase. The Silvermoon world appeared, and the Silvermoon gave birth to a new king. Another point ... The Silver Moon should have given birth to a new great Dao universe ...""It's inevitable!"The old man didn't seem surprised at all.""There were already such signs a long time ago. Silver Moon sealed herself for many years and cut off her connection with the origin. Without the suppression of the origin universe, it's normal for a new Dao universe to be born.""So you knew.""So, you intentionally lost contact with Silver Moon more than fifty years ago? "Grandmaster's voice was a little strange."Not really,"The old man frowned slightly."At that time, I was busy dealing with a few Red Moon sovereigns. Although I was good at attacking, I was not good at defending. It was too troublesome to bring Silver Moon with me. Don't accuse me of any crime." please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "No one said that losing Silver Moon is a crime."The Supreme martial artist added,"although my grandson is among them, isn't he still alive? After you die, I will punish you!"“……”"If you have something to say, say it!" The old man was too lazy to respond."The Silver Moon King appeared and killed two middle-stage venerable sovereigns, which attracted the attention of Red Moon master. Now, the news has begun to spread in some great worlds. The new silver Moon King is so powerful. Even though I didn't think more of it ... It should be difficult to hide the fact that Silver Moon has given birth to a great Dao universe from some great world Masters! I'm afraid that the Silver Moon King won't be able to live in peace. ""You're good at causing trouble. " "Hehe ..." The old man suddenly laughed."But ... To be able to kill a middle-stage venerable sovereign in such a short time, you are indeed capable!"He frowned."In the past, he entered a Red Moon Emperor. In addition, the Silver Moon gave birth to a great Dao universe. There are also some new martial inheritances left inside. There is also the Silver Moon world itself ... It should not be too difficult for the Silver Moon King to enter the intermediate level."This was actually what Silver moon's internal department and Li daoheng's group had thought.It devoured everything!In the end, even the great Dao universe had been devoured. He was still confident of becoming a middle-stage venerable sovereign, but ... This way, Silvermoon's potential would be gone.Of course, at that time, li daoheng and the others didn't know what a middle-stage venerable sovereign was.They only knew that if they succeeded, they would become top venerable sovereigns, second only to the human King and the others."That might not be the case!"The Grandmaster's voice rang out again,"his Dao might not be the Dao you imagine it to be ...""It's not the way of the sword?""According to my judgment, he should be a swordsman. He should be a pure swordsman," the old man said with some doubt."It might be related to another power ... Time.""Shi Guang?"The old man hesitated for a moment before saying,""Is there really someone who can cultivate time? Or ... Back then, the part of the power that had passed away was really the power left by Zhan Tiandi? Did Zhan Tiandi ... Really cultivate time?""I'm not sure. "The Supreme martial artist's voice was soft."It's hard to say. It's hard to judge. Even Fang ping can't judge this. It's just that ... The energy of battle has indeed flowed out. Fang ping chose to fulfill your wish and didn't absorb it back. He wanted to fulfill your wish ... To let you become the next high-level venerable sovereign ..."

Chapter 2748 Return (2)
"I don't need it!""Swordsman!" The old man said indifferently."A swordsman just needs to be pure!""You're still too stubborn ... But it's your own path. It's your own path. It might suit you more!"The Grandmaster didn't say much. Some people were like this, firm in their own beliefs, and dedicated themselves to walking their own path.He did not care about any foreign Dao, no matter how strong it was ... This kind of person would either be a failure or be successful.Whether longevity swordsman could catch up from behind and surpass some people to become the next level Seven venerable sovereign of neo martial artists ... No one could be sure, nor could they deny it.Zhi Zun didn't say anything more and quickly said,"Go and find Empyrean terminus and the others.""To see the Silver Moon King?" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "No need ... I just want to get rid of some trouble!"The Grandmaster spoke,"he doesn't need protection, and he doesn't need protection ... He's also walking his own path, and he doesn't need us to interfere!" It's just that ... It's necessary to eliminate some top-notch existences!"The old man thought for a while and nodded slightly,""I can ... However, I have my own methods and means. I know about this matter. Just give me the location of celestial pole and the others. You don't need to worry about the rest!"The Grandmaster didn't say anything more, but the old man's body flickered with a brilliance. The old man sensed that there was a spot of light among them, which should be the location of the celestial pole and the others.In the primordial chaos, it was very difficult to locate someone, and it was very difficult to send a message.However, it didn't seem too difficult for a new martial Supreme to send a message or locate him.This Supreme martial artist actually rarely participated in the battle. Most of the time, it was the human King and the others who participated. Even the sun god fought more than him. It seemed that he had been staying in new martial arts for many years.However, everyone understood that he was the brain of neo martial.He was commanding all the powerhouses in neo martial to devour Crimson moon's power step by step and strengthen neo martial. He had used a thousand years to develop neo martial from the weakest Tier 6 world to what it was today. It was related to the human King and the others, as well as the Supreme Being of neo martial.With him in command, neo martial quickly rose from a newborn world.As of now, in the entire Crimson Moon region, only the Crimson Moon world was capable of fighting.Longevity swordsman sensed the location and found that it was not too far away from him. Of course, it was only relatively so. He did not say anything and quickly changed direction and flew towards that area.Originally, the Supreme martial artist should have made arrangements, but it seemed that he felt that things were not stable now and that he might encounter even greater trouble. The longevity sword still believed in old Zhang's judgment.From the looks of it, the new king of the Silvermoon clan was not a kind person.That was normal!If they were good, they would not be the new king of the Silvermoon and would not be able to leave the Silvermoon world.……In the neo martial world.The Grandmaster opened his eyes and looked at the sky, as if he was thinking about something.After a long time, he suddenly said,"someone, go and call senior earth Emperor to see me!."Very quickly, someone outside the door answered. This time, the Supreme martial artist didn't directly send a message, but sent someone to invite him.He was also calling her senior.After a while, an old man who looked like an old farmer in the field walked over. He had a scholarly air ... Or rather, a lazy aura. He walked into the hall with carefree steps.He didn't say anything and directly sat down next to Zhi Zun, picking up the teacup and drinking.The Grandmaster looked at the old man, but didn't say anything."What's the matter?"the old man asked after finishing his tea.Before the new martial, the nine emperors and four Emperors dominated.Among them, the celestial Thearch governed the origin.The king of earth had unparalleled schemes and stirred up the wind and clouds. He had once transformed into Daoist Fengyun and stirred up the heaven and earth. He had several Kings and three sons, all of whom were top-notch experts. The youngest son, Li Zhu, was the biggest enemy of the new martial era.The birth of new martial arts was closely related to this sect.In the end, the defeat of the celestial Thearch was greatly related to this family.In the last battle of neo martial, the sect went to death and made a great contribution for the human King to kill the heavenly Emperor. Because of this, they obtained the recognition of the human King. After controlling the underworld, they reversed yin and yang and paid a huge price. Even this large family was resurrected."Senior ... Where is Lizhu?" he asked."He probably went out to play. I'm not too sure."Grandmaster smiled and didn't seem to mind."There's something I want him to do.""You contact him yourself!""I don't have a good relationship with him ... He's always ignored me."The Grandmaster laughed again. He and that person had fought many times in the past. They had schemed against each other, and they had fought and schemed against each other. Everyone knew that the two of them didn't get along.Although the Supreme of neo martial was very famous ... That person didn't care too much and rarely stayed in the neo martial world.The king of earth laughed,"he ignored you?" He's that bold?"The Grandmaster was too lazy to talk to him about this, and spoke again, "There's been some rumors circulating in the primordial chaos that I'm worried about ordinary people doing such a thing...I'll be more at ease if I let Lizhu do it. I want him to go to the divine realm of light as an envoy!"The king of earth immediately sat up straight and looked at Zhi Zun with a slight frown."The rank 8 world in the tianfang region?""Yes,""Alliance?" the old man frowned."It can be considered so.""It's not very reliable. ""I know ... But, even if it's just a name, it's fine! Yunxiao of tianfang is also eyeing neo martial covetously. With Hong Yue ... Once a battle between high-level venerable sovereigns breaks out, an eighth-rank great world will participate, and neo martial will be in danger! If the divine light plane is able to help us tie down the enemy ... Then we'll have some confidence. ""This is not easy to handle!"

Chapter 2749 Return (3)
The king of earth said bluntly,"with just one mouth, he can make an Alliance of type 8 worlds as difficult as ascending to the heavens!.""Even if you can't bring a diplomat from Lizhu ... You won't turn hostile easily, right?""You trust him," the king of earth laughed."Senior's family is full of outstanding people, isn't it?"On this day, the Supreme martial artist was much more polite.The king of earth laughed again,"alright, I'll pass the message to him. However, he's not listening to me now. He's also not paying attention to me, his father." Now that his wings have hardened, it's hard for me to control him, and I don't have the right to control him. After all, I didn't help him much. "The Grandmaster didn't care too much about it, which was also reasonable.The king of earth had schemed for many years, and he didn't really care much about his son. It was normal for him to ignore him.However, he was still her father, so he still had some use.He wouldn't feel at ease if someone else were to do it, but he would feel more at ease if his old rival were to do it."If he's not too far away from the Silver Moon King ... Have him take a look at the Silver Moon King and make a judgment. I'll make a judgment," he said after some thought.The king of earth laughed,"Silver Moon King?" What, after nurturing Fang ping, you want to create a new king?"Zhi Zun also smiled."That's not something I can decide. It's beyond my reach. I'm just making a judgment to see if it will become a threat to the new martial arts."“"Is it that exaggerated?""It's hard to say,""I know."The king of earth stood up."Just this? Is there anything else?""There's nothing else,""Then I'll take my leave first."The old man turned around and left. When he was about to leave, Grandmaster suddenly said,"Does senior have any hope of reaching the seventh step? Among the remaining emperors from the past, I feel that senior has the greatest chance ... In recent years, senior has rarely taken action ...""No chance!"The old man didn't even turn his head,"how can a seventh-rank be so simple?" Besides, I've died once!""I've also died before ..."The old man's voice carried a hint of sneer."You've died before. But when Fang ping reversed yin and yang, did he use the same method for those close to him like you? After reversing you and passing through the chaos lightning tribulation, it's not like that for us. Too much Yin Qi and too little Yang Qi, how can we enter Level Seven with an imbalance of yin and yang?"The Grandmaster frowned slightly and nodded. He didn't deny it, but said,"He hasn't reached level 8 yet. As long as he reaches level 8 and tries to reverse yin and yang again ... He should be able to make up for it! Moreover, we've been searching for a Supreme yang attribute great world nearby. If we can seize it, it won't be difficult for senior to reach the seventh step. ""The sun great world?" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The old man didn't say anything and just shook his head slightly.It's not that simple. He had no idea where to find the sun great world.Moreover, there were many people waiting to be distributed.The reversal of yin and yang had its limits. He thought of something and turned back after walking far away."If yin and yang are at odds, can the Dao of life and death be balanced?"The Grandmaster hesitated for a moment before shaking his head."I'm not too sure. Although I've also cultivated life and death, I'm not a true master of life and death ... On the other hand, the Silver Moon King seems to be cultivating life and death. I don't know the details." You can tell Lizhu that he's also on bad terms with the Silver Moon King. Try to see if you can get some information from him. ""Like this?"The king of earth pondered for a moment and nodded.Soon, he disappeared from the spot.After he left, the Grandmaster once again fell into deep thought. Soon, he closed his eyes and ignored the matter. This time, since it was rumored that the Silvermoon King had some connection with the great radiant world ... Perhaps he could pull in an unreliable ally.Everything would depend on the situation."Life and death, time ..."The way of life and death had not been spread. Even the Crimson Moon had only said that if one cultivated some abilities that could easily trigger the chaos lightning tribulation, time could also trigger the lightning tribulation. The reason why the Supreme martial artist made such a judgment was that the other party had attacked many times, but he had only provoked the chaos lightning tribulation a few times.This meant that ... That person had probably dispersed time.After dispersing time and coming into contact with time, the Silver Moon King's Dao should not be able to catch his attention. He could either cultivate life and death, yin and yang, or space. Space was difficult to master, and he was very clear about yin and yang. He lacked the opportunity to do so.On the other hand, life and death. That person should have experienced life and death, so this was the most likely method to cultivate.……Li Hao wasn't sure how everyone was reacting, but he knew that the red moon master had said that he would be hunted down this time.It was obvious that some of his information might have been leaked.That included the sixth rank venerable sovereign who had escaped. He might also spread some news about him.The celestial pole and King Huai's location might be the focus of many experts now.These two were probably the bright lights.New martial arts, Red Moon, and some experts behind the scenes all saw these two as bait and thus played a game. This was because these two were rare low-level venerable sovereigns who acted alone on new martial arts 'side.It was a big target!The other neo martial venerable sovereigns were all secretive about their whereabouts. Only these two people were under the spotlight because they were not strong and the news might have been leaked.At this moment, the others 'cultivation had temporarily reached a bottleneck.Li Hao distributed the countless resources he had exchanged with Kong Ji. The treasures he had obtained from the dark Tao Aura Crystals were all useful to those below venerable sovereign.Li Hao had never even heard of some treasures.
