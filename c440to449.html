ace turned purple!
 Was there a superpower on the other side?
 Damn it!
 And it happened to be at the same time as her ... Who was it?
 At this moment, she wanted to kill someone!
 Before she could get angry, before she could decide whether to retreat or wait for a while to make these black-armored people lose their fighting power, a copper-armored figure appeared in the next moment!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com BOOM!
 The copper-armored warrior slashed his sword and it clashed with the lightning.
 'Damn it, I can't stay here any longer!' Ziyue cursed.
 Otherwise, he would be in deep trouble.
  Because this place was too close to the city gate, there were many black-armored warriors. In the blink of an eye, seventy to eighty black-armored warriors came out from all directions.
 Zirai had no choice but to give up on the few black armors who were about to die and escape.
 He didn't dare to fly, as flying in this place was simply courting death.
 However, the armored soldiers behind him caught up, and the sounds of killing rang out.
 There were even more armored soldiers coming from the inner city.
 At the 3rd Street, Hong Yitang was also about to solve the problem ... But in the next moment, he ran away and cursed in his heart.
 Ziyue, that trash!
 He was at the peak of the three suns realm, but he caused such a huge commotion while dealing with a few black armors and attracted so many armorers. Damn it.
 Run!
 Even though the three suns were not allowed to fly, their speed was still very fast. However, in the city, once the black armors discovered the enemy, they did not slow down. In the blink of an eye, the black armors appeared in all directions and began to surround the purple Moon.
 As for Zi Yue, she was also blocked from the front and back. She was indeed powerful. With a boom, lightning exploded and even struck the copper armor away. However, in the blink of an eye, seventy to eighty swords came towards her. Zi Yue's scalp went numb.
 She wasn't afraid, but these things couldn't be killed. She didn't have the time to send them flying for a minute.
 If this went on, she wouldn't be able to stop more and more words.
 The next moment, she couldn't help but roar,""Quickly come and help me!"
 If they didn't come, she wouldn't be polite either. She directly ran towards them with these black armors.
 However, who would dare to come over at this moment?
 In the distance, the reincarnation King had finished off the black armors. He then shouted,""Quickly leave the outer city! Run!"
 He was not only talking to Ziyue, but also to the Yama superpowers in the city.
 Hurry up and run!
 'That idiot, Ziyue. He actually caused such a huge commotion by killing a few black armors. At this time, they even saw something unusual. It's in the inner city. At this moment, it might have sensed the powerful Ziyue.'
 The next moment, a white light flashed!
 He directly flew!
 This was the first time they had seen a flying expert. It was a silver-armored warrior who had flown over from the top of the city walls. He held a silver greatsword in his hand and didn't emit any aura.
 However, everyone knew that ... They were in trouble!  He had really attracted a stronger existence.
 A silver-tier warrior!
 Ziyue's expression also changed. At this time, she no longer cared about anything.
 A huge Thunderbolt exploded instantly and the soldiers were thrown off their feet. She quickly escaped, but the more she used her full strength, the wider the range of the superpower, which led to more and more black armored soldiers swarming over.
 ……
 At this moment, Li Hao and the others in the distance had long taken off their armor.
 Li Hao took a deep breath. What a great formation.
 I just wanted to make Ziyue suffer ... But now, he has also sensed that those black-armored people have appeared in the outer city.
 Run!
 "Should we leave the city or what?" Liu Long was also anxious.
 Li Hao glanced around and suddenly saw a ball of light. He was delighted.""Quick, catch up with the one in front ... Department head Hao is in front!"
 He saw Hao lianchuan's ball of light!
 That's good, it's good to sneak out now.
 If he hadn't seen Hao lianchuan, he wouldn't have dared to sneak out ... But since he had seen him, he should get out of here as soon as possible. Now that he had his eyes on someone, maybe Hao lianchuan could help him.
 Liu Long and the others didn't doubt him. There were some things that didn't need to be asked.
 Li Hao said he saw it ... So it should be there.
 ……
 At that moment, Hao lianchuan was also running away like crazy.
 'Damn you, Ziyue, you're really a piece of trash. You only killed a few black armors, are you going to confiscate their property?'
 He even provoked a silver chiliarch!
 He was also extremely speechless!
 The number of black armors in the city increased rapidly. Not far away, there were even screams. Those were the supers who did not manage to escape in time. They were all discovered by the black armors.
 Just as Hao lianchuan was about to run away, he suddenly stopped in his tracks. The next moment, his eyes widened.
  "You guys ..."
 "Minister, we're here to get you. Get out!"
 艹!
 I thought that you had been teleported to somewhere else, and I had also guessed that you would be here. Who would have thought that you would be completely fine, and even have the time to find me ... You are truly capable!
 To them, the outer city was still very dangerous, but looking at these three people, they were completely fine and uninjured. It seemed that they were doing well.
 He was really good.
 He didn't have time to say anything more. He instantly pulled a few people and ran outside. As he ran, he cursed,""The purple Moon is so useless. Are the people of the red moon all so stupid? I told you, it's close to the inner city, and the black armor...No, even the silver is drawn out!"
 Liu Long didn't say a word. Hao lianchuan probably didn't expect that it wasn't Zi Yue who had caused such a big problem, but the crystal beads that Li Hao had casually buried.
 Boom! Boom! Boom!
 In the distance, the sounds of explosions continued. Lightning flashed, reflecting the appearance of the entire outer city.

 At this moment, a silver-armored soldier with a large sword in his hand slashed down and directly shattered the lightning. With just one look, Hao lianchuan gasped,""The strength of the late stage to the peak of the three yang realm ... And he's still an unkillable existence. Zi Yue ... I'm afraid she's really in trouble!"
 It didn't matter if the enemy died. The key was that this guy was so powerful. If they wanted to enter the inner city later, they would have to go through this pass. This was not easy to handle.
 "You bastards!" Ziyue roared."You bastards!"
 In the next moment, she directly rose into the air and flew towards Hong Yitang, who was the closest to her, regardless of the possible danger in the air ... Hong Yitang's face turned purple!
 BOOM!
 At this moment, a white light flickered in the air and instantly bombarded Zi Yue's body. However, a suit of armor wrapped in lightning appeared on Zi Yue's body.
 A loud boom instantly rang out!
 Zi Yue staggered, but she wasn't killed. Instead, she instantly landed beside the running Hong Yitang.
 Hong Yitang didn't say anything. The two three suns didn't say anything and quickly chased after Hu dingfang in the distance.
 Hu dingfang, who was also running fast, cursed when he saw this.
  How did these guys end up like this after killing a few black armors?
 He even used an origin god weapon!
 At this moment, the black-armored soldiers had already appeared. There were also quite a few bronze-armored Centurions. They slashed at them with their long swords!
 Not only that ... The sound of something breaking through the air rang out.
 In the city, the traps that had not been activated before seemed to have activated as well. In that instant, sharp blades shot through the air and killed the supers who did not manage to escape in time!
 Even if the three suns were shot, they would still feel a sharp pain.
 The invisible blade that Hao lianchuan was talking about had appeared!
 Hao lianchuan, on the other hand, was running with the three of them. As he ran, he shouted,""Quickly retreat! We've triggered those mechanisms ..."
 He was also extremely depressed, but fortunately, he was not far from the city.
 As he ran, he could see the large square. If he retreated, he would be safe.
 At this moment, Li Hao and the others looked back. A large amount of lightning had already illuminated the entire city ... Many three suns were running for their lives. If it was silver alone, he could deal with them, but at this moment, the 800 Black-armored guards might have all appeared.
 At this time, these three suns didn't dare to force it, as that would be courting death.
 Zi Yue was the most miserable. She had been hit by the restriction in the air. Although the origin god weapon had blocked most of the power, her hair was disheveled and blood was flowing from the corner of her mouth. She was so angry that she wanted to go crazy.
 Just now, who was the one who made a move?
 Of course, there was no need to pursue the matter. Under such circumstances, the other party was dead for sure!
 However, he could not vent the anger in his heart.
 With a loud bang, a silver sword slashed down again from behind. Although Hong Yitang's strength was not as good as Zi Yue 's, he ran very fast. With a kick, he instantly surpassed Zi Yue and gave the sword to her.
 Zi Yue almost wanted to strike him with lightning, but if she did, Hong Yitang would be in danger if they fought.
 Ziyue had no choice but to release her lightning to resist the sword again and escape even faster.
 Further ahead, Hu dingfang let out a tiger's roar and stomped the ground, forcing the surrounding black armors to retreat. He also ran towards the Samsara King without stopping. Suffer, let's all suffer together.  ……
 The entire outer city was in chaos!
 Outside the square, the supers from the large organizations quickly rushed over. They did not dare to approach the square, but they all looked worried.
 How did it end up like this?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The next moment, a flash of light appeared. Hao lianchuan ran back and threw Li Hao and the others into the crowd. No one was in the mood to pay attention to this. At this moment, people were still running out of the city.
 Hao lianchuan quickly shouted,"enter the square and unleash your powers. Attract the black-armored man here. Let the three suns have a chance to escape. Otherwise, we're all dead!"
 They could go out, but the three suns of the organization had died, and these people would not have a good end!
 The next moment, everyone entered the square one after another and their powers exploded. In an instant, they attracted the attention of countless black armors and they all rushed over. The pressure on the three suns was finally reduced a lot.
 Li Hao and the others in the crowd also took the opportunity to sneak in. Looking at this big scene ... Liu Long speechlessly glanced at Li Hao.
 Good fellow!
 You're really good at pretending, you have an innocent face, as if nothing happened.
 No one knew that this chaos was caused by Li Hao, and he even had a worried look on his face ... What the hell are you worried about?
 And Li Hao was indeed worried.
 He was worried that Ziyue would not die!
 How good would it be if he died!
 However, even if he didn't die, he would be in trouble. He could see the silver greatsword madly slashing at the purple Moon ... How tragic!
 What a pitiful Ziyue!
 Li Hao silently sympathized with him. Fortunately, he wasn't in the city. Otherwise, he would have been finished.
 "Ah!"
  Zi Yue's angry roars continued to ring out. The next moment, Zi Yue flew into the air again at an extremely fast speed. In the blink of an eye, a white light attacked. The Thunder armor on Zi Yue's body burst out, but it was struck so hard that the Thunder kept flashing.
 A moment later, Zi Yue flew back while resisting the pressure. However, Li Hao took a look ... The Thunder beast, which was the origin god weapon, seemed to have exhausted a lot of energy. It was almost motionless inside Zi Yue's body. Could it have been killed?
 As for Zi Yue's ball of light, it had also shrunk by a size. It seemed that she had used up a lot of energy and was badly injured.
 Intense panting sounds were heard continuously.
 Zi Yue's hair was disheveled, and her eyes were filled with hatred.
 Damn it!
 The origin god weapon was severely damaged, but if it hadn't flown back just now, she was afraid that she wouldn't have been able to come back.
 The next moment, they saw a sword light. Hong Yitang roared and slashed out. The earth trembled as the power of the earth overturning sword was instantly displayed. It sent the armored warriors around him flying. He also leaped and crossed hundreds of meters, quickly escaping in this direction.
 One by one, the three suns were a little dejected as they cursed madly in their hearts!
 The city was already in a mess.

 Li Hao didn't care about the others. He was mainly staring at Zi Yue.
 The current Hong Yue was full of resentment towards him.
 In addition, his teacher had killed many of the three suns of the Crimson Moon. As long as there was a chance, these people would definitely not let him go.
 On one hand, he was looking at Ziyue to see how her injuries were.
 The second was to look at the red shadow.
 Most of the people on the red moon's side had Red Shadows, but he did not see any Red Shadows on Zi Yue. This was also something that Li Hao found strange. Even when they had encountered such a great crisis, Zi Yue had not shown any Red Shadows.
 No?
 Or ... The red shadow of the purple Moon was not here?
 Zi Yue was very powerful. If she had a red shadow, it should be a red shadow with the strength of the three suns. But why didn't he see it?
 Li Hao was a little confused, but no one could give him an answer.
  In the distance, Zi Yue was panting heavily. She looked back at the silver-level experts, then suddenly turned to look at Li Hao. She felt that someone was looking at her. Although many people were looking at her, the gaze made her very uncomfortable.
 She followed his line of sight ... And her eyes moved slightly.
 The Li family's descendant!
 She hadn't seen Li Hao before.
 However, the Nightwatchers had entered the city before Red Moon. She wasn't sure if Li Hao and the others had entered the city to investigate or what they were doing. Before she saw them, she was worried that Li Hao had died.
 Now that he had seen Li Hao, he felt a little more at ease.
 Yes, she didn't want Li Hao to die Here more than anyone else.
 Red moon's request was that even if they couldn't take down Li Hao, they had to try their best to keep Li Hao alive. Of course, there was also a prerequisite ... They couldn't give Li Hao any more chances to become stronger. Li Hao's ability to break through 100 without anyone knowing had already been known by the higher-ups, and they were extremely dissatisfied.
 It would be even better if they could capture Li Hao alive!
 Of course, there was also a final bottom line. If Li Hao really died, he had to bring back Li Hao's body in one piece. This was a decision that could only be made as a last resort.
 As long as it was possible, Li Hao could not be allowed to die.
 When Zi Yue saw Li Hao, she did not care about his gaze. The resentment she had for being injured earlier had dissipated a little.
 He was still here, and it was fine as long as he was alive!
 She knew more about the eight great families than anyone else. This was a matter of great importance. Hong Yue had planned for the eight great families for many years, and she had originally wanted to complete it without anyone knowing.
 In the end, Li Hao made a mistake on his last attempt. It was a pity.
 Even if the other families died, Hong Yue tried her best to make it look like a natural death, so it didn't attract any attention. But now, it was all over the place.
 Just as he was thinking, a loud noise came from the city.
 Hong Yitang was caught up again. At this moment, he had to shout for help,""Commander Hu!"
 In the distance, Hu dingfang turned his head and took a look. When he saw the silver-tier expert, he immediately flew into the air at a very fast speed. It would be difficult to outrun this guy if he ran on the ground.
  Save Hong Yitang?  Hong Yitang's swords gate was a lot stronger than the three major organizations. In addition, Hong Yitang was a native of Silver Moon, so he did not harm the ordinary people of Silver Moon. Therefore, the three major organizations were known as dark powers.
 Swords gate, on the other hand, was not considered a dark power organization.
 After a moment's consideration, Hu dingfang turned his head and struck in the air. A sharp beam of metal energy condensed. This was also a metal-Elemental Expert. In an instant, the metal-elemental energy gathered into a ball of light.
 The ball of light rapidly shot into the air!
 BOOM!
 With a loud sound, the silver-tier expert took a few steps back, which gave Hong Yitang a chance to escape. In the blink of an eye, he had run away.
 ……
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At the square.
 Li Hao didn't look at the city, but at the swords gate. At this moment, many people in the swords gate were worried. The three suns expert that Li Hao had paid attention to, the one who was suspected to be Hong Yitang's mistress, also looked worried. It seemed that he was ready to rescue Hong Yitang at any time.
 Li Hao only took a glance. At this moment, many black-armored soldiers had gathered around them.
 Hao lianchuan and the other powerhouses who managed to escape attacked one after another. They hit the black armors so hard that they kept flying out. Some of them were even sent flying out of the square. Once they flew out of the square and into the outer city, these black armors would lose their combat power very quickly.
 "The rest of you can leave now!"
 Hao lianchuan shouted. He had already attracted a large group of black armors. If they stayed any longer, they would be cannon fodder when the silver-tier powerhouses arrived.
 Everyone retreated.
 Soon, everyone had retreated from the outer city area.
 At this moment, Wang Ming hurriedly squeezed through the crowd. Seeing Li Hao and the others, he heaved a sigh of relief."Are you guys okay?"
 These few fellows had disappeared the moment they entered.
 Fortunately, he had finally returned.
  "I'm fine!"
 Li Hao chuckled and said in a low voice,"Hao bu has arranged a special mission. After we entered, we deliberately split up from everyone. I just didn't expect that Purple Moon would suddenly attract such a powerful expert. What a pity. We almost completed the mission."
 What mission?
 Wang Ming's interest was instantly piqued and he was a little curious.
 Li Hao shook his head and said nothing.
 Wang Ming was a little regretful, but he didn't ask too much. It was a secret, so it was better not to ask. He was also afraid that he wouldn't be able to help talking about it.
 At this moment, not far from Li Hao's group, Zhang Ting's ears twitched slightly. It was extremely light, but she heard the conversation between the two clearly.
 Mission?
 Did they separate on purpose?
 Didn't hao lianchuan say that there was a problem with the teleportation and that was why they were separated ... So it wasn 't!

 The disappearance of the three martial masters meant that they had entered the outer city ... It was true that martial masters had some advantages in the outer city, as it was difficult to spot them in black armor. However, these three weren't that strong, so what kind of special mission could they carry out?
 Zhang Ting looked over at Hao lianchuan, who was still fighting. Hao lianchuan seemed to be an upright person, but of course, he also seemed to be a little incompetent ... But now it seemed like he had his own schemes.
 Zhang Ting was also paying attention to Li Hao.
 He was the descendant of the Li family, one of the eight great families of Silver City.
 The central region did pay attention to the matter of Silver City, but the battle was so intense that they couldn't spare too many people. However, Li Hao was on night patrol, so there were some orders from the higher-ups.
 First, try to get as much information as possible about the eight great families.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Second, it would be best if he could get his hands on the sword that the Li family handed over.
 Third, get close to Li Hao and see if you can get any special information.
 Fourth, we can't let the Crimson Moon succeed ... As for how to prevent such a situation, we'll have to think about it.
 Zhang Ting understood what he meant.
  When there were no problems, they didn't need to worry about anything. Once they encountered trouble, the first thing they had to do was to find a way to save Li Hao. If they couldn't save Li Hao, they would kill Li Hao. They couldn't let the red moon people succeed!
 As long as Hong Yue's plan was ruined, even if they didn't know the secrets of the eight great families, it didn't matter.
 After all, they knew even less than Red Moon.
 Zhang Ting's mind was filled with such thoughts as she looked at the silver-tier Warriors in the distance. Her eyes flickered slightly. The ruins that Silver Moon had discovered this time were far more powerful than she had imagined, and she had to report this matter!
 Just the thousand black hou, the bronze hou, and the silver armor ... They were all priceless treasures!
 If he could obtain all of them, he could create a thousand-man Martial Master battle team!
 Such a team could even sweep through some provinces and was extremely terrifying.
 And this was only the strength of the outer city.
 What about the inner city?
 There was at least one origin divine weapon in the inner city, and it looked extremely powerful. It might be the legendary heavenly origin divine weapon.
 Origin God weapons were also divided into different levels.
 As long as a divine weapon had some characteristics, it could be considered an origin divine weapon. For example, it could absorb some mysterious energy to replenish its consumption, shrink and expand, and store it in its body ...
 These were all the definitions of origin God weapons.
 However, there were also strong and weak origin God weapons. The one she carried was the weakest, while the fiery phoenix spear she wielded was one of the stronger ones. It was rare even in the central region.
 She then looked at Zi Yue, who was carrying an origin divine weapon. She didn't know what it was before, but now she knew. It was the Thunder God's armor.
 It was a black divine weapon, one grade higher than his yellow divine weapon.  Moreover, because it was an armor-type weapon, it was relatively more valuable. However, as long as it reached the level of an origin god weapon, there was no need to care about its type. It was just very precious.
 As one of the seven moons, it was normal for the purple Moon to obtain a Mystic Divine weapon.
 Zhang Ting silently observed. This time, she didn't have many tasks to do in the ruins. She had reported to her superiors, and they only told her to keep an eye on them and not make a move. However, there was one thing ... They couldn't let any defensive divine weapons fall into hou Xiaochen's hands!
 A defensive origin god weapon was no secret in the eyes of some people.
 According to what was written on it, not giving hou Xiaochen this treasure was to prevent him from choosing to rebel now. Once he resolved his worries, hou Xiaochen might rebel!
 Would hou Xiaochen rebel?
 In truth, Zhang Ting didn't know either. However, she did know that hou Xiaochen had disobeyed his superiors "orders several times, refusing to carry them out and not participating in the central continent's war. Originally, after hou Xiaochen had left, the higher-ups had wanted her to take charge of Silver Moon.
 But now, hou Xiaochen still hadn't left. This could be considered a rebellion!
 Zhang Ting's mind was racing. She looked at Zi Yue and the others in front of her and saw the black armors being thrown out of the outer city and turning into armor. She was thinking, where are the armors that the night patrolmen had obtained before?
 Had hou Xiaochen been training a lot of experts in secret to prepare for the upcoming rebellion?
 He had to report this matter as soon as possible!
 Perhaps hou Xiaochen was really going to rebel!
 She couldn't figure out why he wanted to rebel.
 But this was none of her business.
 As a three Sun Expert, she had been dormant here for three years. If she had stayed in the central region all this time, she might have entered the late stage or even the peak of the three sun realm long ago. She was a little impatient after wasting three years.
  This time, she hoped to obtain more evidence of hou Xiaochen's betrayal. That way, the central continent might be able to take him down. With solid evidence, there wouldn't be much of a problem.
 As for the three major organizations ... They wouldn't do that. They would love for hou Xiaochen to leave.
 And Hu dingfang ...
 She glanced at Hu dingfang in the distance. Without mentioning anything else, it was a serious crime for hou Xiaochen to collude with Hu dingfang. The military was independent, and according to the dynasty's laws, the inspection Office and the military were two separate systems. No level of collusion was allowed.
 Once they colluded with the military, it would be a sign of rebellion!
 Although this was Hu dingfang's personal operation, he was the commander of the Tiger wing Army. Perhaps this time, he might even take down Hu dingfang as well.
 ……
 While Zhang Ting was observing the others, Li Hao would also observe her from time to time.
 Soon, Li Hao looked at the square.
 At this time, the Samsara King had also escaped. A moment later, Hu dingfang let out a long howl and crossed a hundred meters in one step, landing on the square. Behind him, Hong Yitang, covered in dust and coughing blood, also rushed back.

 The three suns had gathered!
 In the distance, the silver-tier elite with the greatsword was covered in armor. This time, he did not rush over like the other armored warriors. Instead, an unknown, sharp, and ear-piercing sound came from his armor.
 In the next moment, all the black-armored and bronze-armored soldiers in the city retreated and gathered toward him.
 Everyone was shocked!
 The silver-armored warrior still had consciousness?
 Or perhaps, he had a different command from the others?
 He was actually able to order these armored soldiers around. Although he knew that this was an Army, the black hou and copper Yan soldiers had been able to attack without making a sound, completely different from now.
 A moment later, a large number of black armors gathered under the silver-armored soldiers. The eight bronze armors each led a team and divided into eight small teams, forming a special battle formation.
 The silver-armored soldier held a large sword and looked forward.
 In front of them, many three suns did not retreat from the square. Instead, they looked on solemnly. They also wanted to see and test what else this Army could do.
  At that moment, the silver-tier warrior swung his sword!
 Below them, a team of 100 people instantly spread out and drew out large shields from their armors!
 Shield warrior!
 Before that, they didn't see their big shields.
 Hundreds of shield Warriors stood in front of them, and their huge shields instantly blocked everyone. Not only that, but those large shields seemed to have connected together to form a steel wall.
 Not only that, behind the steel walls, another hundred-man team suddenly transformed their swords into Spears. Spear formation!
 Boom! Boom! Boom!
 The sound of footsteps!
 The sound of uniform footsteps could be heard as the entire steel Army marched toward them. The huge square was a wide expanse of flat land, which was just right for these troops to move about. Perhaps it could be said that this place was originally used for the gathering of troops.
 In an instant, the battle formation formed by more than 800 armored soldiers was like one person. They walked in unison and instantly charged toward the three suns.
 Among the three suns, Zi Yue was the first to make a move. She hated these guys to the core.
 A bolt of lightning struck down!
 If it was before, the lightning would have been able to send the black armor flying. If it had been stronger, it could have even cracked the black armor.
 However, this time, when the lightning landed on the shields, its power was instantly dispersed by the hundred shields. The remaining power, under everyone's observation, instantly fused into the ground.
 Ziyue was shocked!
 In the next moment, the battle formation had already charged over.
 The large shield disappeared in an instant, and in the blink of an eye, hundreds of long Spears stabbed at him!
 "Hu!"
 The air exploded as the hundred Spears released a blood-red aura. It felt like killing intent.
 This was an Army that had been on the battlefield for many years!
 It was definitely not the military that they had seen on the battlefield now. Even Hu dingfang's expression was constantly changing. If this 1000-man army broke into the Tiger wing Army, could the 100000-strong Tiger wing Army stop them?
 After all, the Tiger wing Army consisted mostly of ordinary people with very few superpowers.
  If the guns couldn't cause any damage to the armor ... It would be a massacre!  "Attack!"
 The three suns attacked one after another.
 They also wanted to test the waters, so the Super experts attacked one after another. At that moment, the Super fluctuations were extremely intense. Under the joint efforts of many three suns, the huge shield reappeared.
 However, when these people attacked at the same time, there was still a loud boom and the shields were shattered one after another. The powerful attack force shattered the shields of these soldiers, even though they were extremely strong.
 At this moment, someone sensed danger.
 The three suns expert who was flying in the sky instantly felt his hair stand on end!
 Everyone's attention was on the silver-armored warrior, but they had forgotten about the eight bronze-armored warriors. At this moment, these eight Warriors suddenly appeared behind the large shield.
 Eight long swords emerged from behind a broken shield.
 One sword was extremely neat, sealing off all directions. Eight swords were launched at the same time!
 BOOM!
 With a loud bang, the flying expert's superpower exploded violently, but his defense was still penetrated by the eight swords. In the blink of an eye, bloody wounds appeared on his chest and head. He quickly retreated, but fortunately, there was three suns beside him.
 At this moment, although some people hoped that the flying sky guy was dead ... They all understood that the death of one of the three suns at this time would be a great blow to the morale.
 The Samsara King and Hu dingfang came to their rescue at the same time. They attacked one after another, and with a loud bang, they repelled the eight swords.
 "Watch out!" Hao lianchuan shouted at that moment."Be careful!"
 The crowd had been paying attention to the silver-tier warrior. They only saw the silver-tier warrior fall into the crowd in an instant. In the blink of an eye, the large shield was raised again, blocking their line of sight.
 The next moment, everyone was shocked.
 The aura of these armored warriors was not obvious.
 At this moment, that guy might be behind the shield, but who would that guy attack?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Just as he was thinking, the shield disappeared.
 Everyone's faces changed when they saw the scene!
 The eye-catching silver color ... Disappeared!
  It had disappeared!
 Where was he?
 ? Where did he go?
 Right at this moment, Yama's Yao Cheng's expression changed drastically. In front of him, a black-armored warrior was slashing at him. He didn't pay much attention to it at first, as the black-armored warrior was too weak.
 However, the fear in his bones told him that ... This sword was not simple!
 "No... Good ..."
 BOOM!
 A deafening boom reverberated through the world as the black-armored warrior slashed out with a power that instantly surpassed Yao Cheng 's, reaching the peak of three suns!
 Bang! Bang!
 The brilliant wind blade was shattered. His expression changed and he was sent flying. However, his arm was still cut by the sword. With a plop, his arm fell off. His face was pale. He didn't care about this and retreated out of the city.

 The next moment, all the three suns retreated without saying anything!
 All of them quickly evacuated the square!
 There was no way to fight!
 Everyone was shocked. This silver ... Could change its color?
 He had actually turned into the black banner and hid within it. How was he supposed to fight?
 The black Phoenix did not have any aura, or rather, these soldiers were all the same. They were all made from the same mold. It was impossible to fight every Black Phoenix with all your might. If you did, your powers would have been used up long ago.
 However, the moment you are careless ... You will be struck to death by this silver-ranked expert in disguise!
 "Hao lianchuan!"
 The Samsara King glared at Hao lianchuan fiercely. As for Yaocheng, he looked at his broken arm with an extremely ugly expression. He had been ambushed. More importantly, that silver had been staring at him. Did it think that he was the weakest?
 He was almost killed by the sword. Fortunately, there were experts around. He escaped quickly and escaped death.
  Originally, he was just testing these armored soldiers ... In the end, it was just a test, and one of the three suns lost an arm.
 Hao lianchuan's brows were also tightly furrowed at this moment. He was a little dissatisfied and annoyed."What are you shouting for? how would I know about this situation? The Nightwalker has never encountered such a thing before. If I knew that he could hide in it and transform into a Black Phoenix, I would have told him long ago. If you die now, it won't do me any good!"
 He was also having a headache!
 He wasn't lying. He really didn't know that silver-ranked powerhouses could hide in the black flames and even transform into the black flames. It was impossible to distinguish them. They would only be slightly exposed when they attacked. This was very similar to martial masters.
 This is troublesome!
 Everyone was helpless. At this moment, the Army was also quickly recalled.
 A moment later, the silver-tier powerhouse flew into the sky again and looked out of the city.
 In the blink of an eye, the silver-armored warriors flew toward the inner city, and the remaining black-armored men quickly disappeared and began to retreat.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com As long as the enemy did not enter the city, they would not care.
 Only after all the black Phoenix had disappeared did the moonlight and sunlight behind them heave a sigh of relief.
 How terrifying!
 At this moment, on the Yama's side, the Samsara King looked around and his expression turned ugly. As the Yama was the first to arrive, there were quite a number of powers entering the city. The sudden explosion just now had caused hei Teng to increase in numbers and kill people everywhere ...
 The people he killed were mainly Yama's people!
 Many Yama Kings had already died. This time, more than 30 people had entered. At this moment, only half of them were gathered here!
 Half of them were dead!
  Apart from those individual cultivators, the Yama had probably suffered the most losses. There were also a few sunlit cultivators who were missing, and it seemed like they had all died in the outer city.  Swords gate also suffered great losses.
 There were quite a lot of people from swords gate who entered the outer city, and this time, they had lost seven to eight of them. Hong Yitang's face was also not looking good, they were just exploring the outer city, and so many people had died.
 The other families didn't suffer much losses.
 The Yama's biggest loss was not this, but Yaocheng's lost arm. To a superpower, losing an arm did not affect their combat power much. After all, supers were different from martial masters.
 If a Martial Master lost an arm, the impact would be greater.
 However, losing an arm would also affect Yaocheng's combat power. The key was the blow to their confidence. Even the three suns were in danger, which greatly affected the morale of the entire exploration team!
 The Samsara dynasty's Nightwalker swept his gaze over them. Suddenly, he looked at Liu Long, Li Hao, and the others with a cold and sharp gaze."Where did you guys go?"
 "Explore the outer city!" Liu Long frowned and said calmly.
 "Explore the outer city?" the reincarnation King shouted with a cold face. When did he explore it? The Yama and swords gate arrived here as soon as they could, but they have locked down this place and didn't see you guys enter the outer city!"
 His face was cold."The night patrolman knows more. You three martial masters suddenly disappeared and then appeared. When you reappeared, such a big mess broke out. This matter ... Is related to you!"
 “……”
 Li Hao, Liu Long, and the others all cursed in their hearts. You're right.
 However, this guy was obviously saying this on purpose to find fault.
 Li Hao didn't believe that he would really think that way. However, Yama had suffered heavy losses, and he probably had other motives.
  The few of them did not say anything.
 Hao lianchuan's face turned cold,"Huanhuan, what do you mean?" You know what happened. Ziyue was too slow and her power exploded, which attracted those guys 'attention. What does it have to do with them? I arranged for them to enter the outer city and explore some things. Are you trying to find fault with them?"
 The Yama coldly said,"so, you have a second passage to the outer city?" Other than this square, it seemed that no one could enter from the other directions. It was as if there was a layer of protective film. How did they enter? You tell me!"
 Finding fault was one thing.
 Second, he wanted to get more information. The night patrolman must have hidden some important information.
 Hao lianchuan furrowed his brows. At this moment, the rest of the people were also making things difficult for him."Hao lianchuan, are you Nightwatchers trying to take this opportunity to kill all of us?"
 "Is there only one passage in the outer city? Hei Teng is very well known here. Once we enter, we'll easily attract his attention!"
 "What are the night patrollers trying to do?"
 “……”
 Hao lianchuan frowned and said in a low voice,""There's a second passage, but it's extremely dangerous. Martial masters might be safe, but superpowers have a 90% chance of dying! Besides, we're only entering the outer city, so there's no need to suffer too much of a loss ..."

 "Where are you?"
 The others 'eyes lit up.
 As for why they had to find the second passage to enter the outer city, it was because at this moment, the silver-tier expert might be paying attention to this side. It was too dangerous.
 He didn't expect it to really exist!
 Li Hao and the others were also slightly surprised. Was there really such a thing?
 Or was he lying to them?
 Hao lianchuan must have known that they had not entered through the second passage but had been directly teleported in ... This guy had not asked them why they were there before, so he must have known something.
 In that case, the second passage was probably fake.
 Hao lianchuan frowned."I told you. It's dangerous. I didn't lie to you!" "We've explored it once before by accident, but many people died, so we gave up. If a Martial Master enters, there won't be any fluctuations, so it'll be safer. I asked Liu Long and the others to go in first just to investigate the distribution of the black Phoenix. Every month, the distribution of the black Phoenix will be slightly different ..."
 As soon as he said that, Lord zhuanlun said coldly,""We don't need you to remind us. We just want to know where the second passage is!"
  "I told you it's dangerous ..." Hao lianchuan furrowed his brows and was a little annoyed.
 "You're afraid of us being in danger?"
 The cycle King sneered."It's best if you can't wait for us to die. Why would you kindly remind us that it's dangerous?" Hao lianchuan, it looks like there's something special about the second passageway, right?"
 Hao lianchuan struggled for a moment, and his expression changed slightly.
 "We've already come to this point," Ziyue said gloomily."We've all suffered great losses. Hao lianchuan, do you think we can keep this a secret?"
 Hao lianchuan glanced at Hu dingfang, but Hu dingfang ignored him. He didn't want to make the decision, so Hao lianchuan would make the decision.
 Hao lianchuan sighed and said,""There's an ancient house on the first street. The main door is different from the other houses, and it faces the outside. If we enter from there, we can enter the ancient city ... But like I said, it's very dangerous, extremely dangerous! Martial masters did not have any superpower fluctuations, so the survival rate was 90%! However, superpowers ... Have a 10% chance of survival!"
 Everyone's eyes moved.
 Enter the ancient house directly?
 What was in the ancient house?
 Also, what's the benefit of going in from there?
 "What's the difference between entering from the ancient house and entering from here?"Ziyue asked quickly.
 "There are!"
 Hao lianchuan was a little unhappy and said unhappily,""The martial masters haven't found anything yet, but the supers who enter from the ancient house ... When they fight, they won't have any superpower fluctuations and won't attract too much attention ..."
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com As soon as he said that, Zi Yue and the others 'faces changed.
 "Bastard, why didn't you say so earlier?" the reincarnation King cursed. The night patrolmen are really trying to kill us ..."  "Idiot!" Hao lianchuan said angrily. It was just a wave of energy, how many could die? Entering the ancient house, there was a 90% chance of death. Who would suffer a greater loss? I wanted to trick you, trick you, I should have told you at the first moment that it would be best if you all died! I didn't say it because I hope that everyone can fight the enemy together. Otherwise, I wouldn't have gone that way. "
 "Who knows if you're telling the truth or not!"
 "Perhaps you want to take the opportunity to kill us and then go to the ancient house?" the Rotary King sneered.
 No matter what, he had just received an important piece of information.
 There were no superpowers!
 What did this mean?
 This meant that they could attack without any restraint. Even if they killed hei Teng, the other party might not be able to track them down.
 It meant that the three suns could also launch a sneak attack.
 It meant that if they were to hide, even the silver-tier warrior might not be able to find them.
 Damn it, Hao lianchuan, that bastard. The night patrolman really did hide a lot of secrets and was unwilling to tell them.
 How detestable!
 Of course, it was normal for the enemy to not tell them, but hou Xiaochen had said that they should work together ... This guy was a hypocrite. How could that be considered working together?
 The crowd didn't say anything, and soon, someone moved in that direction.
 Hao lianchuan wanted to say something, but he stopped himself ... He looked like he wanted to persuade her.
 After a long time, he sighed and was too lazy to say anything more.
  He looked at Liu Long and the others as if he was blaming them for their actions!
 As for Li Hao, on the one hand, he was surprised that there was really an entrance, and on the other hand, he felt that ... Department head Hao was being a little too exaggerated!
 'Your expression, your attitude ... Maybe you really didn't intend to say it, but the more you do it, the more tempted everyone is, right?'
 This Minister Kuang ... Felt like a scammer!
 Now that Hao lianchuan had revealed the second entrance, Liu Long and the others did not pay much attention to it. Since there was a second entrance, and they were martial masters, they might have been arranged to enter in advance.
 As for why they didn't see anyone from the beginning, perhaps they had taken a different route from the beginning. Who knew if the night watchman had a second route?
 Hao lianchuan sighed and said,""Hu dingfang, you stay here and keep an eye on them ... I'll go and take a look. Don't let them wander around. If too many of them die ... It's not appropriate!"
 After thinking for a moment, he said, Li Hao, you guys come with me!
 Li Hao and the others quickly followed.
 As they walked, Hao lianchuan transmitted his voice to her,""If someone asks later, just say that it's pitch black inside and you can't see anything. You can't see what's inside the room, but you can feel countless little hands touching you ... That's pretty much what it feels like. As for where we went after we entered ... Just say that we did a casual investigation after entering the city ..."

 "Also," he added,"you said that you saw a token when you came out ... It feels similar to the city entrance token in the ancient books. Remember, don't answer unless someone asks you!" Liu Long, Liu Yan, don't speak. Let Li Hao speak. This guy is very deceitful ..."
 Li Hao had an innocent expression. Did you misunderstand me?
 Department head Hao has a deep misunderstanding of me!
 Of course, he felt that Minister Kuang was a little deceitful and didn't look like a good person. Why did he feel like ... He was a deceitful person?
 Hao lianchuan didn't care what he was thinking and continued,""Lastly, don't tell anyone that you were directly teleported to the outer city. There must be something special about the place you were teleported to. It's not like martial masters haven't been here before, but they're different from you ... It's most likely related to Li Hao! This old man has already said that you must have something to do with this place ... The inner city's Gate has a big turtle pattern, perhaps this place really has something to do with the eight great families. "
 Obviously, he wasn't stupid. He was just pretending not to know anything and didn't say anything.
 "Also, remember, don't run around anymore! From now on, follow me carefully ... We might have a chance to enter the inner city. Li Hao, whether or not we can take away the origin God weapons that cover the entire ancient city ... I think we still have to rely on you! If you die, you'll be in big trouble. Not to mention the origin god weapon, even if your teacher finds trouble with you, it'll be big trouble!"
 "There's one more thing that I forgot to mention. If I'm busy in times of danger, I can look for Hu dingfang ... That guy will definitely not dare to not protect you! Your teacher has long wanted to find trouble with him, and even tried to assassinate him a few times ... But he was stopped. If this guy doesn't protect you this time, he's dead!"
 “……”
 Li Hao was a little confused. Enemy?
  Otherwise, why would his teacher assassinate him?
 "He ... Has learned the five birds technique!"
 It was normal. With so many people learning it, it was fine as long as they didn't learn the breathing technique of five birds. The teacher didn't care about this.
 "I've also learned the core!"
 Li Hao's expression changed, and his eyes turned cold. Core?
 The breathing technique of five birds?
 How was that possible?
 "Don't get angry, it has nothing to do with you. This matter can't be explained in a few words, and your teacher didn't care about it after that. In short, if you encounter danger, just try your best to get close to him!"
 Li Hao took note of it and glanced at Hao lianchuan.
 This Deputy Minister ... He was usually all smiles, but when he was up to no good, he didn't seem like a good person.
 Hao lianchuan ignored his gaze.
 He didn't say anything. Did he have any evidence?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com I sent a voice transmission!
 If you can't even record it, then Sue me if you have evidence!
 Hu dingfang, this bastard ... Li Hao, this big trouble, should be handled by you.
 The riot in the city had nothing to do with Li Hao and the others. He, Hao lianchuan, had even pulled his head off and kicked it like a ball.
 "Minister, can I speak now?" Li Hao asked in a low voice after taking a look.
 "Sure!"
 "Why not?" Hao lianchuan asked in surprise. Could it be that there's someone who can eavesdrop on me?"
 “……”
 Li Hao and the others were stunned. Then ... Why did you send a voice transmission?
 They thought that someone was listening in on them, so they didn't dare to speak.
 Li Hao was speechless. After a long while, he said gloomily,""Um ... There's a bad guy in our team ..."
 "Oh!"
 Hao lianchuan nodded and suddenly smiled.""Are you talking about yourself?"
 “……”
 ? "No!"  Li Hao decided to give her a heads up. Otherwise, if he tried to launch a sneak attack, what if she killed him because she thought he had killed his colleagues?
 Before Li Hao could finish, Hao lianchuan frowned and said,""I know who you're talking about! However, you must remember that even if the Minister says it doesn't matter ... You can't really be indifferent! You have to understand that if that person dies, there will be a lot of trouble. The Minister's crimes will be further increased! Moreover, it would also make some people think that the Minister really had the intention to do that ... In fact, that was not the truth! The Minister was just too lazy to explain ..."
 Li Hao looked at him in a daze. What did he mean? you know the situation?
 Hao lianchuan chuckled."Don't look at me like that. I'm not blind about some things!" That person wasn't a professional in this field, so he would definitely give himself away. It's not easy to move, do you understand? If he moved, it would mean trouble. Also, if he moved, even if the other side didn't hold him accountable, what would he do if another person who was more hidden came? At the very least, it's on the surface now. At least everyone is on guard. "
 Li Hao's head ached. He scratched his head and said,"I ... I lack water energy."
 Hao lianchuan was speechless!
 He glanced at Li Hao and suddenly said,""I can give you the water, so what can you do? Can you directly store your spirit like your teacher?"
 "No... There's still hope for a Qian battle."
 Hao lianchuan hesitated for a moment. After some consideration, he said,""Anyway, you can't do it. Even if you do, you might not be able to solve it ... Of course, if you really want to do it, when no one is around ... Remember, when there are no night patrols, you can consider it! The prerequisite is that you have enough confidence ..."
 He didn't continue to object. He only told Li Hao not to do anything when there were night patrols, because there might be more than one night patrol. She had hidden her strength, but there might be others who didn't and were acting as spies.
 Li Hao understood.
 Then, Hao lianchuan transmitted his voice again,"sneak an attack on the three suns. It's fine as long as the three suns are broken. But you have to remember that once you have an origin divine weapon, a sneak attack is not very useful. You saw Ziyue just now. She instantly summoned the Thunder God armor and has extremely strong defense!" Even the attacks from the sky couldn't kill her ... If you want to deal with that one ... Think of a way to send her up into the sky ... Give her a few thunderous strikes and break the origin god weapon. Only then will you have a chance!"
 Li Hao's expression became even more peculiar.
 Didn't you say you can't kill him?
 But now, why are you giving me ideas?
 Hao lianchuan doesn't care about that. What he's talking about has nothing to do with me.
 "Even if she has an origin god weapon, she won't be too strong. She can't be compared to the purple Moon. She might be at the lowest yellow level ... The purple Moon is at the black level and can block five to six attacks. She can only block three to four attacks at most ... But she needs to stay in the air for about ten seconds ... That's the time to test you."
 "Minister, why don't you ..." Li Hao said.
 Hao lianchuan looked at him in surprise and sent him another message.""I what? I'm a three yang, and everyone is looking at me. You want me to kill my own people? Don't make a fuss. I killed someone. Once someone sees it and word gets out, won't I be dismissed and investigated? If you want to do it, settle it yourself, and you'll be well fed ... Also, after you leave, no one will believe you even if you say that I ordered you to do it! Besides, I won't admit to it!"
 Li Hao didn't know whether to laugh or cry.
 This person was really a coward!
 Do you think I can empty a mid three yang realm cultivator for 10 seconds?
 You must be joking!
 Even with the addition of Liu Long, it would still be very difficult.
 "It's actually not difficult!"
 At this time, Hao lianchuan transmitted his voice again, teaching him with words and actions,""I'll split you guys into a team later. You can run as fast as you can toward the black-armored warriors and attract a lot of them. If a Martial Master hides well, the black-armored warriors won't care. As long as there are black-armored warriors around her ... She'll have to stay in the air even if she doesn't want to!"
  "Oh, and if you can't even deal with this, go to the inner city ... Once the silver is out there, she's definitely done for ... Don't you just want water energy? As long as we move faster and don't let it all be absorbed by the ground, we can still get some back ..."
 After saying all this, Hao lianchuan regained his calm and stopped transmitting his voice.
 "Minister ..."
 Li Hao was just about to speak when Hao lianchuan said in a dignified manner,""Stop talking! The few of you, don't cause trouble for me!"
 “……”
 At this moment, Li Hao, Liu Long, and the others looked at each other with strange expressions.
 Oh my God, two-faced man!
 Department head Hao wasn't a good person either!
 The only thing he was lacking was a strategy to kill Zhang Ting. More importantly, this fatty didn't even want to take the blame himself. He didn't even mention it directly, only using voice transmission ... As expected, bad people don't show it on their faces.
 [PS: it's the end of the month. It'll be a waste if you don't vote. Everyone, vote!]

 At the end of the outer city.
 There, they saw a house that was different from the other houses in the outer city.
 Not only that, but there was also a plaque hanging on the house, and the main door was open.
 "The horse reining Hall."
 Li Hao recognized the ancient characters at a glance. As an archaeologist, he could recognize some basic ancient characters.
 It wasn't as if no one in the crowd had recognized him.
 This time, the large organizations had actually brought some experts in this area.
 "Do you mean to stop at the edge of the cliff?"
 Someone asked with some hesitation. What did he mean?
 It was a perfectly fine passage into the city, but it was called the horse reining Hall.
  Was it to tell everyone not to Harbor any ill intentions?
 It was the simple literal meaning: stop your horse here.
 Seeing that Li Hao and the others had arrived, the Samsara King spoke again,""Hao lianchuan, you've been inside, and so have these people ... Li Hao, tell me, what's inside?"
 He knew Li Hao!
 They could even directly call out his name. Obviously, it was not that these large organizations didn't care about the eight great families or Li Hao, but because Li Hao was too weak, they didn't care too much for the time being.
 But at this moment, the Samsara King pointed out Li Hao.
 Hao lianchuan was the deputy head of the night patrolman, Liu Long was a veteran chief patrol officer, and as for Liu Yan ... The woman's words were not reliable, not to mention that Liu Yan had a grudge against the Yama.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, at least looked gentle.
 Li Hao frowned, glanced at him, and then at Hao lianchuan. Hao lianchuan said calmly,""What are you looking at me for? You're the night patrolman ..."
 "Hao lianchuan, shut up!"
 The Samsara King berated. His eyes were cold as he looked at Li Hao and said,""Li Hao, tell me everything you've experienced and seen ... In addition, I hope that you can try to enter with the others later!"
 Li Hao frowned and looked at him. After a long while, he said,""It's very dangerous. If I die, I'm afraid you can't bear the responsibility. "
 The Samsara King laughed!
 "You mean Yuan Shuo?"
 Li Hao said calmly,"no, I'm talking about the red moon!" Ask Ziyue, if you kill me, will Ying Hongyue kill you?"
 “……”
 Silence.
 The Samsara King's eyes flickered, and not far away, Zi Yue frowned slightly but did not refute.
 If Li Hao really died here ... In any case, he would be in a lot of trouble.
 It was not from Yuan Shuo. The Samsara King had killed Li Hao, so the red moon organization might not let him off.
 The night patrollers were easy to bully, but the Crimson Moon was not.
 Sometimes, night patrollers had to follow the rules and look at the big picture, but Red Moon didn't need to.  Li Hao said calmly,"if you ask me, I can answer you honestly. But if you want me to take a risk when I'm only above 100 ... That's impossible!" So, you don't need to threaten me. "
 The reincarnation King laughed, and his laughter was filled with hidden meaning. "You're quite smart at such a young age. You actually threatened me with the red moon!"
 Interesting!
 Not Yuan Shuo, not the night patrolman, but Li Hao actually threatened him with the red moon. Was it ridiculous?
 It was laughable!
 However, he, the king of Samsara, had to take on this ridiculous threat.
 "Tell me, what did you see and what happened when you entered the room?"
 " 100 cubic meters of mysterious energy!" Li Hao said.
 "What?"
 He thought he had heard wrong and looked at Li Hao in surprise.
 Li Hao was still persistent and gritted his teeth, 100 cubic meters of mysterious energy! I want the fire element! I'll only tell you if you give it to me ... Big organizations like yours don't lack this little bit of mysterious energy!"
 “……”
 "It's fine if you don't want to tell me ..."The reincarnation King laughed and suddenly said," just send someone to the night patrolmen!"
 Hao lianchuan glanced at him and smiled.""Are you sure?"
 The Samsara King frowned slightly. After a while, he looked at Li Hao."As long as you answer honestly, 100 cubic meters is nothing ... But we don't have any fire-type magic crystals in reserve. Water-type magic crystals will do!"
 Li Hao frowned."Water element ... I need a fire element. Heart fire ape ..."
 He immediately shut up.
 The others, however, perked up their ears.
 He knew that it had something to do with the accumulation of spirit energy. Furthermore, Yuan Shuo's outburst was caused by the heart fire ape. The power of the fire element made one feel that it was somewhat similar to a superpower.
 As expected, Li Hao also needed a fire element super!
 At this moment, everyone had some judgment in their hearts ... After they went out, they had to inform their superiors to store more fire-type mysterious energy.
  When the heart fire ape appeared, everyone had thought that it had a lot to do with the blood God. Now, it seemed that it also needed the mysterious energy of the fire element.
 The more he said this, the more the Samsara King laughed,""I really don't have any fire-type energy reserves. It's the same for Water-type energy reserves. I'll give you 150 cubic meters. You can bring it out and find someone to exchange for it. You can also exchange it for 150 cubic meters of fire-type energy."
 "Of course, if you can't get it ... You can ask Hao lianchuan for it. He's a fire-type super. He can accumulate it for one or two months without using it. It's easy for him to give you 100 cubic meters."
 Li Hao was a little dissatisfied. He glanced at Hao lianchuan, who frowned slightly.
 Li Hao felt that he wouldn't be able to get any more benefits, so he said gloomily,""Give it to me!"
 The next moment, something that looked like a human bone was thrown over.
 Li Hao didn't dare to take it, nor did he take it.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Seeing this, Hao lianchuan cursed in his heart. He didn't say anything and reached out to take it. After examining it, he threw it to Li Hao.
 "It's pitch-black inside," Li Hao said."And it's much bigger than what I can see now!"
 Li Hao recalled,'I can't tell the direction, I feel lost! And ... And while you were walking, it felt like someone was watching you. Not only that, but there was also a feeling, like countless small hands were caressing and touching you!"

 Li Hao hesitated for a moment before he said, in addition, I feel like I'm suffocating! "The suffocating feeling in the darkness feels like something is trying to seal you. I didn't understand it before, but now I guess it's probably sealing the mysterious energy ... It's not a seal ... It just feels like your pores are blocked, and it's very uncomfortable! I'm a Martial Master, so I can't feel it clearly. Perhaps the superpower is more obvious. "
 "Did you encounter an attack?" the reincarnation King suddenly asked.
 "No," Li Hao shook his head.
 "How long did it take you to enter the outer city?"
 "I'm not too sure. It felt like an instant ... I can't calculate the exact time, and it's not easy to calculate, so it's hard to judge the time here. "
 "The three of you went in together? You're not injured?"
 "No, I didn 't!"
 Li Hao shook his head."It's just a little uncomfortable. When I entered the outer city from the house, I felt like I had just dived into the water. I felt like I had just survived a disaster."
 The Samsara King asked a few questions, and Ziyue suddenly said,""After you enter the outer city, do you go through the inner city gate?"
 "The inner city gates?"
  Li Hao shook his head."There's no need. There are many small alleys in these streets. After we entered, we met hei Teng not long after. We know how powerful they are, and the night patrolman also explained the dangers. Hao bu told us to avoid them, so we left through the small alleys."
 "Which alley?"
 "Go in and go to the right ... It's an alley with six houses ... If not six, then seven. After you go out, enter the second Street. There seems to be a teahouse outside ..."
 Zi Yue frowned slightly and said in a deep voice,""Only you martial masters went in. Are there any superpowers?"
 She was thinking, did the superwaves that were triggered on First Street have anything to do with these guys?
 Li Hao shook his head."No, the chances of survival are very low. Besides, you guys saw clearly how many people we sent in. How could you not know if any superpowers disappeared?"
 That was true!
 Among the night patrollers, only these three were missing. There were indeed no superpowers.
 "Is there anything else?"
 "No more!"
 Li Hao shook his head.
 When he shook his head, there was a guilty look in his eyes. He lowered his head, not daring to look her in the eye.
 When this stance was revealed, the expressions of the Samsara King and the others changed slightly.
 This kid must have something else he didn't say.
 The reincarnation King said coldly, Li Hao, a Martial Master must have faith! Since you've taken the reward I've paid you, you can naturally say whatever you want. Although your teacher doesn't get along with us, he's a man of his word. As a Martial Master and the last disciple of the five birds sect, do you dare to swear on your teacher that everything you've said is true, without leaving out anything?"
 Li Hao raised his head, somewhat dissatisfied,"why should I swear?" Was there any use swearing? Besides, my teacher is my teacher. Why should I swear on my teacher's name?"  "Don't you think it's childish?"he asked unhappily. We're all experts, and you still want to make an oath ... What a joke!"
 Was it funny?
 If it's funny, why don't you dare to?
 At this moment, Hong Yitang tried to muddy the waters again. He smiled and said,""Li Hao, don't mind this. This time, we're still working together. We're all working together, and we all hope to enter the inner city! If this goes on, we won't even be able to solve the problem in the outer city. If we can hide the energy waves, it'll be good for the Nightwatchers ... Did you find anything else?"
 Li Hao did not say anything.
 "I can see that you've comprehended the sword force. You're not far from the Qian battle stage. Do you want to continue on the path of a Martial Master or the path of a super?" Hong Yitang continued.
 "Martial Master!"
 "Good news!"
 Hong Yitang nodded and smiled."I think you're not far from the thousand warrior realm. As long as your sword force is strong, you'll be able to reach it sooner or later." I've already given up on martial arts, and I saw that you didn't have a good sword before ... If you don't mind, I'll give you my earth-overturning sword!"
 A sword?
 Li Hao was stunned. Earthcover sword ... This was no ordinary sword!
 This was the sword that made Hong Yitang famous!
 Moreover, as he became a superpower, he had made many changes to the sword. The Earthcover sword was already considered an extraordinary item. Even if it had not reached the level of an original divine weapon, it was still much more powerful than many extraordinary items.
 For me?
