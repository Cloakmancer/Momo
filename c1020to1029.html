        ng was shocked!
         The light sword's expression also changed slightly as it looked at the sky.
         A moment later, Li Hao landed on the ground with a pale face. He had consumed too much energy, but he was still somewhat shocked."F * ck!"
         It was so fast!
         It was so fast that he felt like he was teleporting. He was a little shocked."The Xu family actually doesn't use it, but instead worships it? Wearing this thing consumed a lot of inner strength, but ... It was a good escape tool! I just used it and instantly broke through a thousand meters ... A thousand meters, even if martial uncle Hong were to chase after me, it would take some time, right?"
         The light sword was even more shocked than he was.
         Hong Yitang also touched his chin,"the eight great families" bloodlines are so powerful?" Or is it that the Li family's bloodline can use any weapon?"
         He really wasn 't!
         In fact, Li Hao knew that he didn't use any blood contract at all. He only used the five birds breathing technique. In other words, the five birds breathing technique should be the core of the boots.
         Take the small sword for example. Even now, Li Hao had been using the breathing technique of five birds to extract the sword energy.
          ,m The small sword ... Didn't seem to have recognized its master yet.  That's right, Li Hao still hadn't been able to take the small sword back into his body.
         Therefore, strictly speaking, he was not the owner of the small sword at the moment. He had only been borrowing it, and the core of it was the breathing technique of five birds.
         His teacher had always been using the Zhang family's saber, and he had not done anything like dripping blood on it to recognize it as his master. The core of the technique was also the breathing technique of five birds.
         The light sword was shocked, but it was also excited."Can the dark energy in the boots be extracted?"
         "Well ... If I take it out, if we need to do dual cultivation ..."
         "Cough, cough, cough!"
         At this moment, Li Hao was shocked. He took off his boots and threw them away, his face full of fear.
         An old man is telling me this?
         Of course, he did not forget that one day, his teacher had also performed dual cultivation with him ... That time, he had absorbed too much blood energy, and he had absorbed it with his teacher.
         However, the meaning of the light sword did not seem to be that!
         It was too F * cking terrifying!
         The light sword seemed to have realized something, and its face suddenly twisted. After a moment, it showed a different face and sighed,""Actually, it was just a disguise ..."
         Li Hao gritted his teeth and didn't say anything.
         Yes, he was in disguise.
         But ... So what?
         It was just that he had changed from an old man to a rough aunt. Yes, rough!
         It's hard to say ugly!
         But it was indeed just an auntie's face, and it was a little rough. To put it simply, there was a small beard and it was quite heavy!  His eyebrows were especially thick!
         You ... You're not as pleasing to the eye as that old man just now. At least he looks like a kind old man. Now that I look at him ... My God, Li Hao swears that I'm not judging people by their appearance ... Ahem, a little, but this man is really ... A Little Manly!
         Of course, it didn't matter if the taste was heavy.
         Seeing this, the light sword sighed again.
         Ugly people had no human rights.
         Just look at the Silver Moon Martial Master. Ying Hongyue liked pretty girls, and so did Yuan Shuo. He had been merciful because the Azure light sword looked good.
         They weren't the only ones. Many Silver Moon martial masters were the same.
         They liked good-looking people.
         Or rather, men ... Heh, they were all like this!
         Seeing Li Hao's expression, the Sword of Light felt helpless and sad. It seemed that there was no hope again?
         Li Hao could use the Windchaser's boots, which could be said to be her greatest hope!
         But ... Li Hao's current state was really sad!
         Li Hao was also speechless. Beside him, Hong Yitang coughed lightly."Li Hao, what's with your attitude? No matter what, he's still your senior, so why are you so surprised? When I was young, the light sword was actually very pretty. But later on, the more I cultivated, the more ... Cough cough!"
         When he was young and had just started cultivating, he was actually quite good-looking.
         But to say that it was very good-looking ... Hong Yitang recalled. Cough, cough, it was just like that. He saw quite a lot of them on the streets.
         However, there weren't many female martial masters. If she continued to be like that, she might be called a flower of the martial arts world in the future. After all, there were more men than women in Silver Moon martial arts world.
         Li Hao was embarrassed. He laughed drily and hurriedly said,""I didn't mean it that way ... It's just ..."
         What he wanted to say was, don't even mention dual cultivation, just extracting the energy from it wasn't a must. There were many ways. Wasn't it the same to directly extract the energy with the five birds breathing technique?
          Why are you all considering dual cultivation?
         How filthy!
         The light sword sighed again."Actually, it doesn't matter if I change my appearance. The main thing is that my power of light has reached its limit. If I continue like this, I'm worried that I'll explode! Therefore, the wind-chasing boots became my last hope ..."
         "Then we'll stop cultivating ..." Hong Yitang said in a deep voice.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Then I'd rather die."
         The light sword shook its head. If she didn't want to be like this, she would have stopped cultivating long ago. There was no need for her to become so strong.
         To a Martial Master, they could obviously continue to become stronger, but because they were afraid of danger, they did not dare to continue cultivating ... They might as well die.
         Li Hao thought for a while and suddenly said,""What you want is the dark energy in it, right?"
         "Right!"
         The Sword of Light hurriedly nodded. Li Hao thought for a while and said,"You don't need this energy. I can let you try ... Using an extremely pure dark energy to supplement your body, but ... If you can solve the problem, you have to give me these wind chasing boots!"
        
         The light sword was a little hesitant, not because of the Windchaser's boots, but because it said,""Normal dark energy will explode and be destroyed as soon as it enters my body. I've tried it before, and even sunguang's couldn't do it! "I once killed a late-stage rising light realm fairy expert, but it didn't work ... Of course, if you can solve my problem, you can take the wind chasing boots. But be careful of the Xu family. They won't give up on the wind chasing boots. Even the death of Xu Zhen and his son isn't as important as the wind chasing boots ..."
         If normal dark-type swords couldn't do it, what about those that could be purified?
         The mysterious thing that could be purified was still a little thin.
         What about the ones purified using Dark Divine power stones?
         After the purification of the sword energy and the purity of the dark element, it should be comparable to the energy in the boots, right?
         Li Hao quickly looked through it and soon found a few dark-colored divine power stones. He would know once he tried them.
         He shattered the divine power Stone. This time, he didn't convert it into sword energy. Instead, he purified it with sword energy. It was a waste, but it didn't matter to Li Hao.
         He had extracted a stream of dark energy. He touched the light sword with his finger, and a stream of dark energy gushed into it.
         At this moment, there seemed to be a strong backlash from the other party's body.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, the dark energy was quickly absorbed and dissolved.
          Sword of Light had been very nervous all this time. The next moment, his eyes suddenly brightened, and he couldn't help but look at Li Hao."It ... It seems like it wasn't defeated ..."
         She was a little shocked. This was possible?
         Over the years, she had tried many methods and even seized some dark-type origin divine weapons, but none of them had worked. Li Hao, on the other hand, seemed to have solved the problem with ease.
         At this moment, Hong Yitang's eyes flickered.
         Li Hao's sword was not simple.
         It could release a special energy that could repair the body. Now, it seemed that it could also purify elemental energy. This Li family sword was indeed a divine sword!
         He really wanted to snatch it away!
         Even he was a little tempted at this moment, but he quickly suppressed it. He thought to himself,"everything is illusory. Humans are stronger than weapons, and weapons are just external objects. Besides, just because Li Hao can use them doesn't mean I can."
         The light sword didn't think too much about it and was only excited."Yes ... I really can ... Li Hao, I'll give you the Windchaser's boots. If you have any other requests, you can tell me. I need a large amount of this dark energy ..."
         With the dark energy, she might be able to advance further. This was secondary, it could also alleviate the disadvantage of the power of light becoming stronger and stronger.
         In addition, his appearance might be able to return to how it was before.
         Although she wasn't the most beautiful woman in the world ... As a woman, no one wanted to have a mouth full of beards, no one wanted to have eyebrows that were even rougher than Men 's, and no one even wanted to have an Adam's apple.
         As for his martial arts, he might not be able to reach a higher level, but his five organs and body would be relieved. If he strengthened them, his superpower lock would be stabilized and would not break so easily like before.
         The stronger it was, the harder it was to break the superpower lock.
         However, she and Nan Quan had easily broken five of them.
         Li Hao also heaved a sigh of relief. It was good that it worked. He really couldn't bear to part with that boot ... Unfortunately, he only had one.
         However, even if there was only one, this thing was a life-saving treasure.  They might not care about the earth overturning sword. To them, they might be able to cross a thousand meters in an instant, or they might feel that there was no need to escape.
         But for Li Hao, with these boots ... He would have more confidence.
         And this was only one. What about a pair?
         Hearing the light sword's words, Li Hao was suddenly tempted.""Why don't we go to the Duke dingguo's mansion to take revenge and take the other boot ..."
         The two of them looked at him in shock.
         I'll go!
         Are you crazy?
         The light sword was dumbfounded. 'Is this guy that bold?'
         The radiant sword hurriedly said,"no!" "There were many powerhouses in the other party's residence. I was able to succeed back then only because Xu Qing thought I would die for sure. It was no big deal even if I took it away. His strength was unparalleled. Even without unsealing his seal, he was able to block my attack and was only slightly injured ... His strength might be comparable to the Earthfall sword or even stronger. The high Duke's public house has also gained many benefits over the years."
         "Furthermore, there are still three great generals alive in the residence. The heaven and earth generals are probably both in the transformation stage, while general Huang is at least at the peak ... In addition, there are also many powerhouses in the dingguo Army. He has also recruited a group of sinecures and foreign officials, all of whom are powerhouses!"
         Her success was due to luck. In addition, the other party thought that she was dead for sure and was unwilling to pay a greater price.
         However, if they were to snatch it again ... The high Duke's public house would have to risk their lives!
         Li Hao felt very regretful. He really wanted to snatch it!
         If a single boot could cross a thousand meters in an instant, then wouldn't a pair be able to cross two thousand, or even three thousand meters?
         At this stage, the strong were strong, but there were not many who could fly so far in an instant.
         Hong Yitang was also a little speechless.""Don't look down on these families. They have 200 years of history and don't use your long-lost Li family as an excuse. They were able to stand strong for 200 years and remain as overlords even after the rise of supers. "The East is almost the Xu family's world. The three major organizations all rely on their support ..."
          "If you really want to snatch the remaining shoe, you'll have to wait!"
         As for when?
         Hong Yitang felt that it would not take too long. Given the current situation, Silver Moon might very soon have a conflict with the various parties.
         "Let's go. Don't stay here for too long. Be careful, they might throw us dozens of city-destroying bombs. It's still very dangerous ... As for the dark energy, let's find a place and slowly deal with it!"
         Hong Yitang didn't plan to stay any longer. It was true that one was bold because of his skills, but there was no need to seek death. If the other party really threw dozens of city-destroying bombs at him, and they were as powerful as the ones fan Chang threw out earlier ... He wouldn't be able to withstand them.
         If it was just one, then forget it, but dozens of them ... He would still be blown to death.
         He wasn't too sure about the power of the city-destroying bomb, but it was definitely not weak.
         Even though the light sword desperately needed this energy, at this moment, they could only act according to the situation. The group of three, along with the Black Panther, quickly retreated and disappeared into the North Sea.
         It wasn't until they had left for a long time that someone cautiously went to investigate. When they found that everyone had left, everyone heaved a sigh of relief. At this moment, the North Sea didn't want these Devils to stay here.
         It was chaotic outside. If it was chaotic at home, the North Sea would be in complete chaos.
        
         Not long after Li Hao's group left, a piece of news shook the entire dynasty.
         This news was very secretive, but it quickly spread.
         The news did not spread from anywhere else, but from the red moon.
         Perhaps Li Hao's change had stimulated some people.
         Perhaps the Silver Moon Martial master's strength had embarrassed a certain someone, especially after he had taught Black Widow a lesson.
         p Not long after Li Hao's group left, the news spread that the Li family's divine sword had the ability to suppress and seal. In simple terms, if one's five internal organs were in danger of being broken, they could be suppressed or even strengthened by the Li family's divine sword.  It was only because of Li Hao that they dared to unseal their battle strength without any restraint.
         Yuan Shuo's broken heart could be recovered because of Li Hao.
         That was not all. When hou Xiaochen had gone to battle, Silver Moon had become restless recently. All of this was because of Li Hao. Because of Li Hao and the Li family's divine sword, these people had no fear!
         No matter how strong the sealed Silver Moon Warriors were, they were only comparable to a group of Metamorphoses.
          The weaker ones had not even reached the transformation stage.
         And because of Li Hao, these people would all become top-tier powerhouses who would surpass Xuguang!
         If Li Hao didn't die, the Li family's divine sword wouldn't be taken away, and silver Moon ... Couldn't be defeated or provoked!
         ……
         This piece of news quickly spread.
         The nine divisions, the three great organizations, the seven sacred mountains, and the families all received the message from the red moon. The message was telling everyone about the use of the Li family's divine sword.
         It was useful to martial masters, but it was even more useful to supers!
         Why were there no superpowers above sunrise?
         Or rather, even if they did, they didn't dare to appear, didn't dare to show their faces, and didn't even dare to make a move?
         That was because their internal organs were not strong.
         To reach beyond sunrise, one would need to unlock the sixth superpower lock. Other than the four limbs and the one unlocked by the user, the sixth lock could only be unlocked by the second of the five organs.
         That would cause the five internal organs to clash and even explode!
         Other than those who had opened up a new path, such as the powerhouses who had broken the skull's Super Lock, the rest of them had to break the second Super Lock on their five internal organs.
         Everyone had to go through this!
         Therefore, the intelligence also said that the Li family's divine sword might be able to solve the biggest problem of the current superpowers.
         It was not an unverified guess!
         Next, he only needed to see if the light sword was still alive and whether the earth overturning sword was injured.
         It was something that could be easily verified!
         The light sword had broken five superpower locks. If she could survive ... Li Hao's appearance would prove nothing.
          It could prove everything! This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com This meant that the entire Silver Moon would become a dangerous place. Some Silver Moon martial masters would become even more unbridled and unseal their powers at will. They would surpass sunguang and kill a large number of supers!
         This news shocked the entire upper echelons of the dynasty.
         ……
         At this moment, Li Hao and the others had not received such a message.
         The news had already caused a huge commotion.
         Central region.
         Hou Xiaochen had just taken over the position of the Heavenly Star military governor, and he was suddenly given this kind of information. At this moment, he was completely stunned. He looked in a certain direction for a long time before letting out a breath,"Ying Hongyue!"
         The only person who understood the Silver Moon Martial Master the most was him!
         The fortresses were all broken from the inside.
         Outsiders didn't know the specific situation of martial masters, nor did they know if there was anything special about Martial Master Silvermoon. They didn't know anything else, but Ying Hongyue was very clear about it. Not only that, but he had also been working hard on the matter of the eight great families "bloodlines.
         When Ying Hongyue disclosed this information to the public ... As long as they carefully verified it, they could still come to a conclusion.
         Even though there were some speculations and even framing.
         But ... Just like how hou Xiaochen had framed Ying Hongyue, Li Hao had now become a thorn in the side of all non-Silvermoon martial masters. He was a must-kill target. If they wanted to take down Silvermoon, they had to first take down Li Hao!
         Even if he had to pay a huge price!
         It was not just to take down Li Hao, but also the Li family's divine sword. This was a treasured sword that could help them break through barriers, repair their internal organs, and suppress the rebellion of their internal organs!
         Hou Xiaochen took a deep breath. This time, it was different from before.
         "Li Hao ... You're too ostentatious ..."
         It shouldn't have happened this time.
          He guessed that it was Kong Jie and the others who asked Li Hao to go.
         However, they probably did not expect that Li Hao would appear in front of so many people and Save the Light sword. He even brought the Earthcover sword with him. They had originally thought that they would secretly Save the Light sword and even let it go dormant for a while.
         But now ... It would be difficult.
         This was no longer a matter of a treasure, but a matter of advancement in the entire supernatural realm. It was a matter of future dominance. In an instant, Li Hao became a hot commodity in the eyes of the world.
         Kill Li Hao and conquer the world!
         Although this slogan had not been shouted out, everyone probably had the same thought in their hearts.
         "Ying Hongyue ... Can really ..."
         Hou Xiaochen looked into the distance, then towards the North, and his expression became serious.
         He believed that on this day, the entire star dynasty would not be peaceful. Everyone would quickly find out the truth!
         Although the people in the ruins had all been killed, some people had come out alive, such as Qi gang, Hu Qingfeng, the star Army, and Nanquan ...
        
         These people might not leak the news, but they would definitely say something. After piecing it together, perhaps someone would be able to find out the truth about the ruins.
         In addition to the situation with the light sword and the earth overturning sword, everyone would soon be able to verify that the information Hong Yue had was mostly conjectures, but it was extremely reasonable. Moreover, the other party was one of the people who understood the eight great families the most, so they would not reveal this false information for no reason.
         Ying Hongyue's thoughts were very obvious.
         Just like hou Xiaochen, this is an open scheme ... Are you tempted?
         Do you want to take the sword?
         Are you guys trying to suppress Silver Moon?
         If he wanted to, he would go find Li Hao, kill Li Hao, and take the sword!
         As for whether or not he could use it after snatching it, how would he know if he didn't try?
         Even if it could not be used, it would be better to hide it than to let Silver moon's men use it. If they were to unseal it without any restraint, it would be a great disaster!
         ……
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Red Moon headquarters.
         In the palace.
         Ying Hongyue was reading a book and drinking tea. She was extremely relaxed and had a smile on her face.
         All of you don't take me seriously, right?
         "Now that the northern fist is out, they're going to bully my people too. They're Silver moon's people, and they've killed my concubines without mercy. No matter what, they're all Silver Moon martial masters, people on the same ranking.
         Was he that ruthless?
         Since that was the case ... Then he would just play with it!
         Ying Hongyue didn't want to say it at first, or rather, she didn't guess anything at first. After she calculated the light sword's whereabouts, she headed straight for the Silver Moon, as well as some information that Li Hao revealed when he had nothing to do. The light sword was bullying the weak ...
         After some analysis, he had guessed some key points. Clearly, Li Hao had done the same in the relic.
         Perhaps it was to suppress hou Xiaochen, or perhaps it was to use the earth overturning sword ...
         However, the light sword must have seen it, which was why it ignored everything and forced Li Hao to agree to this condition. Otherwise, the light sword wouldn't have sought death by doing so, nor would it have forced Li Hao to do so for no reason.
         Ying Hongyue was able to roughly guess the use of the Li family's divine sword after she put her thoughts together.
         He wasn't sure about the details, but he believed that it was close to the mark, and that was enough.  Just like before, no one knew what the blood God's effects were, but after hou Xiaochen spread the news, everyone was willing to try ... This proved that in this era, people with power could do anything they wanted!
         Superpowers didn't necessarily know about the unsealing of the seal. Even if they did, they wouldn't know much about the Martial master's situation. However, Ying Hongyue knew. Therefore, when he gave the news, it proved that even if this news was verified, it would only reveal the truth!
         Just as he was drinking his tea leisurely, a masked expert quickly entered.""Leader, flying heavens, Yama, and many other organizations or individuals wish to communicate with you ... Do you want to accept the communication?"
         Ying Hongyue smiled!
         Are you impatient?
         That's right, the Li family's sword could not only solve the problem of martial masters. Martial masters could still suppress and unseal, but to superpowers, this was a matter of life and death!
         Some people had actually broken through to the realm above sunrise, but now, all of them were cowering. This was because they did not dare to move. If they did, they might die.
         Some people were stuck in the metamorphosis stage and did not dare to break the superpower lock. However, powerful forces would break it automatically. Once it was broken, it meant that they had advanced. After advancing ... There was a 90% chance of death. Those who survived were in the same situation as the old guys. They were hiding and did not dare to show themselves.
         It could be used as a one-time use weapon, but once it was used for a long time, it would quickly destroy the five internal organs!
         Therefore, everyone was anxious.
         Ying Hongyue laughed, looking exceptionally handsome.
         "Connect, of course we have to connect ... We'll connect together. I'm too lazy to communicate with them one by one. Tell them not to talk if they don't like it. Just hide it and listen to me quietly!"
          "Yes!"
         The masked man didn't say much and quickly started to prepare. A moment later, a huge screen appeared in front of Ying Hongyue. Square boxes appeared one after another, revealing the figures of people.
         Some people directly revealed their true forms, while some people hid their heads and revealed their tails.
         No one spoke.
         Gradually, there were more and more people, and the big screen was filled with square frames.
         Ying Hongyue was drinking tea in a leisurely manner.
         When all the boxes lit up and there were no more new members, he opened his mouth and smiled.""Don't ask me if it's true or not, just judge it yourself! It's impossible for a big man like the light sword to not show up. Besides, you should have received the news that they stayed in the North Sea for a day and a night ... Are two grown men playing a game with the light sword, that ugly old woman?"
         "Even if the light sword is hidden now, everyone will know if the situation is real or not ..."
         "Also, what you're most concerned about is whether you can use the Li family's divine sword without its bloodline, right?" Ying Hongyue continued.
         On the screen, someone said,"that's right, that's what we're most concerned about!" I don't care if the Silver Moon is powerful or unbridled. I only care if he can really suppress the five internal organs rebellion. Repair the five internal organs? "Now, some people have found other ways. They're either using the spring of life to maintain their life force, or using the Scion of the blood God, like you, to strengthen their five internal organs, or other treasures ... But they're all treating the symptoms but not the root cause! We can't keep using it like this, and we can't use it to destroy the second and third internal organs. We still have a long way to go, and if the Li family's divine sword can help us completely suppress any future problems ... That would be for the best!"
        
         Ying Hongyue looked at this person and smiled."Brother Yama is still the most direct. You're not like the flying sword. You hide your head and show your tail all day long!"
         No one responded to him.
         He did not care and chuckled,"without the Li family bloodline ... It's not a big problem!" I know of a few other ways to use the Li family divine sword. It's not that there are no restrictions ... But there are ways to break through the restrictions!"
         "What method?"
         In the image, the imposing Yama asked directly.
         "You don't know?"
         Ying Hongyue looked at him. The Yama pondered for a moment before he spoke,"Collect Li Hao's blood and replace it? Or, he could refine Li Hao and completely unseal the Li family's divine sword. Then, the divine sword would be able to be used smoothly. Or, you can directly suppress the Li family's divine sword. Once the owner of the divine sword dies, you can also subdue it under the suppression. "
         "You see, don't you know a lot of methods?"
         Ying Hongyue smiled and said,"then why are you asking me?" Do you want me to teach you step by step?"
          "Any more questions?" he looked at the crowd and asked with a smile.
         A slightly sharp voice came from the screen,""Li Hao now has the earth overturning sword and the radiant sword. How powerful are they after unsealing them? What kind of state was the Silver Moon Martial Master in? What kind of realm can you fight against if you become a superpower?"
         Ying Hongyue pondered for a while and said with a smile,"it's really hard to judge. Everyone's situation is different ... However, on the Martial Master side, no one has actually reached the next level, which is above the sunguang stage." No one has yet to give a name to the realm above sunrise, but I know that some old fellows and sinister villains have actually broken through ... They just don't dare to reveal it now ... It's alright, I've judged that their overall strength should be equal!"
         "For example, the light sword killed five generals in one move. I think some people who have broken the sixth superpower lock can do the same. "Actually, everyone's the same. They can't last long. You guys can't last long after breaking the sixth lock either ... You're all in high demand ..."
         As he said that, he laughed. His laughter was a little unscrupulous and a little playful."As long as we take down Li Hao, or hold him back, or hold him back ... They won't be able to recover. The power of light in the light sword can still be restored ... But as long as you bring the spring of life, can't you do the same?"
         "The light sword managed to delay her for 12 hours without dying, but she almost completely collapsed ... This is her limit! The others will be a little worse off and will be able to unleash their full power faster!"
         On the screen, another person said coldly,""Brother Red Moon, it's said that the blood God also has a similar effect. We're all willing to let you deal with Li Hao and silver Moon, but I wonder if brother Red Moon can lend us a hand? not everyone has the spring of life. Can you lend us some Blood God?"
         "Flying sword, why is your mouth so cheap?"
         Ying Hongyue smiled."I'm asking you to help me out with some women. Your wife and your daughter. Give them to me ..."  "Sure!"
         "If you're willing to take out a large number of blood deities, what's wrong with giving them to you?" the flying sword immortal was extremely indifferent.
         Ying Hongyue laughed out loud,"as expected of the number one assassin in the dynasty!" Cold-blooded enough, I like it! However ... I don't have enough clones of the blood God for myself. If you're brave enough, you can come and ask me for some. I'll give you some. Do you want to come?"
         Flying sword immortal was silent.
         If it was in the past, he might not be afraid.
         However, now that they knew the effects of the blood deity, many people were actually guessing to what extent Ying Hongyue's five internal organs had been cultivated to.
         Was he a superhuman or a Martial Master?
         However, no matter which one it was, be it a super or a Martial Master, this person could have already broken through the limit and become an invincible master who could use all his strength.
          Everyone was very afraid of such an existence and was unwilling to completely fall out with him. Otherwise, the matter of the blood God would have already been completely exposed.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Ying Hongyue laughed for a while and said,"it's too difficult to raise a Blood God. The high-level ones are even more difficult. I know that everyone is tempted, but compared to the Li family's divine sword, the blood God is trash. After so many years, I haven't been able to raise many of them. I've eaten all of them, and the remaining weak ones are useless to you. However, I don't think the Li family's divine sword will take too long, and it won't cost too much ... According to my speculation, it can be done by paying some divine power stones. "
         "Everyone can see how much capital Li Hao has. He's only risen to power a few days ago, so what Foundation can he have? When Yuan Shuo recovered from his injuries, he might have started to use the Li family's divine sword. This meant that the price he paid back then was not big at all! If everyone gets it, the effect will be beyond expectations!"
         Another person said in a deep voice,"Hongyue has been trying to seize the Li family's divine sword. Did she know about this long ago?" Or is there another reason?"
         "What does it have to do with you?" Ying Hongyue said bluntly. Was this the main point of the day? Who Do You Think You Are, you ask me and I'll answer? I'm telling you, I'm using you guys to deal with Li Hao and silver Moon. Do you really think I'm your father? do you think I'll tell you anything you ask?"
         “……”
         After a moment of silence, the person who asked the question suddenly became furious!
         Those who could contact Ying Hongyue directly were no ordinary people. They were all overlords and leaders of their respective regions.
         He was humiliated in front of everyone. This person was furious and was about to speak when Ying Hongyue laughed playfully."Alright, I was just joking, don't be angry! If I'm angry ... You can't bite me to death. It's not appropriate for you to be angry! Did he have to make a strong enemy for himself to be happy? Be good and don't make a scene. Besides, everyone is watching, so be a little bit more organized!"
        
         In an instant, the man quieted down and suppressed the anger in his heart. He knew that if he spoke again at this moment ... It would be F * cking embarrassing!
         It was better to be silent!
         "Alright, that's all for now. Right, keep a close eye on those guys. Northern fist, BA Dao, and the others have all come out. That Tian Jian guy hasn't said a word, so we have to be careful. And hou Xiaochen ... Don't mess things up. It won't look good!"
         After saying this, he smiled and raised his teacup.""To deal with Silver Moon, for a higher future ... Let's drink together. After we're done drinking, we'll go kill Li Hao together. Remember, this kind of person is hard to kill, so don't be reluctant. Take all the one-time combat power with you ... At worst, you'll die, but if you win, you'll be rich for the rest of your life! I believe everyone has someone who broke the sixth SuperLock ... By the way, should we name the sixth stage since there are so many people here today?"
         He chuckled and said,"back then, when suguang took the meaning of nine days, I already found it unpleasant." Why don't you pick a better one for the next realm? This was a huge transformation. Why not call it ... The absolute peak? He will stand at the top, the meaning of the peak ..."
         The Yama said coldly,"enough. Do you think we haven't read those ancient books?" There was no point in pursuing the footsteps of the ancient people! Ying Hongyue, think about it. You can call him that. When this level officially appears and there are more people, there will naturally be names. You don't need to worry about it!"
         "You ... You were the one who suggested it at Xuguang ... You're really bad!"
         Ying Hongyue joked and said with a smile,"that's it then. We'll talk about this later. If you capture Li Hao or seize the Li family's divine sword ... Remember to let me know."
         No one paid any attention to him. Soon, the screens dimmed one by one.
          Ying Hongyue's smile disappeared as all the screens dimmed. She sighed,"The people are in a terrible situation. I've really committed a sin. I've caused some trouble for Silver Moon again. I wonder if I'll lose a few of my old friends ... What a pity!"
         Although he said it was a pity, he once again revealed a bright smile.
         "Where's Blue Moon?"
         He asked after he finished.
         Qingyue was the only person left in the huge base. She didn't see anyone this time.
         "Lady qingyue has gone to stellarsky city ..." Someone quickly reported.
         "Nonsense!"
         Ying Hongyue furrowed her brows slightly before quickly relaxing them."Forget it, let her be. These people are wild and don't listen to what they say. Be careful not to suffer!"
         Then, he smiled and said,"forget about her. The elder Council, inform the first elder, second elder! And third elder to go out together! Each of them is allowed to bring a drop of the spring of life! In addition, each of them will be rewarded with a peak sunrise Blood God!" Don't be in a hurry to do anything, just observe for a while. If the earth overturning sword and the light sword are both entangled by someone ... We can also be the fisherman!"
         "Yes!"
         Someone quickly went to report.
         There were many experts in the elder Council, including tsunami and red-haired, but they didn't rank very high. However, Ying Hongyue had directly sent out the top three elders.  "Also, inform the ancient divine guards to dig three feet deep and find that Groundhog, Yuan Shuo! That old man probably went to dig up graves again!"
         Ying Hongyue furrowed her brows."This old thing has been studying grave digging for the past few decades. Be careful that he doesn't dig up any treasures. This guy grows up very quickly ... Even if he doesn't dig up any treasures, he can dig up a few big ones ... By then, it'll be enough for everyone to suffer!"
         Then, he shook his head and sighed."The ignorant are fearless. Or rather, this guy doesn't care. If we really dig out one or two living existences of the ancient civilization ... Hehe, we'll all be doomed!"
         That guy would not care about this.
         However, Ying Hongyue had to take care of it. Even if they wanted to dig them out, they couldn't do it now. If they dug them out now, it was very easy for a huge change to occur. It would be fine if they dug out someone who was easy to talk to, but if they dug out someone who had a bad temper and a fierce personality ... It wouldn't be fun if they were to start a massacre.
         "Yes!"
         Below, more ghostly faces left.
         There were a large number of ghostly faces here all year round. They were in charge of communicating with all parties at any time.
         "Right, make the three northern provinces even more chaotic. Silver Moon is currently very stable, but Huang Yu and the others are too idle ... Give them something to do! The royal family hasn't made any moves, and I don't believe they're not worried. They might lose the Li family's divine sword, and their Heavenly Star ruins won't stand a chance anymore ... Oh, I forgot to mention that Li Hao's divine sword can open the Heavenly Star ruins ... Hahaha, spread the news around and let the royal family have a good time!"
         "Leader, it's not a good time to fall out with the royal family now," a ghostly face said."If the news is leaked, the royal family might deal us a heavy blow!"
          Ying Hongyue pondered for a moment, smiled, and nodded. "That's true! Just this information is enough for everyone to contribute. "
         He quickly turned around and left.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He was still as carefree as ever, not the slightest bit disturbed by Silver moon's troubles.
         Li Hao and the others had improved very quickly ... But what could they do?
         ……
         Silver Moon.
         At the administration Bureau.
         The group of people were silent at this moment.
         Kong Jie was slightly irritated and asked,"can you hide the light sword?" "I should have expected this ... Hou Xiaochen wasn't here, so I forgot about this. Director Zhao, didn't you think about this as well? Now that some of the uses of the Li family's divine sword have been exposed ... Trouble is coming for us!"
        
         He had not thought of this before.
         In his eyes, not many people would consider this point. He had always felt that superpowers didn't understand martial masters at all, but he had subconsciously ignored some things. Some people understood martial masters too well!
         Director Zhao let out a sigh of relief."I've thought about it, but we still have to save him. Also, I think that even if Ying Hongyue and the others know about it, they'll keep it to themselves because they'll want to take it for themselves. It wouldn't be good if too many people knew about it ... I didn't expect him to make it public ..."
         "You didn't expect that?"
         Kong Jie was a little troubled,"how could I not have thought of it?" Don't we all know what kind of person he is? It's not the first time he's done something that harms others without benefiting himself ..."
         "Enough," Huang Yu interrupted,"there's no point in saying all this now!"
         "We were in a hurry to save them," he said in a deep voice."This is the best way. Let Li Hao go and save them."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Kong Jie was a little angry,"but now, Li Hao will be in big trouble!" I was the one who negotiated with him and asked him to save her. The two of you, I suspect that you've even included me in your scheme! This matter is perhaps within your expectations! Did you two bastards set me up on purpose after hou Xiaochen left?"
         “……”
          The two of them remained silent and ignored him.
         Kong Jie snorted coldly,"most likely!" Just say it, what do you want to do? Force Li Hao to leave Silver Moon? Or are you trying to get Li Hao to draw everyone's attention and do something for you? It seems that the agreement of the four sides is invalid, and I am excluded by you, right?"
         He never thought too much about it, because over the past few years, he and hou Xiaochen had been on the same side. Hou Xiaochen had a lot of ideas, so most of the time, he just listened to hou Xiaochen.
         But now that hou Xiaochen had left, the two of them had probably come to some sort of agreement and abandoned him.
         Director Zhao frowned,"I didn't mean it that way. First, it was indeed unexpected! Second, it was indeed an urgent matter! Third, the uncertain danger was greater than the fall of the light sword. Moreover, Li Hao had taken the fee himself, so he should consider the risks, not for the sake of carrying out a mission! "Fourth, as long as he is on the first day of the Silver Moon, we will still protect him. If this matter is blown up, it will also be trouble for us ... Thus, no one wants to deliberately cause trouble. The last point was that this matter was related to Li Hao's flamboyance. If he had waited in the dark instead of charging out ... He could have avoided these troubles! To be honest, it was out of our expectations that he would kill his way out. In our minds, he has always been a person who plans first before taking action. He wouldn't make a move if he wasn't completely confident. Moreover, he has a grudge against the light sword. Do you think we would think that he would kill his way out to save people?"
         "But if that's the case, the light sword will fall ..."
         Kong Jie wanted to continue, but director Zhao shook his head,""As I said, I'm only doing my best and leaving it up to fate to let Li Hao go this time ... But I have to say, his choice was beyond my expectations. Now that we've caused such trouble, it's indeed related to our negligence. "
         After a moment of silence, he said,""I can understand that you feel bad, but don't get too emotional. We're talking about how to deal with it, not just venting."  "Then what do you suggest we do?"
         Kong Jie calmed down and looked at him."You have too many thoughts. What do you think we should do?"
         Director Zhao rubbed his temples and said,""First, kill the chicken to warn the monkeys. Let the Silver Moon expert go out and kill some people! Second, throw out the Li family divine sword and let them fight each other! Third, let Li Hao say that the eight divine weapons all had the same effect, and let Ying Hongyue try to confuse him ... But no one would believe him. Fourth, make Li Hao disappear and hide for a while ... This way, it would be safer. Fifth, find someone to impersonate Li Hao and go to the central region to cause some chaos and attract people there!"
         He told them some plans.
         Kong Jie thought for a while and cursed in her heart. After a while, she said,""I'll try to contact Li Hao ... Also, give me a communication Jade. I'll give it to Li Hao and ask him to share some information with me, so that he won't be ignorant!"
         Huang Yu and director Zhao looked at each other and nodded.
          At this moment, he should give one to Li Hao, or Li Hao's Information Network would be too limited.
         No one knew where Li Hao was hiding right now, so he might not even know about this news.
         Kong Jie took the messenger jade pendant and quickly left.
         After he left, director Zhao sighed,""Tell me, is this an accident or an inevitable?"
         "I don't know!" Huang Yu replied calmly. If he had kept hiding and waited until the last chance to appear ... There would naturally not have been so much trouble. However, if that had happened, both of us would have underestimated him. You and I may think that Li Hao is not bad, but he has indeed brought a lot of trouble to both him and us!"
         It was on purpose, but the two of them didn't do it on purpose.
         However, they had indeed made some predictions, but they didn't expect that Li Hao would really kill his way out. This was actually beyond their expectations. At this moment, they didn't know whether to be happy or sad.
         Director Zhao sighed,"forget it, I'll deal with whatever comes my way." Li Hao is willing to go out and save people ... Which means that he's changing. Since that's the case, we can't let him be disappointed. You go and keep an eye on him in case he can't handle it. "
         "If I go ... The Whitemoon city ..."
        
         "And the military," Huang Yu said, frowning."The others aren't too reliable either."
         "Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on him. "
         He then added,"take the spring of life in the storage. Li Hao is a very carefree person. He might not be willing to save you if he thinks too much. Save yourself!"
         Huang Yu was speechless.
         Without saying anything more, he turned around and left. He had always been in the military and was relatively isolated. If he left, he could avoid being discovered to the greatest extent.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com After everyone left, director Zhao leaned back in his chair and fell into deep thought.
         "Ying Hongyue ..." He said softly after a long time.
         This guy had really done too many things that harmed others without benefiting himself, so why bother?
         'Yuan Shuo, Oh Yuan Shuo, who asked you to stir up trouble all day and not clean up the mess. Now, you've left behind a lot of trouble.'
         You've been living a carefree life, but I'm afraid you've gone to dig graves again.
          ……
         The situation outside was turbulent, and countless people were madly worried about Li Hao.
         On Li Hao's side, the three of them didn't know anything about information. As for communication jades, they had some, but they didn't disclose this information to the public. It was only for some experts.
         Li Hao and the others didn't receive any news. In fact, Li Hao had already thrown away his communication Jade in case he was located.
         At this moment, none of them were thinking about this.
         Even Hong Yitang didn't think about this.
         Even he was thinking that it didn't have much to do with it. Not many people knew about it. He wouldn't tell anyone about the southern style, and non-martial masters didn't know much about the Martial Master System. Even if someone who had cultivated to this level knew about it, he wouldn't tell anyone.
         ? The light sword was focused on the dark energy, so it would not think about all this.
         As for Li Hao himself, he sometimes thought about it ... But as more and more people knew about it, he didn't care too much. Sometimes, he even wanted to go crazy and experience what it felt like to be The Enemy of the World.
         This was the disadvantage of reading too much.
         Whenever he saw the biographies of heroes, he liked to put himself in their shoes, give it a try, and go crazy. After reading the records of "battle of Nanjiang," Li Hao's heart was somewhat free.
         Otherwise, according to his previous personality, he would never have rashly made a move. Even if the overbearing sword had made a move, he would not have made a move if he was not confident that he could kill everyone.
         Therefore, even if Li Hao knew, he wouldn't care.
         Perhaps, he would even sigh and say,"it's great that I have such a day!"
         However, no one knew about this. Even Hong Yitang didn't know that Li Hao's heart was in turmoil, unwilling to be lonely and calm.
         At this moment, Li Hao and the others were hiding in a small city that no one knew about.
         Li Hao was checking his spoils of war and injecting some dark energy into the light sword. Of course, he didn't forget Hong Yitang and told him how many divine power stones he could exchange for sword energy ... Li Hao knew that Hong Yitang had taken a storage ring for a metamorphosis stage super and was trying to empty it out.
         Those in the metamorphosis stage were the strongest group of people in the world today, so they must have a lot of treasures.
         Li Hao didn't want to ask for more. He only wanted to charge half of the administration fee. Ordinary people wouldn't be able to enjoy such treatment.
          Hong Yitang was also extremely speechless!  However, after some thought, he still agreed. It couldn't be helped. Li Hao's business was unique. Sword energy could strengthen and stabilize one's five internal organs. Everyone wanted their five internal organs to become stronger. Today, martial masters and superpowers were facing such a predicament.
         Moreover, he still had a great divine stone left. In addition to the money he had paid back with the light sword, he now had some capital. He could be extravagant for once and have a good time.
         Seeing this, the light sword couldn't wait to take out its old capital. The two of them had been sucked dry by Li Hao, the vampire.
         Except for the swords he carried with him, he wished he could sell the rest to Li Hao in exchange for some sword energy.
         Li Hao spent the turbulent times outside in this kind of pain and happiness.
         When the two powerhouses had been completely emptied of their wallets by him, Li Hao stopped the supply of sword energy.
         Hong Yitang felt lost!
         It was so comfortable!
         Unfortunately, he had sold his last piece of rock to Li Hao in exchange for a sword energy ... At this moment, he really didn't have a single cent.
         Actually, there were still some other treasures, such as the heavenly Golden Lotus seed. He still had one left, but after some thought, he decided not to sell it. He would keep it as a last resort. He couldn't possibly have no treasures in his storage ring, right? that would be too embarrassing.
         If he was killed one day or his storage ring was taken away, he would be cursed to death and laughed to death!
         A top-notch Martial Master capable of killing a being in the metamorphosis stage, yet ... His storage ring was empty!
         As for the light sword, it also sighed and felt a little sad. It had absorbed a lot of dark energy, lost a lot of its mustache, and even its Adam's apple had disappeared a little, but ... It was still not enough!
         She still wanted more, but Li Hao refused to give it to her. She had exchanged so many wind-chasing boots for Li Hao. She had no choice, mainly because Li Hao's divine energy stones were almost exhausted.
         Of course, the result was that his body was strengthened greatly. His five internal organs and the superpower lock were strengthened as well. For the first time, he felt that the superpower lock in his heart was about to be saturated!
         This time, the amount he absorbed might have reached the level of 100000 cubic meters.
         Even Li Hao had a toothache. There were too many.
         In terms of divine power stones, it didn't seem like much. 100 divine power stones could be exchanged for 100000 cubic meters of mysterious energy. However, what Li Hao absorbed was different. What he absorbed was the essence, which was not the same.
          Moreover, there would be a lot of waste in the process.
         It wasn't until the middle of October that Li Hao's group of three finally left their hiding place and began to approach white moon City.
         Not long after he approached white moon City, a message appeared in Li Hao's armor. Soldier Kong Jie, 300 calls ...
         Li Hao was startled. Is she crazy?
         It's only been a few days, and you call me every hour, right?
         He was even considering whether he should block Kong Jie. This fellow never had any good news every time she called him!
         A moment later, before he could call back, Kong Jie's communication notification came again.
         At this moment, Kong Jie was also overjoyed!
         “艹!”
         He finally got through. That bastard Li Hao was a thousand miles away from white moon City. He didn't know where he had been for the past few days. If he still didn't show up, he would have suspected that Li Hao had been assassinated or killed by Hong Yitang and the others. Li Hao might have fled after taking the treasure!
        
         In communication.
         Kong Jie quickly explained what had happened.
         Li Hao just listened in silence.
         In the end, Kong Jie said,"return to the White moon City quickly. Don't leave for the time being. The White moon City is still safe for now. No matter how bold those guys are, they won't dare to come to the White moon City to die."
         "Oh, I know!"
         Li Hao didn't say anything, and his expression was calm.
         After hanging up the communication, Li Hao looked at the two men.""I'm going back to the White moon City. Are the two of you going to leave now, or are you going to the White moon City as well?"
         "I'll go with you!"Said Sword of Light immediately.
         Although she had suppressed some of her power of light, it was still not enough. Thus, she had to continue following Li Hao.
         "As you wish."
          Li Hao didn't say much. He had to return to Whitemoon city first to collect the reward money from the previous mission. He would take it with him and go to the ruins to find the little tree. He had promised him a lot of benefits.
         Furthermore, the members of the demon hunt squads were all there.
         However, he didn't need to bring the two of them to the ruins to avoid any trouble.
         ,m As for what Kong Jie said, he didn't mention it.  Although these two people were not well-informed, they should know soon enough. It didn't matter if he mentioned it or not.
         Moreover, the news had only been out for two days. Everyone knew how powerful di Fujian and the others were. If they were not fully prepared, these people would not act rashly.
         "Ying Hongyue."
         Li Hao muttered in his heart, it's you again.
         This guy, was he afraid that she would be too quiet and cause trouble for herself?
         However, Li Hao was no longer the Li Hao of the past. The current Li Hao had seen much, was powerful, and had enough confidence. Ying Hongyue's little tricks couldn't scare him!
         ……
         They were less than a thousand miles away from the White moon City. The three people and one dog were all very powerful, and their speed was also extremely fast.
         Li Hao took out his divine boat and took them on the flight.
         In less than three hours, they landed near the White moon City.
         When they arrived at the White moon City, Hong Yitang didn't seem to want to go in. He said,""Since you're here, I'll go back first ..."
         "Don't you want to see Hong Qing?"
         Although Hong Qing was still in the remains, Li Hao would still bring him back later.
         This man didn't even want to look at his daughter?
         "You just have to take care of her."
         "I might not have the time to take care of them after this ..."
         "Of course!" Li Hao laughed."I'll make the appropriate arrangements. Don't worry!"
         Hong Yitang glanced at him and didn't say anything. No one knew what he was thinking.
         "By the way, martial uncle Hong, I heard you want to build a city?"
         "Not building a city ..."
          Hong Yitang wanted to deny it, but he thought for a while and said,""I just want to expand swords gate a little."  "Yeah, it's pretty good."
         The two of them chatted for a while. A moment later, Kong Jie, who had received the news, flew out. Seeing the people from Sword of Light, she nodded slightly. Then, she looked at Li Hao and said with a frown, "You're finally back. If you hadn't come back, I would've thought that you were assassinated ..."
         Li Hao laughed and said directly,""I won't die so easily. Director Kong, I brought back the light sword, where's the thing?"
         "What?"
         "I've just received the deposit for the benefits of the previous mission. I still need an origin weapon and 20000 divine power stones."
         Kong Jie was speechless. Was this guy not worried about her safety at all?
         "I'll give it to you tomorrow ..."
         "I want it now!"
         Kong Jie was speechless. She could only say,"I don't have that much on my side. I'll need the support of the administration Bureau and the military."
         "Then go and ask for it!"
         “……”
         Kong Jie frowned slightly and glanced at Li Hao. Why was this kid in such a hurry?
         It's not like you'll be left out!
         Li Hao didn't care about that. He had to bring enough treasures to the relic.
         Kong Jie cursed under her breath. She didn't say anything else and quickly left.
         After Kong Jie left, Hong Yitang laughed and said,""You're really bold!"
         Kong Jie was a top-notch expert, but this guy didn't give her any face at all.
         Li Hao did not think much of it. Silver moon's officials had probably considered the possibility of him being exposed when they sent him to rescue the people. He had vaguely thought of this, but he did not care too much about it.
         No matter what, he could take these things with ease.
         Spending money to buy life.
         There was nothing to be embarrassed about. If he didn't mention it, others might really pretend that they didn't remember it and it would be gone in the end. There was no time to argue.
         Since the overlayed sword and the radiant sword were with him, director Zhao and the others would definitely give it to him.
         After waiting for a while, Kong Jie appeared again and threw a storage ring to Li Hao.""Here you go. You almost emptied Silver moon's pockets."
          Li Hao didn't believe it!
         30,000 divine power stones and three origin God weapons were not a small number.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, he didn't believe that he had emptied out all their savings.
         "Then I'll go pick up the members of the demon hunt squad, you guys wait for me for a bit ... If martial uncle Hong has something to do, then you can leave first."
         "With the earth overturning sword here, your safety will be more guaranteed ..." Kong Jie quickly said.
         Hong Yitang glanced at Kong Jie, who quickly explained the situation to him. Hong Yitang immediately frowned. He looked at Kong Jie, then at Li Hao, frowning.
         Ying Hongyue, this fellow ... Was really bored to death!
         "Then, I ..."
         "Senior uncle, please return to swords gate!"
         Li Hao said,"the swords gate might not be safe. Once an expert sneaks into Silver Moon, the other places are not well defended except for white moon City. With senior uncle not in swords gate, the people in swords gate will not be safe. Everyone knows how powerful senior uncle is, so they might use swords gate to threaten senior uncle."
        
         Hong Yitang seemed to be hesitating.
         It was fine if he didn't know, but now that he did ... He was still a little worried.
         Li Hao would probably be in big trouble.
         Li Hao said,"uncle-master, don't worry. I will stay in white moon City. No matter how bold those people are, they won't come to white moon City to seek death. Commander Yu, director Zhao, Secretary Kong, director Zhou, and the light sword will all be in white moon City. If they dare to come, they will be courting death!"
         Hong Yitang thought for a while and nodded,"Then be careful, swords gate might not be safe. If you need anything, you can contact me anytime!"
         "Alright!"
         Hong Yitang didn't hesitate anymore. It was indeed much safer in white moon City.
         On the other hand, without him, the swords gate would have to be careful not to be infiltrated.
         Then, without saying goodbye to Kong Jie, Hong Yitang left.
         Kong Jie wanted to say something but stopped, feeling helpless.
          In fact, he wanted to keep Hong Yitang. This person's combat strength was extremely strong. If he was willing to stay and stay in white moon City, the defense of white moon City would instantly reach a peak. The defense of the earth-covered sword was indeed excellent.
         Unfortunately, the swords gate was his territory.
         Li Hao turned around and was about to leave. The light sword wanted to follow, but Li Hao hurriedly said,""You don't have to follow me, it's very close. I'll be back soon. Senior, you should talk more with director Kong. He's offered a lot of benefits!"
         Light sword glanced at Li Hao, then at Kong Jie. Thinking that Silver moon's officials had indeed paid for it, it was necessary to be polite, so he had no choice but to stay.
         And Li Hao, with the Black Panther, quickly disappeared.
         ……
         After flying for a while, Li Hao's eyes flickered.
         His eyes faintly revealed a bright light, as if he had not noticed it. He looked around, and finally, he raised his head to look at the sky, and then quickly lowered his head.
         He frowned slightly.
         It seemed like someone was following him.
         It was a little glaring, but he couldn't see anything clearly due to the distance. After thinking for a while, Li Hao realized that it was either director Zhao or Huang Yu. One of them was following him.
         Perhaps it was for protection, or perhaps it was for surveillance ...
         However, Li Hao didn't like either of them.
         Moreover, he was going to the little tree's place next. He didn't want these experts to follow him, as it would easily cause the little tree to misunderstand.
         After thinking for a while, the divine boat landed.
         The huge divine boat smashed into the ground, creating a huge pit and falling down.
         Li Hao took the opportunity to leave the divine boat and disappeared.
         Under his control, the giant chariot divine boat continued to descend.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com In the sky, Huang Yu frowned.
         What was he doing underground?
         Ruins?
         He knew that Li Hao's group had gone to explore the ruins, but he wasn't sure which one.
         Could it be that he was here?  He didn't follow and just watched silently.
         After a while, the huge divine boat stopped moving. Huang Yu waited for a while, but the divine boat still did not move. This made him feel a little strange.
         Would something happen?
         However, he did not sense any energy fluctuations.
         In the end, he chose to remain silent.
         ……
         At this moment, Li Hao had already left.
         The earth sword force exploded when the divine boat landed. It opened up a small path underground. Li Hao, who had great concealment abilities, took advantage of the divine boat's descent and left. As for the divine boat, he left it there for Huang Yu to look after.
         Avoiding the people in the dark was also Li Hao's practice.
         He wanted to try and see if he could successfully escape from these people.
         In order to practice, he even used the wind-chasing boots, instantly crossing a thousand meters. This was also a sensing range for many experts.
         After using it three times, Li Hao was greatly exhausted, but he was still three kilometers away from the divine boat.
         He looked around and sensed that he was no longer being followed.
         "Not bad!"
         Li Hao chuckled in his heart. Not bad. The Windchaser boots, coupled with his identity as a Martial Master, and his dark-type abilities made it impossible for ordinary people to detect him.
         After leaving the person in the dark, Li Hao quickly moved forward. After a while, cat head mountain appeared in front of him.
         Li Hao's figure flickered and he quickly returned to the cave.
         It had been a few days since he left.
         Although everyone had brought enough food, they had been waiting here for a few days, so they didn't know if they were in a hurry.
         Li Hao jumped out of the black hole.
         Before he even landed, he felt a faint spiritual energy fluctuation."You seem to have obtained a pretty good divine weapon ..."
         "And it seems like he has really comprehended another Dao?"
          Little tree's mental energy fluctuation was slightly surprised.
         So fast!
         It did not know whether it was because the people of this era were more talented or because Li Hao was more talented, but it had only been a few days. It thought that Li Hao would need to go through at least a few more comprehensions of the origin Dao before he could comprehend it.
         But in the end, he went out for a trip. To it, the time was actually very short, and in the end, he had already successfully comprehended it.
         "I was just lucky!"
         Li Hao replied.
         As he landed, the others also saw him. Seeing that he had returned safely, everyone was relieved. Hao lianchuan quickly said,""You're finally back. It's been a few days. If you hadn't come back, we would have gone out to look for you."
         Li Hao smiled and glanced at him, somewhat surprised.""Peak of three yang?"
         That was fast!
         Looking at the others, there seemed to be quite a few martial masters who had comprehended the divine decree. However, the improvement in martial masters was not too obvious. What was really obvious was their superpowers.
