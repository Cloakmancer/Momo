Things like powerful physical bodies, powerful mental power, and those that specialized in cultivating various elemental DAOs ... These treasures were like cabbages. They were transported from level eight great worlds to the solitary void in exchange for those dark Dao accumulation crystals.It didn't have much effect on people who reached the venerable sovereign level.However, for those below venerable sovereign, it was a precious treasure.In an instant, the entire Silver Moon was in a frenzy of cultivation.……On the back of the Black Panther.There was a depression on the body of the Black Panther. The Black Panther was looking more and more like a dog now ... This was something the Black Panther had been trying to transform into. It had originally possessed a cow, but now it had transformed it into a dog.Several venerable sovereigns and some non-venerable sovereigns were standing in the depression.The three newly joined venerable sovereigns were also there.At this moment, they finally knew and confirmed that this bright moon sovereign was the new silver Moon King that everyone had talked about. It was somewhat unbelievable, but he was indeed the new silver Moon King and it was said that he was young beyond imagination."Senior Empyrean pole!"Heaven's Fate looked at Li Hao, who said again,""If I'm not mistaken, the location of your true body is probably the focus of attention of the major worlds. I'm afraid that our meeting won't be that simple.""If I hadn't killed these people, I might not have attracted the attention of some top-notch existences. However, I killed Ming Hao and the others. The will of the Crimson Moon master has personally ordered to kill me. Now, the Crimson Moon world will definitely pay attention!"Previously, it was only a battle between a group of low-level venerable sovereigns. At most, it involved some middle-level venerable sovereigns.But this time, Red Moon master had discovered that Li Hao could kill middle-stage venerable sovereigns. He had determined that Silver Moon had given birth to a new Dao universe ... A new Dao universe was most likely a seventh-stage venerable sovereign, which was synonymous with high-stage venerable sovereigns!Under such circumstances, the other party would definitely have to pay a greater price.They definitely wouldn't leave Li Hao alone and allow him to meet up with the enemy.Although Heaven's Fate was lazy, he wasn't stupid. He nodded. "That's right. The main thing is that my original body might not know about this. It's still gathering towards us. As I advanced to Tier 2, my original body's speed has indeed increased ..."He felt a headache coming on,'it's inevitable that I'm being watched! It's hard to escape now!"He felt a little helpless.The situation was more troublesome than he had expected.It would have been better if the news that Li Hao had killed those people hadn't been leaked. More importantly, he had a splitting headache now that the news had been leaked.More importantly, Li Hao, the strongest of Silver moon's group, had lost his ability to borrow strength. He had also lost his fifth stage venerable sovereign body, so it would be difficult for him to deal with a middle stage venerable sovereign. As for a high stage venerable sovereign, he would just be courting death if he encountered one. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao didn't say anything. At this moment, a huge map was presented in front of him.Stars were like existences that dotted the map.In the North, the red moon region. In the South, tianfang region.One was North and the other was South. There were very few worlds in the middle and it was a chaotic region. The Crimson Moon world and the Skylands world were at the borders of the two regions. The Skylands world was the boundary between the two.Because there were no advanced venerable sovereigns in the tianfang world, they were not a threat.Li Hao had never been to the West. It was said that this place was called the Scarlet sun region, and the most powerful force in the region was the Scarlet Sun World. It was also said to be a level 8 world, but it rarely came into contact with this place.The East was known as the Dragon field, which was the territory of the demon race. It was said that there was a Dragon World and other demon worlds there. Almost all of them gathered in the East. In the chaos, the demon race was not weak.Many chaos beasts were wandering there. They were of the same origin as the demon race and were very powerful.This was the distribution of power in this chaotic region.There was an empty space between each domain. It could be considered a man-made division zone. There were almost no worlds in these areas, unless they were some newly-born small worlds.The great world would not exist within the boundaries of these isolation zones.At this moment, Li Hao pointed at a spot of light."This is the Crimson Moon world!"That light spot was emitting some red."We're here!"Li Hao pointed again. On the map, he was very close, almost right next to the dot of light. "Your true body is here!"According to the celestial pole's doppelganger's judgment, Li Hao pointed to another place. To their South, not far away, was where celestial pole's original body was.The distance was also extremely close.At this moment, Yuan Shuo said,"do we have to meet up?" "We don't have the ability to participate in such a war now. It's a battle between a group of venerable sovereigns, and it involves high-level venerable sovereigns ... It's not that we don't want to save them, but the key is that neo martial should have their own plans. It might not be a good thing for us to get in touch with them rashly! Senior Empyrean terminus's clone is here, and I have the same thought. Right now, Silver moon's priority is to protect himself!"They couldn't even protect themselves, but Li Hao seemed to want to get in touch with them.This was not a good thing!It was too dangerous.Li Hao had killed those powerhouses, and the rank six venerable sovereigns had escaped. Now that they had escaped the enemy's detection range, they could find a place to hide. Even if they could not completely hide, they could at least give Silver Moon some time to develop.Li Hao had brought back a lot of resources, and everyone was training at a faster pace. The two masters of the great Dao still had a little hope of reaching level three with the help of everyone's training.Of course, Tier 4 was too difficult."I think we should keep a low profile for now," Yuan Shuo said."Neo martial will naturally be in charge of the safety of senior celestial pole and the others. We can't do things beyond our capabilities."

Chapter 2751 Turning Back (3)_5
Celestial pole nodded,'I think so too ... At this stage, we're in even more trouble! If we don't have to gather, I suggest we don 't! As long as I avoid my God Body, I'm not an idiot. I know that there must be a reason, so I'll avoid us!"He looked at Li Hao and sighed."Actually, you don't have to worry about me."Li Hao was really a man of justice!Li Hao chuckled."Senior, pardon me for asking. Do you know the Dao of yin and yang?""No," Tian Ji shook his head.That thing is too complicated. How can I know it?"Then, are there many people who understand yin and yang in neo martial?""Not too many ... Of course, there are some, especially the ultimate Yin Dao. Most of the people who died in the past knew it.""In the past, many people from new martial arts died once in battle. Later, they were resurrected. The human King reversed yin and yang ..." Tian Ji explained."Senior didn't die in battle?"“……”Heaven's Fate looked at the sky and didn't say anything.You guess!"Where is King Huai?"The celestial pole looked at the sky again.Li Hao smiled and thought for a moment, then said,'what about the other venerable sovereigns? Did many of them die in battle?""Of course.""An Autarch died in battle, right?""Yes."Li Hao nodded."I don't need to see you in person. I just want to see an expert who understands the way of yin and yang. As for the way of ultimate Yin, that would be the best!"He didn't have to go to the celestial pole.The key was that neo martial was the world he knew the most about yin and yang so far.He needed to comprehend some of the ultimate Yin Dao and merge it with the ultimate yang Dao. Yin and yang would merge and he would enter the fourth rank. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Otherwise, he, who was at the Grand completion of Tier 3, could only change his path.Exchange for what?Nirvana revival?Most importantly, he had some understanding of Nirvana, but resurrection ... Even the void did not know much about it.Other than this, walking the five elements?It didn't meet his expectations.Therefore, it was best to meet him now. He hoped that he could gain some insight.Yuan Shuo seemed to have understood what he meant and frowned slightly.Since it involved Li Hao's advancement, he had to do it, even if it was dangerous.Silver moon's trump card and confidence all came from Li Hao. He pondered for a while, looked at the crowd, and said,""We still have to separate! "We'll split into two groups. One group will act as a bait to lure some people to surround and hunt us down. The other group will secretly contact senior Empyrean pole's true body!""Of course, most people are still staring at senior celestial pole and the others. They won't rashly shift their attention ..."Yuan Shuo thought for a while and said,"what I mean is ... We should use the great path universe as bait ... No matter how great the temptation of the celestial pole seniors is, it's not as great as the great path universe. Now, the great path universe may have been exposed, and the Crimson Moon may not tell the outside world. We don't care. Whether the Crimson Moon knows or the entire chaos knows, the difference isn't big.""Only by using this method can we possibly divert the attention of senior Empyrean pole and the others!" On the side, Qian Wuliang also said after a moment of hesitation,"Not bad! Moreover, we'd better do something now. Attack a small world or even a medium world that's affiliated with the Crimson Moon world ... And cause some commotion! It exposed the fact that he was in the universe of the great path! Lord Marquis can take senior Empyrean pole's clone and secretly leave, looking for an opportunity to make contact with the other party ..."At that time, Silver Moon would naturally be in grave danger!However, Li Hao had his own reasons for insisting on making contact with them. No one tried to stop him.Li Hao didn't say anything. Instead, he lightly tapped his thigh.In Silver Moon, he could set up some traps or plots because he understood the situation. However, in the chaos, he did not understand the chaos. Moreover, the chaos was too large, and some things were too difficult to do.Right now, too many people were eyeing Silver Moon and new martial.It was very troublesome!It was also very difficult to escape their line of sight.After much consideration, Li Hao said, I want to return to the tianfang world!Everyone was stunned.Go back?Why?"I don't have many trump cards in the chaos," Li Hao said."I can't deal with some experts. I'm going back to tianfang to kill some experts, such as Supreme Dragon Emperor!"“……”The other three venerable sovereigns who knew the truth were all gasping.F * ck!Are you crazy?A rank six venerable sovereign, you want to kill him?What was he thinking!"However," Li Hao continued,"I'm going to pick up senior celestial pole and the others in person ... Not only that, but I'm also going to hide them and make them disappear from everyone's sight along with silver Moon!"Everyone fell silent and looked at Li Hao. This mission was too difficult to complete."I'll go to Tian Fang and create some noise!""You guys go and pick them up!" Li Hao said."Black Panther, come with me. The world is with me, and I'm here as well ... In everyone's minds, Silver Moon is here! Qian Wuliang and senior uncle Hong, you two go and pick them up. "Qian Wuliang wanted to say something but stopped."The aura of the origin of a great world is a little heavy," Li Hao said."With the consent of the two seniors, I hope to dissipate their aura of a great world, which means to separate them from the origin."Everyone was stunned again. Was this possible?The current Silvermoon great Dao universe was too weak.Would they agree?The Heaven's Fate doppelganger rubbed his chin and didn't say a word. He knew himself very well, and to be honest, was it possible for his main body to join the Silvermoon universe?The possibility was very high!As long as he promised that he wouldn't need to participate in the war ... He was more than happy to do so.In any case, pledging allegiance to Silver Moon was not considered a betrayal."Therefore, we need two masters of the great Dao to pick them up!""Of course, I can't be sure. I'll definitely attract everyone's attention ... After all, I'm only at level three at the moment. Unless there's a major change in tianfang that exceeds everyone's attention on the neo martial arts, such as ... The recovery of the great Dao universe!"

Chapter 2752 Return (6)
Everyone was stunned again."But that's too difficult," Li Hao continued."It's almost impossible ... So, the two masters of the great Dao might need to separate ..."Li Hao thought for a moment and added,"using my Silver moon's great Dao universe to pretend to be tianfang's awakening great Dao universe is also an opportunity. The awakening of tianfang's great Dao universe will be very weak, and silver moon's great Dao universe just happens to be very weak. This is in line with the situation of recovery. Otherwise, if it were too powerful, no one would believe it!"He looked at the two and said,"Qian Wuliang is good at pretending!" Qian Wuliang, why don't you come with me to Tian Fang, and senior uncle Hong will go and pick them up. As long as Tian Fang's Dao universe revives, even Level Seven cultivators can stop fighting, let alone senior celestial pole and the others. But ... It will be very exciting and dangerous!""I'll make you so agitated that you'll be devoured alive if you're caught!" He laughed.“……”Qian Wuliang felt helpless.Pretending to be the awakening of the tianfang great path universe in front of a group of venerable sovereigns, and perhaps even attracting many high-level venerable sovereigns ... Damn, this was simply dancing in front of the King of Hell.It was too exciting!The one dancing wasn't a beautiful woman, but a delicious piece of meat. Anyone who saw it would want to eat it, and they had to eat it.At this moment, even the three venerable sovereigns who had just joined could not hold back.The referee whispered,"is this necessary?" This ... Wasn't this too crazy? I think that if you want to pick her up, you can think about it. Why do you have to do this ... That ... That would make you a target for more people ..."He felt that Li Hao had blown things up!Was it worth it just to pick up two low-rank venerable sovereigns?It didn't feel like it was worth it!Li Hao explained,'the situation in Tian Fang is complicated, so it's actually safer! However, if we don't make a big fuss, it's almost impossible to divert everyone's attention. As for attacking small worlds and medium worlds ... In fact, it's more obvious if we try to cover it up. Everyone is more and more certain that we will meet up with the new martial artists!""As long as Tian Fang is more cautious ... It won't be too dangerous!"That was just what he said."In Tian Fang, we can do much more!" Li Hao said.And there, at critical moments, he could borrow strength.In the chaosverse, where was he supposed to borrow power from?It was very difficult to do so now. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Even the rank five venerable sovereign's corpse was gone.Li Hao didn't waste any more time and said,! Heibao, Qian Wuliang! And I will go to Tian Fang. " The rest of you, go and receive senior Empyrean pole's main body! Of course, remember, you must get a Supreme Being's avatar or have some communication with the venerable sovereign behind senior Empyrean pole. ""I need some enlightenment regarding the ultimate Yin Dao ... That's my goal!"Then, Li Hao added,"as for when I will make contact with you ... Hong Yu is too far away from you, so it's hard for me to communicate with you. I will destroy some of your life and death Stars ... When you are injured for no reason, you can make contact with her. It means that there is a lot of movement on my side ... Or, you can also sense it."Everyone was frowning.He still felt that it was too dangerous!At this moment, Yuan Shuo suddenly said,"there are five elements in Tian Fang?" I want to go to Tian Fang to take a look and comprehend the power of the five elements. It might be of some help to me. " "It's very dangerous there,"Li Hao frowned."You think I'm afraid?" "Qian Wuliang, Hong Yitang, and the others can become Dao Masters, so why would I be afraid of danger?" Yuan Shuo sneered.“……”The two venerable sovereigns didn't say anything, and this one couldn't be provoked either.Li Hao thought for a while and nodded.""Alright!"He didn't say anything else. Even if he didn't follow him, he had to follow Black Panther. And black Panther had to follow him, or else he would be too big of a target.In fact, his teacher would always be by his side.No one objected to Li Hao's plan.The few people from the Holy See wanted to cry but had no tears.This was crazy!These people were really bold. They didn't escape now, but insisted on going back and causing trouble ... Although, according to Li Hao, the three of them could just follow Hong Yitang, it was still very dangerous. Who knew if Heaven's Fate's people would retreat?They only wanted to escape!Li Hao continued,'there's no time to waste. I need to hurry back to Tian Fang! We'll start preparing for the revival of the great Dao universe ... This time, if the plan succeeds, we'll quickly meet up and obtain some comprehensions of the ultimate Yin Dao. I can take everyone to hide for a while and avoid some tracking. "This would require the use of chess!The way of chess required energy to activate. Of course, there was no need to do so inside the tianfang world, but Li Hao couldn't enter from inside the tianfang world. Otherwise, people would definitely know that he was still in tianfang.He thought about a lot of things and made a rough arrangement for some of his future plans.Man proposes, God disposes.Whether or not he could succeed would depend on his luck.If he succeeded, he would have a chance to enter the intermediate level. He could also find a place to hide for a while.This was much better than directly coming into contact with neo martial arts!Everyone looked at each other, and Hong Yitang also nodded.""I don't have any objections, it's just that ... I still need to bring someone along.""Who is it?""Senior Zhang an!"Li Hao smiled and looked at Zhang an. Seeing this, Zhang an also nodded.""Sure. If I go, I might be able to communicate with the two venerable sovereigns.""That's good!"Li Hao continued."All of you have entered the reality Dao universe and the Dao River ... The Dao universe. In fact, your main body is still in the Silver Moon world, not the Dao River. However, the Dao River is still there. That's enough!"

Chapter 2753 Turning Back (3)-7
"If we really can't join up ..."Li Hao pondered for a while."If I can get the ultimate Yin Dao, I can merge it with the Dao River. The main body of the Dao River and the great Dao universe are in the Silver Moon. I can try to comprehend it remotely in the Silver Moon!""If it's too difficult to gather, then give up ... To avoid being caught in one fell swoop!"It was obviously better to comprehend it in person than to comprehend it from a distance.,m However, meeting up was indeed full of risks. If they had no other choice, they could try this."If I absorb the ultimate Yin Dao, can I transfer it back through the Dao of life and death?" Lin Hongyu asked."It's too far!"Li Hao shook his head."My River of Life and death isn't as powerful as the Dao universe. It's not stable enough either. In fact, it's not as stable as the Dao universe."Lin Hongyu nodded and did not say anything."Then it's decided!"Li Hao looked at everyone."Whether or not Silver Moon can stand tall in the chaos ... This is very important. I hope that everyone, including me, can succeed!"He didn't say anything more, and he didn't care too much about this parting.Soon, he left with Heibao, Qian Wuliang, and the others, heading back to Tian Fang.This time, he was going to create a huge commotion in Tian Fang.Just like the day the Stargate opened and the neo martial human King annihilated the great world, creating a shocking commotion that allowed Silver Moon to escape the attention of many people, he had learned this technique of creating a diversion from the neo martial human King.……After Li Hao left, Hong Yitang exhaled.This time, they only had one goal ... To get the understanding of the ultimate Yin way and pass it back to Li Hao. The key was whether new martial arts could provide it and whether the two sides had the opportunity to come into contact.As for regrouping, that would probably be very difficult.The distance was too far.They weren't strong enough, and they would all be on the run when the time came. How would they have enough time to gather?It was still very difficult to transmit it through the river of the path.At that moment, Lin Hongyu transmitted a message to him,""Don't worry. As long as I get the Enlightenment ... I'll comprehend it and have a chance to send it back!"Hong Yitang was stunned and looked at her.Lin Hongyu did not say much. She now knew about the cycle of life and death."If I die, there's a chance that I'll be revived in the life and death Star ... At that time, as long as my memories and comprehensions are preserved, I'll naturally be able to transmit them back.……At this moment, everyone was still tracking down Silver Moon, as well as the location of Empyrean terminus's true body.At this moment, no one believed or imagined that Li Hao would actually turn around and rush toward Tian Fang.Without the big target, Black Panther, it would be difficult to find the venerable sovereigns.The Black Panther with the Silvermoon world was the most difficult to hide.The Supreme neo martial was still trying to rescue Li Hao, and Li Hao didn't want them to come to his rescue at all. The greatest help they could provide was some understanding of the ultimate Yin way.Once those people from new martial arts made a move ... At that time, it might cause even greater trouble. In addition, if he found a suitable place with Taoist connotation in Tian Fang, he might have a good chance to counterattack some experts. At this moment, Li Hao regarded Tian Fang as the base of his counterattack.……At the same time.On a warship, celestial pole suddenly frowned.""The clone deviated from its path. It seems to be intentionally distancing itself from me ...""They're probably in danger and don't want to meet immediately,"King Huai said thoughtfully."Yes,"Heaven's Fate thought about it and nodded. That was probably the case."Also ... My clone is at the second stage." please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  “……”King Huai was speechless.F * ck!"This means that this Silver Moon must have given birth to a great Dao universe. Otherwise, how could it have so much great Dao power? as expected, I guessed correctly.After a while, Heaven's Fate suddenly said,""The clone's meaning is to have me wait.""What?"King Huai was stunned. He could not communicate directly with his clone. How did you know to make you wait?Heaven's Fate sighed."My avatar seems to have become smarter. He's actually starting to use his brain. The path he takes is different according to his perception. I seem to have perceived it. It's a word,'' and so on!"King Huai's heart moved slightly. One word?In other words, this guy's clone was doing something in the chaos. It was constantly changing its position, direction, and writing so that the celestial pole could sense it and get the results?It was a good idea ... But the location of chaos was not very clear. If he wanted to write a word, that word would have to be unimaginably large. It seemed that the lazy celestial pole would have to run until their legs broke this time."Senior, you're good!"King Huai complimented, but Heaven's Fate was somewhat emotional. "That's right, not bad ... How did the clone become so smart? Do you think I should let my clone's consciousness be the master after the fusion?"“……”Go to hell!This brain of yours, you really dare to think.He had never heard of anyone who was willing to let their consciousness clone replace them. Although they were both the same person, their experiences were somewhat different.Heaven's Fate, on the other hand, rubbed his chin and pondered.Since the clone was capable ... Why not let him be the main body?I've been so annoyed recently!'Look at how capable my clone is. If I want to sense a single word, the area I can write will be much larger. For my clone to be willing to run over such a large area, it seems that he's much more hardworking than me.'If it was me, even if I thought of it, I might not be bothered to do it.Thinking about it, he didn't continue.He could only tell that Silver Moon had made some moves, and he hoped that going to Silver Moon would not be the start of any trouble.

Chapter 2754 Returning To Tianfang (1)
The Skylands world.At this moment, Tian Fang was also very lively.The incident with the Silver Moon King was an accident. Tian Fang had been preparing to deal with the neo martial artists all this time. The plan to kill the sword Master had been set a long time ago.Of course, he had to make some preparations to kill a sixth level venerable sovereign.In addition, the whereabouts of the Swordmaster were relatively hidden, so he had not been locked on.But today, a figure appeared on a huge screen.One of them was venerable Emperor Hui long. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The tianfang experts also started to discuss.……Back to the Dragon Temple.Hui long Emperor didn't hide his face or aura. He said directly to the screen,""The Silver Moon King killed Ming Hao and the others and took the Silvermoon world away. The other party has mixed into Ming Hao's team. Their goal is actually very obvious. They are going to meet up with Heaven's Fate, King Huai, and the other neo-martial experts!""As for new martial arts, they threw out these two pieces of trash. Everyone knows it ... It's to fish. It's to see who can catch who!""As of now, the venerable sovereign who is the closest to Silver Moon in neo martial arts, and the venerable sovereign who still has the time and energy to care about ... You should know that it could only be the neo martial venerable Swordmaster!"Venerable Emperor Hui long analyzed the situation, and his analysis was reasonable.In fact, it was true."So, Heaven's Fate and the others are the key now. Heaven's Fate and King Huai are both there. Venerable sword might be nearby, and the Silver Moon King might also be nearby ..."Killing a neo martial artist was not everyone's goal.His goal was still wealth.Resources, the quota for venerable sovereigns in the great world, the hope of reaching the seventh rank ...These were the goals of these experts. They were not targeting anyone. If Red Moon sovereign was killed, new martial arts would also be able to provide enough resources and benefits. Everyone would not mind killing Red Moon sovereign."Huilong," someone said,"it's said that the Silver Moon King's Silver Moon world might have given birth to a great Dao universe. Is that true?""I'm not sure ... It could be true, or it could be fake. "The person who asked was a little dissatisfied,"we all know your background. Are you not clear or are you not willing to say?" Furthermore, as far as I know, that Silver Moon King is very likely to be venerable Emperor Hao Yue ... If he's one of your people who returned to the Dragon Temple, don't you know?"Do you think we're really stupid?Huilong frowned slightly."It's just a guess. Of course, I have some doubts, but I've tested it before. If the other party really has a universe of the great path, to be honest, I would have taken him down long ago. Would I have given you a chance?""We're working together, so we have to be a little more honest. If I don't know, then I don't know. How can I make up some lies to deceive you? if there's nothing in the end, wouldn't I be asking for trouble?"In any case, he didn't find any traces of the great Dao universe on Li Hao. This was not fake.He could say that he did ... But if he really didn 't, these people weren't to be trifled with. If they came to find trouble with him, where would he go to reason? "Alright, now is not the time to talk about this."Someone interrupted and quickly changed the topic,""The current situation is that the Crimson Moon world is also looking for this person. Celestial pole and the others are probably targeted by the Crimson Moon. If venerable the sword appears nearby ... Do we still have to go?""Of course I'm going!"Venerable Emperor Hui long said,"Hong Yue gave us the resources because she didn't want to lose too much. Venerable swordsman is not a weak person. He is a sixth rank venerable sovereign. How many of them dare to fight him alone?" It's better for Hong Yue's people to go. If there's an advanced venerable sovereign, Hong Yue will definitely take action ... It'll increase our safety. "This was true."Then we can't delay any longer. It's time to take action!""That's right. From what I know, Heaven's Fate and the others aren't far from where the Silver Moon King disappeared. There are experts searching along the way, so it might take some time, but the two sides will meet sooner or later. I feel that ... The Silver Moon King might have given birth to a new Dao universe. Otherwise, how could the Silver Moon King have improved so quickly?""That's right, I also have such a guess!"“……”The venerable sovereigns were all talking, and venerable Dragon sovereign didn't say much. He wasn't sure if there was anything else.The sector Lord had guessed it before, he just didn't probe it out."Then, everyone, get ready. This time, it's best if we work together. It involves a major world, so we have to be careful.""Alright!""That's right!""Huilong, what's the situation with Kong Ji?" someone suddenly asked.As soon as he said that, the others all looked at the Supreme Emperor. The Supreme Emperor frowned and said,""You all know what's going on. It's not my place to say anything now. Not to mention me, anyone in this situation ... Can't provoke them, can they?"Everyone was silent.This was a fact.A descendant of a rank eight venerable sovereign.The most important thing was that the divine light plane had yet to start a war. It was still in a period of peace, and it would be difficult to fish in troubled waters."Then don't bring him back to the Dragon Temple!""He wants to go, but he keeps urging me." Hui long Emperor said helplessly,"but after his identity was exposed, I didn't dare to take him there ... It's too troublesome and dangerous!"It wasn't just the void that was in danger, they were in danger as well.Now, people in the outside world were guessing that Hao Yue was the Silvermoon King.And Kong Ji, in front of many people, said that Hao Yue was his friend.If it wasn't related to a level eight venerable sovereign, Kong Ji would have been captured long ago.Even if they didn 't, some people were guessing that new martial arts and the great radiance world had joined forces. This would be a big problem. If Kong Ji, a rank five venerable sovereign, suddenly turned against them, they would be asking for trouble.

 It wasn't easy to kill, but he couldn't just let himself be killed, right?"You can't bring him over!""We can ignore him, but we can't keep him by our side. That's just asking for trouble!" Another person said. Moreover, his strength at the fifth step was not weak! He's from the radiance great world and he has no lack of monarch weapons. He was already at level five five five hundred years ago and can still reach level five after re-cultivation. He can't be treated like an Ordinary Level five itinerant cultivator!""His true strength might not be weaker than an ordinary rank six. He's still extremely terrifying!""So, Huilong, you have to settle him down. If you want to bring him along ... We won't be moving with you."Dragon Emperor was speechless. I don't want to bring him either.You're saying it as if I have to bring him along?Most people don't know my background, but these people do. Of course, he also knows their background.The tianfang world was divided into four major regions.Other than the Hui long temple, the other three forces also had rank six venerable sovereigns. Almost all of these people had the support of a great world behind them. Otherwise, how could the tianfang great world be so easily invaded?In the entire tianfang region, there were only two rank 8 worlds, but there were many rank 7 worlds.It was not appropriate for the sector Lords of Level 7 worlds to come personally, so they had some arrangements.There were not only a few rank six venerable sovereigns, but also some domain Lords, rank four and rank five Lords, and some representatives of great worlds.Tianfang was said to be the territory of rogue cultivators ... But in reality, what were rogue cultivators?How many true rogue cultivators reached the sixth step?Without the support of a great world, it would be very difficult to reach level six.Tier 4 was as difficult as ascending to the heavens!Hui long didn't say much and quickly said,"it's decided. I'll give everyone some time. Ten days later, we will gather in the southern region and set off together!""Yes!"Ten days wasn't a long time for them. They still needed to make some preparations, including the time they needed to travel.Going to the southern region would allow him to exit the realm gate and head to the red moon region.……With a wave of his hand, the Supreme Dragon Emperor took away the screen.Soon, he activated another mirror.After a while, a figure appeared."Realm Lord, we've agreed to leave in ten days," the Emperor replied respectfully. On the mirror, the realm Lord didn't seem to mind. He slowly said,""The key is not to kill."The Dragon Emperor was all ears.The shadow chuckled and said,"we must make Red Moon and neo martial quickly break out in a large-scale war, including the battle between high-level venerable sovereigns!" "The resources given by the red moon ... Aren't the key. The purpose of hunting the neo martial artists is to cause chaos in the neo martial artists so that they won't run around anymore. Instead, they'll choose to take revenge head-on!""Neo martial artists pay particular attention to revenge. Moreover, time usually passes quickly ... So, I asked you to hunt for neo martial artists.""I understand!" Venerable Dragon Emperor nodded.He hesitated for a moment, but still asked,""Sector Lord, last time I suspected that bright moon was the Silver Moon King. I tested him a few times, but I found out that he didn't use the power of the great Dao universe. Of course, he might have hidden his strength ... But ... It's impossible for him to be at the middle level right after he came out, right? In addition, the drought in the great dark world and his death in the darknorth rains...I'm unable to determine whether or not it was Haoyue's doing. "The shadow pondered for a while."I still think that the Dao universe has been born. Perhaps there are some special aspects ... Otherwise, without the Dao universe, it's impossible for pure itinerant cultivators to cultivate so quickly.""Just sorting out the great Dao is a huge project. Only the great Dao universe can help people sort out the great Dao.""However, every time he attacks, some Primal Chaos lightning tribulation will appear ... Perhaps it's related to some special great Dao.""You'll know all of this after we capture the other party. "The realm Lord said a few words and then added,""After you leave, I'll send someone to take over the Dragon Temple and the dark Demon Ridge. Tian Fang is also very important. We can't lose Tian Fang just because we're hunting a neo martial artist!""Has there been any other changes in tianfang recently?" he asked Hui long.The Emperor thought for a while and shook his head. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Last time, there had been some changes on the side of the heavenly River. Tianfang's universe of the great path seemed to have some signs of emerging, but there had been no more movement after that."You don't have any?""I don't know," the shadow mumbled to himself."The last time venerable Emperor Tian He was killed, something strange happened ... It was said that there was a Primal Chaos lightning tribulation at the time. Could it be related to this Silver Moon King? Could it be that he did something in Tian Fang that caused the change?""If you can capture this person alive, it's best if you can!"The shadow said slowly,'compared to neo martial, or even the Crimson Moon, Tian Fang is actually more important! Tian Fang is the key to reaching the type 9 realm and entering the type 9 world! Once Yunxiao can enter a rank nine world, he will undergo a transformation. At that time, he should be able to produce some daosource power and even a few more rank seven venerable sovereigns ... Huilong, you've worked hard these years in tianfang. If an opportunity comes, it will be your rank seven opportunity!"The venerable Dragon Emperor thanked him immediately.At his level, the seventh step was the key, but it was not that easy.Now that the realmlord had given him a promise, he wouldn't kill the donkey after it had served its purpose. It wasn't worth it either. With such a quota, it was a good thing for Yunxiao to have another Grade 7 expert.Seeing that the sector Lord was about to end the communication, he quickly said,""Realm Lord, there's one more thing, it's related to the world of light ...""You mean the son of the radiant sovereign?"The mysterious man smiled and said,"ignore him for now!" Of course, if he wants to find trouble ... You don't have to be polite! The divine light plane and I are not ready to fight now. Let's wait for the outcome of the battle between Crimson Moon and new martial to be decided!"

Chapter 2756 Entering Tianfang Once More (3)
If they were not prepared for war, they would not make a big move.Otherwise, if a fight broke out here before the other side, wouldn't it be advantageous to others?"I understand!" Venerable Emperor Hui long nodded again.Anyway, he didn't have to be too afraid of that guy.Of course, don't take the initiative to find trouble for no reason, or it would be troublesome.A moment later, the mirror returned to its calm state.The two sides lost contact.A rank 8 Lord had spent so much effort to chat with him, a rank 6, so it could be seen how much importance he placed on this matter. Hui long knew that heaven and earth were extremely important.This place might be related to the opportunity for several venerable sovereigns to enter the ninth level. Once he left, Kong Ji, a Tier 5 martial artist, would become the strongest person in the Hui long temple. The Hui long Emperor was worried that this guy would cause trouble.Of course, cloudsky would send someone over.He didn't care who he sent.What he needed was for Kong Ji to not cause trouble before the person came. Otherwise, he would be in deep trouble.Just as he was thinking, his expression suddenly changed.A moment later, a person appeared in front of him. He had a calm expression on his face."Temple master, sorry for disturbing you!"“……”"Kong Ji, what's the matter?" venerable Emperor Hui long forced a smile."Abbey Dean, when will the hunting of venerable swords start?""Soon!"The venerable Dragon Emperor smiled and cursed in his heart."The Abbey Dean will take me with you, right?" Kong Ji looked at him again.Right, my ass!Venerable Dragon Emperor was having a headache. He forced a smile and said,""I will ...""You don't want to take me with you?"“……”Kong Ji glanced at him."Are you worried about something?""There's no such thing!"Kong Ji gave him a deep look. Ever since his identity had been exposed, he didn't care about being exposed. However, if he was exposed, it would cause some trouble, like now.He thought for a while and said,"then I won't make things difficult for the Abbey Dean ... But I have a request.""What?"The Emperor frowned slightly.Kong Ji said calmly,"I want the authority to control the dark Demon Ridge ... When the Abbey Dean is gone, I want to guard the dark Demon Ridge. You can enter and leave as you wish. No one is allowed to enter without my permission!"The dark Demon Ridge!Huilong frowned slightly. This was the foundation of the Huilong temple.Of course, he had consumed a lot of resources recently, so he couldn't enter the dark Demon Ridge again for a short time. Even if he did, he would have to consume a lot of resources.Kong Ji, why did he want the authority to control the dark Demon Ridge?Did Haoyue discover something the last time he entered, and tell him something?It was hard for the Supreme Emperor to make a judgment.On the one hand, he was worried that he would really give this fellow an opportunity. On the other hand, he was worried that if he did not agree, it would cause some trouble.In fact, the dark Demon Ridge was not of much use now. It was not a big deal to let Kong Ji control it.More importantly ... Wouldn't it be too embarrassing for him to agree to the other party's request?"Abbey Dean, why don't you take me with you to hunt revered sword, or ... I'll stay in the dark Demon Ridge!" Kong Ji said."Kong Ji, you ..." Hui long frowned.Kong Ji looked calm."I know. The Abbey Dean may not be afraid of me. After all ... Huilong temple is not simple." However, if I insist on looking for trouble, I'll kill you, Abbey Dean. Supreme Emperor Yunxiao may not find trouble with me ... At most, I'll just compensate you with some resources! But if you kill me ... My father will definitely find fault with you. That's the difference! Both sides are unwilling to start a war in the Crimson Moon region and the heavenly square region. However, if you kill me, you will definitely start a war. If I kill you ... After all, you're only a rogue cultivator to the outside world, aren't you?"It made so much sense!In fact, the venerable Dragon Emperor was very clear about this. Otherwise, why would he give him face?Although he had cloudsky behind him, there were still differences between people.If he died, if the divine light realm was willing to compensate him with enough treasures, Supreme Emperor Yunxiao might not continue to find trouble with him. However, if Kong Ji died, he would probably be finished unless the two sides started a war.However, was there a problem with Kong Ji's insistence on taking control of the dark Demon Ridge?Kong Ji looked at him and chuckled,""Are you worried that I've gotten some lucky chance?""No, I didn 't!""If there's really an opportunity, it's your fate. I'm so happy!" Venerable Emperor Hui long also smiled. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  After thinking for a while, he said,"if you want to do this, that's fine!" However, in a few days, a friend of mine will come here and help me guard this place for a while. I hope that Kong Ji can assist me well and not have any conflicts with him ..."Kong Ji understood that Yunxiao should be sending someone over."As long as the other party doesn't look for trouble, I naturally won't cause any trouble.""I believe in you, Daoist void!"The venerable Dragon Emperor smiled. In order to avoid some trouble, in order to prevent this guy from following him, he finally made a decision. Regardless of whether there were opportunities in the dark Demon Ridge, he would let this guy control it for a while.Soon, he took out a treasure that looked like a token.""This is the pass to the dark Demon Ridge. With this, you can open the door and enter at any time ...""Many thanks!"Kong Ji took it and quickly disappeared without saying anything.Now that his identity had been exposed, he knew that it would be hard for these guys to trust him and bring him along to hunt the revered Sword Master.It was probably not too convenient to travel outside.Since that was the case ... He would take control of the dark Demon Ridge.Li Hao would return to the dark Demon Ridge sooner or later.The reason was that the Dao chess could bring Li Hao back. Taking control of the dark Demon Ridge was actually helping Li Hao. If Li Hao was in danger and chose to use the Dao chess to return, the Supreme Emperor of the Hui long sect, who controlled the dark Demon Ridge, might be able to sense it.

Chapter 2757 Returning To Tianfang (1)
It would save him some trouble if he took control of it. At the same time, he could take the opportunity to comprehend it. Previously, because of Hui Long's presence and the fact that he had been in closed-door cultivation for too long, he had missed the event to kill the venerable sword. Thus, he chose not to go into closed-door cultivation for the time being.Now, since these people were not willing to take him along, it would not be bad for him to take the opportunity to comprehend the Dao of chess.Both sides quickly reached an agreement.Seeing Kong Ji leave, Hui long Emperor let out a sigh of relief and cursed.Very quickly, he laughed again.That's good!He had finally managed to stabilize this problem.This was a good thing!……At the same time.Li Hao led Black Panther and the others toward Tian Fang at a very fast speed.However, it was very difficult to shrink the size of a Black Panther.It contained an entire world. It was extremely difficult to compress it and achieve true freedom. At the current stage, Black Panther was unable to do it unless he reached Level Seven. At that time, he would be like Emperor Cang and could compress it however he wanted.Such a large body was actually quite eye-catching even in the chaos.He definitely couldn't bring the Black Panther to Tian Fang.Or, the Black Panther could spit out the small world and he could go over himself. That would be fine and not a big problem. Tian Fang did not reject the Chaos Beast too much.However, once the small world left behind was discovered ... With the Lord of the great Dao gone, the Lord of the World gone, Li Hao gone, and discovered by a random venerable sovereign, it would be strange if they did not eat a medium-sized world without a master!Even a fool would know that such a great benefit could not be taken away, so he would just eat it!As for Black Panther, it would be best to bring him to Tian Fang.If Black Panther brought Qian Wuliang to Tian Fang instead of Tian Fang, he might not be able to disguise himself as the real Dao universe. It would be best if the Silvermoon world could get close to Tian Fang. Otherwise, the Dao universe was too far away and it would be hard to disguise.This was the problem that Li Hao had to solve right now!Secondly, he had to sneak into tianfang world. The four realm gates were guarded, and an unfamiliar venerable sovereign could easily be targeted."Qian Wuliang!""Here!"Qian Wuliang answered in a hurry. Li Hao asked while he was on his way,""The Black Panther is too big, so it's not good to get close to tianfang. But if we don't get close, the Silver Moon won't be near tianfang, and it'll be difficult to affect tianfang with the radiation of the great path universe. Do you have a solution to this problem?"Qian Wuliang was a bit depressed.You never ask me for easy things.There's nothing simple about it."There are!""Do you want to hear it, my Lord?" Qian Wuliang asked.“……”Nonsense!Also, did this guy really have a way? "Lord Marquis, the world can actually be compressed."Nonsense, I know.Li Hao didn't say much and continued to listen.Qian Wuliang was a quick-witted man, and he could give some reliable suggestions sometimes."The problem is that the Black Panther isn't too strong. If it's compressed ... The world might collapse, causing countless deaths!"Li Hao nodded.Qian Wuliang continued,"so, I think we should find a small world and kill everyone in it." After killing the Lord of the small world, the Black Panther would replace the dead and temporarily move the Silver Moon people into it. Then, the Black Panther would compress the Silver Moon world! There are many small and medium worlds in the primordial chaos, and Lord Marquis just so happens to have a map ... Some of the small worlds are backed by some large worlds. For the time being, no one will find trouble with them, and no one will care about them ..."Killing all the living beings of a world!Then, he moved the Silver Moon in.This was a good idea ... But the method was too ruthless.Although the Silver Moon world was a mid-tier world, it only had ten billion people. This was only the population of some small worlds, and they could be integrated into small worlds.That way, he would be able to compress the Silvermoon world and walk around easily.The world could naturally be compressed. Otherwise, no one would trade worlds.There were even some forces in tianfang world that were selling some worlds for venerable sovereigns to devour.These were almost all worlds after being compressed.There were no living people.Even if there were, it was rare, because the world would collapse if it was not compressed until one reached the seventh step.Qian Wuliang had always been ruthless.Li Hao was also used to his way of speaking. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  However ... He still shook his head,'there are tens of billions of living beings in a world! For now, we should maintain the attitude of not attacking unless someone attacks us first. Otherwise, it's still not appropriate to kill all the living beings in the world. ""If it's not convenient for you, I can help ..." Qian Wuliang said slowly."Wouldn't that be deceiving yourself?"Li Hao smiled.Qian Wuliang was helpless.This was actually a good idea!Not only could it hide one's tracks, but it could also make the Silver Moon disappear from the public's eyes. As long as it was done well, it would be normal for no one to discover it for tens of millions of years. Who would check whether the original living beings in the small worlds were the original living beings?Sometimes, Qian Wuliang felt that Li Hao was hypocritical.In fact, Li Hao didn't think that he was being kind. He just believed in the philosophy of a martial artist: if you don't mess with me, I won't mess with you. If you mess with me ... I'll kill you. It was as simple as that.He was very interested in killing the strong, but killing the weak ... He was not interested in killing the creatures of an entire world, unless it was to deal with worlds like the Crimson Moon.The red moon was an enemy.The enemy must be exterminated!Qian Wuliang's idea wasn't very reliable.However, it was also a plan.

Chapter 2758 Returning To Tianfang (1)
Thinking of this, Li Hao suddenly said,"senior two cat, you're also a stage two. You should be able to devour a world into your body like Emperor Cang, just like the chaos beasts, right?" Furthermore, he might even be able to do better than Black Panther?""If senior doesn't mind, can you temporarily accommodate the Silver Moon? this time, we will be separated for a period of time and circle around Tian Fang ... I will bring the Black Panther into Tian Fang, and it will use heaven's will to contact the Silver Moon and the great Dao universe ..."In the long river, second cat turned over and continued to sleep.Go to hell!Don't force a cat to curse!Once or twice, it was fine.There's something to do every day, senior. When there's nothing to do, senior, aren't you annoyed?It was not easy to find a place to sleep, but something happened every few days. Just two days ago, it ate a chaos lightning tribulation and almost exploded. Now it came again. I'm not a big cat!The big cat likes to swallow the world and run with the world, but I don't like it!Can second cat swallow the world? Naturally, he could.Whatever the big cat knew, it knew. Because the two of them were one, or rather, almost exactly the same. Other than the big cat's strength improving a lot over the years, and it not improving, there was almost no difference.But ... I'm not doing it!Li Hao couldn't bear to leave the Black Panther outside, because it was indeed very dangerous. However, he was willing to leave second cat outside to circle around ... On one hand, he thought that second cat was more experienced and might be stronger than the Black Panther. On the other hand, second cat had special abilities that could avoid detection.Second cat's body wasn't big. After devouring the world, it might get bigger, but it shouldn't be as obvious as the Black Panther.Also, second cat was very good at hiding his aura, so he didn't have much of a presence.These were all things that Black Panther could not compare to.In fact, Li Hao also had a headache.Second cat was not easy to deal with.Li Hao, on the other hand, had already owed ermao countless favors. Every chaos lightning tribulation was a debt of gratitude ... Now that he owed more, he could only count on ermao to not worry about it, because ermao had no desires!"Senior second cat, this matter is very important. It even affected my advancement ... Otherwise, I wouldn't have let you take the risk ...""Then let's not take the risk!"Hearing second cat's words, Li Hao coughed in embarrassment."I don't want to do it anyway!"“……”"Is there no room for discussion?" Li Hao said helplessly."There's room for discussion!""Conjure up the time star again and let me play with it for a while ...""It's easy to attract chaos lightning tribulations. "Li Hao frowned."Also, I need to bring the time star to Tian Fang. Just in case!" This was something that he could play with normally.It won't work this time.He had to enter Tian Fang, so he might need this.Second cat wagged its tail, a little unhappy.However, it knew that if Li Hao didn't advance, time wouldn't be strong enough to resist the chaos lightning tribulation. Every time it condensed, it would attract the chaos lightning tribulation. It couldn't carry the time star into the river and play with the teachers like before."Then just this once ... Next time, don't come to me!""Just once!" Li Hao exhaled and nodded."You seemed to have said that."Li Hao was embarrassed.Second cat was not too happy, and black Panther was a little depressed.Obviously, the Black Panther understood. Li Hao felt that second cat was more reliable, stronger, and more camouflaged than it. Although it was said that bringing him into tianfang would help him communicate with the world and the great Dao, Qian Wuliang was also the master of the great Dao. There wasn't a big difference without him.With er Mao's agreement, Black Panther did not say anything. In the chaotic void, he opened his mouth wide and spat out a world.It was a very big world!As for second cat, it swallowed it and said in disdain,""This little dog has a breath!"“……”The Black Panther was speechless. At this moment, its body rapidly shrank. After a moment, although its body was still very large, at least it was not as huge as before. Now, it was only a strange dog that was over a hundred meters long.Previously, its body size was so huge that it was almost a thousand kilometers long, which was in line with the length of a Chaos Beast. However, anyone with a discerning eye could tell that it might contain a world inside.After second cat swallowed the world, his body grew in size.However, compared to the Black Panther, it was indeed much stronger. Perhaps the space inside was more compressed. Under the internal universe, er Mao's body only grew by a few thousand times. He had grown from the height of a man to a giant cat that was a few thousand meters tall.In the chaos, a few thousand meters was like a drop in the ocean.Li Hao heaved a sigh of relief. Just as he had expected, second cat's devouring and holding abilities were much stronger than the Black Panther 's. It was just a cat that was a few thousand meters long ...Alright, it was still extremely huge, but it was not conspicuous in the chaos. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  At this moment, Qian Wuliang, who had been silent, suddenly said,""Senior, it's best to change your appearance ... Otherwise, if you meet an expert in the primal Chaos, it's easy to be mistaken as the new Martial Emperor Cang."“……”Second cat was extremely depressed.The big cat has provoked countless enemies, and now I can't even maintain my original appearance. How sad.That was true.If it was seen by others, a Beast of Chaos that was thousands of meters long was nothing, but a cat that was thousands of meters long ... Like a big cat, that would be terrible. Perhaps some high level venerable sovereigns would appear soon to deal with it!"Of course, if senior feels that it can deter the enemy, it might not be a bad idea ..."

Chapter 2759 Returning To Tianfang (1)
Before Qian Wuliang finished, second cat said unhappily, "You're an idiot! Those who want to kill big cat are all seventh or eighth level venerable sovereigns. If one of them comes, I'll be killed. Who else can I threaten?"It was not going to scare away the weak and attract the strong!Li Hao smiled but didn't say anything.Soon, second cat's appearance changed. Although it was still a cat, it looked like ... A pig.Li Hao held back his laughter and didn't speak.The group of people quickly rushed towards Tian Fang. They no longer needed the Black Panther to drag the world along, so their speed was much faster. As for er Mao, although he had swallowed the world, his speed was not much slower.If silver Moon had hidden himself like this before, he might not have been exposed so easily.However, before this, second cat might not have agreed.He probably agreed now because he felt that Li Hao had reached a bottleneck and needed some help. Only after Li Hao advanced could time come again.Second cat didn't care about other people's lives.He didn't even care about Li Hao's life.The reason he stayed behind was all because of Shi Guang. Otherwise, Li Hao wouldn't have been able to order ermao around.Li Hao also knew that this was the reason why he had asked second cat to do something.Based on this, in the future, when they really reunited, he had to satisfy second cat's desire.……The Dragon Emperor and the others were scheduled to leave in 10 days.Li Hao, on the other hand, would need a longer time to return to Tian Fang.Supreme Emperor Hui long and the others had set off before Li Hao arrived at Tian Fang. Li Hao didn't know about this. Even if he did, he couldn't stop them. Besides, it was a good thing for him that these experts had left. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  These people would come back sooner or later when Tian Fang made a big move.……When they left, Li Hao and the others maintained the speed of a first level venerable sovereign and walked for more than a month.Li Hao's speed was much faster than before, but because of Silvermoon's existence and the devouring of two cats, it took some time. It couldn't keep up with Li Hao's speed alone. In the end, after 15 days, Li Hao saw the enormous tianfang world.On the way, he didn't encounter Huilong and the others. Li Hao deliberately avoided the conventional route and took a few detours. Otherwise, the two sides might have met in the chaos.He placed er Mao near tianfang world.Li Hao went to tianfang world with Qian Wuliang, Heibao, Yuan Shuo, the Queen of the West, and the king of Dali. They all had the potential to become venerable sovereigns, and the chances of the king of Dali and the Queen of the West were higher.These few people also acted as the company of the three venerable sovereigns. Three venerable sovereigns and three non-venerable sovereigns, it was in line with the configuration of one person, and it was not too conspicuous. If they brought too many, it would be conspicuous.Some venerable sovereigns would also bring a servant along, mainly for the convenience of doing things.This time, Li Hao didn't choose to enter from the South Gate.Instead, he changed directions and took a detour around tianfang world. After spending a few days, he entered tianfang world from the Western gate.……The Western world gate.Just like the South realm gate, there were people guarding it.However, when he saw Li Hao's group, which consisted of two human venerable sovereigns, a Chaos Beast, and three servants ... He asked them a few questions, but they did not seem to need a guide. The guards at the Western gate did not dare to say anything.Now that some middle-stage venerable sovereigns had left, Li Hao directly revealed his third stage venerable sovereign aura. Black Panther also had the aura of a second stage venerable sovereign, so it would be difficult to recruit him.Li Hao soon entered the Western Region.Similar to the southern region, this place was also divided into ten major regions. The strongest was the floating light region, which was similar to the returning Dragon Temple. There was a sixth stage venerable sovereign in charge of the power called Fu Guang city. The floating light venerable sovereign was also a sixth stage venerable sovereign, but he did not seem to be in the region at the moment.Although the arrival of the three venerable sovereigns had attracted some attention, a first level venerable sovereign from Fu Guang city had left quickly after coming to meet them, as venerable sovereign Fu Guang was not around.The three of them did not seem to be interested in joining Fu Guang city, and the other party could not say anything.……But this time, Li Hao wasn't alone, so he wasn't in a hurry.The group of people did not go into the city. Instead, they found a place with no one around and used their magical powers to create a temporary residence. No one dared to provoke them. Hence, in the Western Region of Fu Guang city, there were more rumors that a few venerable sovereigns had come to this area and might be staying here for a while.Even though it was only a temporary residence, it was not small.At this moment, Li Hao's group stopped their journey and felt a little more relaxed.In the palace.Li Hao didn't waste any time and said directly, I came here with one purpose ... To make a big scene! Heibao and Qian Wuliang, your goal is simple. Try to communicate with the Silver Moon and get through it. It would be best if you could summon the universe of Dao at any time. ""As for Dali King, the few of you ... Including my teacher, your goal is still to become a venerable sovereign!""Tian Fang has many opportunities. If he's lucky, he has a high chance of advancing to venerable sovereign!" "As for me ... I might need some help. I'll go find someone and see if I can get some support."Who?Of course, it was emptiness.It was not bad to have someone to help him when he was doing something."Is it reliable?" Yuan Shuo frowned slightly.Li Hao had been here for a year, but could he find any reliable friends in a year?Li Hao laughed,"it should be reliable!" Besides, this is a great opportunity for him!"Who knew what the result would be?Finally, what if he could really lure the tianfang great Dao universe out?Wasn't that an opportunity of emptiness?Yuan Shuo nodded slightly."It's good that you think it's reliable. I heard that there are many places with Taoist connotation here, similar to relics. I haven't been to relics for a long time. I'll act on my own this time!"Li Hao frowned.Yuan Shuo laughed,"why are you frowning?" You weren't even born when I dug up the grave!""Teacher, this is the place where the venerable sovereigns 'Taoist connotation is ...""So what? Back then, I dared to dig it out when I was a cultivator who had broken through a hundred realms. Now, I'm at the Dao integration stage, so what's wrong with the venerable sovereign's Dao accumulation land?"“……”Alright!As long as you're happy.Li Hao didn't say anything more. He looked at the two and said,""What about you guys?""I'll go on my own too!"The Dali King grinned."Don't come with me!"He looked at the Queen of the West.This was a God of plague!The Queen of the West couldn't be bothered with him. Who would want to be with him?You're a reckless man, a fool, and you'll be tricked to death very quickly when you're out. I'm not going with you.She broke into a smile."Marquis Li, I'll act on my own as well ..."Li Hao glanced at her."You didn't take the opportunity to run away, did you?" he asked.“……”The Queen was speechless."How could that be?" she asked after a long while.Li Hao laughed,"so be it ... Just don't leak any information before I complete my plan!" As for whether you want to stay in Tian Fang or something else, I have no objections. "He didn't really care if they ran.The Queen had been suppressed by him in Silver Moon, so it was normal for her to want to run.The Queen was helpless."The Marquis is so worried about me. Why is he willing to let me leave on my own? if I leak the news, wouldn't it be troublesome?"Li Hao laughed."You're not really stupid. The news has been leaked. If I don't die, won't you die as well?"“……”Alright!,m The Queen didn't say anything else. As Li Hao had said, betraying Li Hao wouldn't do her any good.She wasn't even a venerable sovereign. No one would believe her even if she told them."Moreover, when you really go out, you'll know how miserable itinerant cultivators are. Now, at least you've entered the Dao universe ... When you go out, you'll realize that many venerable sovereigns want to join the Dao universe but don't have the chance!"The Queen nodded and did not say anything else.Let's go out and take a look.If there's a good opportunity outside, I'll run away. If there's no chance, I'll come back. I've been suppressed too badly by Li Hao in Silver Moon.Since everyone had made their decision, Li Hao didn't delay.Soon, he left his temporary residence and headed straight for the southern region.He had heard that many venerable sovereigns had left.
