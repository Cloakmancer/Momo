Ying Hongyue was dead, and so was her venerable sovereign. However, everything started with Hongyue's invasion. It would be strange if Li Hao didn't deal with Hongyue.This guy was very narrow-minded."Copy ..." He said.At this moment, second cat suppressed this and felt a headache.""It's actually very difficult to copy you. You've mastered too many DAOs. Even if I really do know them, it's difficult to completely copy you ..."Li Hao nodded."It doesn't have to be exactly the same. Even if only one great Dao is replicated, it's fine. This means that you have such an ability."If it was replicated, the meaning would be completely different.Now, even if Li Hao merged with the Silvermoon great Dao universe, it would only give him a slight boost in strength. In fact, the boost in strength was not great. Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  However, if he were to copy the level 7 and level 8 DAOs into his own, it would be a natural fit. He would be able to fuse them into himself, strengthen himself, and strengthen himself. It would not be borrowing power. It would be ... Something he possessed!If some of the great DAOs were strengthened to level eight or Level Seven, and some of the fifth or sixth level venerable sovereign's Dao were integrated into them, Li Hao might burst out with unprecedented power.Second cat also knew that this was a chance, a chance to completely gain a foothold.He didn't need to rely on anyone.Of course, he might need to rely on a cat.At this moment, it was also thinking hard and was somewhat conflicted. Should it copy?It was so difficult!It didn't have a clue, but gradually, it seemed to have a clue. If it was really the spirit of the great Dao ... That was to say, it had been a spirit from the beginning, and there was no such thing as completely descending into the world.Absorbing large amounts of the source of the world and the source of life could only be said to have perfected er Mao's body. It didn't mean that without the source of life, he was actually an inanimate object.Perhaps, in that state, it would be more suitable for him to replicate the great Dao.At that moment, second cat was faced with a choice.It looked at Li Hao and said,"I think I'm bound by this body ... Unless I give up this body, which is a level 7 body ... And return to my previous appearance. I'll see if I can replicate it. In that case, I'm not sure if I can create another body ..."In that case, it would lose its power of the seventh step, and Li Hao's side would have one less powerhouse of the seventh step.Was it worth it to bet on the right thing?If he gave up on his physical body, even if he devoured again, would he be able to recover to the seventh-rank?Could it be materialized again?Second cat wasn't sure.Li Hao frowned slightly. Second cat said,""I don't mind, but you have to consider it carefully. If I give up my current physical body, it doesn't matter if you have one less seventh-rank cultivator ...""It doesn't matter!" Li Hao exhaled.Second cat was speechless.It looked at Li Hao unhappily. I was just being polite, and you really said it was okay?You're so direct!Li Hao laughed."At most, I'll find another source of the world for you in the future. Now, do you still need to be afraid of not having any enemies?" It didn't matter if he tried. Besides, even if he gave up this body, would the source of the world completely dissipate? At most, I'll use up a part of it ... I'll give it a try. If I succeed, a rank seven is nothing, but if I fail ... I won't be short of you, a rank seven. "Second cat was depressed.Were these words still human words?"Then ... I'm really giving up?""Yes, hurry up."Second cat's eyes were unfriendly, and Li Hao didn't respect his seniors at all.He was too inhumane.At that time, in order to conjure this physical body, he had spent a lot of energy. He had even thought for a long time and experienced a lot of psychological struggle. He had to say goodbye to his teacher, and he had to do this and that ...Good fellow, now that it's your turn, all you can say is 'hurry up'?You're more of a dog than a dog!Although it was helpless and reluctant, it thought about it. It was right. It didn't lack opponents or enemies. At most, it could destroy a macro world and devour the macro world origin to recover ...With this thought in mind, it no longer hesitated. A large amount of life force overflowed from its body.And Li Hao didn't hold back. He didn't want to waste it.The origin of the world was not an energy that could strengthen one's strength, but it was a kind of vitality. It just so happened that he had consumed some vitality and lifespan when he traveled through time. At this moment, it was a good time to replenish himself.It was pretty good!A rank seven venerable sovereign's life force was enough to replenish his own.At that moment, second cat was a little angry. I'm not dead yet!"Even if you try to collect my source of life right now, just for show, and let me absorb it back when I fail to replicate it, it'll still be better than now.Good fellow, you just absorbed it?If this really isn't the Dao of duplication, are you not going to give it to me?As depressed as it was, second cat didn't say anything. It dissipated its life force and its aura declined ... Or it disappeared. At this moment, second cat seemed to have returned to the state it was when it had just been revived.His aura was very weak, and it was almost non-existent.It was at a critical point. It was as if one could sense the omnipresent Dao but could not completely understand it. At this moment, Li Hao was even more convinced that er Mao was the Dao spirit.He had been thinking about how er Mao was able to hide his aura. Now, he understood. Maybe he wasn't hiding it on purpose. For example, er Mao was actually here in the omnipresent Dao. However, if you wanted to see the essence of the Dao, you would have to have a deep understanding of the Dao. Otherwise, you could only know that it existed, but you might not be able to sense it.

3491 Chapter 565
All of er Mao's miraculous abilities could be explained by connecting it to the spirit of the great Dao.As for second cat, it didn't care about Li Hao anymore. It began to try to copy everything from its memory. Gradually, second cat felt strange. It had never thought that it would have such an ability, so it had never tried it.However, at this moment, it recalled everything about Li Hao and put itself in Li Hao's shoes. Gradually ... Its form began to change.It was as if they had returned to the day Li Hao was born.All of a sudden, the original cat gradually melted into dough and began to change. Li Hao's eyes flickered, and in the void, what appeared was no longer second cat, but ... A naked child.That's ... Me!Li Hao's expression was complicated. He had an indescribable feeling. A copy ... A complete copy?If there was no difference at all ... That would be too terrifying.Copying a Dao was a powerful Dao, but if he could copy it as he wished without any restrictions, then ... Wouldn't he be able to copy even time?That was impossible.If that was the case, if second cat really mastered the Dao of duplication, could it actually defeat all of them?Many thoughts appeared in his mind.And the child in front of him was also growing, from an infant to an infant, and gradually, to a teenager. He seemed to be following Li Hao's path. He began to practice martial arts, cultivate, absorb energy, and cultivate ...He was another Li Hao!Li Hao's eyes flickered. Could it be that second cat was also like this back then, passing off the fake as the real one, making people think that it was a projection of a big cat?It was almost impossible to distinguish the difference.The biggest difference was that back then, second cat and big cat had completely different personalities.There was a difference in temperament! Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  Later on, there were even some differences in strength. Otherwise, it would be almost difficult to distinguish between the real and the fake.The "Li Hao" in front of him was exactly the same as the one in Li Hao's memory. There seemed to be no difference. The only difference was strength. The "Li Hao" in front of him was still very weak, but he was growing."Meow?"At this moment, second cat seemed to come back to its senses. If it hadn't meowed, which reminded people of its identity, Li Hao would have doubted whether he could tell the difference between the two.And the meowing from "his" body was still very horrifying.At this moment, second cat was also shocked,"it ... It seems like it really can be done!"For some reason, it was immersed in Li Hao's past. Then, it changed naturally. It turned into Li Hao, as if it had become a second Li Hao.They became Li Hao's projection!As for Li Hao, he sighed and said,"I knew it!" So, back then, everything in the illusory space, even ... Including Zhan Tiandi, was only ... A part of the projection. It was a copy of you!"Second cat was stunned. It was stunned. 'I ... Copied it?'The teacher, actually ... Never existed?Li Hao seemed to understand. He explained,""Zhan Tiandi must have lived with you for some time, and you may even represent part of Zhan Tiandi's will! Because it has happened before, you can only reproduce it! Your Dao of duplication should require one to experience and sense before one can duplicate something. "Therefore, fragments of er Mao and Zhan Tiandi's life should have existed. Of course, in this fragment, if er Mao's original body was Dao Ling, it might not be Cang Mao, but Dao Ling and Zhan Tiandi who had lived together.Second cat was a little distracted. After a while, he said slowly,"Li Hao, so you're saying ... That I'm actually a teacher?"Li Hao nodded."That's what I think. You might even be the spirit of Zhan Tiandi's core great Dao!" Otherwise, it would be very difficult for Zhan Tiandi to quickly comprehend time. If he could replicate it, it would be much easier. "Second cat didn't know whether to be happy or sad. He was happy that he was a real living being.No matter what my nature is, I am a real existence.The sad part is that I'm not a cat?"Is there any disadvantage or difficulty in your copying?" Li Hao quickly asked.Second cat thought for a while and said, "It's not difficult to be immersed in it and treat me as you. The difficult part is that I can't completely replicate it. I've been immersed in it until now, but I failed when I reached the creation of the thousand territories ... I don't know if it's because I don't have enough energy or because there are too many great DAOs that I can't distinguish them one by one ... Unless you provide me with the energy of a thousand realms, I'll try again ..."Otherwise, it wouldn't have been able to replicate Li Hao 's.Energy was a problem."That's good!"Li Hao exhaled.If you're exactly like me, I'll even doubt if I'm Li Hao.At this moment, Li Hao was more concerned about something else."Can you fuse with me?"Second cat looked at Li Hao. Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"I don't mind if you don't merge with my body ..."Second cat was speechless!"The fusion of great DAOs. You use your energy, and I'll use mine as well. Let's see if our energy can be fused together!"Second cat muttered. It also minded, okay!Who would be willing to fuse with your body?Who Do You Think You Are? Two cats used the power of their great DAOs, and Li Hao did the same. The two powers of great DAOs were of different strengths. They touched in the void and ... Merged in an instant!They gathered into one and instantly exploded.BOOM!Li Hao's eyes flickered when he saw that he had almost used the power of a first stage venerable sovereign. Ermao's eyes also flickered, just like Li Hao 's.

It was stacked!It was a true layering!The two powers seemed to be one, and when they fused together, there was no sense of disharmony.Second cat was also shocked. He looked at Li Hao, who said, "It's really possible!""How could this be ... If that's the case, then ... I can even duplicate a type 9 spiritual beast?"Li Hao shook his head,"you don't have the ability!" You can't see the past of a rank 9, so you can't copy me completely. You can copy me because I've let you see my past ..."At this thought, Li Hao frowned."But that's all you can do for now. What I need now is for you to copy other people's DAOs into the same DAOs as mine ... Not for you to copy them!""Also, can you duplicate powerhouses of the eighth step?"If he couldn 't, he could only choose the weak.Li Hao pondered for a moment and said, Silver moon's Dao is all in the great Dao universe ... It's too troublesome to replicate them one by one. Since it's of the same origin as me, I can bring the entire Silvermoon universe into my system and merge it into one ...""You want me to change the nature of the Silvermoon universe, not turn me into it, right?" second cat was confused."Yes."Li Hao nodded."It doesn't matter if you change your form. You're just a cat. There's a limit to how strong you can be."Second cat scratched his head. Could this be done?Would it work?"Then wouldn't I need to understand the structure and origin of the Silvermoon universe, and even pry into the universe's memories to be able to do it?""It's possible. ""What about a universe that isn't Silvermoon ... And a stronger one?"Wouldn't that be better?Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"Silver moon's Dao is more compatible with mine. I originate from him, so it'll be easier. Silver Moon is not strong himself. He only has a few level six venerable sovereigns, and my master is the only Level Seven venerable sovereigns. However, with so many of them, their combined power is still very terrifying. Furthermore, they have two Dao universes. If they completely merge with my Dao, they might be able to increase my power by a thousand Dao."He looked at second cat and said,"you should return to your cat form!."It was very awkward for this fellow to take on his appearance and talk to himself.Second cat rolled its eyes. Li Hao was also very depressed. This is how I look. Don't roll your eyes like that. People who don't know might think I'm the one.Soon, second cat returned to his cat form.It was more used to looking like a cat. Even at this moment, it still believed that it was the Dao spirit of the Dao of duplication. However, it still felt that it was a cat. Too many years had passed, and it was impossible to change it in a short period of time.After returning to his cat form, second cat was used to it. He asked curiously,"You mean you want me to change the form of other people's great DAOs so that I can completely fit with you, so that you can deal with those powerful venerable sovereigns?""Yes,""Then, will these people be completely assimilated by you in the end?""Have I become one with you?" second cat was a little uneasy.It looked at Li Hao, wanting to know the answer.This was actually very dangerous!If Li Hao was greedy, this might be a huge shortcut. If the others 'DAOs were of the same origin as Li Hao' s, then ... Then Li Hao could directly devour their DAOs and turn them into his own, quickly accumulating ten thousand DAOs.Although it was weak, after completing the accumulation of 10000 DAOs, he could officially walk towards the Dao of time.It wasn't like he hadn't finished accumulating it yet."Do you think I will?" Li Hao smiled.Second cat shook his head.It didn't think Li Hao would, but ... People were fickle!If Li Hao really felt the benefits and turned other people's Tao into his own, and he could even completely integrate it and comprehend thousands of great DAOs at once, would he still be able to maintain his original intention?Even if Silvermoon's ten thousand DAOs weren't perfect enough, he could still pick a few thousand that were considered decent, right?For Li Hao, how much time could he save?But at this moment, Li Hao smiled."Alright, it won't be like this. Besides, other people's Dao is their Dao after all. Even if you copy and change it, it's still their Dao in essence. If I really had such thoughts, I would have focused on cultivating time. Time and Stars have never been completely compatible with me ... I have all the DAOs in it!"This cat had become more scheming.Perhaps it was influenced by him?In fact, Li Hao had not even completely cultivated time, let alone the way of the Silvermoon people. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  If he really had such thoughts, he wouldn't have given up on Silvermoon great Dao universe.Second cat was relieved and nodded his big head,""That's right...That's right, why would I think of that?"As he spoke, he looked at Li Hao. Although he didn't say it clearly, he was somewhat speechless and reproachful. It was all your doing. After seeing your past, I became you and was suddenly influenced by you. Clearly, Li Hao was a paranoid person.Li Hao chuckled and didn't care. At this moment, he changed his expression and laughed."Let's not talk about this anymore. This time ... We might give the enemy a surprise! Second cat, we'll be very busy ... No, you'll be very busy! If three rank eights couldn't be replicated, then forget it, he would just deal with the other rank eights! More importantly, everyone else has to become my Dao!"Second cat sighed.He had to work again.Moreover, this time, it might not be an easy task, but a very troublesome one.How many DAOs would he have to replicate?It could even be a copy of a universe!However, if he succeeded, that would be incredible.……At the same time.New martial.The human King was a little curious. Li Hao didn't come to him again. Did I scare him off by asking for a level 8 great world?It was very strange!Was that guy that stingy?You're already at death's door, and you still care about an IOU?"Old Zhang ... Do you think he'll be in trouble this time?"He looked at the Grandmaster, who nodded slightly."There will definitely be! Not just him, but us too!"The human King raised his brows slightly.Zhi Zun said softly,"if the enemy wants to deal with him, they'll definitely deal with new martial arts. Extreme Ice and the others ... Perhaps they're secretly forming an alliance. The establishment of Li Hao's heavenly Daoist sect is a time when new martial arts is in danger. Whether we can stand firm ... It's not just a test for Li Hao. It's a test for us too! Success, Eastern Overlord, failure ... Silver Moon is gone, and my neo martial will be hard-pressed to survive!"The human King frowned slightly."Do you think the three overlords will personally take action?""Most likely not. At this stage, they're still at the ceiling. Once they attack, it might cause a three-way war and expose their real strength! Therefore, they'll be hiding their actual strength, but they might send people to assist. "The human King remained silent.Even if the three overlords didn't make a move, it would still be troublesome this time. There were still 15 level eight venerable sovereigns in the East.If Samsara's people returned and a few more worked together ... There would be more than 20 rank eights!On his side, there were only four.Li Hao only had three.There were seven of them at the eighth step, and their opponents might be more than 20 of them.Even one against three might not be enough.The human King was a little displeased."You're bullying the weak and fearing the strong. You think that we've just appeared here and you're attacking us first?" These people from Extreme Ice were all a pile of loose sand! There's no need to be afraid. After killing one or two, I'm sure the rest will run faster than rabbits ... As for Li Hao, we might not be able to help him. If that happens, if Samsara doesn't come to me and goes to him instead ..."Or did he meet up with Silver Moon?That might be even more troublesome!But if it was Li Hao's turn, could the three of them, who had just advanced to level 8, stop him?Difficult!It was very, very difficult!The Supreme martial artist seemed to be deep in thought."Li Hao didn't come again. He only said that he wanted to try the three-body Fusion ... Perhaps he has some plans and doesn't need our help.""You think he can block it?" the human King laughed."I don't know,"The human King thought for a moment and nodded,'forget it, if I can't win, I'll just run ... I'm not afraid of losing face! It doesn't matter if you lose face, but your life is the key. With the power of time, if you can't beat him, there's still a high chance that he can escape!"The Grandmaster nodded and didn't say anything more.At this moment, he should consider the safety of the new martial artists. This time, the eastern rank-8 world would definitely be incited by the three overlords. Whether it was for his own sake or for some other reason, they would definitely attack the new martial artists.He had to kill a few of them to intimidate everyone. However, with so many rank-8s, killing a few of them would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens. If Fang ping had the time to think about Silver Moon, perhaps, he should think more about how he, a neo martial artist, would get through this.It wasn't that simple to establish a foothold in the East and become the Overlord of the East. In addition ... Long Zhan of the four-sided region might also emerge.The Grandmaster rubbed his head. This time, he might have to run away.

Chapter 3493 All Parties Preparing (1)
Chaos.Darkness was the mainstream of chaos.In the South.The reincarnation Emperor had just left the realm of spring and autumn. At this moment, he was accompanied by three rank eight venerable emperors. At this moment, the reincarnation Emperor's face was cold and emotionless.A month later, the heavenly Daoist Rite opened.Li Hao would completely open the heavenly Daoist Rite and let the eastern emperors enter the Dao discussion.Silver Moon King Li Hao.In everyone's eyes, Li Hao had always been a vassal of neo martial arts. However, after Li Hao killed di yang and Fu Sheng and gained control of time, he became Samsara's greatest enemy.Moreover, the other party had ruined his plan to kill the man king, which made him even more hateful.It was hateful and murderous!He had to be killed!The heavenly Daoist Rite was the foundation of condensing tens of thousands of DAOs. As a rank eight venerable sovereign, he knew very well that Li Hao could not be allowed to complete it, nor could he complete such a plan. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The human Emperor only wanted to unify the East, but Li Hao ... Had an even bigger ambition!He wasn't the only one involved in this matter. If Li Hao succeeded, the three overlords would be wary."Pengcheng!""Do you think spring and autumn will send help?" the Samsara Emperor suddenly asked.Beside him, the sovereign of the chaos race, rank eight Peng Cheng, said in a deep voice,""I will! Li Hao mastered the art of time! Everyone said that the Supreme Emperor of spring and autumn mastered the Dao of time and was the first and eighth level in the world! Spring and autumn is King, invincible among tier 8!""Now, there are new people rising in the east. He might not care about the new martial artist King ... But Li Hao, who also controls time, is definitely his biggest enemy!"Therefore, spring and autumn would definitely send people to help.The reincarnation Emperor pondered for a while and said,""You and I will work together. In addition to the many venerable sovereigns of my reincarnation realm, there are four rank eights and many rank Sevens ..."Is that enough?Logically speaking, it was definitely enough.Li Hao had three level 8s under his command, but he was not afraid of them even if they joined forces. Besides, even if he did not attack, the three level 8s were enough to suppress Li Hao's three level 8s.However, it was not enough.Therefore, he was still trying to rope in people from all sides.Not only that, he looked at Peng Cheng,""A genius like Li Hao must be killed in one strike! "We might not be able to delay neo martial's side in the ice and snow worlds. I think we need to solve it too! Therefore ... Daoist Pengcheng, I hope that huntian Supreme Emperor can send a few level 8 experts to help you!"Venerable Pengcheng frowned slightly.And send a level 8?Level eight was not a cabbages.There were more than 20 rank eights in the East. Naturally, the West was not too bad either. There were many rank eights, but a portion of them were enemies. Huntian was strong, but those rank eight venerable sovereigns were not willing to be ruled by others.And now, there was actually a type 8 Alliance in the West to defend against huntian. Apart from these, huntian Supreme Emperor had four level 8 subordinates. They were not considered weak and were very strong.Apart from him, there were three grade 8 experts.But they all had their own duties!They each had their own tasks.Unifying the West was the key to huntian's current goal. If they sent another grade 8 ... Not to mention what the Western monarchs would think, it would be very troublesome if something went wrong."Daoist Samsara," venerable sovereign Pengcheng said softly,"with our strength, if the new martial artists are held back, are we ... Still unable to take down Silver Moon? Even if no one comes to help, it should be enough, right?"Was he overestimating Silver Moon?"Time!""That's enough,"reincarnation Emperor said calmly. "Moreover, there are still some troublemakers in the East. New martial arts and long Zhan might have some unusual movements. Although long Zhan and Li Hao have a blood feud, long Zhan is an unpredictable person. It's not impossible for him to help Silver Moon.""There are four tier 8 powerhouses on the warring Dragon's side. The warring Dragon is even more powerful ... Silver Moon has three tier 8 powerhouses. If Li Hao is included, there are four tier 8 powerhouses as well!""Eight, including the neo martial artists, that's four. A total of 12 rank-8s!"Pengcheng's head hurt."Don't tell me that we need to mobilize 12 type 8 powerhouses. To be honest, at this stage, all the overlords have some type 8 powerhouses under their command. But if you want to talk about how many, it's possible. Even the strongest, huntian, only has four.Of course, including Samsara's three, that was seven.If he wasn't so unlucky last time, where 4 of the type 8 powerhouses were killed, that would be a total of 11 type 8 powerhouses.Such power was enough to shock the entire chaos.If di yang didn't die ... It would be even more terrifying. One could only imagine how useful huntian's rank nine title was. He had gathered more than ten rank eights, which showed how terrifying he was.But now ... There were only four of them.Even if the South and the North sent their powerhouses to help, each family only had one level 8 at most, six ...According to Samsara's plan, they needed to send out another six players to stabilize the situation!How could that be possible?Could the chaos heaven realm call six rank eights?It was possible, but huntian Supreme Emperor would not send out all his level 8 subordinates just to kill Li Hao, who was only Level 7."Daoist reincarnation ... If the Lord sends another rank 8 to help, there's still hope ..."In other words, there was no more."Samsara has been in the East for many years. Could it be that ... Daoist Samsara can't call any of your friends over?"You've been in the East for so many years!The reincarnation Emperor was extremely calm."This time, I've already informed and contacted all parties. This time, many level Sevens in the eastern land have agreed to help me. The master of level eight ... There are also people willing to help, but we may need to deal with the new martial artists!"

Chapter 3494 Preparations From All Sides (2)
"To deal with Silver Moon, we need to send at least six tier 8 experts ..." He continued."Li Hao is only at the seventh step!""Tier 7, he is also a Dao of time cultivator!"“……”Pengcheng was speechless.Just how afraid are you of him?Was there a need to?In his eyes, the human King was much more difficult to deal with than Li Hao. Last time, in order to kill the human King, they had joined forces but failed. This time, the human King was also a key figure. What was Li Hao to him?Last time, he had only helped the other grade 8s kill a few.He himself had not even reached the power of 2000 great DAOs.Such an existence was difficult to deal with even the weakest tier 8, so what was there to be afraid of?The reincarnation Emperor was still calm, but he was a little serious."I won't underestimate Li Hao, who is only at the seventh level. If he hadn't caused trouble last time, four eighth level venerable sovereigns wouldn't have died, and the human King wouldn't have escaped."Li Hao wasn't very famous.However ... She could not ignore his existence."This time, I even want chaos heaven Supreme Emperor to help ... Of course, I know the difficulties of chaos heaven Supreme Emperor, so I think ... There are still three level 8s in the chaos heaven realm. Now that they are known to outsiders, I think ... I want them to participate as well!"Three more!In addition to the four here, there were a total of seven.Even if there was at least one from the north and south, there would be nine!Nine rank eights and nearly 6000 Dao law reincarnations were enough to annihilate any expert.Venerable Pengcheng frowned.How could that be possible?"No matter what, Daoist Pengcheng," Samsara said."Please help me pass on my message. I hope that huntian Supreme Emperor will value the East!""The East has produced experts since ancient times. Tian Fang of the past, and even rumors say that the owner of the Thunder region came from the East! And now, long Zhan is also in the East. Since ancient times, the East has always been the place where overlords rise ..."Venerable Pengcheng frowned slightly."Long Zhan, the chaos race has come this far. Could it be that ... Daoist Pengcheng still doesn't feel anything?"Venerable Pengcheng's expression turned serious and he nodded,""I know long Zhan is very strong. I've met him once in the past. To be honest ..."He paused for a moment before saying,"this person is very charming!"The truth.If huntian Supreme Emperor had not stepped into level nine, to be honest, he would have wanted to go to the four-sided region and join long Zhan. He was a true Almighty!In order for the chaos race to rise up, they had actually paid a huge price. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  He really admired this person.However, the four-direction region was too small. Now, there was a ninth grade venerable sovereign. To join long Zhan was the same as seeking death.This person's heart was too big!"That's right. That's why we have to consider him. I suspect ... He's prepared for this. His goal isn't to help anyone, but to weaken everyone!" Reincarnation Emperor said with a serious expression.He saw long Zhan's goal clearly.Long Zhan wasn't helping anyone. He only wanted to weaken everyone. Whoever was weak would help whoever was weak. He didn't care about what Li Hao did, didn't care about the blood feud. He only cared about helping whoever was weak, and weakening the strong!This was the true dragon battle! An Overlord!The chaos race was the most ambitious Overlord that had been born over the course of countless years.What kind of hatred could compare to the rise of a race?Even Samsara felt that this person was terrifying.This time, he had to take them into consideration.Pengcheng frowned. He wasn't afraid of Li Hao, but he was afraid of long Zhan. After hesitating for a while, he said,""It's very difficult for all three of you to come! I'll think of a way to contact the Lord and ask for another grade-8 ..."One?Samsara frowned.To be honest, one was too few.Moreover, huntian only had four level eight venerable sovereigns?He didn't believe it.There must be more in the dark. No matter if they were scattered in various places or whatever, there must be more in the dark.It was impossible for there to only be four level eight venerable sovereigns!One had to know that the five elements realm already had five rank eights.Spring Autumn of the South was only a level 8, and he had three powerful level 8 existences under his command. Furthermore, there might be more in the dark. As a level 9, whether it was true or not, huntian was indeed much stronger than the other level 8 existences.Was that even possible?"At least two more!""I'll convey your thoughts to you, Daoist reincarnation ..." Venerable sovereign Pengcheng was silent for a moment."However, it all depends on my master. I can't give you any guarantees!""Sure!"The reincarnation Emperor nodded and looked to the East with a deep look in his eyes.The people from the four-sided domain were even more terrifying than he had expected.I have to make all the necessary preparations!"This time, I'm also the Overlord of the three forces, the vanguard to test the waters. These people, including huntian, actually don't treat themselves as one of their own. Their thoughts are very simple: internal strife in the East!He wanted to fight new martial arts, Silver Moon, and Dragon. Therefore, these people would help, but they would not put in much effort.However ... After a few exchanges, the Samsara Emperor was on high alert. He couldn't calculate these people based on their current strength. Otherwise, it would be like the last time when four rank eight venerable sovereigns died in an instant!The losses were extremely heavy.If it wasn't for the heavy losses last time, they wouldn't need to do so this time. With the help of four grade 8s, there would be more room.His thoughts kept flashing.Li Hao, Fang ping, long Zhan ...They were all difficult to deal with!Even if there were two of them, would eight tier 8 experts be enough?Who knows?No matter what, he had to stop them from unifying the East and Li Hao from establishing the heavenly Daoist sect. Otherwise, he would not be able to take revenge, and these guys would not let him go.……Four regions.

Chapter 3495 All Parties Preparing (3)
Tianfang world.Long Zhan, who was originally prepared to wait until tianfang recovered, looked at tianfang world and fell into deep thought.Beside him, several level eight venerable sovereigns were present.The red moon sovereign, after talking to long Zhan once, had become more relaxed. At this time, he said in a low voice,""News from the outside world says that Li Hao is building the heavenly Daoist Rite and perfecting the ten thousand Dao techniques! "Fang ping is currently unifying the East. Once they've completed it ... The four-sided region will definitely become a major threat to them!"He looked at long Zhan, somewhat apprehensive.Should he make a move?To stop him?Or let it go?Long Zhan was incomparably valiant and was also a powerhouse that could not be ignored in the East. Whoever ignored long Zhan would definitely suffer a backlash.This person, without making a sound, the strength of his subordinates was getting stronger and stronger.Today, he had several grade 8 subordinates and even more Grade 7.Before this, eight tier 8 powerhouses had attacked and suffered a great loss. One tier 8 had died, so one could imagine how difficult this fellow was to deal with.Beside him, Black Tiger gritted his teeth and said, Li Hao will die!He hated it!Hatred was also the motivation that supported him in reaching the eighth step.Feng Yan, who had also just advanced to level 8, also said in a low voice,""I ... I want to kill him!"Li Hao, the culprit who caused his mother's death.Although she usually didn't mention it, she was still mad with hatred.On the other side, the Qing Qiu sovereign, whose aura was still unstable and constantly jumping from Level Seven to level eight, also said softly,""Be it the human King or Li Hao, they're both scourges! The Dragon Lord might want to borrow their hands to weaken the outer reaches of chaos ... But it may also bring disaster to us ..."The black Tiger emperor snorted!Some of the words of the human race were somewhat out of place when it came to the chaos race.Raising a Tiger?Who was he talking about?The Qing Qiu Emperor was also speechless. I'm just used to it, but you're still being calculative, this guy.Of course, the key still lay in long Zhan.At this moment, long Zhan only looked at tianfang world silently and suddenly said,""Many venerable sovereigns in the outer realms have died ... In fact, this will speed up Tian Fang's return!"Everyone was silent.He listened quietly.Long Zhan continued."Whether it's Li Hao, Fang ping, or huntian and the others ... They're all our great enemies. They're all humans. They're all powerhouses. They're all dangers!""It doesn't matter who we help or not! Remember this, the only stand of the chaos race ... Is to oppose the human race!"There was no personal grudge, and it was meaningless.The biggest stand was the stand of the race.Long Zhan said softly,"I'll go out. You guys too! The only thing he had to do was wait! He would help whoever was weak! Eliminate the strong!" His eyes were cold and sharp,'there are too many type 8s in the human race, but how many are there in the primal Chaos race? Even in the outer domain, how many rank eight chaos beings were there? What about the human race? "Therefore ... What we need to do is to achieve balance! Don't think too much about personal grudges. For now, personal grudges ... Will not exceed the interests of the race!""The four-sided domain can be used to attack and defend. This is our greatest reliance!""This time, Li Hao established the heavenly Daoist sect ... To be honest, I admire him very much and feel that this heavenly Daoist sect suits my taste. However ... This time, I can't let Li Hao succeed. At the same time, I don't want Li Hao and the others to be killed at this moment!"He needed to consider when, how, who to deal with, and how to avoid revenge after he attacked."So ..." Long Zhan said softly,"this time, we will participate in Li Hao's all-heavens gathering. But ... Who we're dealing with, we can't be clear right now!""I think Li Hao's team must be even weaker ... So ..." Feng Yan couldn't help but say.She felt a little uncomfortable. Did this mean that she had to help Li Hao this time? All of a sudden, she felt a little unbalanced.Long Zhan actually thought so too. It was just that he was not 100% sure. At this moment, he said softly,""Anything is possible! Even if he helped Li Hao, he could eliminate Wu Shan, Dao Qi, and Thunderlord! I'm not saying that we have to protect them all ... Do you understand?"Feng Yan felt a little more at ease, but he was still a little angry.""Dragon Lord ... Li Hao is irreplaceable? How about we kill him and leave the Thunder Emperor and the others behind?"  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Those were all grade 8!Li Hao was only at the seventh step!Now, she had also reached level 8 and surpassed Li Hao. She wanted to take revenge."Li Hao ..."The Dragon Lord was silent for a while and slowly said,"killing him might cause some big trouble!"For example, Tian Fang!The experts of the Outlander domain had returned. Perhaps, in the eyes of the leader of the Outlander domain, would the return plan still go smoothly after Li Hao was killed?As for the master of tianfang, although he might not be able to return, did he really not leave behind any means?Was there really no way to stop it?A time path cultivator might be very important to the master of Tian Fang."Just listen to my orders. As for the rest ... There's no need to say anything else!" He said calmly."Understood!"Although Feng Yan was angry, she absolutely believed in the Dragon Lord. Since her father had said so, she had no objections.At most, he would let Li Hao live for a few more days!It would be difficult for Li Hao, who was at the seventh step, to reach the eighth step.And to surpass the Dragon Lord ... Just wait!……On this day, all the powers in the chaos were planning something.In the East.The world of Extreme Ice was also surrounded by eighth-tier great worlds. Due to the pressure from neo martial and silver Moon, they had no choice but to join forces.The eighth heaven.The 15 level eight venerable sovereigns had all arrived today, and the extreme Ice side had three level eight venerable sovereigns.

Chapter 3496 Preparations From All Sides_ 4
The one at the top was naturally Emperor extreme frost.At this moment, venerable Emperor extreme frost was also a little depressed and frowning. To be honest, 15 rank eight venerable sovereigns were invincible existences no matter where they went. However, he knew very well that in front of him, other than the three on his side, the remaining 12 rank eight venerable sovereigns were all very complicated.It could be people from the three overlords, or it could be an independent powerhouse, or even an ally of the warring Dragon Guild. As for whether there were people from neo martial or Silver Moon, the time for both sides to rise was too short, so the possibility was not high. The complicated situation gave the ice element venerable sovereign a headache.And now, the three overlords had sent their emissaries.It only meant one thing ... You should settle the chaos in the East yourself, and we won't interfere. However, it would be best if you could eliminate cancer like new martial arts and silver Moon. Moreover, they also supported the extreme Ice world and became the Overlord of the East!But ... How could it be that simple?Emperor extreme frost was silent for a while before saying,"You, Silver Moon Li Hao, want to form an alliance with the world to build the heavenly Daoist Rite. Have you heard of it?"Below, someone sneered,"you have a big appetite and great ambition!" But ... I don't think that's possible. Who would just sit back and do nothing? Moreover, he could cover the East, which was very fearsome ... If he could cover the East, what about the South? What about the North? What about the West? It's fine if he didn't expose himself ... But he's gone crazy and exposed his trump card. I think he's courting death!"Even if we don't kill him, the other three overlords won't just sit back and watch!This was digging a Foundation!"You created a Daoist field of the heavens, where ten thousand emperors gathered. Everyone exchanged their DAOs. Regardless of whether their DAOs improved or not, they were still a threat to the rulers!If I don't kill you, who should I kill?You, Li Hao, with the power of a tier 7 and only three tier 8 subordinates who had just advanced, dare to challenge the authority of the entire chaos? you must be tired of living!Emperor extreme frost was silent for a while before saying,"Now, all three sides have their own ideas ... Their intentions are clear. The East will make its own decisions! There are a total of 15 level eight venerable sovereigns in our realm ... Today, we are an Alliance and are extremely powerful. They hope that we can stop the new martial artists!"The 15 level 8 powerhouses were only there to stop them ... In fact, they looked down on the eastern Alliance.There were only four rank eights in the new martial arts.However ... Emperor extreme frost did not say to eliminate them. He only stopped them.To be honest, it was very difficult to exterminate them. Moreover, it required everyone's efforts. However, who was willing to risk their lives for this group of people in front of them?He knew all too well that this Alliance was loose.If they tried to stop him, they would have a higher chance."If we really want to work together, let alone stopping them, it'll be enough to annihilate the Joint Forces of neo martial and silver Moon!" Someone said.In other words ... Even if they were not United, it would not be a problem to stop them.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ "Neo martial and silver Moon are both arrogant ... Fellow Daoist Extreme Ice, I think we need to get rid of the cancer of the chaos. Since the three parties are willing to help, we naturally have no objections!""Right, I agree too!""They're too much of a threat!"“……”The venerable sovereigns spoke up one after another. Extreme Ice couldn't tell who was the one being supported by the three overlords, or who was truly afraid. However, at this moment, most of the venerable sovereigns spoke up in support. Extreme frost Thearch took a deep breath."Since no one has any objections, then when the heavenly Daoist Rite is established in a month ... All of us have only one goal, which is to stop the new martial artists from rescuing Silver Moon. With 15 tier 8 experts, even if it's four against one, I don't think it'll be a problem for us to work together to hold back the new martial artists, right?"Everyone nodded in agreement.This is very safe!Four against one, even the strongest human King would find it hard to match.What's the problem?But someone said rather fearfully,"I'm afraid that long Zhan will make a move!"Extreme frost Thearch nodded."I know ... But ... Even if long Zhan really makes a move, he may not help new martial. Of course, anything is possible. Send people to watch the movements of the four-sided region. If long Zhan and the others really leave the four-sided region ...""At most, we'll deal with them together!" Extreme frost monarch gritted his teeth.Even though he said that, he was still a little afraid.Long Zhan was too strong.Everyone nodded again, each with their own thoughts. Anyway, they were most likely going to help out this time. They might not be willing to fight a real bloody battle, but if they had more people and less fighting, they could delay it!Also, the middle world Alliance ... Was nothing!They were just a few rank seven venerable sovereigns!Among them, there were even some people who were planted by them, so they were not afraid at all.He could completely ignore the middle world Alliance.……On this day, all parties came to a decision.Sh * t-stirrer, he had to be eradicated!Be it the human King or Li Hao, they were both trash that had to be eradicated!……Alliance City nine.At this moment, rank seven venerable sovereigns from all over the world were gathered.Among them, there were also venerable Emperor myriad transformations, venerable Emperor Wanqiu, several other seventh-rank venerable emperors, and even some peak sixth-rank venerable emperors.At this time, a seventh level venerable sovereign's face turned ugly.""I think ... We'd better watch from the side and stay out of this. After this ...""After?" myriad transformations Emperor asked in a deep voice. If we really succeed and you stay out of it, do you think that venerable Emperor Hao Yue will really be willing to share the profits with us after the matter is over, even if he's easy to talk to?""But I can't just throw my life away, can I?"The seventh level venerable sovereign who had spoken frowned and said,""I've already received some news. Myriad transformation, this time ... It's best that we don't get involved. To be honest, I didn't expect to succeed in the beginning, and I didn't think that the scale would be so big. At that time, I thought that there were actually benefits on a small scale. Myriad transformation, you might take the opportunity to enter level eight ..."

Chapter 3497 Preparations From All Sides (3)
But now, the enemy had actually covered the East!This was terrifying.It would be strange if they didn't hit you at this moment!This Silver Moon King was too arrogant and too high-profile. This made them very worried. No one wasn't afraid of death, and at Level 7, they were even more afraid!As for myriad transformations Emperor, his face was cold."Wealth comes from danger. I don't care what you do. This time ... Is my chance to reach level 8! "I've been stuck at Level Seven for far too long. Perhaps the Emperor discourse this time ... Will be my chance to officially step into level eight! "Even my dream of reaching the ninth rank has a glimmer of hope ... I can't give up. I don't care about you, and I don't want you to die with me. But now, I've paid too much for the heavenly Daoist sect. I've gone bankrupt and paid everything ... If I fail this time ... Not to mention the ninth rank, even my dream of reaching the eighth rank will be shattered ... So, whoever breaks my Dao, I will ... Kill!"He, who had always been calm and collected, was furious today.His eyes were filled with killing intent.He looked at the other venerable sovereigns, gritted his teeth, and said coldly,""I don't care if you attack or not! However, whoever dares to mess around and cause trouble, even if I can't defeat those level 8s...It's enough to kill you all!""Fellow Daoist myriad transformations, you've gone too far. We'll go through thick and thin together ..."Myriad transformations Emperor remained silent.You really think I don't know?"There must be pawns from other factions among you. Everyone is publicly acknowledged to be strong. Don't treat anyone as a fool!At this moment, he had also made up his mind.He would kill whoever broke his Dao, even if he had to pay a great price.As for Li Hao, whether he could resist it or not ... He wasn't sure, and it wasn't easy to judge. The danger was great, but the arrow was already on the bow and had to be released!At this point, he had no way out.……If the chaos monarchs could see it clearly, so could Silvermoon.The Masters of the arcane realms and those who wanted to participate in the meeting, even if they didn't know at first ... As the chaotic aura became more intense, some overjoyed venerable sovereigns gradually calmed down and felt a little nervous.Fortunately, it was only a spiritual body.It wasn't his main body!If it was the original body, most of the venerable sovereigns would not have come this time. It was too dangerous. However, it was only a spiritual body. If they really encountered such a situation and their spiritual body was destroyed, they could see a large number of high-level venerable sovereigns participate in the battle ... To be honest, it was worth it.Therefore, those who should participate and those who wanted to participate had some ideas. If they failed and their spiritual bodies were destroyed, it would be worth it if they could see a group of top powerhouses fighting.Apprehension, uneasiness, melancholy, and all sorts of complicated emotions spread through the entire chaos.It was very complicated to hope for Li Hao's success, but at the same time, feel that it was impossible.They hoped to give the middle and low-ranked venerable sovereigns a chance. They wanted to give all the venerable sovereigns in the primal Chaos a chance. They wanted to have a huge platform for them to communicate. It was too rare. Ten thousand emperors had gathered together. Such a Grand occasion had never happened before! But ... How could three level 8 experts fight against so many enemies?……On Silvermoon's side.At this moment, second cat was still duplicating the entire great path universe. Very few people knew about it.The lightning Emperor and the other rank-8s also felt that a storm was brewing.The Thunder Emperor was an impatient person. In fact, he could bear with it. Otherwise, he would not have survived in the Dragon field for decades. However, this time, he also felt an unprecedented sense of crisis.At the place where Li Hao was in seclusion.p The Thunder monarch and the others had arrived. At this moment, the Thunder monarch's face was solemn."Fellow Daoist li ... In recent days, there have been many people who have been sending me messages, hoping that I ... Can leave the Silvermoon camp. Not only me, but also Wushan, Dao Qi, and all the other fellow Daoists have had such experiences. They are all nobodies, but these people dared to let a tier 8 cultivator leave without any fear ... Clearly ... This time, it is very dangerous!""If we really can't do it, let's give up!"The Thunder monarch said in a deep voice,"where there is life, there is hope!" I know that the heavenly Daoist Rite is very important to you, but ... It's too dangerous. It's safer for us to avoid it!"Wu Shan also sighed,"fellow Daoist li ... I can see ... A dark future!" The darkness ... Is boundless!"He saw fate!The future would be very dangerous.Dao Qi didn't say anything, but he was also helpless and dejected. He had thought that this was an opportunity for Li Hao to become stronger, but now, he was about to fail before he even started.It was too unbearable.For this, he had worked so hard to teleport to different places and even spent some of Silver moon's accumulated wealth, yet ... He was going to fail.He had originally thought that he would be able to cover it up for a period of time.Whoever knew that before he succeeded, the news had spread and the entire Primal Chaos knew. He cursed in his heart and couldn't help but grumble,""The middle world Alliance is too unreliable. If I had known, I would have prepared in secret! Slowly, we'll form a secret alliance ..."These guys were too unreliable.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  Although he had such plans, he had never succeeded.It had only been a few months, and chaos already knew about it. It really made him speechless.At this moment, Kong Ji was also extremely solemn."Go all out! If they failed this time, it would be very difficult to set up another one! This time, if Samsara attacks, we'll ... Fight them to the death!"He was so calm that he didn't have much hope. However, he didn't want Li Hao to give up, either. This was his only chance.Silver Moon had fought many tough battles, but this kind of Public Enemy, or rather, Public Enemy of the Overlord, was rare. In the past, everyone was concerned about neo martial, not Silver Moon.

Chapter 3498 Preparations From All Sides (1)
This time ... The neo martial artists 'fight for hegemony in the East was actually just a side effect. The key was that they couldn't let Li Hao succeed, because it was a threat to their dominance!This was the core!This was the first time he had become an absolute core member, but it was also an absolute danger. This made him feel very helpless.As expected, it was not easy to be the core.In the past, neo martial had always been at the forefront, but this time, Silver Moon was The Public Enemy, and neo martial was only secondary.On the other side, monarch Senlan didn't say anything.At this point, he had nothing to say.The other Silver Moon venerable sovereigns did not have much say as this was the battlefield of high-leveled venerable sovereigns.At this moment, Li Hao was silent for a while before he slowly said,""Fellow Daoists ... This time, we're in grave danger! I know what I'm going to face. Fellow Daoists, you've helped me a lot. I won't stop anyone who wants to leave .... I'm not trying to hit you when you're down, I'm ... Making a wise choice!"He looked at the crowd and said softly,"all good things must come to an end. This time, I was determined to do it. I must persist and do it. I even overestimated myself and tried to stop the chariot with my Mantis's arms ... So, there is no need to be embarrassed. Nothing is more important than your own lives!""I might not die. I have time. I can escape. On the other hand, you guys ... Are in great danger!"Li Hao looked at them and said softly,"even if I leave, they're still my friends. Even if I don't leave, they're still my friends." Now ... While there's still time!"Everyone frowned.Kong Ji said in a deep voice,"I won't leave. Of course, I won't say anything for the three seniors. You and I know each other. I'm only at the 4th tier. Now that I've reached the 7th tier, I might not be able to help you, but I won't leave!"The three level eight venerable sovereigns also frowned.The Thunder monarch was a little unhappy."Fellow Daoist li," he said."If you think we're just afraid of death ... Then you're wrong! We hope that you can lay low for a while and rise again to preserve your strength. It's not that we're afraid!""If you insist ... I won't leave!"He said in a deep voice,"since fellow Daoist is still alive, I'm willing to fight alongside you!" We share the same goal. I've seen all kinds of danger in the Dragon field, and I've never compromised! It's just that ... It's a pity for you, fellow Daoist. In a few more days, who in this Hundun will be a match for you?"He thought highly of Li Hao. At this moment, he directly said,""I'll give fellow Daoist another ten thousand years, no, a thousand years. Fellow Daoist, you'll definitely sweep across the chaos! The chaos is vast. As long as you lay low for a period of time, you'll definitely be able to stir up trouble again!"Wushan also said softly, "I've left the clouds and become a disabled person. I want to be free ... In fact, I don't want to participate in the hegemony of the world. If fellow Daoist is like neo martial and aspires to dominate the East, I may leave ... But this time, I hope that the heavenly Daoist temple will be established. This is a very good platform for everyone to discuss the Dao together without any scruples. Identity is not important, strength is not important ... In fact, many people in the chaos hope for such an occasion, such an opportunity ... I will not leave even if fellow Daoist insists!"He desired freedom and was not willing to fight for anyone.What does the fight for hegemony have to do with me?But ... No matter what Li Hao's original intention was, the battlefield of the heavens he had established was not a weapon for hegemony, but a key system for the progress of the great Dao in the entire chaos. He was willing to contribute to it.Dao chess was much more straightforward."I'm a monarch weapon ... I only have a dream, to no longer be a monarch weapon. In fact, I want to become an existence of the same level, not a weapon in anyone's hands ... When I was beside the master of Tian Fang, I didn't see such hope. Even if he was invincible in the world, he only had one punishment for me ... He didn't need me anymore, he hoped that I could be used by others, becoming the key to everyone's enlightenment of the Dao.""He's an amazing person, but he ... He considered many people, but he didn't consider me ...""I'm sorry," Dao Qi said self-deprecatingly,"and fellow Daoist Li Hao ... You ... Might ... Give me some hope."Everyone had their own reasons and thoughts, but they all firmly believed that they would get the result they wanted.Forest orchid master didn't respond.When he saw Li Hao looking at him, he suddenly smiled."Don't look at me like that ... I've only just entered Level Seven. That's one thing. Two, my forest orchid realm is gone. Fellow Daoist, you've really screwed me over. If I leave this time, it'll be a big loss for me! Third, since fellow Daoist is so insistent, it's impossible that there's no hope at all. I don't believe that fellow Daoist doesn't know the situation. Since that's the case ... What's the harm in trying?"Li Hao laughed in spite of himself, and the others were also slightly stunned. Kong Ji couldn't help but say,""You ... Do you still have other tricks up your sleeve? Could it be that neo martial arts will help?"Li Hao shook his head."It's difficult for the new martial artists. It's already good enough that they can protect themselves.""That ... Could it be ... Long Zhan?"Li Hao laughed again."That guy ... Might take action to balance the forces, but he definitely won't appear when I'm facing a powerful enemy. That would be overestimating him and treating him like a Saint!""Then ..."Kong Ji didn't understand. You still have tricks up your sleeve? "Ninth-rank borrowed force?"Li Hao shook his head."Then I'm really courting death. I almost died by borrowing the strength of a pseudo-rank seven."Ninth-tier borrowed force!Not to mention that I can 't, even if I can, why would I send myself to death? I really can't afford it!He smiled and said,'you ... Will know soon! This time, it was a crisis, but it was also an opportunity. Since everyone was not leaving, then ... Let's wait together! The day the heavenly Daoist sect is established ... Will be the day I, Silver Moon, and all of you will become famous in the chaos!"Li Hao smiled. At this moment, he was smiling brightly."This time, I'm going to let all the heroes of chaos know that I, Li Hao, didn't rely solely on new martial arts to walk out of Silver Moon and reach where I am today ..."As he said this, he suddenly felt a lack of confidence and mumbled,""It's definitely not just by relying on neo martial arts ... It doesn't include fighting. "“……”Everyone was speechless.What do you mean by that?Don't tell me that a battle that has been dead for so many years can still help you?At his peak, he was only at the sixth step.As for Li Hao, he was also a little embarrassed. If he had to fight to duplicate the great Dao, he would have to rely on a fight this time. However, he didn't have the confidence to say such harsh words. It seemed that he wasn't thick-skinned enough!This was awkward!Li Hao laughed and looked at the chaos. After a long time, he laughed again."This time ... I'll let all the forces in the chaos know that I, Li Hao, am no weaker than a human King!"“……”Everyone was speechless again. You ... Don't say such harsh words.Was this guy really confident?Although they were not sure, they felt more at ease at this moment. Yes, at ease, and so did the level eights. Although Li Hao was not as domineering as the human King, when Li Hao was full of confidence, they also felt that he was confident.He was more reliable than the human King.As for Li Hao, he was silently sensing second cat's location. Could second cat ... Quickly complete the duplication of the Silver Moon myriad Dao?'Don't waste time. Of course, if you really do ... Then I'll have to think of a way to delay time. '……At the same time.From all directions, countless experts were silently watching this side.In fact, in the depths of the primal Chaos, in unknown place, a group of sculptures had people opening their eyes. Countless worlds appeared in their eyes as if they were also observing.The cultivators of the Dao of time ... Seemed to be in danger.In the center of the statues, the largest statue did not open its eyes, but it was secretly watching everything.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ This time ... Was Tian Fang going to return?Time Dao cultivators ... Were they really going to die this time?Some thoughts appeared in his mind.

Chapter 3499 The Dissipation Of Time (1)
Time slowly passed.The chaos had no time.It was only a month. To chaos, it was a very, very short time. It passed in the blink of an eye.The chaos was frighteningly quiet this month.Although the chaos had always been very quiet, there had been constant battles in the past few days, and grade 8 experts had shed blood. Now, in a month, even the turbulent East had become strangely quiet.At this moment, not to mention advanced venerable sovereigns, even middle and low-stage venerable sovereigns could feel the storm coming!……The 1000th secret realm was completed.After three days, you can be teleported to the heavenly Daoist sect.The news spread once again.The dojo system that covered the East was completely completed. Of the 1000 entrances, some were distributed among the cotton trees, some were in the chaos, and some were in the cities on deserted islands.The entire East was anticipating and waiting.At this moment, at the eastern edge.In a small world.The reincarnation Emperor had arrived.There was also an entrance to a secret realm here.The Guardian of this secret realm was a third rank venerable sovereign. At this moment, his face was full of respect and humbleness. He stood behind Samsara and said in a low voice,""My Lord, this is the entrance to the secret realm!"The reincarnation Emperor observed it for a while, but he didn't go too deep into it. After a brief look, he said calmly,""The entrance to the secret realm is only constructed by the myriad transformations Emperor's myriad illusions. The key is not this. The key lies in Li Hao's time!"Myriad transformations 'myriad DAOs illusionary realm was not bad, but it was only not bad.In fact, it didn't have much of an effect.He had known about this thing a long time ago, but he wasn't too interested in it because it was just a relatively independent small space.

Daoist Samsara, can you sense the location of the time core?" Lu Fan asked. He didn't sense it.Logically speaking, there should be a teleportation channel that could teleport, even if it was only a spiritual body. However, he had never discovered it.In fact, the reincarnation Emperor had been sensing it for a long time. He had a strength of nearly 6000 Dao, so he could vaguely sense it, but it was not very clear and very weak.When he heard this, he chuckled."As long as someone is teleporting, the commotion will be huge. When the time comes, even if we can't sense it clearly now, we will be able to sense it clearly. When everyone is teleporting in one direction, the commotion will be huge. When that time comes, we will be able to sense the power of 3000 to 4000 Dao laws."The current Li Hao wasn't too strong. Shi Guang was strong and well-hidden, but that wasn't enough.That was unless Li Hao strengthened time and reached a higher level in time Dao.Otherwise, it would be difficult to hide it from these top existences.Pengcheng nodded slightly.He then looked at the reincarnation Emperor and asked,""Then should we send our spiritual bodies through the teleportation, or ... Should we use our true bodies to find out the exact location and track it?"If a spiritual body went over, its combat power would be limited and it would not cause too much trouble, but it could still spy on the actual situation. If Li Hao's main body followed them, he was afraid that Li Hao's main body would be too far away to detect his exact location.As of now, there were some rumors about the exact location of Li Hao's group, but no one knew exactly where they were.It was said that it might be in the Alliance city's ninth city.But who could be sure that the guy was still there?"If we want to kill Li Hao, we'll have to investigate with our true bodies!"Samsara laughed. Then, she suddenly looked towards the South and laughed."We're following them. We're not fast ... But the faster ones are coming!"The voice fell.After a moment, Peng Cheng sensed some fluctuations, and his speed was extremely fast.It was unbelievably fast.It was as if everything in the world had come to a standstill and time and space had been torn apart. A low cry rang out, and the sound reverberated. In an instant, a great demon appeared.The monster had spikes all over its body, but it had a pair of wings.The South was the world of great demons.The Overlord Spring Autumn was also a demon.Peng Cheng belonged to the chaos race and was considered one with the demon race. At this moment, his expression changed slightly. He recognized this great demon. It was quite famous. It was a hummingbird Cloud Beast, a special kind of demon race.He was very small. Even though he had reached rank 8, he was only the size of an ordinary person. This was his true self!It was reasonable to say that the stronger a demon was, the larger their body would be. When a demon reached level eight, their body would be so large that it was beyond imagination.However, the other party was only this big.Venerable sovereign Feng Ming, on the other hand, was quite famous in the primal Chaos. His body was covered in extremely sharp and poisonous thorns, each of which was extremely deadly. There was once a precedent of a poisonous thorn killing a rank seven venerable sovereign!And this guy had countless poisonous stingers!He was also incredibly fast and had the ability to travel through space. He wasn't a space venerable sovereign, but his speed was beyond ordinary.It was fast, poisonous, sharp, and had the ability to create sound waves.Such an existence was a huge threat to any rank 8.Venerable Pengcheng's expression turned grave. This fellow's strength wasn't the best, but was roughly on par with his, with around 4000 Dao laws.However, venerable Pengcheng was clear that he might not be able to defeat Feng Ming.It wasn't that it didn't have enough power, but it wasn't as fast as the bee.This fellow was also known as the number one expert under spring and autumn.It was actually the buzzing!Peng Cheng thought to himself. This also meant that the spring Autumn Emperor placed great importance on this matter."Samsara, Pengcheng, I'm not late, am I?"The buzzing demon was not large in size and its aura was not strong, but at this moment, it gave off a fatal threat.
