He had crossed the heavenly chasm in one step!In an instant, it appeared beside Li Hao with a bitter expression. It was the bitterness of being killed by someone in the future, but it was also a helpless one, because the current him was borrowing the power of a certain moment in the future.It was an extremely complicated time power!At this moment, he merged into Li Hao's body, and his voice sounded in Li Hao's head.""Don't use this method anymore ... The drawbacks are too great. There might be a chance to remedy it once, but two or three times ... Extracting the power of the future will definitely be called at a critical moment, and not at any random moment when your battle intent is the strongest! This is the disadvantage of future self ... Fortunately, this is only one of the thousands of possibilities ... You have to be careful of the next explosion ..."As soon as he finished speaking, Li Hao suddenly felt his qi and blood surge, and countless sword intents suddenly appeared in his body, as if they were a dream.Future self!Bright moon sword!Countless thoughts and sword intents suddenly appeared in his mind ... Was this what he would comprehend in the future?It was somewhat unreal, somewhat illusory. However, the sword intent was really displayed.Countless stars appeared in the sky once again. A hundred, three hundred, five hundred ... Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  In an instant, thousands of stars gathered!A sword of a thousand DAOs!At this moment, Li Hao suddenly felt that he was infinitely powerful. He was so powerful that he could fight, or even ... Defeat, the two half-emperors who were coming for him?There were thousands of thoughts in his mind, but he suddenly felt infinite fear.In the future, there would be a moment where he would have all of his energy drawn away by the thousand swords ... And then be killed by the enemy!Was it like this?Even if he could get past today, he couldn't get past the next time?But ... That was still in the future!At this moment, Li Hao didn't say anything. He wanted to know if the thousand sword rays could match a pseudo-Emperor.He slashed out with his sword!A thousand stars converged, and the sword became one!"Kill!"A low roar shook the universe. A sword was thrust out, and its killing intent shook the sky. This sword went straight for li daoheng.The man with the sword on his back slashed out with his sword as well, carrying with it the power of the longevity sword will. When the two swords collided, Li Hao's body trembled violently. The illusionary power seemed to be not solid enough, and it dissipated in an instant.As for the man with the sword on his back, his sword Qi trembled and his long sword was shattered. He retreated a few steps and his arm exploded, blood flowing everywhere!His eyes revealed a hint of surprise!Zheng Yu's expression also changed slightly. Li Hao, who was at the fourth level of Dao integration, had suddenly become much more powerful. According to the power of the new Dao, this sword strike was at least at the eighth or ninth level of Dao integration!Only those at the eighth or ninth level of the Dao integration realm might be able to match a half-Emperor or even win by a small margin."The power of time!"Zheng Yu murmured and became even crazier! Was this the power of time?He didn't hear what the future Li Hao said, and even if he did, he wouldn't care. He only knew that Li Hao, an early-stage Heavenly King, had absorbed the power of time, fused the past and the future, and burst out with the power of a half-step Emperor!It was unbelievable!Zheng Yu didn't say anything. He lashed out with his whip, shattering the heavens and earth, and charged straight at Li Hao!Li Hao's expression changed slightly.The illusionary power ... Wasn't condensed enough. Moreover, after one exchange, some of it actually leaked out. This meant that this power wasn't really integrated into his body. Even if he could fight a half-step sovereign, it would only be a matter of a moment.His heart skipped a beat. Without saying anything, he turned and ran. He reached out and grabbed the star of time, which seemed to be leaving too ... But at that moment, Li Hao used the river of chaos as a path and led the star of time into the depths of the universe!The time star was a little curious. The next moment, the long river seemed to have taken root in a barrier and could not move forward!Behind him, the two half-step sovereigns were madly chasing after him at an unbelievable speed!This speed was unimaginable.Li Hao's eyes flickered with golden light. At this moment, he saw something. At the end of the world, there seemed to be a wall, and on the wall, there were countless roots.This was his spiritual universe!The sword tree was the wall of heaven and earth, rooted in the barrier of the void Dao universe. At this moment, Li Hao no longer turned around to deal with the two half-emperors. He knew that he might be able to fight them now, but his strength was continuously being drained!In the end ... There was a high chance that he wouldn't be able to kill these two people. Moreover, it was very likely that he would be killed by these two people as his power dissipated.Now that he had powerful strength, he could do something.In an instant, the sword pierced through the barrier between heaven and earth, and the sky cracked!He seemed to have unlocked something!The swordsman didn't expect this at first, but a moment later, he sensed a familiar aura, and his expression changed!At the same time, Li Hao broke through the barrier with his sword. He turned around and swung his sword. Startled, time star no longer stayed and ran along the hole in the sky. It was all the same to him anyway.Be it the reality Dao universe or the void Dao universe, they were all connected to it.It was just two sides!Time and Stars instantly entered the void Dao universe!The sword-bearing man's expression changed and he shouted coldly,""How audacious!"Damn it!At this moment, Li Hao stepped into the depths of the void and headed straight for the void Dao universe.If I don't have the guts, how can I deal with you?Zheng Yu didn't even look at it ... He had vaguely sensed some problems ... But at this moment, he couldn't care less.To him, be it the truth Dao universe or the void Dao universe, any universe would do. He was not a controller anyway, so he could go to any one of them. As long as it was a true great Dao universe, he would not lose out!Furthermore, the time and star sphere had entered ... This was what he was most concerned about.

Chapter 2381 One Peach Kills Three Soldiers (3)
In an instant, Zheng Yu followed the passage and directly entered it!,m In that instant, he knew that this was not a truth Dao universe, but a void Dao universe.Behind him, the sword-carrying man's expression was ashen. However, he could not ignore this now. He had to return and force these two people to retreat. He had to think of a way to seal the void Dao universe. With a loud shout, he slashed out with his sword!BOOM!With a loud bang and a miserable cry, the sword tree was suddenly cut down by countless roots."Sword tree!" The sword-bearing man snorted.At this moment, he had completely seen through everything. Damn Li Hao, he had used the sword tree as a root to take root in the barrier of the void Dao universe. Damn it!He could no longer care about the screaming sword tree and cut off all its tentacles with one strike. In an instant, he entered the void Dao universe.He had to get rid of these two guys as soon as possible!Otherwise ... It would be a big problem!He also instantly disappeared!The three great experts entered the void Dao universe at the same time.……Void Dao universe.There were fewer stars than Li Hao 's, but each star was full of mystery. Li Hao glanced at them and found that they also looked like a greatsword.The moment the three of them entered, the sword seemed to transform into a person. The next moment, the huge sword transformed into a human face. It was li daoheng!At this moment, li daoheng was quite calm. He glanced at Li Hao's group and then at the escaping time star. He disappeared in an instant, chasing after the star!This, perhaps, was the true self.Behind him, Zheng Yu was also in a mad pursuit. A cold look appeared in his eyes, and he gritted his teeth and roared in a low voice,""This should be mine, li daoheng. If you dare to stop me, I'll break this Universe Today and leave you with nothing!"What killing Li Hao ... Li Hao wasn't important!The most important thing was this star!Besides, this was li daoheng's territory. If he killed Li Hao now, he would give li daoheng an opportunity.The man with the sword on his back held his sword and attacked!"Get out!" He shouted angrily.Zheng Yu and Li Hao actually came in. Damn it, bastards! Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  Although the star was extremely mysterious, Li Hao could vaguely see it now. Although the star's speed was unimaginably fast ... In the eyes of a pseudo-Emperor, there were still some traces.His expression changed slightly ... He couldn't have really been caught, right? If that was the case, it would be troublesome!Then, he looked at the man with the sword on his back and Zheng Yu, who were fighting in the universe. In an instant, the sky collapsed and the earth cracked, and the universe shook.Li Hao suddenly fled and stabbed his sword into the universe!This sword was extremely powerful!Kachaa!The air trembled. At this moment, Li Hao was extremely powerful. Li Hao said coldly,""Open up a passage for me and let me out ..."In an instant, a black hole appeared under his feet!It was for the best that Li Hao was willing to leave. At this moment, li daoheng didn't have the mood to care about him. Not only that, li daoheng's voice echoed throughout the universe."Zheng Yu, this is my territory! When Li Hao leaves, he will definitely kill those Heavenly Kings and take over Hurricane city ... Since you're all alone here, why don't you leave with him ..."Zheng Yu did not even listen. In an instant, in the entire Phantom Dao universe, many stars suddenly exploded, turning into tiny Zheng Yus that surged towards him, and countless Phantom DAOs fused into his body!Zheng Yu's aura grew stronger. His long whip pierced through the universe in the blink of an eye. He disappeared from his spot and headed straight for the distant stars!What Heavenly King?What Hurricane city?"Today, taking this star will be my greatest opportunity. Only then can I get rid of li daoheng. Otherwise, if li daoheng takes it away, it'll be the time of my death!"At this moment, the two of them had completely understood Li Hao's thoughts.But ... Even if they knew, they couldn't care about that.Zheng Yu, who was far away, shouted sternly,"Li Hao, you'd better not leave!" Help me block that sword principle clone for a moment! Otherwise, this is the void Dao universe, li daoheng's territory. Once I'm defeated by him, he will be able to seize Time and Stars today ... And you will die soon! Your plan succeeded ... But it also failed. You bastard, you're simply a bastard, you're short-sighted!"Even if he killed a few Heavenly Kings and seized Hurricane city, this planet was lost, especially now that it was still in the void Dao universe ... His death date would not be far!Li Hao stepped into the passage without looking back. His voice was cold."So ... Senior Zheng must stop him from succeeding! Once li daoheng successfully seized the time and star, the heart of the great Dao would control the complete great Dao universe and the power of time. Li daoheng would be comparable to a venerable sovereign even if he wasn't one! When that time comes ... It will be the time of our deaths!"Zheng Yu was furious!"Is it worth it for you to kill a few Heavenly Kings? Li Hao, if you want to kill them, why don't I give them to you to kill if you successfully seize the star?"Don't you know what the key is?Li Hao had already left.At this moment, li daoheng's voice resounded throughout the virtual Dao universe.""Zheng Yu, Li Hao has left. At this moment, the world is still shrouded by the great path of the universe. I'll give you a chance to leave and return to Hurricane city ... Otherwise, you'll die Here!"Zheng Yu's expression was cold."Li daoheng, do you think I'm afraid of you?"BOOM!A powerful aura instantly covered the entire heaven and earth. Zheng Yu's aura instantly rose by 30%. The blood Qi on his body was turbulent, and the universe was trembling. His eyes were cold."Since Li Hao has left ... We'll get serious! If you want to take the time star, you have to ask for my permission first!"

He turned around and threw a punch, shattering the heavens and earth. The sword-carrying man struck out with his sword, but it instantly trembled and shattered into pieces.Zheng Yu's expression turned cold,'you want to kill me with just a clone? Li daoheng ... You're talking nonsense!"He broke through the void and instantly rushed to the end of the universe.Today, even if he couldn't seize the time star, he definitely couldn't let li daoheng do so!Li Hao ... You're ruthless!You even dared to expose this star. No wonder you were so sure that li daoheng and I wouldn't care about you. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  ……At the same time.Li Hao appeared in the outside world.At this moment, his body was illusionary and his strength was constantly flowing out. His future power was overflowing. Li Hao sighed. If he stayed in this state, he might be able to fight a pseudo-Emperor for a moment, but ... What was the point?Since that was the case, he might as well do something more meaningful.While he still had strength!In an instant, he disappeared from the spot.Hurricane city.At this moment, as Time and Stars disappeared, the world in Hurricane city shook. Everyone had returned to normal. The Heavenly Kings were terrified, but what about Zheng Yu?They had vaguely seen Zheng Yu rush out at that moment, but he had been sealed afterward. At this moment, they couldn't see Zheng Yu at all. In the sky, only two bright moons were still there, and they were also awakening.Just as they were panicking, a figure suddenly flashed over.​ "Li Hao!"A fierce roar resounded through the world. A Heavenly King turned pale with fright. Why was Li Hao here?Where did Zheng Yu and Li daoheng go?As for Li Hao, he instantly slashed out with his sword. This attack was incomparably powerful, piercing through the heavens and earth. The sword of a thousand DAOs descended, and with a loud boom, the ancient city shook. The defensive barrier around it was instantly shattered.A Heavenly King-level monster plant trembled and shouted in fear,""Escape ..."Hurricane city trembled!However, at this moment, Li Hao reached out and grabbed. Heaven and earth seemed to be sealed, and a tremendous force pressed down. The next moment, the universe of the great path seemed to have descended!The entire city was directly grabbed into the great path universe by him with great power!The seven Heavenly Kings rose into the air. One of them roared,""Fight! Battle! Battle!""Kill him! Otherwise, we'll all die!""Hold on! Wait for the Lord to return! The Lord won't die! Hurry!"The seven Heavenly Kings all erupted. At this moment, they knew that they could not escape and could only fight. The seven Heavenly Kings were not weak. Even if Li Hao was strong, he could still fight.Not only that, the seven Heavenly Kings also roared,""Moon goddesses, Empyrean gods, join the battle! If you don't fight, Li Hao will definitely kill you if we die!"The two moons both had the power of a Heavenly King.With the nine Heavenly Kings working together, even if Li Hao was unparalleled at the moment, he could definitely stop him, if not kill him.None of the seven Heavenly Kings had the confidence to stop Li Hao. It was clear how much pressure Li Hao had put on them these days. In the sky, two bright moons rose.On the moon, two figures appeared. One was the Queen and the other was the moon god.The moon goddess was incomparably cold, while the Queen was trembling in fear ... Zheng Yu and Li daoheng had really been taken away by Li Hao. It was too terrifying.As for joining forces with the seven Heavenly Kings to kill Li Hao ... It seemed to be a good decision.However, in an instant, the bright moon where the Queen was instantly fled.She did not know why she wanted to escape.She didn't know what use it would be if she escaped ...However, she just wanted to escape.The pressure Li Hao gave her was too great!Li daoheng and Zheng Yu left when they were told to. The two half-step sovereigns were at Li Hao's mercy, so how could she join forces with these Heavenly Kings to deal with Li Hao?Yueshen was slightly hesitant. These Heavenly Kings were not on the same side as her.While she was hesitating, Li Hao's sword pierced through heaven and earth. The river of time seemed to flow in this sword. At this moment, he seemed to transform into the future Li Hao, who had experienced the vicissitudes of life and was filled with killing intent!As the sword struck out, a Heavenly King's expression changed drastically. He roared,""Kill!"The seven Heavenly Kings attacked one after another, and the powerful force swept across the entire universe.He could only resist!If he didn't resist now, he would definitely die.The powerful force made their hearts palpitate. The unparalleled sword essence made them feel boundless fear. It was as if they were seeing the existence of a Sword Saint, the terrifying sword of killing!And Li Hao's sword attack was also terrifyingly powerful.The seven Heavenly Kings erupted with power. BOOM!The sound of the collision resounded through the world!One sword slowed down a Heavenly King and instantly cut him into pieces. The remaining Heavenly Kings roared and shattered Li Hao's sword intent with a boom, all of them injured.But at this moment, an even greater fear struck. A Heavenly King ... Actually couldn't block a sword!"His sword can slow us down!""Interfere with his sword intent ..." A Heavenly King roared.BOOM!The long sword slashed down again, but this time, it was not as sharp as the last time. One of the seven Heavenly Kings was missing, so the six of them joined forces and actually broke Li Hao's sword intent with a boom.Someone noticed something and was overjoyed.""His power is flowing away!"Li Hao's strength was indeed depleting.The power of the future was too superficial.He had consumed a lot of energy to kill one of the seven Heavenly Kings when they joined forces. Li Hao raised his eyebrows. As expected, his strength was not cultivated by him, after all, and it seemed a little weak.Otherwise, a half-step Emperor would be able to grind these fake Heavenly Kings to death.Fortunately, he did not stay in the void Dao universe and fight with the two half-emperors. Otherwise, he would have become a pseudo-half Emperor after three strikes. After a few more strikes, he might not even be a pseudo-half Emperor!

Li Hao didn't say anything. In an instant, billions of stars in the entire universe of the great path gathered and merged into his body.Not only that, the long river and the spiritual world merged into his body.His strength had increased again.The sword slashed out, and the power of time flowed. The Heavenly Kings burst out and broke free from the control of time. After all, Li Hao's power of time was too weak. One Heavenly King was fine, but it would be difficult to control him even if many Heavenly Kings worked together.However, at this moment, a thousand sword intents burst out from the sword. BOOM!Another Heavenly King was blown up by Li Hao!The remaining five Heavenly Kings were all shocked. One of them roared and gritted his teeth,""His power is dissipating ... Don't give him a chance to recover ... Everyone, I ... I'm still considered half a neo martial artist. F * ck his father!"In an instant, this person charged forward, and Li Hao took a step back. The next moment, an extremely powerful self-destructive force resounded through the world!BOOM!The Heavenly King's self-destruction swept across the world. Li Hao's sword destroyed it, but the illusionary power on his body instantly collapsed.The third Heavenly King had self-destructed.Li Hao's aura instantly plummeted. He frowned again. Sure enough, the power was too weak. A fake Heavenly King's self-destruction dispelled most of the turbulent power.Out of the seven Heavenly Kings, only three had died. There were still four left.Li Hao sighed. At this moment, his spirit sea began to fluctuate violently, and the Dao meridians in his body also fluctuated wildly.External forces are unreliable ... But don't forget, I'm not a weakling!It's hard to kill a half-step sovereign, but is it really hard to kill you?The illusionary sword of a thousand paths instantly disappeared.A hundred stars gathered!The sword of a hundred DAOs fused with the 144 truth Dao stars. Li Hao's aura was no longer illusory, but instantly condensed. He slashed at the Four Heavenly Kings. His figure dissipated, reappeared, disappeared, and reappeared!Swords were being drawn from every direction!Boom! Boom! Boom!The sound of explosions reverberated in all directions. The Four Heavenly Kings kept on coughing out blood and counterattacking. However, the more they fought, the more astonished they became. How could this be?Without the support of that power, Li Hao was not weak at all.Although it wasn't as strong as before, it was more ferocious."Time!"At this moment, Li Hao shouted, and the power of time seemed to appear again. The Four Heavenly Kings burst out again. Not only that, but at this moment, a bright moon appeared behind him and smashed down, as if it wanted to kill Li Hao!It was the moon goddess! In the end, the moon goddess still joined the battle. Although li daoheng and Zheng Yu were currently fighting, the moon goddess couldn't really let Li Hao successfully kill these Heavenly Kings, or she wouldn't benefit from it! Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  "You don't know what's good for you!"At this moment, a sword suddenly appeared in Li Hao's hand, and a special sword intent emerged-longevity sword intent!This was the longevity sword essence that he had absorbed in sword city. He had not used it yet.At this moment, the longevity sword essence burst out!This time, his attack was even more powerful than his own attack. He slashed at the moon behind him. With a loud bang, the moon god, who had just recovered, was pierced through by a powerful sword will of longevity!With a muffled grunt, the moon goddess's true body appeared. It was a cold woman with a huge bloody hole in her chest. She looked at Li Hao with gritted teeth, no longer cold!Why ... Was it the longevity sword intent?That sword intent ran wildly in her body, bursting out with countless sword Qi. With a bang, the void exploded, and the moon god's moon exploded. The broken Moon instantly escaped, tearing the void as if it was going to Enter the Void Dao universe.She could Enter the Void Dao universe!Since his sneak attack on Li Hao had failed, he could only flee.Just as he was about to tear open the void and escape, a bright moon suddenly appeared. A scepter appeared and hit the countless fragments, causing them to shatter instantly.The Queen instantly appeared with some excitement, some apprehension, and some uneasiness ... She sneaked a glance at Li Hao and reached out to grab a large number of moon fragments. The remaining large piece instantly entered the void Dao universe. The Queen didn't care. She grabbed the things she had seized and turned to escape!Suddenly, he turned around again, and a scepter burst out of the void, heading straight for the Four Heavenly Kings. The scepter hit the back of one of the Heavenly Kings, causing him to stagger and vomit blood. He roared,""Bastard!"At this time, the Queen actually sneaked an attack on him!At this moment, Li Hao's long sword fell, and with a crack, the Heavenly King was cut into pieces.This time, the Queen really didn't look back and fled!I'm making my move!I helped you kill a Heavenly King ... I'll take some moon god shards.She ran quickly and grabbed countless fragments, absorbing them madly. She was extremely happy.As expected!The moon goddesses were still far from being able to fight Li Hao. Their sneak attack had failed and they had almost been completely defeated by Li Hao. If not for the fact that the moon goddesses had some of the core of the Silvermoon world with them, they would not have been able to survive.She did not care about all this. Even if the moon goddesses were to resurrect again, it would be difficult for them to recover their Heavenly King's power. As for her ... From being a puppet, she had the upper hand. The power of the Silver Moon she possessed had already surpassed the moon goddesses 'true body!As soon as the Queen fled, the remaining three Heavenly Kings all had looks of despair in their eyes.Four of the seven Heavenly Kings were killed in an instant.

The moon goddess had almost been killed by Li Hao's sword will of longevity, and the Queen had launched a sneak attack on the moon goddess instead. By the way, she had also dealt them a thunderous blow, causing the death of one of the Heavenly Kings. The remaining three had no hope at all!"Li Hao!""You can't win ..." One of the Heavenly Kings gritted his teeth.The three Heavenly Kings looked at each other. Suddenly, they charged into the depths of the great Dao universe, and brilliant light burst out of their bodies. If they couldn't match Li Hao, they would self-destruct and blow up the great Dao universe!Even if he couldn't destroy the great Dao universe, he had to completely throw this universe into chaos!Since they couldn't kill Li Hao, they would destroy his hope of advancing again. This was more worth it than killing Li Hao.The three people's eyes were filled with ferocity!At this moment, the fierceness in their bones was awakened. Although we betrayed neo martial, we still have some of neo martial's rebellious heart. If you don't let us live well, we won't let you live well either!Li Hao frowned slightly. Just as he was about to attack, he suddenly had an idea.At this moment, he actually didn't care!Three enormous self-destructive forces suddenly exploded, boom boom boom!The entire great path universe burst out with a powerful wave that swept across the world. The great path universe trembled. Li Hao's body trembled slightly, and so did the river in his body!The three destructive forces swept in all directions!Li Hao coughed. The power of his great Dao actually overflowed, and his aura weakened.He didn't stop her!Li Hao did not say anything. He simply looked at the depths of the universe in silence. If Time and Stars were the heart of the great Dao and the universe was destroyed, would that star appear?Suppress the turbulence of the great Dao?If he could lure the other party from the void Dao universe into the truth Dao universe, that would be fun. He would let those two fellows fight in loneliness in the truth Dao universe!This was also one of the reasons why he didn't care!As for the decline in strength, what did it matter?Li Hao's eyes flickered with coldness. He disappeared from where he was in an instant, letting the great path shake. When he reappeared, he was already in the sky above Hurricane city.There were still some people in the city.At this moment, they were all terrified. Someone shouted,""I surrender ..."BOOM!Tens of thousands of sword wills burst out, and tens of thousands of swords swept through the world. Screams were endless. Not far away, Zhang an appeared instantly. He looked down and sighed, not saying a word.They were all traitors! If he died, then so be it. It was just a little ... Regretful. Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  Why did he betray her?The entire city instantly turned into a bloody land!Countless people who had survived were killed one after another, and their screams were endless."All major cities, quickly gather here!" Li Hao's voice was like a great Bell.One after another, huge cities broke through the air!At this moment, some of them had seen some of it, and some of them hadn 't. They were all shocked and shocked beyond words. Hurricane city ... Had really been taken down!As for Zhang an, he also let out a soft sigh. Li Hao had just said that he would take down Hurricane city, and in the blink of an eye, the city had actually fallen into his hands. At this moment, according to their agreement, Galaxy city should also be given to Li Hao."Withdraw from Star River City ... Star River City will be handed over to Li Hao!"In the city, the Saints were all shocked!But at this moment, they said nothing. They had seen how Li Hao killed all the Heavenly Kings in Hurricane city. They had no intention of refusing.In an instant, the enormous Star River City landed near Li Hao.A few Saints appeared behind Zhang an in an instant. They were all shocked and uneasy.Li Hao actually killed all these people!After killing all the rebels of the neo martial era, Zheng Yu might be the only one still alive.From even further away, large cities flew over.Hurricane, Xinghe, zhantian, wujian, martial Union, Dingbian, and Thunderbolt-the seven main cities had all gathered. At this moment, aside from sword city, which was still sealed, the seven ancient cities of the eight great families had all fallen into Li Hao's hands!Li Hao sensed the void and raised his eyebrows. Two extremely powerful auras seemed to have penetrated the void. The two half-emperors were still fighting!He said nothing. As the seven main cities gathered, Li Hao shouted in a low voice,""Arrange them in the eight trigrams Formation and wait for me here ... I'm going to capture them!"Catch who?Ying Hongyue!Today was the day of Ying Hongyue's death!Li Hao instantly disappeared.……In the North.Ying Hongyue's expression changed drastically. At this moment, she had also seen something. Without saying anything, she frantically fled, and her eyes revealed some fear!"He wants to kill me!"At this moment, he seemed to have realized something. He gritted his teeth."He wants to kill me!"Gathering eight major cities to suppress and seal them!Li Hao wanted to kill me. Everything he did today was probably for this moment. He wanted to kill me ... To kill me completely!Escape!However, at this moment, a wave of sword energy rose from behind them, and Li Hao's voice came.""Ying Hongyue, I think you should already know!""Li Hao!"Ying Hongyue angrily shouted,"I was also struggling. I was protecting myself. I was doing this for Silvermoon!" Only when the bloodlines of the eight great families gathered together could they hope to break the conspiracy of this group of new martial artists! I'm doing this for Silver Moon and our world! I'll sacrifice some people. If I succeed, I'll be the Savior!""Do you dare to say that you have not killed innocent people? Your teacher has killed countless martial masters, and they are all innocent! I only killed a few ordinary people for the sake of the world. I am also The Guardian of the Silver Moon!""Twenty years ago, I was the only one who had any hope of saving silver Moon!"Li Hao was extremely calm."I've never killed an innocent person. Those who die in my hands are not innocent!" You can't escape. The Silver Moon is only so big, where can you escape to?"

"Li Hao! Don't force me!"BOOM!A powerful blood aura exploded from Ying Hongyue's body, and the power of the red moon quickly spread.The power of the eight bloodlines shook violently!At this moment, his expression changed, and his voice was struggling but dignified."Li Hao, we meet again ... Li Hao ... Don't force me to do this!"His expression kept changing, one moment ferocious, the next dignified!That was the power of venerable sovereigns. It had exceeded the limits of the eight great bloodlines and was invading him.If this went on ... He would very likely be possessed.Li Hao's voice slowly sounded,""Venerable sovereign, the time star has appeared. Zheng Yu and Li daoheng are both fighting for it. Once someone succeeds, he'll become a venerable sovereign. I can't see far ... That trace of blood of yours will probably be able to lock onto its location soon!""Why don't I kill Ying Hongyue, and the seal will leak its aura for a moment. You might be able to permeate your power and Enter the Void Dao universe to fight with the two of them. Do you want to get involved in my mess?" p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  At this moment, Ying Hongyue's expression was dignified."You killed three warriors with one peach. You're really bold!"The stars of time were this peach!"Is this the source of your revival power?""Not bad!"At this moment, the overbearing look of the venerable sovereign gradually dissipated, and his voice reverberated,""I know that you want to use the eight cities to suppress and seal it ... However, just as you said, once Ying Hongyue dies, there will definitely be some cracks that will allow my power to Enter the Void Dao universe ... However, aren't you worried that I will kill you in that instant?"Li Hao smiled."Venerable sovereigns can try. Let's see if you can kill me or lose the chance to Enter the Void Dao universe. If you kill me, I won't be able to kill you, so I won't participate in the fight. If the other two succeed, they will definitely be able to kill a weak venerable sovereign!"An open scheme!From the beginning to the end, it was an open scheme.Even if you do, are you going to kill me or fight for the time star?Do you still have a chance if you delay for a while?The venerable sovereign's power completely dissipated, and so did the Crimson Moon Power in Ying Hongyue's body. The imposing look in his eyes disappeared, and a ferocious face emerged as he roared,""Are you all so stupid? Li Hao was the biggest threat! The stars of time ... Can you really take it away? Kill him ... And take over the truth Dao universe. That's the real benefit!" At this moment, he was terrified!Red Moon sovereign had chosen to give up on possession and his clone. Instead, he had chosen to wait for Li Hao to kill him and reveal some flaws in the seal!At this moment, the three powerhouses of the Silvermoon world were all attracted by that star and no longer cared about anything else.A single star ... Had disrupted everyone's plans!Li Hao, on the other hand, smiled.At this moment, Ying Hongyue gritted her teeth. The next moment, a person appeared beside her. It was the flying sword immortal ... No, Zi Yue!At this moment, it was no longer a flying sword immortal, but Zi Yue's appearance.The power of lightning flickered on Zi Yue's body, and her eyes kept changing. Ying Hongyue, however, was not surprised at all. Instead, she was furious."Didn't you run away?"Damn it!Why did she come back?Ziyue's voice was calm,"can't we fight him fair and square?" Even if he was defeated, it shouldn't be like this! His father had been hiding in the dark all this time. In the end, he had lost his last bit of dignity! Li Hao schemed against the common people, so how could he let me go? You're also a chess player ... Would you let go of a chess piece like me?"Ying Hongyue's expression changed.Zi Yue said calmly,"fight him ... Even if you lose, you can die with dignity!" Silver moon's 36 heroes, the amorous swordsman Ying Hongyue, should not be afraid of this battle!""Bastard!"Ying Hongyue was furious!As for Li Hao, he had only sealed the sky and the earth. At this moment, the three of them appeared in the sky above the Silver City.His expression was calm as he looked at the two of them and said softly,""Are you done? Was it fun to entertain yourself? Was he so perverted that he was splitting himself? Or do you think that I'll cherish heroes like you? I'm not a hero ... And you're definitely not! Ying Hongyue, today is the day you die!"He chuckled. Was the purple Moon ... Still the purple Moon? Ying Hongyue, do you want to play split personality with me?Today, he must die!

Chapter 2386 Killing Ying Hongyue (1)
Silver City.The seven main cities circled around, the seal stood tall, and three people stood in the void.The sky and earth were spinning. Li Hao brought them here.Silver City ... The place where all karma began.This was the origin of the story.Here, he stepped onto the path of martial arts. Here, he began his path of revenge. Step by step, he walked to this day. Today, the person who secretly manipulated the red moon to kill his parents would be beheaded here!It was like reincarnation.Li Hao didn't even hesitate to expose the temporal acceleration constellation to trap the three great experts there, making them give up on assisting Ying Hongyue.This made this formidable person have no choice but to face Li Hao alone.This time, they had come to Silver City again.Ying Hongyue's expression was grave. She looked at Li Hao, then at the seven main cities nearby, and then at the Saints in the surroundings ... All of Li Hao's accumulation over the past year was here.Silver City!It was a place so special that he would never forget it in his life. At this moment, he looked at Li Hao, then at Zi Yue beside him. He suddenly smiled, as if he had returned to the past. He was as carefree as ever, and sighed."My good daughter ..."Ziyue just looked at him silently.At this moment, she seemed to be even calmer than Ying Hongyue. She shook her head."At this point ... Why bother?"What daughter?Just as Li Hao said, with the power of the Crimson Moon, he couldn't lose any of the eight great bloodlines. How could he have any descendants? p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The so-called dozens of children ... Were all just his test subjects!Ying Hongyue laughed at herself. She nodded slightly and sighed. "That's right ... Li Hao has his past, future, and present clones, while li daoheng has his sword Dao clone, origin clone, and new Dao clone. That Zheng Yu fellow also has a new Dao clone and an origin clone ... Everyone likes to use their clones to do some shameful things. " He looked at Li Hao and smiled."Actually, the purple Moon isn't my clone."Li Hao nodded slightly."I know. Yama, flying sword immortal, the other June of July, and Hao Tian. There are nine of them!" An eight Meridian clone and a Crimson Moon clone, a nine Meridian body! Every time someone else died, the purple Moon was almost always nearby ... Therefore, the purple Moon actually absorbed the other seven Meridian clones and the Crimson Moon clone ...""Yes," Li Hao said."The purple Moon is not a clone. She's more like a red shadow ... A special type of red shadow, just like the Red Shadows I saw back then. They're your own Red Shadows ... All the members of the red moon have a Red Moon, but July doesn 't! You are the only ones who aren't ... Because they are your blood puppets!""Ying Hongyue, do you have anything else to say?" Li Hao asked softly.Ying Hongyue glanced at Li Hao and smiled."Interesting! Li Hao, why do I feel like you know me better than I do?"The red moon organization had seven great leaders. Other than Ying Hongyue, there were six others.The three great organizations, as well as Yama and fairy.In addition, there were nine people from the clear sky divine mountain, excluding Ying Hongyue. These nine people didn't have any Blood Shadows accompanying them, and they just happened to fit the eight Meridian body and the red moon body.Li Hao sighed softly,"you're called an amorous swordsman, but you're really cold-blooded and heartless!" The group of martial masters who left with you back then have long been refined into your own puppet bodies. Only Yu Luosha was lucky enough to escape and give up her identity as Zi Yue. Otherwise ... She would not be the Zi Yue of today. ""It's just a guess. You don't seem to care about the deaths of the other members of the red moon, even the other members of July. They're no exception ... But every time someone dies ... It seems like someone will witness it all ..."He looked at Ziyue."I'm killing the others. This one seems to be nearby."Li Hao smiled."That's why I'm guessing if there's a connection. Ying Hongyue ... Do you think I'm right?"Ying Hongyue smiled and shook her head,"not all of them are correct!" You've guessed some right, but also some wrong! I didn't make a Red Moon avatar, so Haotian wasn't one of them. I only made eight avatars that corresponded to the Eight Families! Have you forgotten my own name? I'm Ying Hongyue ... In fact, I'm one of the nine great clones, the Hongyue's body!""The other seven moons died a little too early ... It's a pity that because of you, the eight great families" bloodline hasn't fully matured yet, so I couldn't absorb it early, so I could only let Ziyue do it for me!"Ying Hongyue looked at Li Hao and said with some regret,"Among them, the Li family's bloodline is the weakest. This is what I regret the most! If I had killed you earlier, or if you hadn't resisted a year and a half ago, I would've killed you and balanced my eight meridians, making them all stronger. Li Hao, I would be the one standing here today and judging the world!"He seemed to have regained his fighting spirit. He looked at Li Hao and said coldly,""In order to become stronger, I have to endure humiliation! Everyone says that you're a brave man, but you should know how much I've sacrificed to become stronger. I willingly became a part of the seal. I took advantage of the fear of the three powerhouses to obtain the greatest benefits. I became their target!""Li Hao, if you hadn't ruined my plans time and time again ... We wouldn't be in this situation today. Your master might not die! How many Silver Moon martial masters have I killed since I left the Silver Moon clan?"He looked at Li Hao coldly and said,"I know better than you that they are Silver moon's hope ... So, even if I could kill them and your teacher, I wouldn't have done it! Their deaths are your responsibility!"

Chapter 2387 Killing Ying Hongyue (2)
At this moment, Ying Hongyue's aura was getting stronger and stronger. Zi Yue, who was beside her, seemed to have been relieved and released. Bit by bit, her power was being absorbed by Ying Hongyue.Li Hao didn't stop him.He just watched and listened in silence.Ying Hongyue coldly said,"do you think that I'm the reason why you've made it to where you are today?" No, it was caused by those people from neo martial! It was caused by Red moon's venerable sovereign! It wasn't me! I'm also a resisters!""The sacrifice of the eight great families is necessary ... Because this is the evil consequence caused by their ancestors!""Are Zhang an and his people good people?""They are the cause of Silver moon's current predicament, do you understand?" he sneered. You're actually working with these people ... You're Silver moon's traitor, while I ... Should have become his hero! Whether it's the eight great families, new martial arts, the traitor, or the Crimson Moon ... They're all targets I want to kill! And you?""Li Hao, who have you killed today, other than a bunch of unimportant and important people? You've killed many Silver Moon martial masters!"His voice was as loud as Thunder!At this moment, Ying Hongyue seemed to be even more righteous and righteous than Li Hao.You're the one who killed them!He was a rebel, a Guardian, and a just man.He had only killed a few Silver Moon martial masters.The necessary sacrifices were all for the future and for resistance!Li Hao was the real villain.Li Hao just watched and felt in silence, allowing him to absorb the overflowing power of the eight meridians. Zi Yue and the others were only part of his plan. This person was indeed ambitious and capable.He had started planning everything a long time ago.Absorbing the power of the eight meridians, splitting them up, connecting them to the seal, and traveling in three different directions ...​ If he really succeeded in killing Li Hao, he might even be able to control the eight main cities and seize the blood saber. He would become a true top-tier expert and stand at the peak of the Silver Moon.Unfortunately ... Li Hao suddenly smiled. Ying Hongyue's expression was cold. "What's so funny? The winner is king and the loser is vilified. Besides, I haven't lost yet!"Li Hao smiled and shook his head."It's nothing. It's just that ... I'm thinking, thinking of the books I've read. From ancient times to now, be it a villain, a bear, a hero, or a treacherous official ... Has there been anyone who relied on schemes and intrigues from the beginning to the end to reach the position of the world's Overlord?"Li Hao looked at him and smiled."I've read the history books ... I did lie low for a while. But from the beginning to the end, I was acting like a coward. I was acting and playing tricks ... It seems that no one has ever succeeded!"Li Hao sighed with emotion,"Ying Hongyue, do you want to be the first person to achieve this?" You've been lying low for decades, giving up everything-women, status, reputation, face ... You don't want anything anymore, acting like a dog and a pig in front of the three great powerhouses ... In the end, aren't you just a pig?" "In this world, how can there be a pig that pretends to be a pig for decades ... If it can't even eat a Tiger, then it's a real pig, not a Tiger!"Ying Hongyue's expression was slightly unsightly.Li Hao chuckled,"you're pretending to be a pig to eat a Tiger, but you've got to eat a Tiger, right?" Even if you can't eat it, you're acting like a dog, baring your teeth and saying a few words to show that you have some strength to resist. You've been acting like a pig from the beginning to the end, but why do I think you're a real pig?"He smiled brightly,"although I also like to use schemes, I'm not afraid of the world knowing!" Be it Zheng Yu, li daoheng, or even the red moon Emperor in the sky ... At least they won't look down on me, Li Hao. Aren't you overestimating yourself by comparing your pig head to mine?"He knew that the man was extremely confident. Even now, he still felt that if it weren't for Li Hao, he would have been able to control everything!But ... Was this the truth?Such a confident person ... If his confidence was destroyed, how satisfying would that be!In an instant, the sword Qi soared to the sky!At this moment, the seal seemed to crack. Li Hao smiled brightly."Red Moon Emperor, you can be the witness. Between Ying Hongyue and me, who is the Overlord of the Silver Moon? Who is the person you fear?"At this moment, Li Hao seemed extremely childish.He actually let the enemy judge!Ying Hongyue's face was extremely cold. Red Moon sovereign's voice slowly came from the void with a smile and some disdain."Ying Hongyue ... You're just a clown who doesn't even dare to use your real name. You think your schemes are unparalleled, but in our eyes ... You're just a clown! However, no matter what era it is, there will always be people like this ...""Thank you for your judgment, venerable sovereign. I'll definitely let the venerable sovereign divide more power later!"Li Hao's smile was brilliant. The sword energy dissipated, and the seal closed.Ying Hongyue's expression was incomparably cold! n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Li Hao once again slashed apart heaven and earth. Suddenly, the void Dao universe seemed to appear, and a sword slashed over as if it wanted to kill Li Hao. Li Hao's voice resounded. "Don't misunderstand ... I have no intention of fighting for time and Stars ... Since both of you are here, give me some time. I only have one question. In your eyes, what kind of existence is Ying Hongyue?"Ying Hongyue's expression kept changing.Meanwhile, in the void Dao universe, the two experts who were locked in a fierce battle were slightly stunned.è‰¹!At this critical moment, you're so bored that you're asking this question?They didn't want to answer, and they couldn't be bothered to.At this moment, Li Hao's voice rang out again."If you don't answer me ... I'll completely break the seal right now. Then, I'll let the red moon Emperor play with you!"

Chapter 2388 Killing Ying Hongyue (3)
"You're so boring!"Zheng Yu laughed. Li Hao! Ying Hongyue? Was it very important? He's just a self-righteous little brat who always thinks that everything is going according to his plan. In fact, we're just letting him do whatever he wants ... He's also a channel for us to weaken Red Moon Emperor ... This person is not bad, he has ambition, ability, and strength ... However ... The day the seal breaks will be the day he dies. We've actually seen everything he said about gathering the bloodlines of the eight great families. If not for that, how could it be so easy to obtain the inheritance behind the stone door? Didn't you see that I took the initiative to send him off?"At this moment, li daoheng's indifferent voice reverberated,""You think you're just a chess piece of a chess player, so there's no need to talk! Li Hao, do you want to come in and get a share?"Li Hao laughed heartily."Then forget it. Please continue. I won't disturb you any longer!"BOOM!The universe was sealed. At this moment, a sword aura shot out from the sealed space and was instantly destroyed by Li Hao. Li Hao smiled."How sinister. I was just asking, and you wanted to assassinate me ...""What do you think?" he looked at Ying Hongyue and smiled.The aura on Ying Hongyue's body had already risen to the limit. The power of her eight bloodlines, seven of which were extremely powerful!He looked at Li Hao with a cold expression."Li Hao, do you think the three of them can change anything? Can you destroy my confidence? You must be dreaming!" p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "You actually let the enemy judge ... The more they belittle me, the more it proves that they are afraid!"Li Hao laughed."Alright, it seems that you don't want to admit that you're useless! You've reached your limit, right? Come, try and see what you can change. You've been acting like a pig for too long, so aren't you a pig? Have you ever fought with a venerable sovereign? Have you ever fought with a Heavenly King? Have you fought with a pseudo-Emperor before? Other than your aura being a little stronger and your mouth being a little more stubborn ... You ... You're nothing!"In an instant, the sword Qi soared to the sky!The longsword moved horizontally!The sword of time was unleashed, and it broke through the heavens!Ying Hongyue let out a low roar. At this moment, she had completely absorbed the power of her clone. The power of her eight meridians was extremely powerful, and her aura was incomparably valiant. She also slashed out with her sword, and lightning erupted! Li Hao's voice rose again,"you piece of trash, up until today, the so-called martial skills are only the eight great families" combat skills that have barely been combined!" There's nothing unique about it. In my eyes, your sword intent ... Is only superficial!"BOOM!The long sword broke through the air and pierced through the heavens and earth. Time spread and with a crack, a bone-deep bloody wound appeared on Ying Hongyue's arm!Blood flowed out!Ying Hongyue's expression changed slightly. At this moment, his battle strength was definitely at its peak. He even felt that he could match a late Heavenly King!His powerful combat strength even caused the entire world to tremble.However, his long sword was broken and his arm was injured.Li Hao walked between heaven and earth and sighed.""Other than your little tricks, you're only focused on this. You have nothing else! You've improved very quickly and even reached the Heavenly King stage in a short time ... But you ... Who have you fought? How many times have you experienced a real life-and-death battle?" "Crack!"Hundreds of sword intents burst out from the longsword, breaking the Thunderbolt. Li Hao chuckled.""You underestimated the eight great families and humiliated them ... But what you used was a battle skill from the eight great families, don't you think it's ridiculous?"He appeared and disappeared like a ghost, as if he had walked out of time.The long river surrounded the world!At this moment, the red moon was surrounded by sword after sword."You think you're the number one in the world ... How ridiculous, how arrogant!"Li Hao struck out with his sword again, and with a boom, Ying Hongyue was forced to retreat continuously!Li Hao's voice rang out again."You still have a backup plan. Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you? that's because you're also cultivating a new Dao. Today, there's no movement from the new Dao. It seems that you still have a new Dao clone. In the land of Silver Moon, do you think that you can rise again even if you lose this time?"Ying Hongyue's expression changed slightly. She quickly counterattacked, but it was still difficult for her to keep up with Li Hao's pace. She was stabbed by his sword, and blood spurted out with a splash!Li Hao's voice was like a voice urging for death,"why do you always like to look down on the people of the world?" Do you really think that you can scheme against the world? Even I, Li Hao, don't dare to say that, so what right do you have?"A wisp of blood was absorbed by the long sword.In an instant, a long river of chaos appeared, and the blood spread in the river. Soon, it seemed to merge with the power of some great DAOs. The long river rolled and spread into the void along with the power of the great DAOs!Among the billions of stars, there were a few that were shining brightly!At this moment, a few stars were shattered!Ying Hongyue's expression changed.Li Hao, on the other hand, said with a smile,"have you forgotten that I'm the master of the great Dao?" Who Do You Think You Are?"The moment the stars shattered, many people in the world were suddenly injured!Li Hao's voice resounded through the world,"the person who was suddenly injured just now must be investigated and arrested as soon as possible!" Heibao, follow their aura and chase them. I want to kill all of them!"The Black Panther instantly pierced through the heavens and earth, disappearing from sight!Ying Hongyue's expression was unsightly. Li Hao said indifferently,"There is no need to be so ugly, this is only the truth Dao universe, with your thoughts, this is only a part of it, the other part might be hidden in the void Dao universe!"At this moment, Ying Hongyue was no longer silent. She coldly shouted,"Can you even control the void Dao universe? Even if you kill me, kill these truth Dao clones, that Phantom Dao clone will become the next me sooner or later. I will make you fear me, I will not die just like that!"

Chapter 2389 Killing Ying Hongyue (3 In 1)
This person was also a ruthless person.Countless clones!The reality Dao universe had them, and so did the void Dao universe.Li Hao chuckled."I'll make you completely desperate before I kill you!" Ying Hongyue ... I want you to see with your own eyes that I'll kill all of your clones. Not a single one will be left! I'll cut off all your hopes!""Hmph!"With a cold snort, he seized the opportunity and suddenly threw a punch. He no longer used his sword, but his eight meridians gathered together and instantly hit Li Hao!His eyes revealed a hint of joy!He finally hit it!From the beginning to the end, he had been suppressed by Li Hao. All his plans seemed to be within Li Hao's calculations, but at this moment, he finally broke Li Hao's gloom.However, the next moment, his expression changed drastically!He suddenly retreated!His vision blurred. What he had just hit wasn't li Hao, but a long sword. The sword Qi swept out and exploded in an instant. With a boom, the sword Qi pierced through his entire body. Ying Hongyue was sent flying, her face deathly pale."Li Hao," he bellowed,"you only know how to play tricks. Do you dare to fight me face to face?"A chaotic River appeared instantly.Surround him!The great river roared and washed over the heaven and earth. The power of ten thousand DAOs gathered and crashed into his body with a rumble. It happened time and time again, and his flesh and blood were instantly melted. Countless amounts of energy overflowed. Ying Hongyue let out a violent roar and broke free. Her flesh and blood had recovered, and her face was pale.As for Li Hao, he transformed into his human form, licked his lips, and chuckled.""The eight great families" bloodlines have fused, the taste of their blood is not bad!"Ying Hongyue's expression changed slightly!This guy swallowed my blood!Li Hao walked toward him step by step and said,"don't you like fusion?" Didn't you like the eight great families "bloodline? Come, merge with me today and I'll give you a chance! Ying Hongyue, I've given you a chance, but you don't dare to take it?"He opened his chest and looked at him, smiling. "You're not my opponent, not in any aspect. Now, I'll give you one last chance. Come, fuse with me and devour me ... If you succeed, you'll still be Ying Hongyue. If you fail, I'll devour you bit by bit. What do you think?"Ying Hongyue's face was deathly pale as she took a few steps back. Li Hao smiled and said,"you do it!" I'll keep my word and give you a chance to merge with me ... Merge with the Li clan bloodline that you need the most. That way, the eight bloodlines will be completely merged, and you might be able to jump out of this chessboard and become a real Go player!""Don't force me!"Ying Hongyue gritted her teeth and roared," do you think I don't dare to?""Come at me!""Do you dare?" Li Hao shouted coldly. You're just a rat that only dares to live in the dark. When will you ever dare to come out and show yourself in front of people?"Li Hao was talkative today.Everything seemed to be venting and telling him something.He wanted to destroy all the confidence and hope of this person in front of him. He wanted to completely crush and kill him in the strongest domain!Ying Hongyue gritted her teeth. In the next moment, she let out a fierce roar and suddenly transformed into an Eight Trigrams diagram. She went straight for Li Hao and enveloped him in an instant. However, Li Hao didn't Dodge and allowed the eight trigrams diagram to envelop him.Outside, everyone was shocked. Zhang an shouted,""That's the shrunken Eight Trigrams Formation, you ..." I can't let him seal it as he wishes!He knew that Li Hao was eager for revenge and hoped to defeat Ying Hongyue in all fields ... But in Zhang an's opinion, killing and torturing Ying Hongyue was enough. Why did he have to take the risk?It was too dangerous!The complete version of the seal could seal a venerable sovereign!Ying Hongyue's aura was extremely powerful at the moment. Although it was not as powerful as the complete version, Li Hao was only at the fourth or fifth level of Dao integration. Although he had suppressed Ying Hongyue in many ways, he had been turned around at the last moment. This kind of thing was common!Villains die because they talk too much!Li Hao didn't kill Ying Hongyue instantly, but kept competing with him. In Zhang an's opinion, this was very irrational. Many villains failed in an easy task like this!At this moment, Li Hao seemed to be sealed.The eight trigrams covered his entire body!"Li Hao, you're too arrogant!" Ying Hongyue's cold and stern voice rang out.This guy had gained the upper hand and was arrogant to an unbelievable extent!He would allow him to improve and seal. This might even be his chance to truly seize the Li family's bloodline and combine the eight great families 'bloodlines into one, completely merging the eight great families into one!Li Hao was too crazy!A powerful devouring force came from the eight trigrams. His eight meridians trembled, as if they were going to devour all of Li Hao's bloodline.As for Li Hao, he sat cross-legged and allowed him to absorb it.Gradually, wisps of special bloodline power overflowed from Li Hao's body and were swallowed by the eight trigrams Formation. The eight trigrams Formation grew even more resplendent, and Ying Hongyue was extremely excited. This ... It actually succeeded!'How ... How is this possible?'Even he himself could not believe it! Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  Had they really turned the tables?All of the Dao integration stage Saints and Dao integration stage cultivators on the outside were astonished!Zhang an took a step forward as if he was about to enter this place. However, in an instant, several Dao integration stage super mighty figures appeared and blocked his way. Lin Hongyu's expression was a little grim as she looked at Zhang an, shook her head, and transmitted her voice,""The Marquis said that ... Before he kills Ying Hongyue, no one is allowed to interfere!""You ..."Zhang an was a little angry. Didn't you guys see the situation?He saw it!However, Lin Hongyu insisted."The Marquis has said. Anytime!""You people ..."Zhang an was simply speechless!What time was it?At this moment, Li Hao's bloodline power was being drawn out from his body. It was a special bloodline that contained some sword intent. The golden light in Li Hao's eyes began to weaken.
