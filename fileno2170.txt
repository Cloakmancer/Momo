"Li Hao ... It seems like you're not capable of killing us!"The Queen turned around and looked at him with a cold expression.""You're only so-so!"Li Hao smiled and looked into the distance. The void shattered, and in an instant, several figures rushed over with the force of heaven and earth.One, two, three ...Li Hao's eyes flickered.9!The one leading them should be Zheng Yu's clone. The world had become much more stable, and this fellow even dared to send his clone out.He had the power of a half-step sovereign. Even if his clone was only at the early stage of the Saint realm, it might be more difficult to deal with than some late-stage Saints.This was a strong person!Nine saints, plus Ying Hongyue and the Queen who weren't any weaker than Saints ...Even Li Hao would be no match for such strength. He might even be killed.The Queen's words were deliberately provoking him. She even hoped that Li Hao wouldn't run away. They had been chased too miserably just now. If Li Hao didn't run ... They only needed a moment to have a chance to kill Li Hao and take revenge!Li Hao glanced into the distance. Perhaps exposing li daoheng was a good idea. Perhaps Zheng Yu would know ...However, Zheng Yu was extremely arrogant and might not believe it. No, there was a high chance that he would not believe it.p At that time, he would be in trouble.Li daoheng probably didn't like it when someone revealed the rules of the game in advance, right? Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  Moreover, it would also ruin his plan.Therefore, there was nothing much to say to Zheng Yu.Should he leave?He hadn't gotten enough benefits yet.He glanced at the starry sky sword in his hand. It had originally been broken into many pieces, but at this moment, it had recovered a lot. Moreover, it had just devoured the nine-section whip, so it had recovered even more.Li Hao didn't say anything.At this moment, ten li Haos appeared in all directions. Li Hao muttered,""All the cultivators of the new Dao in the world, give me a hand!"At this moment, heaven and earth trembled.All of a sudden, countless cultivators of the new Dao, including Ying Hongyue and the others, thought of Li Hao. His voice was so loud that it resounded through the world."Help me!"At this moment, there were more than ten million cultivators who were practicing the new Dao.At least one billion people were cultivating!And there were many who had opened their meridians.Li Hao had gained more prestige than the last time. Last time, he was defeated by the Queen because everyone was more afraid of gods. But now, while Lin Hongyu and the others were constantly praising Li Hao, Li Hao had done several live broadcasts, including carrying a city ... He was almost regarded as the number one God in the world!Under such circumstances, the entire world seemed to be boiling.Countless people were praying."I'm willing to contribute to the governor's demon-slaying!"BOOM!A boundless aura swept over, shaking the heavens and earth.Countless rays of light flickered in the bright star sector. Ying Hongyue's expression changed drastically!The Queen's expression changed as well. A scepter suddenly appeared in her hand. At this moment, the power of faith appeared in the Western divine Kingdom. Countless citizens of the Western divine Kingdom began to pray,""The heavens and earth are born, and the moon god has descended ..."The power of faith swept over. Last time, it had defeated Li Hao as well.However, this time ... It was completely different.BOOM!An even more powerful energy swept through the world, suppressing it. BOOM! BOOM! Countless cries of fear rang out, and the divine Kingdom prayers were instantly shattered. Images were pulverized.The power of faith was instantly suppressed.The statues of the moon god within the temples of the Western divine Kingdom began to rumble and shatter. The temples exploded, and countless people died in an instant!The Queen's expression changed drastically as she vomited blood.It was filled with disbelief!Li Hao's voice was calm,"how many people are there in the West? 300 million? 500 million? Or 1 billion? Do you know how many cultivators of the new Dao there are? We're all cultivators, and everyone in the world believes in me, Li Hao. You ... Still think you're the moon goddess?"BOOM!Li Hao's aura instantly skyrocketed, and an incomparably powerful force suddenly erupted. The broken sword in his hand trembled violently, and in the distance, Zheng Yu's expression also changed.Human King path?The path of the human Emperor?Li Hao could actually borrow the power of the people. He had done it once before, but since he was defeated, Li Hao had never used such a method again.Today, he had used it again.Then, he wiped out his previous humiliation and instantly destroyed the Queen's power of faith that had defeated him last time.The longsword burst out with a brilliant light!A murderous aura filled the air. It was as if a huge sword had appeared in the entire world!"Run!"Ying Hongyue roared and threw out two treasures in an instant. The Zhou clan's spear and the Zhao clan's glove ...At this moment, how could he care about this?At this moment, Li Hao was almost invincible!If this sword was cut down by him, they would all die!When did Li Hao become like this?Moreover, the people were really stupid to believe in Li Hao so much.On the other side, Zheng Yu's clone also instantly broke through the void and came over. His long sword fell, and there was a rumble!The heavens and earth were turned upside down!Everything in front of him was shattered. The Zhou family's spear and the Zhao family's boxing gloves were also instantly shattered. They were devoured by the starry sky sword to repair themselves. The longsword continued to fall.The eight trigrams appeared in Ying Hongyue's hand once again. On the eight trigrams, countless Red Moon Power erupted, but it was still difficult to resist and was directly broken by the sword!The Queen's scepter was also instantly shattered. The power of the Silver Moon swept out, but it was still difficult to stop.Zheng Yu was about to descend!However ... Perhaps before the other party could arrive, they would be completely torn apart.At this moment, Ying Hongyue's eyes revealed a hint of helplessness. She gritted her teeth, and suddenly, eight blood-colored light pillars emerged from her head. The eight light pillars instantly turned into one, but it trembled violently and was not stable.

At this moment, he grabbed the vast heaven Mountain Master. The vast heaven Mountain Master had long felt that something was wrong and wanted to escape, but ... He didn't have the chance.He suddenly screamed!A bloody aura emerged from his body. Frowning, Li Hao mumbled,""I see!"The heavenly Mountain Lord ... Was actually of the eight great families "bloodline!He didn't know whose family it was, but he felt that his bloodline was quite rich. In an instant, his bloodline was extracted and integrated into the eight light pillars. The originally unstable eight light pillars instantly stabilized.Ying Hongyue let out a fierce roar and punched out. It directly turned into countless Eight Trigrams and pressed toward the long sword!BOOM!The longsword shattered one, then the second, the third, the fourth ...It continued to shatter until the end. With a bang, Ying Hongyue was sent flying. However, she had exhausted all her remaining strength and was broken by the Queen's punch.The sword light dissipated.Ying Hongyue didn't stop spitting out blood. A deep bloody mark appeared on her face. She was a little scared, but she didn't die. She survived.Li Hao said softly,"so that's how it is ... The people who participate in the resurrection for the first time all have the bloodline of the eight great families!" They are, you are, and director Zhao is! So, they are here to help you consolidate the key to your eight meridians as one ... Interesting!"After saying that, he instantly disappeared from the spot! Zheng Yu, if you want to kill me, come!"In an instant, he disappeared into the void.As for Zheng Yu, he instantly descended, and the other Saints also arrived.At this moment, Zheng Yu's clone took a look at Ying Hongyue, and his eyes flickered.What a good method!At that moment, Li Hao's strength had definitely reached the peak of a Saint. He couldn't kill him with a single strike. Eight meridians as one!With Ying Hongyue's eight meridians combined, she actually blocked the opponent's sure-kill attack!Of course, from this, it could be seen that Li Hao really wanted to kill him. If Ying Hongyue had been a little less capable, she would have died without a doubt. Not only him, but the Queen would also have died.This Ying Hongyue ... Her methods weren't weak.Ying Hongyue's face was also pale and unsightly. The flying sword immortal beside her had an ashen face!So that was how it was!The participants of the first revival were all of the eight great families "bloodline, but they didn't even know that. Whether it was the flying sword immortal or the clear sky Mountain Lord, none of them knew that they were the descendants of the eight great families.It was only at this moment that Ying Hongyue revealed herself. She had used the heavenly Mountain Lord to block a certain-kill attack.Ying Hongyue, on the other hand, didn't say a word.He didn't say anything.There was a hint of helplessness in his eyes.At that moment, he had truly felt the danger of death. Li Hao, who had borrowed the strength of the people, had become much stronger. If he did not use the eight Meridian unification technique, he would definitely die!Zheng Yu only glanced at Ying Hongyue and then at the Queen, but he didn't say anything. Li Hao could kill these two, but he couldn 't.Being able to control the two of them was the best result.At this moment, their priority was not them, but Li Hao. His eyes flickered as he looked into the distance and said coldly,""Li Hao, now that the world can accommodate Saints, why don't you stay and try to kill us? otherwise ..."Li Hao's laughter rang out,'otherwise, do you think you can slaughter the world? You killed my Silver Moon Martial Master? Destroy my star dynasty? I'll wait for you! Zheng Yu, I'll wait for you to kill them and let them accompany my teacher first. I'll resurrect them after I've mastered my divine skill! Also, don't just talk but don't do anything. You'd better slaughter this Silvermoon. I also want to see if a world without people is what you want. I'm looking forward to it ... Don't threaten me, I'm so scared!"Zheng Yu's expression changed slightly, and he didn't say anything else.He was a little intimidating.But ... Li Hao didn't buy it.Or rather, ever since his parents, brothers, master, and Savior died ... This fellow had almost no weakness!You can kill the rest as you wish!How many you kill is up to you! But was Zheng Yu really willing to slaughter the world?If he really killed everyone in the world ... Could the Silver Moon world be revived again?Now, the cultivation of the world was the key to their true bodies!If all the cultivators in the world were killed, the world might end here and never recover again. That would be sad.Ying Hongyue also sighed and said in a soft voice,"I shouldn't have killed Yuan Shuo!" Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ Zheng Yu didn't say a word, and his face was extremely cold!Did I not know?But how would he deal with it then?They had taken the initiative to charge into boundless city, and Zheng Gong was facing a life and death crisis. Was he going to control himself and not kill Yuan Shuo?Ying Hongyue's words were pure nonsense. She was speaking after the fact!I also know that if Li Hao doesn't die, killing Yuan Shuo won't be a good thing!But ... Was there any use in saying all this now?He glanced at Ying Hongyue, but didn't chase after Li Hao. Instead, he said coldly, "You'd better put away your little schemes! You and yueshen better come with me to Hurricane city and lie low for a while!"They couldn't protect these two forever. The outside world could accommodate Saints.However, it was actually very dangerous!A single Saint, or even two or three saints, would not be Li Hao's match.Let alone two or three saints, even five Saints in heaven battling city wouldn't be enough to guarantee their safety. However, the Saints had always been gathered together. Were they just going to wait for Li Hao to kill them?"Can we take the initiative to attack and kill him?" the Queen asked in a low voice.Zheng Yu frowned slightly."The recovery of the world isn't fast enough. Even if I can exert the battle power of a late-stage Saint, Li Hao is almost the same. I'm on par with him, and he can escape into the universe of the great path. It'll be ... Very difficult to catch up to him!"

The Queen frowned."Then keep chasing. We can't give him any time. He can't appear in the world!""He can enter and exit the great Dao universe at any time!"Zheng Yu's tone was heavy. The second moon Goddess was not very clear-headed!Don't you understand what I mean?The other party could escape into the universe of the great path at any time and might not appear in the same place. This was Li Hao's greatest confidence. If you caught up to him, he would escape into the universe, and in the next moment, he might appear elsewhere.Do you understand?Moreover, if they spread out even a little, they might face the other party's thunderous attack!Chasing after Li Hao ... Wasn't a good idea.The best way was to enter the Dao universe and attack from the front and back to kill him directly.He looked at Ying Hongyue and asked,"can we enter the great Dao universe?"Ying Hongyue's expression changed slightly. She said,"Difficult! I might not be able to do it, but Her Majesty the Queen might be able to ... Provided that she can find a way ..."The Queen was stunned,"my Natal star is not in the universe of the great path ..."How could he enter?Ying Hongyue said softly,"it doesn't matter if you're here or not. You're born as gods, and you're all manifestations of the great Dao. If you search carefully, there's still a great chance. As long as the Queen is willing to put down her pride and take the initiative to cultivate a new Dao technique, you might be able to locate the great Dao universe!" Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ Can I? She glanced at Ying Hongyue and frowned slightly.Zheng Yu said calmly,"I'll try!" Li Hao is getting more and more difficult to deal with, but the key is still the Dao universe. Without entering the Dao universe, I'm afraid ... It'll be difficult to kill him!"Ying Hongyue suddenly said,"my Lord, you're extremely powerful. Have you never thought about the great Dao universe?" Have you never thought of changing to a new Dao?"Zheng Yu glanced at him and said in a cold tone,""All of this ... Is it something you should be asking?"Ying Hongyue smiled and didn't say anything else.Zheng Yu must have made some preparations as well.It was just that it was not convenient to reveal it.No one would give up on researching new DAOs. Perhaps Zheng Yu had already started researching new DAOs.However, this time ... He sighed.The losses were too great!Not to mention losing a few divine weapons, the death of the clear sky Mountain Master meant that he had lost another chance to merge the eight branches.At this moment, Zheng Yu suddenly said,"your eight meridians have converged and are extremely unstable!" Perhaps ... I have a way to help you stabilize. ""Sir, you mean ...""The stone gate inheritance!""The eight great families all have their own stone gate inheritances!" Zheng Yu said indifferently. It requires the divine weapons of the eight great families to activate it ... However, I know of another way to activate it, the eight city Lord seals! This was the symbol of the eight great families "dignity, dignity, and power! Sometimes, it was equivalent to the inheritance divine weapons of the eight great families! After entering the stone door, it might be able to help you stabilize your eight meridians. ""What price does my Lord want me to pay?"Ying Hongyue had also thought about entering the stone door. However, not only would there be a huge commotion when opening the stone door, but there were also some stone doors that she couldn't find. Perhaps Zheng Yu knew everything.After all, he was the direct descendant of the eight great families.Zheng Yu glanced at him and chuckled.""Simple. Once you become stronger, you just need to extract more of the Crimson Moon's power. Ying Hongyue, you're a smart person, aren't you?"Ying Hongyue thought for a moment and nodded,"with my eight meridians combined, my eight meridians will be even thicker, and I'll be able to withstand even more of the Crimson Moon's power!" We're indeed helping each other. At that time, the seal will be strengthened, and the Queen will be able to extract more Silver Moon Power ... Our current enemy is Li Hao! Even the red moon sovereign wants Li Hao to die. Li Hao seems to be able to use the power of a great Dao to purify the power of the red moon!"Zheng Yu didn't say anything more and said,""Let's go!"The Queen was still a little reluctant. The Western divine Kingdom had suffered too great a loss this time.When their faith was destroyed, the temple exploded, and countless people died.Now ... Should I continue to escape?"Where there's life, there's hope!"Ying Hongyue advised. It was useless to stay.And Li Hao wouldn't go crazy for no reason and slaughter hundreds of millions of civilians.The Queen gritted her teeth and nodded.""When the seal stabilizes and I extract more power from the Silver Moon ... That will be Li Hao's death. If he can enter the great Dao universe, I'll definitely shatter his Natal star!"What a hateful fellow!At this moment, Li Hao seemed to be the worst person in the world.These people were even worried that Li Hao would slaughter the civilians to threaten the Queen.……The group of people left unhurriedly.It wasn't fast, but it was still waiting for Li Hao's surprise attack.However, Li Hao didn't have such thoughts.There were almost 11 Saints. He wasn't crazy, so why would he attack them?This time, the fragment of the starry sky sword had directly absorbed three divine weapons, and the seal had become much weaker. Zheng Yu would probably have to pay a great price to stabilize the seal. Ying Hongyue had lost her divine weapon as well as a vast sky Mountain Lord, which was not bad.Li Hao couldn't be bothered with the Queen.A portion of the Heaven's Will was missing, and that was enough.A complete victory!He had achieved almost all of his goals."When the Yama died, Ying Hongyue actually didn't use him to erupt once ... Was she deliberately hiding it, or did he collect the Yama's bloodline when he died, so he could actually erupt again?"Thinking of this, Li Hao sent a message.""Qian Wuliang, where did the Yama's body go after he died?""It was snatched away by Ying Hongyue!"As expected!Li Hao's heart stirred. As for why he had used the heavenly Mountain Lord instead of Yama's corpse this time, it was probably because the two of them were somewhat hesitant and suspicious. Killing one of them would mean one less burden.

"If that's the case, if flying sword immortal didn't escape, perhaps this fellow could still erupt twice ... But that's only if his eight meridians haven't stabilized yet!"Ying Hongyue's explosive power was still very powerful.It could even seal a Saint!He kept improving, and this guy kept improving as well. Li Hao suddenly laughed. This guy really had some tricks up his sleeve. He had become his Bandit. Raising bandits for self-respect was exactly what Ying Hongyue was saying.  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  He even suspected that Ying Hongyue had the chance to kill him in the past, but she deliberately didn't do so so so that a person who could threaten everything would appear and give him more opportunities.Otherwise ... How could he have stepped into the divine path so quickly?This time, Ying Hongyue would definitely be able to enter The Holy Road!This included the Queen.These two people should be thanking him.Without him, the two of them had no hope of stepping into the Holy Dao in a short period of time. The Queen didn't know about it and thought that she was the reincarnation of the moon god. As for Ying Hongyue ... It was very likely that she knew something.Beside him, the ninth master appeared again,"what do we do now?" Heaven and earth can now accommodate Saints ... My main body can also go out. Do I still have to continue chasing them?"He vaguely felt that Li Hao had held back.It wasn't about holding back, but about timing.He could have used the power of ten thousand people earlier and perhaps had a chance to kill a few people, but he didn 't. Instead, he waited until Zheng Yu and the others were about to arrive and used the power of ten thousand people when they arrived.He had missed the best opportunity!Moreover, he had revealed his full strength, which was not a good decision. Seeing that they were here, Li Hao should have held back even more. "Experts from several sides have gathered together!""The chaotic world is about to end!"Li Hao suddenly laughed,'when the three of them come together, they'll definitely try to outwit each other! At the current stage, they might want to kill me by entering the Dao universe ..."The ninth Division commander looked at Li Hao."Give them a chance!" Li Hao said after some thought.With that, he pointed out with one hand, and a dim star appeared in the void. Li Hao touched the star, and it trembled and flickered with a little radiance. The power of a great Dao swept over.After a while, the stars began to shine.The ninth Division commander was a little confused. Li Hao said softly,""This is the star of the Empress's physical body's Dao Meridian ...""Eh? Isn't there only one deity?"Li Hao smiled."Queens are special. Moon goddesses are the number one gods in the world. There might be many of them!" I'll help her catalyze it now, and perhaps soon, she'll be able to open her own Dao meridians. At that time, she'll be able to sense the great Dao universe and have heaven battling city keep a close eye on this star!"The ninth Division commander vaguely understood Li Hao's thoughts and nodded.Was he ... Trying to bait them?In order to kill Li Hao, if the Queen could really locate the Dao universe, these people might pay a great price and send more experts into the Dao universe. At that time, it might be a great harvest!……At the same time. The Queen was retreating with them when she suddenly felt a little uncomfortable. A faint power of the great path appeared on her body, making her body tremble. She quickly sensed it, and a strange look flashed in her eyes.This ... Dao Meridian?In his body, a weak Dao Meridian suddenly appeared in an undetectable area.How was that possible?Didn't Immortals only have one Dao Meridian?In the next moment, his heart trembled."Not necessarily. I'm the moon goddess, the number one God in the world. Maybe I'm special and have more than one. Maybe I'm like the others and have countless."This ... Was really like giving a pillow when one was drowsy.My Natal star isn't in the Dao universe, so I can't find Li Hao or deal with him.In the end ... A Dao Meridian actually appeared at this critical moment.Even the heavens didn't want Li Hao to live!She really didn't expect the Dao Meridian to be born in her body. This was man-made. The Dao Meridian was in her body, so what did it have to do with others?At this moment, she did not mention it.Secretly cultivating!He had to cultivate this emerging Dao Meridian according to the cultivation method passed down by the new Dao.Perhaps, he would soon be able to locate the great Dao universe. If Li Hao could enter, why couldn't he?A cold glint flashed in her eyes!When I locate the great Dao universe, I'll be able to enter it and even bring people in ... Perhaps, Li Hao will no longer be so arrogant!However, he still had to be careful of Zheng Yu and the others.I hope they don't control me!She suppressed the thoughts in her heart and was a little happy. Opening her meridians could also help her become stronger. These people all knew about the extraction of the Silver Moon's power, but they didn't know about the cultivation of a new Dao!"The number one God of the Silver Moon won't die so easily. Li Hao ... You're underestimating me!"The Queen thought to herself.……At this moment, Li Hao had already disappeared from the universe of the great path.Now that those people had left, he didn't want to stay in the West any longer. This time, he had destroyed a large number of moon god halls in one fell swoop. This was also one of his plans. He hoped that li daoheng, who was on the moon in the sky, wouldn't mind.The real Moon Goddess was probably still absorbing the power of faith through the temple.This time, it seemed that he had unintentionally destroyed all of this ... He wondered if they would be angry.Li Hao's smile was bright as he headed straight for the vast wilderness.You guys can have a headache, but I should go to the vast wilderness to take a look.

Chapter 2174 There's Nothing That Can't Be Said To Others
In the great wilderness.Dust and sand flew up, the desert spread, and the air of chaos was scattered. As the wild beasts were killed, some of the chaos dissipated, but the will of chaos was still there. It was still like gangrene attached to the bone, becoming a malignant tumor on the body of the Silver Moon world.As Li Hao entered the great wilderness, heaven's will swept through and stirred up the surroundings.Li Hao frowned slightly and looked up at the Heaven's Will that was stirring in the sky.The heavens and earth had given birth to a consciousness, and Da Huang was like a malignant tumor on its body. Now that he was in this place, it was extremely uncomfortable.However, with such a strong disturbance, it would be easy for others to sense it.How could he make heaven's will settle down?The next moment, 11 divine runes appeared and covered the world. The will of heaven was still stirring around Li Hao, but gradually, it seemed to have lost track of Li Hao.The domain isolated heaven and earth!Naturally, it also isolated the Heaven's Will.At this moment, the Heaven's Will felt very uncomfortable staying here since it couldn't find Li Hao. It couldn't expel Li Hao even if it wanted to. The Heaven's Will didn't possess any combat power at the moment and could only affect those favored by the Heaven's Will.Since Li Hao couldn't be found ... Soon, the will of the heavens gradually receded.It was because it was too uncomfortable to stay here.Li Hao didn't care anymore and stepped into the vast wilderness.The yellow sand flew up.The domain gradually extended deep into the great wilderness and started to expand. The earth Force appeared and pressed down like a mountain, gradually suppressing the yellow sand that swept across the world.Li Hao took one step forward and suppressed the ground.There were still some corpses in the desert.There were also some wild beasts, like lone wolves, who were almost all walking alone in the desert.The wild beasts here were affected by the chaos aura and were very powerful. However, they were different from ordinary Fey. They lacked intelligence. This was the disadvantage of desolate beasts. Only when desolate beasts reached the top could they have any hope of developing intelligence.As for the demon race, even if they were very weak, they would still have spiritual intelligence.Behind him, the Black Panther followed Li Hao, also curiously observing these weak dire beasts.Demonic beasts and desolate beasts were actually the same.However, after the demon race entered heaven and earth, they shed their desolate beast bodies and lost the aura of chaos. They gradually turned into demonic beasts, while desolate beasts lived in chaos. From the beginning to the end, chaos was their habitat.Li Hao glanced at the Black Panther."All desolate beasts can talk. Their intelligence is low. You're already at the middle stage of the sun Moon realm, which is comparable to some undying beings. Can't a demon at this level talk?"Woof! Woof! Woof!“……”Li Hao sighed, was he born mute? Your spiritual power is also gone?"A demon comparable to an undying being, but he couldn't use voice transmission or speak, how strange.You're already so powerful. Even if you're really a mute dog, do you know how to transmit your voice?If he couldn't transmit his voice, would he be able to use his mental energy to vibrate it? Still can 't?That qi and blood vibration, ventriloquism ... Would all these be possible?He felt that the Black Panther could talk, but it didn 't. Was it necessary to maintain a sense of mystery?Woof! Woof! Woof!  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  "You can bark, Woof, Woof, but can't speak human language?"The Black Panther wagged its tail and didn't pay any more attention to him. It was more important to get down to business.As Li Hao walked on the land, he looked into the depths of the desert."Chaos is the appearance of the world when it was born. The fact that chaos is maintained here means that we might be able to leave the Silver Moon ... We don't have to go through the Stargate.""Of course, it might just be a small gap that normal people can't enter ..."He said softly,"the new martial artists also know that this place is chaos. They also know that chaos is a product of the universe and not from heaven and earth. Chaos can spread continuously. It is very likely that there is a crack between heaven and earth in the great wilderness. That is, the world has cracked!"However, no one said why they were leaving Silver Moon.There must be a reason. It was either too dangerous, or there was no way to leave.However, this place was definitely able to absorb Primal Chaos energy from outside of the Silver Moon.Hong Mu wanted to cultivate chaos, so it might not be a bad idea to cultivate here.Li Hao didn't have anyone to talk to. At this moment, he could only whisper to Gou 'Zi,""If I want to expel the power of Chaos in the great wilderness, I'll need to use my domain to cover the great wilderness ... The great wilderness is too large. Even though I've only seen it on the map, it's at least the size of five provinces. Adding on the 10000-mile desert, the total area is about the size of more than ten provinces, which is comparable to the square continent ..." He thought.Such a large area was too huge.Now, Li Hao's territory had combined eleven divine runes. If it expanded to its limit, it could cover an area of more than a hundred miles. The more divine runes there were, the stronger the territory and the larger the area it could cover.It would be impossible to completely cover the entire vast wilderness without thirty to fifty Holy prose.They didn't stack into hundreds or thousands. The 30 to 50 divine runes meant that Li Hao had comprehended 30 to 50 great DAOs and their force, which would result in a leap in development.However, he only had 11 divine runes since he started cultivating.It was extremely difficult for Li Hao to cover the great wilderness, capture the will of the heavens, and monopolize the great wilderness world.But he had no choice.They had been planning this for many years. If you don't have any ability, how can you break their plan?"Divine text, power ..."Li Hao frowned slightly. The five elements of wind and thunder were all basic elemental powers. Now that he had comprehended almost all of them, he had to start from another direction if he wanted to continue comprehending other types of Shi.Actually, it was quite a lot.For example, he could refer to the weapon force from Silver Moon Martial Master. Swords, Spears, halberds, fist force, and so on were all forces.However, it was not easy to comprehend it.However, Hong Yitang once said that force was actually formless, had no substance, and had no elements. It was formed later on. In other words, if he comprehended sword force, he might be able to use the same method. Sword force could turn into Saber Force, Saber Force into spear force ...

Chapter 2175 There's Nothing That Can't Be Said To Others (2)
All sorts of thoughts appeared once more.Li Hao moved forward and crossed the desert. Soon, he met a living person.The people of the vast wilderness.In the distance, there was also a city. However, the city was not tall. Instead, it was extremely low, as if half of it was deep underground and the other half was above the ground. Yellow sand filled the sky all year round.Sandstorms also struck frequently.p Outside the city, there were many people riding horses and moving Nomad. This was considered an oasis in the desert. The vast wilderness was considered a nomadic people. However, after so many years, they had stabilized their territory and gradually developed into a race with a fixed base.The great desolate King had led a million elite troops to the Central Plains and had yet to return. This border city was slightly panicked.He seemed to be worried that the great desolate King would not return.If those experts were unable to return, this place would probably be buried by the yellow sand in a few years."Da Huang ..."  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  The primal Chaos dissipated, and the world was rebuilt. Perhaps the great wilderness would once again open up. If the hundreds of millions of people of the great wilderness continued to stay here, they might die.With his previous experience, Li Hao had more ideas now.Very quickly, a message was sent out,'inform the great desolate King to prepare to migrate the great desolate's residents! "The vast wilderness is filled with people, and their customs and habits are different from those of the Central Plains. They can't gather together and have to live separately. There are too many people. Shuiyun in the South is about the same as the Central Plains ..."Li Hao had to separate from Da Huang.The great wilderness was good at fighting, and the people were valiant.These great desolation people had to be spread out across Heavenly Star and slowly fused together.Lin Hongyu was the one who received the call.At this moment, he suddenly had a splitting headache.Things would never end.She had just finished this task, and more missions were coming right after. Every time it happened, it was the migration of a country. If it weren't for the extraordinary era, she would have killed Li Hao with a slap.Of course, this was just a thought.At that moment, Lin Hongyu quickly replied,"Lord Marquis, we need some time, but now is also a good time. The whole world is migrating to rebuild the Hao Xing continent. Now that we're choosing to migrate and integrate, everyone is migrating. The chaos will only last for a while, but we need a large number of transcendents to participate in the construction of infrastructure ... There are already a million of them now, but ... It's not enough."Almost all the supers in the superpower City were sent to build infrastructure.This was probably a scene that would be difficult to achieve in the future. No matter what, they were a group of people with innate Dao body superpowers. Furthermore, they were the first batch of powerful people to awaken their superpowers.Now, they were all being pulled to work on infrastructure.Almost all of Li Hao's Demon Hunter Army members were either from the military or from the martial arts world. Not many superpowers joined.Li Hao was speechless when he heard Lin Hongyu say that even a million superpowers were not enough.One superpower was equivalent to 20 to 30 labor forces, right?At the very least, it should be the case, right?Didn't this mean that using tens of millions of people to build the infrastructure was still not enough ... "Then add more people!""But ..."Lin Hongyu sighed."Lord Marquis, you have to pay. Lord Marquis, you're not forcefully recruiting. You're hiring!" They're not the only ones who need to pay with energy stones. The Demon Hunter Army and the officials of heavenstar actually need to pay with energy stones as well. ""If Lord Marquis had not reduced the Army, perhaps ... We would not have been able to hold on! But even so, the Heavenly Star Mine is almost empty now. Lord Marquis ... We're almost out of money. "Li Hao was stunned.He had never considered this.Ever since he took over the star Mine, he felt that he could use it to unify the world. But in the end, how long had it been?Where's the huge mineral vein?Even though he knew that he had dug up a lot, but ... It was almost gone?It can't be, right?"Lord Marquis ... Heaven battling city has consumed a lot of energy. In addition, boundless city also consumes a lot of energy every time it's activated. In addition, the heaven battling Army, Saints, and undying have all been revived ...""In addition to the establishment of the sky screen system, the opening of the martial arts Academy, and the conversion of energy from many monster plants to cultivate the divine rice ... After a long time, the great Heavenly Star Mine is almost empty!""Of course, you don't have to pay ... As the Emperor who unified the world, these weaklings have to work even if you don't pay them ..."Today was the founding era.What's wrong with letting you do some work without money?It was an era where the strong preyed on the weak ... Even if he was given a mouthful of food, he would still do it!Li Hao's prestige was unparalleled, and his strength was overwhelming. Who would dare to resist?But ... Li Hao chuckled.""There's no need for that! Didn't they work so hard just for some benefits? You're out of energy stones, aren't you ..."He pondered for a while. Needless to say, without energy stones, it was really difficult to get them.All the mineral veins in the world were gone. Although the world had recovered, it was possible that the quantity was not so rich that mineral veins could form again. Moreover, there were too many people cultivating. Everyone was cultivating.Where would there be a chance for you to settle down and form a mineral vein?At this point, perhaps only Zheng Yu had a lot of ores in his hands. The other person was li daoheng, but they were both extremely difficult to deal with. It was really not easy.It felt good when he used it before ... But now ... He felt a little uncomfortable.Of course, Li Hao thought about it. If the chaos of the great wilderness dissipated and became a part of heaven and earth, the will of heaven gathered, and energy swept out. If no one absorbed it, new mineral veins might be formed."I'll use it first. Is it okay to use it for a while?""Sure.""Then use it ...""Lord Marquis, aren't you going to leave some for later use?"Lin Hongyu was a little apprehensive. She had used up all of them. If she were to lose all of her energy like before, the era would return to 100000 years ago.

Chapter 2176 There's Nothing That Can't Be Said To Others
"No need!"Li Hao said firmly,"I'll pay you your salary. I hate people who don't pay their salaries!" Back when I was working at the inspection Office, there was a month when my salary was delayed by three days. At that time, I even had the thought of raising my knife to chop the inspection office's director!"“……”Lin Hongyu was speechless.Li Hao laughed."That's why we shouldn't owe them their salaries. They're willing to work for us. Isn't that just to make some money?" Otherwise ... No matter where a transcendent went, would they not be able to feed themselves? Also, get the great desolate King to come to the great wilderness and look around with me ... You can continue doing your job. Ruling the world is also a form of cultivation, a form of cultivation ..."Lin Hongyu did not say much.Since Li Hao had said so, they would do as Li Hao said.……The great desolate King was also an expert.It came very quickly.However, she didn't come alone. She was accompanied by someone, and it was the extremely powerful director Zhao. Clearly, everyone was worried about the great desolate Queen.Even though the great desolate King had already agreed to cooperate and join heavenstar, everyone was still extremely wary of this King of a foreign country.He was not the only one. Although Li Hao had given Empress Dowager shuiyun a lot of autonomy, in fact, there were also people who had been paying attention to her. The same was true for the Li Dynasty.The great desolate Queen seemed to have aged a lot over the past few days.He was old before, but he was full of energy.Now that the desolate beasts had been dealt with, the great wilderness was at peace. However, the great desolate King seemed to be completely old. Li Hao did not assign him any official positions or missions, but he did not care. It was just that ... Seeing millions of elite soldiers divided and a portion still being imprisoned ... The future was filled with fear.As the king of the vast wilderness, he had been in a state of mental breakdown these days.Where will I, Da Huang, go?At this moment, seeing Li Hao again, the great desolate King looked slightly apprehensive and uneasy. Why did Li Hao come to the great wilderness?Looking at the city in the distance, he suppressed the palpitations in his heart and bowed slightly. His voice was a little old,""I ...""It's done," n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Li Hao interrupted him."That day, I said that if you could do it, I would give you a way out of the great wilderness. There's no need to say more about whether you've sinned or not. You're not a subject, and I'm not an Emperor!"Li Hao looked at the city in the distance."I called you here because I want to move the great wilderness to the bright star continent. However, the people of the great wilderness are tough. I want to split the great wilderness ... Spread it all over the country to prevent it from causing trouble!"The Grand desolate King's expression changed. Just as he was about to speak, Li Hao said,""Listen to me! Whether it's the great wilderness or the other three powers of the four countries, in my eyes, they're all the same. Since ancient times, whether it's rebellion or hostility, it's all the desire for power of the higher-ups that has suppressed the people below. " "The commoners have food to eat. Who would be willing to rebel?""This isn't a good era, but it's also a good era!""It's not a good era," Li Hao said softly."It's because there are too many wars, too many powerhouses, and too many order and chaos. Cities can be destroyed at any time! "It's a good era because the four kingdoms and the Central Plains haven't had a war for hundreds of years. Even if there was enmity in the past, it has actually been forgotten by now. The four kingdoms were defeated before they could even attack the Central Plains. Although there were some casualties ... Since ancient times, when war broke out, there have been no wars that didn't kill people. No country would be destroyed just because some people died ..."The great desolate King heaved a sigh of relief.Li Hao continued, so this is an extremely good era of great integration! "The four continents are also merging now, so there won't be too much opposition. Because the cities have changed, there may be strangers, and everyone's sense of rejection toward outsiders is not as strong."The great desolate King could not help but say,"the Marquis is still concerned about the People's livelihood ... You are indeed a Dragon among men ..."Li Hao laughed,"is this considered the livelihood of the people?" In your eyes, the People's livelihood is even more shallow than mine ..."The great desolate Queen was slightly embarrassed.Li Hao ignored him."It's actually easy to arrange for the people. Even if there are many people, the key lies in the higher-ups. I'm telling you in advance in the hope that you can cooperate. Otherwise ... I'll kill the chicken to warn the monkeys! It's the same for you, for shuiyun, for the Li Dynasty, and for everyone else ...""I don't dare!"p The great desolate King hurriedly said,"now, Lord Marquis's combat strength is unparalleled. There are countless powerful soldiers and generals under you. In this era of extraordinary, a single person's might has already surpassed everything. Who would dare to cause trouble?"Li Hao looked at him, but the barren King remained silent.This was the truth.With his great power and the many experts under him, who would dare to rebel at this time?"That's good! Then I will have to trouble the great desolate Queen to call upon the experts under you to migrate the people of the great wilderness!"The great desolate King nodded. No matter how helpless she felt, she could not say anything."Director Zhao, you guys have to worry about these things too. Don't make a clear distinction and treat them differently. The people of shuiyun, the great wilderness, and the four continents can all be mixed together!"Director Zhao nodded his head. This was good too, but the difficulty was still high.He also knew that if he wanted to complete the mission perfectly, he would probably lose a lot of hair. Not only him, but the others would also collapse.And Li Hao had more to do.He then looked at the great desolate King."Before I leave, I hope to strip the people of the great wilderness of all the aura of chaos. Is there any way?""This ..."The great desolation King was stunned. After a long while, he said,""This ... Is very difficult! Of course, it's not impossible to make use of the chaos will, but ... But if that's the case, the chaos will will become stronger, and there might be some accidents ... That would be troublesome. "

Chapter 2177 There's Nothing That Can't Be Said To Others
"Become stronger? How strong will he be?""I'm not sure. It might become a sacred beast?"Who knew? he had never experienced it before."Have you been to the end of the wasteland?" Li Hao nodded."I've been there. It's chaos! It used to be the habitat of desolate beasts, like the void ... It is said that the end is the limit of heaven and earth, and can not be crossed. "It was just as he had guessed.It seemed that that was where the world barrier was."I know, in the great wastelands, if there's anything you can take, take it all! Get your daughter and the White Horse to come over. They will follow me for the time being ...""Lord Marquis, this ..."The great desolate King was a little puzzled, but very quickly, her heart stirred and she nodded.""Alright!"Li Hao seemed to be unmarried. Marriage?At this moment, such a thought appeared in his mind.Li Hao was the king of the world at this moment.Neither Zheng Yu nor venerable Emperor Red Moon could come out at this moment. He was the king of the world.Since Da Huang had already joined them, it wouldn't be a bad idea to have a marriage alliance.Li Hao didn't care what he thought. These people's thoughts would never be in line with his.Vulgar!He had to first absorb Da Huang's Primal Chaos energy and compress it a little so that his domain could cover it. Right now, Zheng Yu and the others were probably thinking of ways to kill him, while li daoheng was probably thinking of ways to strengthen himself and capture heaven's will ... Li Hao also had to race against time.He had to first bring Da Huang into his own system. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt ……The great desolate King left as quickly as he came. Very soon, he went to make arrangements for the migration.Not long after, Princess ni and the White Horse were gone.The White Horse seemed to be a little weak, but Princess ni wasn't afraid. She looked at Li Hao curiously and sized him up. She wasn't familiar with him, but she was also very curious. What kind of person could suppress those arrogant soldiers?Silver moon's side had quite a number of proud soldiers and valiant generals.She didn't come into contact with many people, but those people she came into contact with weren't kind.Lin Hongyu's smile was as gentle as the big sister next door, like needles hidden in cotton.The scholar-like and refined Qian Wuliang looked at people with a horrifying expression. She was a little scared when he looked at her a few times.The kind-looking old man, Zhao Shuguang, looked kind and friendly. He was smiling, but when he laughed, it made people's scalps tingle.And those neo martial artists, each and every one of them was extremely arrogant.Princess ni was puzzled. These people were all working for Li Hao, but Li Hao ... In her eyes, there was nothing special about him. Other than being a little stronger, the neo martial Saint was not any weaker than him.Why were those new martial Saints willing to submit?"What's your name?"“珺!” "What's your surname?""Wu family name!"Li Hao was stunned. Princess ni knew that he didn't understand, so she explained,"The naming custom of the wasteland is different from that of the Central Plains. It is more casual. In fact, there are surnames, but ... We are not very willing to mention them. The pronouncing is very complicated, and it is somewhat related to the wasteland beasts."Li Hao understood.Perhaps it was a race of desolate beasts?A horse? Monkey? Tiger?He didn't probe further. He looked at the White Horse and asked,""This horse, does it have intelligence?""A little.""It's called white cloud,"Princess ni nodded.White cloud?Li Hao smiled."Good name. The one beside me is called Heibao. We can get closer."The Black Panther rolled its eyes. Who would be close to this thing?Princess ni looked at the Black Panther and asked curiously,""It's a dog, right? Why is he called Heibao?"“……”Li Hao laughed,"I used to hope that it would be as brave as a leopard!" Later, I found out that since ancient times, dogs have been stronger than leopards. It was a mistake. It is said that the new martial arts Supreme Emperor heavenly dog is extremely powerful, but the leopard clan doesn't have any Supreme Emperor. "After chatting for a while, Li Hao said,"did your father tell you?" I hope that this White Horse will absorb the chaotic aura from the humans of the great wilderness and not bring it to the Central Plains. Can you complete this mission?""Sure."Princess Yue nodded and thought for a while before saying,"Will the king kill Baiyun?"At this moment, the White Horse under him seemed to be a little restless.As the chaos heaven's will, now that the desolate beast had been killed and the Heaven's Will had swept over, it seemed to know its fate, that it would die sooner or later.Li Hao glanced at the White Horse and said after a long while,""The will of chaos is about to break. If it breaks, I won't care if it doesn't die, but if it dies ... I can't do anything about it."Princess ni was a little depressed, but she knew that this was Li Hao's most sincere answer."I know."He then added,"I am the strongest cavalryman in the wilderness!" I don't want to be a bird in a cage that the people of the Central Plains talk about. Can I join the Demon Hunter Army or take my great desolate Army to participate in the battle?""Battle?""Right!"Princess NI's long hair fluttered in the wind, and she said,""The battle with heavenstar isn't satisfying at all. I want to participate in more Wars!"Li Hao glanced at her and nodded.""After solving the problem of the vast wilderness, you can look for Marshal Huang Yu and ask her to make arrangements. The 10000 elites that you brought with you can join the Demon Hunter Army as a whole. However, now that the enemies from all four sides have been dealt with, if you really want to fight ... Your opponent might not be an Army, but ... A powerful one!""I know. Thank you, my King!"Li Hao had no interest in changing the way she addressed him. He waved his hand and said,""Go!""Ah?""Go and absorb the primal Chaos energy!"Princess ni looked at him in confusion, but didn't say anything. She quickly rode away on her White Horse. However, she felt a little strange. The White Horse was very important, but Li Hao just let her go?

Chapter 2178 There's Nothing That Can't Be Said To Others
Not care?He didn't send anyone to monitor him?Wasn't she afraid ... Well, she didn't seem to be able to do anything to him.Princess Yue quickly disappeared with her White Horse to absorb the chaotic energy from the humans of the great wilderness.……At this moment, Li Hao glanced at Black Panther, sat down cross-legged, and said,""You should have inherited some of your ancestors" devouring power and lightning power. Lightning dispels evil, while devouring purifies everything ..."The Black Panther was stunned for a moment. Devouring was purification?Alright, he had swallowed them all. They had indeed been purified."We've walked out of the Silver City together, from home to where we are today ... Now, everyone's battle strength is rising. You've just stepped into the fourth level of the sun Moon tier, barely breaking through to the undying realm. It's not a high level, and I've brought you along because I can't bear to leave you behind. But you ... Are in great danger."Heibao was a bit dejected.Li Hao said, I have an idea ..."Woof?""The human Emperor has Emperor Cang, the celestial Emperor has the seed, and Li daoheng has the moon god. One controls heaven and earth, and the other represents the will of heaven and earth ..."Heibao was a bit confused.Li Hao continued, I want to refine the great wilderness and make it my world! 'I'm going to capture, kill, and devour all the will of heaven and earth and chaos!' It just so happens that you're good at devouring lightning. Whether it's purification or exorcism, it's an opportunity!"Li Hao continued."At that time, it's possible that you'll become the will of this small world. Of course, you'll still be you. It's just that ... There might be some danger. Whether it's Li daoheng or the others, they might all want to kill you ..."Black Panther blinked and shook his head. He did not refuse, but felt that it did not matter.Li Hao smiled."There's another point. If you take over this mess ... Your future opponent will most likely be the moon goddesses. You'll have to fight them for control of the world!" Do you have the confidence to deal with the number one God in the world?"She was not a Queen, but a real Moon Goddess.A being whose original body was so powerful that even the sword Saint could not kill him. Of course, it might be because he was too lazy to kill him. The original body of the other party was the moon. If he killed him, the moon would collapse, which might not be a good thing for Silver Moon.Woof! Woof! Woof!The Black Panther seemed to be saying that it was fearless!Li Hao nodded,"if you agree, you'll need to do a lot of preparation work!" I need to comprehend Shi to envelop the great wilderness, and you also have many things to do! First, come into contact with the chaos will. Second, come into contact with the Heaven's Will! Third, think of a way to attract more heaven's will to gather ..."The Black Panther's head started to ache. How could he lure it?"So ... You have to go and hook up with the White Horse! Heaven's will hates chaos will, so wherever the White Horse is, it will attract the attention of a portion of heaven's will!"Heibao understood and nodded."One more thing," Li Hao said with a smile."Do you know divine text?" n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Heibao said nothing."If you do, you should know about the existence of domains ... You need to form a domain! No matter how strong or weak you are, you have to form a domain and hide yourself from the will of the heavens. Only then will you have a chance to capture them!"Woof! Woof! Woof!Black Panther nodded again. Li Hao patted its head and said with a smile,""We've already said this, what are you still doing? Go! "At the moment, everyone's eyes are on me, not you. Help me make these preparations ... When I succeed, we can eat and drink well! If you fail ... Then I'll go find master and the others. "Upon hearing this, Black Panther did not say much and left the place in an instant to find the white horse.After the Black Panther left, Li Hao let out a sigh of relief.He didn't continue to stay in the great wilderness. He wanted to go to the Silver City.In the great wilderness, the initial preparations still needed some time."If I go to the Silver City, I can stimulate the Queen and the others so that they can cultivate hard and kill me as soon as possible so that they can enter the Dao universe ..."In addition, there might be some unexpected gains.On the way to the Silver City, he would also have to cultivate the various legacies of the Silvermoon Martial Master and comprehend more Shi.……Li Hao's current speed was very fast, and he came and went without a trace.Silver City had already been emptied during the battle with the Li Dynasty.The personnel had all been evacuated.Now, it was just an empty city.At this moment, a figure was standing in the sky above the Silver City.When Li Hao's figure appeared, some people in the dark became restless. Some wanted to curse, and some wanted to kill.Li Hao was like a haunting ghost!He's back!When Li Hao raised his head to look at the sky, everyone felt that he was trying to break the seal. This made them very nervous.Beams of saintly way aura rose from the surroundings.Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't move.However, the void in the sky appeared and was faintly discernible, as if it was going to leave at any time.Li Hao's voice resounded, Zheng Yu, it'll be difficult for you to kill me if I don't enter the great Dao universe! Unless you come out with your true body and use the power of a half-step sovereign to instantly seal the great Dao universe, making it impossible for me to escape ... Right now, you're only an early stage Sage and can't kill me!""I didn't come here to break the seal ... It's difficult to break it!""I only have one purpose for coming here!"Li Hao's smile was brilliant."I don't have enough cultivation resources. Provide me with 100000 energy stones every day. In addition, I want all the cultivation techniques of neo martial!" You'll also have to provide me with part of the power of the saintly way, the power of immortality, the power of the origin, the power of the Crimson Moon ..."p At this moment, a shadow appeared in the void.With his hands behind his back, Zheng Yu looked at Li Hao and said calmly,""Are you dreaming? What can you do if I don't give it to you?"More saintly way auras burst out.Li Hao smiled."No, I can't do anything about it. I can only shake the seal whenever I have time! The Silver City is my territory, after all, and although I don't have the bloodline of the eight great families, I ... I have control over all the divine weapons of the eight great families ... Although they're broken, they're all in the starry sky sword. "

Chapter 2179 There's Nothing That Can't Be Said To Others
"I shake a few times a day. Although I may not be able to release that person, I shake every now and then. You have to be careful. Be careful not to break the seal if the shaking is too strong."Zheng Yu was extremely cold."You'd better not provoke me like this. When that time comes, I won't hold back anymore. Once I walk out of the hurricane, it'll be the day of your death!"Li Hao laughed,"I'm barefooted, but you're wearing shoes!" Since ancient times, the barefooted had never been afraid of wearing shoes! You have a chance of becoming a venerable sovereign, but I ... I've only just reached the Dao integration stage and am only an early-stage Saint. I'm still a hundred thousand miles away from becoming a venerable sovereign!"After saying that, Li Hao smiled and said,"I won't take it for free. You're a pseudo-Emperor too. You have the dignity of a pseudo-Emperor!" I'll use the power of my great Dao to exchange with you ..."Zheng Yu was startled. Li Hao ... Was he crazy?He cultivated a new Dao, but he used the power of great DAOs to exchange for the power of the new martial Dao.This ... If he wasn't sick, what was he?What was this person after?What was he up to?For a moment, he couldn't be sure, and he couldn't even see through Li Hao.He kept thinking in his heart, why?What was Li Hao's goal?Li Hao chuckled."Don't think about it. I want these only because ... I don't have much power of great DAOs. In addition, I want to pay the wages of cultivators in the world. Now that the star Mine is almost empty, there's no other way! No matter how I think about it, you're the only one who has it ... Most importantly, you can't absorb the power of the new Dao. Even if you absorb a little, it won't hurt! What's not to like?""There's a blood feud between us ... It doesn't matter. When it's time to cooperate and compromise, we're both Masters of one side. An appropriate compromise is still necessary. Zheng Yu, what do you think?"Zheng Yu just looked at him without saying anything.Li Hao said,"it's settled, then. I'll cultivate here and provide you with the power of a great Dao every day. It's right in front of you, and you have to provide me with enough energy. Is that okay?"At this moment, Zheng Yu's mind was filled with a myriad of thoughts.Li Hao ... Was too surprising! He was silent for a moment before he slowly said,"sure!"Li Hao actually wanted to cultivate in front of them and provide them with the power of a great Dao. Was this guy really not afraid that a new Dao expert would appear on his side and then lock onto the great Dao universe?He kept frowning and didn't say anything.It was not a big deal to provide some energy stones every day. Back then, he had a lot of energy stones in his possession. Because he had made preparations long ago, he had not only hoarded a few energy stones from the star Mine.At this moment, both sides had reached a temporary peace agreement for the first time.Exchanging power. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  From this day on, Li Hao really stood in the void of the silver Blizzard city, opened the universe of the great path, and began to cultivate. Some of the power of the great path that overflowed was also absorbed into the void and extracted by others.As for Zheng Yu's side, would he take it for himself to cultivate, or would he give it to Ying Hongyue or the moon goddesses because he was worried that something would go wrong? Li Hao didn't need to speculate. There was a high chance that Zheng Yu wouldn't dare to use it. Even a smart person like Ying Hongyue would be very worried about problems.On the other hand, the Queen ... Might not think too much and be in a hurry for success. In the end, it would most likely fall on the Queen's side.And Li Hao was here to calm them down.Tell them to be quiet and not to cause trouble.I'm right here!You've all seen how I've cultivated and what level I've reached.In fact, everyone had been observing him.After a day of observation, they were all speechless.Li Hao, a Martial Master who didn't do his proper work.He would read neo martial combat techniques, open a few apertures, deal with some temporary official Affairs, and sometimes read some books that had nothing to do with cultivation.However, he had indeed been cultivating all this while. It was just that his speed ... Was not fast.The group of experts stared at him. The change in his aura was actually very easy to notice.At this moment, in Hurricane city, Zheng Yu and Ying Hongyue both felt that Li Hao was definitely planning something. However, no matter how hard they racked their brains, they couldn't figure it out. What exactly was this guy planning?"He has studied so many neo martial arts combat techniques ... Is he going to switch to neo martial arts?"Some people were puzzled. It was strange that Li Hao had seen so many neo martial techniques!If it weren't for the fact that the Dao universe was always open and they could run away at any time, they would have killed Li Hao Long ago.
