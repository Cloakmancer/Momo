On the other hand, the people of the southern Fist clan lacked some direction on the main road.Li Hao glanced at Nanquan. Nanquan's fist techniques were mainly fire-elemental, and fist intent and fire element were the key elements.Stepping into level four was not difficult, but it was not easy either.Li Hao considered for a while before he said,'when comparing the fourth stage and the third stage ... The comprehension of Dao is higher! I, Silvermoon, also have my own strengths. I have a special trait, and that is momentum!""My Silvermoon's Shi is actually a type of God! The strengthening of the gods is also the strengthening of the Dao ..."Li Hao pondered for a while and continued."Force is a breakthrough point to reach the intermediate level. Of course, comprehending Dao is also an advantage ... But at this stage, it's very difficult to comprehend Dao unless you kill a large number of rank seven venerable sovereigns and seize a large number of Dao accumulation crystals ... You have to change your mind and strengthen your spirit and Dao through the power of force to break through this barrier ..."Nan Quan was anxious, scratching his ears and cheeks.""But Shi, without a specialized cultivation method, is very illusionary. It can be said that sometimes, you will inexplicably increase your Shi. In this way, how can you increase your Shi by yourself?"This was even more profound than comprehending the Dao!At the very least, he knew that if there was a seventh-grade Dao accumulation crystal, he could still comprehend it and become powerful. However, he really didn't know how to deliberately become powerful!Li Hao looked at Yuan Shuo.At this moment, Yuan Shuo was staring at second cat, as if he wanted to touch it ... He was very bold.The old devil was the old devil!Seeing his disciple looking over, he came back to his senses. At the side, second cat glanced at him from the corner of his eye and really wanted to whip him to death with his tail! Yuan Shuo saw everyone looking at him and shook his head,""I don't know how you will become stronger, but I will become stronger through the fusion of the five Forces! Accumulating force, nourishing the spirit! This is a method that I've been using in the early years, but it's still usable now, but it's very inefficient!""Then how did you construct your Dao domain so quickly?" Nan Quan asked unhappily. You're hiding your strength, old man. You're afraid we'll surpass you!"Yuan Shuo was speechless and rolled his eyes.Go to hell!He rarely hid anything ... Of course, that was now. In the past, he would definitely have kept something to himself.After some consideration, he added,"Shi is a thing that depends on nurturing and fighting!" "The speed of pure nurturing is definitely slow. I'm so fast because under the fusion of my five powers, the quantity increased and the quality increased! If only one of you is strong, I suggest that you fight more!"It would be useless to say it.  n0vel online free at ùì∑0ùìøùìÆùìµùì´ùì≤ùì∑ Seeing that everyone was speechless, Yuan Shuo had no choice but to add,""Then there's another method, the cultivation realm!"Everyone was confused. What did he mean? Yuan Shuo explained,"find a small realm that is more compatible with you and use your Shi to nurture the realm.! Try to construct a simple domain ... Not a Dao domain!""In my opinion, the world Lord actually has a great advantage. It can become heaven's will. In fact, in my opinion, the greatest advantage of heaven's will is that it can be used to comprehend domains!""It's a pity that the world Masters today seem to be pursuing the great Dao universe ... But they don't think that the great Dao universe is actually the expansion of a domain ...""Li Hao tore down many Dao nets for us. Everyone should have seen that although he didn't tear down the Dao universe, the Dao universe is a Dao net formed by countless great DAOs, which eventually turns into a Dao universe. Then, we can start from a small realm and nurture our own domain. When the domain is nurtured to the extreme, it is actually a Dao domain!"Everyone listened attentively, deep in thought.After all, Yuan Shuo had constructed a Dao domain and was the first person to use a domain. It was a great inspiration and help to everyone.At this moment, Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"this method can be used, but the cultivation realm ... You guys ..."He looked at the crowd and felt a headache.""You have a lot of people, so you might not be able to find a matching Jie. Even if you do, you will need at least 50 Jie ... Sigh!"Damn it, I can't afford to feed this group of people.You guys think of a way!Sharpening a knife would not delay the work of cutting wood. He had also exchanged ideas with the others. Now, everyone was rapidly advancing towards the third rank. The third rank was just the accumulation of energy. After that, entering the fourth rank was the next hurdle.It was difficult for these people to reach level four, but if they did, it meant that it would not be difficult for them to reach level six.He had a bunch of low-rank venerable sovereigns on his side. As for the middle-rank venerable sovereigns, even Lin Hongyu, who had advanced a long time ago, was still stuck at the third rank.The two masters of the great Dao were simple. Before Level Seven, it was not difficult. In any case, if the 10000 DAOs were strong, they would be strong. It could be considered a sleeping victory.However, it might be a little difficult to advance to the seventh level. Although the great Dao universe was the standard for the seventh level, there were also many masters of the sixth level great Dao who were still stuck at the sixth level.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶After the exchange, Li Hao began to make arrangements.This time, it no longer devoured the two rank six worlds. Instead, it used the Earth Dragon World as a Foundation to construct a fake universe of the great path, attracting countless experts.Five days had passed since the one-month deadline.It would also take time to spread the news. It would take some time for others to arrive, even for cultivators near the Dragon field. The chaos was too big. It was a problem how many worlds could arrive in a month.Moreover, there were too many venerable sovereigns. How could they lure them in and kill them one by one instead of all at once? otherwise, it would be difficult for Li Hao and Kong Ji to kill so many venerable sovereigns at the same time, no matter how strong they were.

Chapter 3251 Seventh-Tier Universe
He had to have a way!On this day, in the Earth Dragon World, a faint fluctuation of the great Dao universe began to spread out. Indistinctly, an incomparably huge Earth Dragon floated above the world, covering the sky and the sun!The aftermath of the great Dao began to spread.The first to sense it were the nearby rank 6 worlds. At this moment, the few rank 6 sector Lords were both shocked and happy.He was shocked because the Earth Dragon World seemed to be about to give birth to a great Dao universe.They were happy because ... The Earth Dragon Supreme Emperor was a rank seven Supreme Emperor. Others might not know, but they did.Since he was a seventh level venerable sovereign ... Although the great Dao universe was very important ... The other party only wanted to use it to purify the power of the great Dao. Did that mean ... He could temporarily lend it to a sixth level sovereign to try to advance to the seventh level?There was still hope!As for the fact that the Earth Dragon World could really advance to a tier 7 world ... Everyone was still somewhat surprised. Although the Earth Dragon Thearch was strong, logically speaking, his comprehension of Dao and the management of the world were ordinary.He really didn't expect that he would be able to advance.The Earth Dragon World did not have a better chance of advancing to the seventh rank than the Tianhuang world.However, at this moment, they couldn't care too much ... Soon, the nearby rank six worlds rushed over. They were all on the same side, and they didn't dare to go to ordinary worlds when they were upgrading.But here, they were all on the same side. They were all cultivators of the dragon world. Even if they couldn't get a share, watching the sixth-tier world give birth to the seventh-tier great path universe was also a form of experience and enlightenment.The fluctuations of the great Dao began to spread!Very few people had ever seen a medium-level world advance to a high-level world.In the nearby area, the fluctuation of the great path spread down, and more and more venerable sovereigns sensed it.In order to spread the news faster, Li Hao even took the risk of having Black Panther return to his original territory as Supreme Emperor Black Dog, and then spread the news along the way. As for why a Lord of the Fire Phoenix Sector had received the news earlier than them ... That was not something that everyone was concerned about.Maybe, it was the fire Phoenix realmlord who informed him?Who knows!Some venerable sovereigns who didn't know about the news before soon received the news that the Earth Dragon Realm was about to advance to a level Seven world and a universe of great DAOs would appear!The news quickly spread!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.Outside the light world.  Best novel online free at üá≥‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüáª‚Äãüá™‚Äãüá±‚Äãüáß‚ÄãüáÆ‚Äãüá≥‚Äã At this moment, a battle broke out. The three experts finally decided to join forces to deal with light first.The radiant master was in charge of the local territory and was very powerful. Although the Dragon Master also led a world and was extremely powerful, the Dragon Master was not stupid enough to go all out and charge into the enemy lines. He was still counting on Red Moon master to help.Under such circumstances, the two sides had been entangled for a few days. Although there were seventh-tier cultivators who were injured, they had not completely broken through the light realm so far. Just as the two sides stopped fighting, the Dragon Lord suddenly looked in the direction of the Dragon field.In his arms, a crystal was shining.After a while, he received news from the dragon world. Although he had left with the dragon world, it was impossible for him to not have any control over it.Two things!First, the lightning Lord invited Zhan Feng.Second, the Earth Dragon Realm was about to advance to a level-seven great Dao universe.The first thing was not too surprising, but he was not surprised. The Thunderbolt master actually had no other choice!However, the second matter ... The Earth Dragon was indeed a level Seven venerable sovereign, but the management of the Earth Dragon World could only be said to be ... Barely satisfactory. It was not even comparable to Tianhuang world. He even thought that he had made a mistake!Tianhuang had a higher chance of advancing to tier 7.But now, it turned out to be the Earth Dragon Realm.Although he was surprised, it was indeed a good thing.However ... The Dragon Master still frowned slightly. He didn't care about Hong Yue and Yun Xiao and quickly returned to the dragon world. At this moment, there were eight Level Seven venerable sovereigns in the dragon world. Only four of them had revealed their identities to the outside world. They were all from the dragon clan. The other four had been in hiding."Dragon Lord!""That Earth Dragon actually nurtured a level-seven universe ... That's incredible!"At this moment, the other experts were also discussing. They were all surprised and envious.With a universe, the increase in battle strength was secondary. To the Beasts of Chaos, the increase was limited. The key was that they could continuously purify their power of great DAOs!This also meant that there was hope for them to reach level eight. It was no longer hopeless. At this stage, it was almost impossible for them to reach level eight."I can't believe it. The Earth Dragon is not weak, that's undeniable ... But its Earth Dragon World is a mess and not as well-managed as Tianhuang world ... I'm starting to suspect that there's a mistake. Tianhuang is about to level up, but it's not far away. Is there a misunderstanding?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùEveryone ridiculed and was a little envious, but they didn't really think that there was a mistake. Maybe that Earth Dragon guy really had some dog shit luck!The Dragon Lord also smiled slightly."This is a good thing!""It's just that ... The Earth Dragon is nurturing a level Seven world. To be honest, I didn't expect it at all!" After some consideration, he frowned and said,""Now, Red Moon and cloudy sky are not willing to go all out against light. I can't expose too much either. If this stalemate continues, light will probably be unable to hold on. But I can't go back now. Advancing to rank seven is a big deal ..."After much consideration, he decided to send a rank seven venerable sovereign back to take a look.First, he had to congratulate the Earth Dragon.The second was to see if they could discuss it and let a sixth-level venerable sovereign temporarily control the universe before the great path universe was completely formed. He might have a chance of reaching the seventh-level, which would mean an additional seventh-level combat power. Although it was somewhat unfair to the Earth Dragon, he could compensate him.

Chapter 3252 Seventh-Tier Universe
Thirdly ... This was the first time a Chaos Beast had nurtured a seventh-tier universe by itself without relying on the human race. If not for the situation not allowing it, he would have wanted to go back and see how the Earth Dragon had done it.If it could be popularized, a level Seven could nurture it by himself ... Then there were many Level Seven cultivators on his side, and they could all nurture a great Dao universe. What was the need for humans?Just kill them all!Of course, it was just a thought. He couldn't do it now.As for the Thunderbolt master's challenge, he also had some words he wanted to convey to the fire Phoenix. Although he could send a message over, it was difficult to do so in the chaos. It might not be in accordance with his wishes.In addition, he was a little suspicious. The Earth Dragon ... Would there be any problems?How did it suddenly advance to a level-seven universe?The Thunderbolt master's sudden challenge instead of following his original plan of ambushing the dragon world and the other worlds was also unexpected. From what he understood, the Thunder Emperor was a little impulsive and reckless, but he was not brainless ... He had used up a lot of his great Dao's power. Did he think he could defeat a peak seventh-rank Fire Phoenix?After a long time, he looked at a Type 7 Dragon and said,""Long Xuan ... Go back to the Dragon field for me! "First, tell the fire Phoenix to be careful. Since the Thunder Emperor dared to challenge her, he might have some confidence. He might have obtained a great Dao crystal by accident to replenish his energy. We must be careful about this matter!""Second, make a trip to the Earth Dragon World ... And convey my congratulations to the Earth Dragon for successfully nurturing the world! In addition, discuss with him if you can give the opportunity to control the great Dao universe to the Tianhuang Overlord. Tianhuang is quite talented and has a chance to reach Level Seven ...""Of course, I will give the Earth Dragon some compensation. When I return, I will reward him!""There's one more thing ..."The Dragon Lord said.He frowned and said,"ask the earth Dragon ... Why he could suddenly advance to a world. Of course, if he doesn't want to tell me, then forget it. There's no need to force him ... I can ask him when I get back. However ... This time, it's a little too fast. I've been observing the nearby Tier 6 worlds. Other than planet Tianhuang, I don't think the other worlds can advance to a new world."Long Xuan, a rank seven Dragon, quickly replied,""My Lord, right now ... We need people. I'll leave ..."Even though the Dragon Lord had brought a total of eight rank seven venerable sovereigns with him!However, there were a bunch of Level 7s in the three regions. One less person meant one less force."It's fine!"The Dragon Lord said with a smile,"one less dragon race on the surface, those fellows will be a little more at ease instead!" There's only about 20 days left until the battle with the Thunderbolt master. At this moment, the universe can't cover you, so you can only hurry on your way. It'll take at least ten days ... Be careful on the way!""Understood!""If the Earth Dragon is unwilling to transfer the Dao universe to planet Tianhuang ..." Thearch longxuan nodded."Then forget it!"The Dragon Master did not force him and smiled."He's capable of nurturing a seventh-tier universe. That's his own ability. I'm very curious though." I even suspect that this guy is secretly working with some human powerhouses ... But ... Forget it. As long as this guy doesn't mess around, we don't have to worry too much. "He didn't really believe that he could nurture a level-seven universe on his own without cooperating with the human race.That was a Dao domain. It was formed from the interweaving of many great DAOs to form a Dao universe. It did not mean that a powerful great Dao, which was a chaos great Dao, could create a Dao domain."Alright, I'll be back soon ...""No need. You can return after the matters in the Thunder World are over! If we can take down the Thunder World, that's for the best. If we can 't, then we'll just put it aside for the time being. ""Yes, sir!"Sovereign longxuan did not say anything more. There was no great path universe to return from the world of light. As a seventh level sovereign, his speed was not slow. However, it would take more than ten days to maintain his power and not overexert himself.It just so happened that the matter of the Thunder World and the earth Dragon's advancement were mixed together. He didn't know if it would affect one side.Soon, he left.The Dragon Master also left the dragon world very quickly. He explained to the two venerable sovereigns, Yunxiao and Hongyue,""There's an internal problem in the Dragon field. A large realm is rebelling. I asked the longxuan to go back and deal with it."The two of them realized that Red Moon master seemed to have guessed that it was the Thunder World and had not said anything. Now that she had said it ... The other party wanted to destroy the human race's macro world, or even the only human race's macro world, should they still try to persuade her?He couldn't be bothered with this!Venerable sovereign Yunxiao had also heard about it. He smiled but did not say anything. He only looked at the divine light realm with a cold gaze. Over the past few days, several seventh rank venerable sovereigns from the divine light realm had been injured quite badly.He had almost killed Supreme Emperor Yao yang, who was at the peak of rank seven.Light, this old thing, still didn't compromise, did he really want to destroy the world? It was a pity that Hong Yue and the Dragon Master did not put in much effort. Otherwise, they would have taken over the divine light plane long ago!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.Within the divine light realm.The light Thearch was silent. Three rank eight venerable sovereigns had attacked. Although he had the geographical advantage, the Dragon Lord had also brought the world here. However, he had not done much in the past few days and had only pestered a few rank seven venerable sovereigns.However ... Even so, Yun Xiao and Hong Yue had joined forces to besiege him, and there were also a few seventh-tier Dragons involved. He was a little out of power.Yao yang was seriously injured. If this continued ... They could only surrender and sign the great Dao agreement.Otherwise, the light would be extinguished!'Damn it!'These guys were detestable.He was a little conflicted about signing the great Dao agreement to deal with neo martial, but now, it seemed like there was no way out.On the side, the severely injured Supreme Emperor Yao yang gritted his teeth and said,""Boss, we can't compromise. Let's fight them to the end. As long as we can kill Hong Yue and a type 8 powerhouse, their alliance will be broken!"The radiance Supreme Emperor was speechless. 'I know, but do you really think that a Crimson Moon without a world is a waste?'How could it be that simple!You're too confident in my strength."It's already difficult to fight one against two, and there are still a few tier 7 experts involved. I'll be considered strong enough if I don't get killed.Supreme Emperor Yao yang continued,"at most ... We'll fight to the death and let someone break out. Or you can break out and look for Ming Tang yourself. He's about to enter Level Seven. After you die, you can pass on the great path universe to him. Ming Tang will definitely become Level Seven, or even level eight ... By then, we'll naturally take revenge ..."Go to hell!"Damn it!" Radiance Supreme Emperor cursed in his heart."Is there something wrong with this guy's brain?"  Best novel online free at üá≥‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüáª‚Äãüá™‚Äãüá±‚Äãüáß‚ÄãüáÆ‚Äãüá≥‚Äã Are you cursing me?I'm still alive and well, why should I pass the world to my son?Besides, I don't even know where that kid went, so how am I supposed to find him?He couldn't help but curse inwardly. If it wasn't for this brat who had to collude with neo martial ... Fine, he had to be friends with the Silver Moon King. How could this happen? even Yunxiao, this brat, dared to bully me!This kid, he wouldn't do it on purpose, right?He can't be thinking that he can inherit the family business if I'm killed, right?Otherwise, a level eight venerable sovereign ... His son might not be able to live longer than him if he did not reach Level Seven.It was too difficult for the children of powerhouses to inherit the family business!There were countless chaotic worlds, but there were very few children of Dao Masters who could inherit the family business. Unless there was an accident, it was rare for someone to inherit the Dao universe like Sen LAN, let alone children. Sighing in his heart for a long time, he suddenly said,""Hold on for a few more days. If ... There's no other way, I can only compromise! After all, compared to the destruction of the world, joining forces with them to attack neo martial, at least the crisis in the future will be further away than now!"Sovereign Yao yang was speechless. After a long time, he said,""What a pity. The last time I met the human King, he was actually a pretty good person ..."The radiance Thearch shook his head and did not say anything."I know that, but ... In the chaos, there is no morality to speak of. I will not really bury my light for neo martial.Son ... It's a pity, I can't do anything about it.In the future, if you are still entangled with the Silver Moon King or even join forces with new martial, I may not be able to take care of you.

Chapter 3253 Tianfang Is Recovering Again!
Fire Phoenix World.There was still some time before the battle. At this moment, the fire Phoenix realm was shifting towards the Thunder World.Meanwhile, in the city in the sky.The fire Phoenix realm master had also received the news. He was slightly surprised,"the Earth Dragon World has actually advanced to the seventh stage ... Also, the external Affairs elder that you took in previously is also moving towards that direction. It seems like he is quite well-informed."Li Hao knew that the external Affair venerable sovereigns of the fire Phoenix realm all had their positions. Previously, he had left the source of the position in an Ethereal Plane.And now, the Black Panther had returned with the void realm.He didn't try to hide it anymore. Instead, he headed straight for the Earth Dragon World. Naturally, his location was exposed.The Dragon elder was surprised.""The Earth Dragon World has learned...This is out of my expectations."The fire Phoenix Sector Lord nodded.It was indeed unexpected.However, at this moment, she did not have the time to go over there to take a look. The Thunder World was about to be surrounded. Not only could she not leave, but the type 7 Dragon and the other Type 7 Phoenix could not leave either.Only with three Grade 7 experts would they have full confidence in taking down the Thunder World.As for the other big realms nearby, it would be best if they didn't take action. If they did, there would be a big dispute over the ownership of the Thunder World."Did venerable Emperor Black Dog refine a rank six world? He left so quickly. Although the Dragon field doesn't have any restrictions, it's still under the dragon world's jurisdiction. If we go there rashly, we might cause some trouble. "Previously, he had wanted the Black Dog to capture the human cultivator of faith that the Dragon Lord had ordered to capture. In the end, that fellow had actually escaped. The fire Phoenix realm Lord said,"since that's the case ... Feng Yan, the Earth Dragon Realm's advancement is a joyous occasion for the Dragon field. I don't have the time to go there to congratulate you personally. You should go and congratulate the Earth Dragon Emperor on my behalf!" You can come back after I take down the Thunder World. "It was better to be careful in a battle between two armies.It would be best if his daughter did not participate in the battle. He did not have a suitable reason or excuse before. Now that the other party had advanced, it was a joyous occasion for chaos. It would be safer there. Moreover, there was also Earth Dragon, a seventh level venerable sovereign.The Earth Dragon knew Feng Yan's identity.The Dragon Lord's daughter.He would naturally protect Feng Yan.Black Dog, the Foreign Affairs elder, had gone. It was normal and reasonable for Feng Yan to go with him. This way, the other venerable sovereigns in the fire Phoenix realm would not say anything."Mother ..."The Phoenix Flame Thearch was in a dilemma. Before the war, his mother still had to fight with the Thunder Emperor. If he left now ... Wouldn't he be a deserter?"The advancement of a world is a big deal. It's been many years since a new rank seven world has been born in the Dragon field! I and a few grade-7s have important matters to attend to and can't leave. Only you can represent my Fire Phoenix realm! This time, many venerable sovereigns from other macro worlds will also go to congratulate you ..."He then added,"if you have the chance, you can observe the newly-born great path universe. I believe the Earth Dragon Imperial Emperor will not refuse you to observe. We don't need to occupy his great path universe." Because he didn't like it.My daughter will only use the great Dao universe of the Thunder World to advance!He would become the next Master of the Thunder World!Feng Yan still wanted to say something, but the fire Phoenix Sector Lord made the final decision,""Go! This is an important matter. The Earth Dragon Supreme Emperor is a seventh rank Supreme Emperor. If you see him, you can be polite to him. It will be of help to you in the future. "His words had a deep meaning.Beside him, the old dragon also chuckled and nodded.""Your Highness Feng Yan, please go and greet him for me. The Earth Dragon is a straightforward person and is easy to get along with. We will have the opportunity to get in touch with him in the future."Feng Yan looked at the two of them. After a long time, he finally nodded, a little depressed.She was prepared to personally participate in the battle.A sixth rank venerable sovereign was still qualified to participate in the battle.Unfortunately, his mother did not agree.Seeing that Feng Yan had agreed, the fire Phoenix Sector Lord smiled. However, he soon frowned and said,""I'm going. I'm going to warn the Black Dog venerable sovereign that there must be some rules in the Dragon field! Venerable sovereigns of the fire Phoenix realm, do not cross the border rashly! When you go this time, don't bring the venerable sovereigns of Fire Phoenix. Bring some venerable sovereigns of External Affairs to protect you along the way ...""Mother, is there a need to do this? I'm already at the peak of the sixth step ...""I want it!"The fire Phoenix realmlord spoke,"if it isn't because the situation doesn't allow for it, we would at least need a large number of middle stage venerable sovereigns to protect you. We will clear a path for you ..."  Best novel online free at üá≥‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüáª‚Äãüá™‚Äãüá±‚Äãüáß‚ÄãüáÆ‚Äãüá≥‚Äã Because you're the Daughter of the Dragon Lord!Ostentatiousness was a must.This is also your first time going to the dragon world and coming into contact with the top experts there. You can't let the Earth Dragon underestimate you."If it wasn't for the danger of the Thunder World right in front of us, the seventh-grade elder of the fire Phoenix realm would have to go with you this time. Only then can you show off your status and the power of the fire Phoenix realm!It was already a little embarrassing to bring some inferior Foreign Affairs venerable sovereigns. It would be even more embarrassing if he didn't bring any!Fortunately, there was still the Black Dog. It was at least a fifth-rank beast, so he still had some face.After some consideration, Emperor Phoenix Flame didn't refuse, and he couldn't refuse.He was just puzzled. It was indeed a big deal that the seventh rank venerable sovereign in the dragon world had advanced to the world realm. However, to leave the Thunder World in front of him and ask him to leave ... Alright, although he was not a seventh rank and could not play a decisive role, his mother was too concerned about those unrelated venerable sovereigns.He had many doubts in his heart, but he didn't say anything.Soon, Thearch Phoenix Flame left.After they left, the fire Phoenix Sector Lord looked at the two rank 7 experts beside him and spoke,""There's some vague news from the Dragon Master's side, and he told me to be careful ... It seems that he's sent someone back. It looks like he's still worried about us."

Chapter 3254 Tianfang Is Recovering Again!
He felt somewhat helpless. The Thunder World had already come to this point, yet the Dragon Lord was still worried. Did he overestimate the Thunder Lord, or ... Did he feel that he was incompetent?If he still couldn't take down a level 7 world that had been out of food for many years, then he would be underestimating himself.Moreover, the Thunder world's inner circle was full of sieves, and she had planted many people inside.From what he had learned from the inside, the venerable sovereigns hadn't obtained any great Dao crystals yet and were still in a difficult situation.  Best novel online free at n0ŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶On this day, a large number of venerable sovereigns set out for the Earth Dragon Realm.It was not just the venerable sovereigns near the dragon world. There were also experts from other large fields, including the 12 large fields of the chaos alliance. Other than the dragon world, experts from the other 11 large fields, even those far away, had also come to congratulate him.World advancement was different from a person reaching the seventh step.For a world to enter the 7th rank, it means that ... You can start your own force.Yes, power!With the great path universe, one could cultivate venerable sovereigns, but without the great path universe, it would be difficult to cultivate venerable sovereigns. A medium world could produce venerable sovereigns, but the problem was, without the great path universe, who would be willing to join a medium world?At the very least, he would not be able to absorb any real powerhouses!Even if you're a sector Lord Level 7, it's useless!Only those who had given birth to a great Dao universe, and even sixth-stage venerable sovereigns, would be willing to come to you.For example, the red moon world. When there was a world, even a level Seven venerable was willing to join it ... Although it was very rare, but now, the red moon sovereign had become a rogue cultivator, and even a level Seven venerable sovereign was too lazy to follow him.There wasn't much benefit to it!This was the difference between a rank 7 world and a rank 7 individual. One could nurture people, while the other was only powerful.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Earth Dragon World.The Earth Dragon's Shadow was still covering the sky and the earth. It was a fake illusion created by the burning of the Earth Dragon Emperor's blood essence, bones, and flesh.No one would have thought that this rank seven venerable sovereign would be killed without a sound.Those with such capabilities were all within everyone's sight. A seventh level venerable sovereign was in the core of the Dragon field. The Thunderbolt master and the five demon lords were all waiting in their nests. The new martial and Chi Yang experts were still fighting. Who would dare to come here and hunt the Earth Dragon?At this moment, five days had passed since the fluctuations of the great path of the universe had spread.Ten days had passed since the one-month deadline.There were already many chaos beasts circling around the Earth Dragon World, but they didn't dare to get close and only looked from afar. Some nearby rank six worlds had arrived early and even the uninhabited Tianhuang world had been dragged over to create a false image.In the world, the Silver Moon Emperor stood still. Soon, Qian Wuliang's figure flickered and appeared.""Lord Marquis, there are already 27 sector Lords in the vicinity. Some brought their worlds, some didn 't. Three sixth stage venerable sovereigns, three fifth stage venerable sovereigns, nine fourth stage venerable sovereigns, and the rest are all low stage venerable sovereigns!"The proportion of medium venerable sovereigns was very high.As this was the core of the dragon world, the closer it was to the dragon world, the higher the level of the world. Thus, the worlds that had come so far were those that were very close. Five days was actually not a large area within the chaos.The fact that these middle and low-stage venerable sovereigns could arrive in five days meant that they had been in the area." 15 middle-stage venerable sovereigns and 12 low-stage venerable sovereigns ... No, there might be other venerable sovereigns in the medium-level worlds. In that case, they've come to the 27 worlds ... Right?""En!"Qian Wuliang nodded. Yes, this was only a world. Usually, when a Chaos Beast moved, it would bring a world with it. Otherwise, Qian Wuliang might forget where he put the world.Moreover, if there were no venerable sovereigns in the realm and a passing venerable sovereign ate it, do you know who ate it?He did not know.If they swallowed it in one gulp, you wouldn't even have a place to cry.Since they could, these chaos beasts were willing to take the world with them. A few venerable sovereigns didn't because there were other venerable sovereigns in the world. When venerable sovereigns fought, the Dragon Master would care, but those below venerable sovereigns ... No one would care even if they died.There were too many things to manage."It's about time to harvest a batch. I can't gather too many!"Li Hao said,"we're close to 30 worlds. Let's harvest them first. Otherwise, there will be more and more later!" It's called bed universe, so it covers all of them, right?""It's covered!"Gan Wuliang was also speechless. He could not help but ask,"Lord Marquis is wise. If it was in the other three regions, it would be called universe coverage. Everyone knows that this is a very dangerous thing. But here, these guys think it's an opportunity. There's pure power spreading out, and they even take the initiative to approach ..."Li Hao chuckled."It's normal. This is one of the drawbacks of unifying royal power ... Everyone thinks that when there's nothing happening within the realm, the great Dao universe will be reborn and the power of the great Dao will overflow. Instead, it's an opportunity to absorb the power of the great Dao ..."It was too normal!It was equivalent to the power of a great Dao overflowing near Li Hao's Palace in the Silvermoon world. Would Li Hao's subordinates stay away for fear of danger?Naturally, he wouldn 't!They would definitely be excited and absorb some of it from the side. He believed that Li Hao would not harm them.It was the same logic.This was the territory of the Dragon Lord. In the eyes of these chaos beasts, the Dragon Lord was almost an invincible existence. He was the Overlord and the Saint of the chaos beasts.Who would suspect that there was danger near the dragon world?Li Hao's eyes gradually turned cold,"be prepared for danger in times of peace. I hope that everyone will always remember this principle!" The Beasts of Chaos have been living in peace in the Dragon field for too long. Let's remind them that humans are stronger in this world!"

Chapter 3255 Tianfang Is Recovering Again!
"Since the bed universe has already covered ... Then ... Do it! Everyone, enter the great Dao universe!"In an instant, the great path universe split open.The venerable sovereigns quickly entered the great Dao universe. At that moment, those worlds were nearby, and the great Dao universe directly enveloped them. With the great Dao universe, it was much easier to descend!A Thunderbolt strike would do!"Let's go!"The long river of the great path churned, and the group of people quickly began to advance.This time, he did not attack them one by one but at the same time. None of the more than 20 worlds could escape!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶There were three rank 6 worlds here, excluding planet Tianhuang.Of these three, Li Hao would descend on one, the empty one, and the remaining one would be handed over to the two Dao Masters. As for the remaining low-level worlds, they would be left to venerable Emperor Silver Moon to deal with.As for the remaining medium-level worlds, Heaven's Fate and the others would attack a few of them. As for the rest, they would deal with them one by one after Li Hao and the others defeated their opponents. At this moment, the weakness of Silver moon's lack of medium venerable sovereigns was revealed.Once they split up, they would lack the main force.Near the Earth Dragon World.In cold cicada world.This was a rank six world, and the world Lord was a chaos cicada. It was rare even in the chaos. Although it also cultivated the chaos Dao, its main attack was the more special sound wave Dao.As soon as the cicadas chirped, the opponent would be killed in an instant before they could even react.At this moment, in the world, the huge cold cicada was greedily absorbing the power of the great path. It was somewhat happy. The power of the great path in the newly born great path universe was indeed abundant. The key was that it could not control the overflow.In the past few days, it had been absorbing the energy very quickly.It felt great!If it wasn't for its fear of the Earth Dragon Emperor, it would have even wanted to enter the great Dao universe to take a look ... Because for the first time, it could clearly sense the existence of the great Dao universe, and it was even right above its head!He was too close!It was so close that it wanted to tear the void apart and enter directly. Unfortunately, the Earth Dragon was a seventh level venerable sovereign, after all, so it did not dare to be too presumptuous.He was greedily absorbing the power of the great Dao when he suddenly sensed the fluctuations of the great Dao universe. He was a little confused. Why? was there any movement inside the great Dao universe?Just as it was thinking about this, a person appeared above its head.Li Hao also sighed!He was so greedy!The universe of the great path is right above your head, and you dare to absorb the power of the great path from below ... Do you really think I'm giving you the power of the great path for free?There was no such thing as a free lunch in this world!If you don't even understand this ... Then you deserve to die! Without any words, a long sword appeared in his hand. It was the firmament sword, but it was no longer a fourth level monarch weapon, it had advanced to the fifth level!A thousand worlds converged, and the power of destruction emerged. The Dao domain suppressed everything, as if the Tribulation of chaos lightning had descended!In an instant, the sword struck out!The Dao domain had suppressed the rank six venerable sovereign. Before he could come to his senses or even react, the distance was too close ... In an instant, cold cicada's sorrowful cry was heard!  Best novel online free at n0ŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  BOOM!The lightning was destructive, and the world seemed to be crumbling. The sword slashed down, and with a crack, it cut him in two.As soon as the daosource appeared, he waved his sword and completely shattered it, causing a large amount of chaotic power to leak out.Even until his death, he still didn't understand ... Why?It wasn't the only one!At that moment, battles broke out in many worlds around them. While Li Hao was fast, Kong Ji was not slow either. In an instant, he froze and destroyed a level six venerable sovereign!The great Nirvana was unleashed and the fist of six paths was unleashed, tearing a Chaos Beast into pieces! The present emptiness was more somber and brutal than before.He had never used the six divine fists before.He preferred to use techniques that seemed to be very impressive, such as the great Nirvana, the intersection of light and darkness, and the extraction of life and death. However, after fighting the earthly Dragon beast, Kong Ji learned one thing ... Even a Lion had to use all its strength when hunting a rabbit, lest it capsize in an easy task.The six divine punches that could break the body of a seventh stage venerable sovereign were launched right away. The poor sixth stage venerable sovereign did not even have the time to scream before he was smashed into pieces and died on the spot!There were still some worlds that hadn't been attacked yet. From a distance, Li Hao and Kong Ji could see that some of them were still in the midst of battle. In the next moment, Li Hao and Kong Ji teleported and appeared above the two tier 5 worlds.This was the use of the Dao universe!Otherwise, there would be some gaps between these worlds, and it would take at least some time for venerable sovereigns to move. However, with the universe called bed, which was still within its coverage, one could teleport!Of course, there was also a danger. It was easy to expose the location of the great Dao universe. With experts here, it was easy to attack!But Li Hao and Kong Ji clearly didn't care.When the two of them appeared, the fifth level venerable sovereigns of the two worlds did not even have time to retreat. In the blink of an eye, they could easily kill sixth level venerable sovereigns, let alone fifth level venerable sovereigns. They were completely crushed!Crack!The level five venerable sovereign in front of him was killed by Li Hao on the spot like a piece of paper!Only then did screams begin to erupt from the surroundings!The venerable sovereigns roared madly, but their voices couldn't spread out at all. This was the chaos, and it was covered by the great Dao universe ...In the distance, the Silver Moon Emperor roared in excitement.This time, they were using force even more!Yuan Shuo had said that the strength of momentum was mainly dependent on combat. These venerable sovereigns had also listened to his advice and erupted one after another. Some were evenly matched, some were slightly weaker, but they were all extremely excited!

Chapter 3256 Tianfang Is Recovering Again!
At this moment, some venerable sovereigns regained their senses and shouted,""Human, enemy attack ..."It was too fast!They didn't even know what had happened before they were suddenly attacked. A few sixth stage venerable sovereigns were killed in the blink of an eye. It was even more terrifying!Li Hao ignored their screams and looked into the distance. The aura of death appeared. Lin Hongyu quickly killed a venerable sovereign and headed to the next world. The dead venerable sovereigns were gathering in the dark land behind her.Hell of death!  Best novel online free at n0ŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  These venerable sovereigns were being resurrected. Lin Hongyu's side was killing more and more people. Although these venerable sovereigns could not maintain their long-term combat strength, they would be of great help in the short term.One kill meant one more guard!Lin Hongyu finally understood the way of death. Li Hao was a little confused. If the venerable sovereigns he killed could be resurrected ... That would be incredible. He had killed earthly Dragon beasts, qishui, and red Moon rank seven venerable sovereigns ...If that was the case, didn't that mean that he now had three level Seven venerable sovereigns under his command?Of course, there seemed to be some restrictions.That was, it seemed that only the ones she killed were useful.Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. Ignoring the others, he disappeared and reappeared in front of Lin Hongyu. Lin Hongyu was stunned. Li Hao pulled her up and disappeared. In the blink of an eye, they appeared in the last rank 6 world.At that moment, the two Dao Masters were attacking each other and had the upper hand. It was an extremely huge bear!As soon as Li Hao appeared, he didn't say anything. A long sword appeared and slashed out. Destructive power burst out. With a boom, the giant bear was pierced through, but it didn't die. Instead, it struggled violently!"Last hit!"Lin Hongyu didn't say anything. She appeared with her blood-red scimitar and slashed. The power of death exploded. With a boom, she cut his body. Another slash cut his Dao origin.Li Hao watched silently. After a while, he looked at Lin Hongyu.Lin Hongyu shook her head."Turn into a dead spirit and become my guard. This won't do. There are some rules in the chaos, or rather, there are some rules in the great Dao. I can turn into a dead spirit, provided that its fatal injury was left behind by my Dao of death!"Li Hao was deep in thought."You mean, as long as I trap it and let you kill it, I can become your undead guard?""Yes, but ... It can't be too strong!"Lin Hongyu added,"although they don't need me to control them, they need to be within the range of my hell of death. If they are too powerful, they will burst my hell of death ... Then, not only will they not be able to become my undead guards, but the others will also be killed! I'm only rank three now, so I can probably only withstand a rank four venerable sovereign ..."There was a limit.Li Hao frowned, but he soon felt relieved. It would be too terrifying if there were no limits. The Dao of life and death ... No, the Dao of death could dominate the world with just one Dao! If you killed one or picked up the body of a level nine venerable sovereign, wouldn't you be invincible?"What a pity!"Li Hao was somewhat regretful."There are three stage six experts here ... It's a pity that I missed it.""You're a fourth-rank, do you feel anything?""Slaughter!"Lin Hongyu did not hold back."The more experts I kill, the stronger the power of death will be ... Many venerable sovereigns have died recently. Actually, I have a vague feeling that it will be soon. This batch of venerable sovereigns has all been killed. I will absorb the power of death ... Perhaps I will have the hope of entering rank four. Killing is the best way to comprehend and advance the Dao of death!"However, only Li Hao had such an opportunity. He had killed too many venerable sovereigns in such a short time!"That's good. I hope you can advance to rank four soon ... If you can advance to rank four, you might be able to control rank six venerable sovereigns ... At that time, you'll be in the death Army!"Li Hao laughed."We're short of a core force. Although Kong Ji and I can kill a level 7, we're no match for them. A level 7 great world doesn't just have Level 7 venerable sovereigns. There are also a large number of middle-stage venerable sovereigns ... And we lack such power!"At present, they had only broken through the small and medium-sized worlds.There were nearly a hundred venerable sovereigns in the great world!The fire Phoenix realm, for example, was extremely terrifying. There were hundreds of venerable sovereigns.Although many of them were venerable sovereigns of External Affairs.When they attacked the four great worlds, more than 30 venerable sovereigns of Senlan had participated in the battle, and a number of them had died.Without the Senlan monarch pestering those venerable sovereigns, it would have been difficult to take down the Crimson Moon world that day.Many ants could kill an elephant. Moreover, venerable sovereigns were not ants. At least for Li Hao, it was not difficult for him to deal with a level six venerable sovereign, but he would not be able to handle three, five, seven, eight, or even a little more than that when they joined forces."I understand ..."Lin Hongyu smiled. She seemed to be in a much better mood!Because she had also thought of this.This meant that walking the path of death would be very useful. Although high-end combat power wouldn't be able to help at the moment, once he entered the 4th rank, he might be able to kill those at the 6th rank and become his death guards.At that time, although he wouldn't be able to control the high-level battlefields, the Dao of death would be invincible in the middle and low-level battlefields!They would only kill more and more!At the moment, she had not felt any restriction, so she was not sure how much she could control. At this moment, there were six or seven venerable sovereigns behind her, but they were not very strong.

Chapter 3257 Tianfang Is Recovering Again!
Lin Hongyu sneered in her heart as she looked at the Queen who was still trying to bewitch her.A fellow who only knows how to pick up the wisdom of others!You only know how to take advantage of the situation and bewitch the faith of humans. That's not the right way. We just need you for now. When the Silver Moon becomes the most powerful in the chaos one day, Li Hao will not allow such a God to exist in the chaos!Wouldn't that mean that all the humans would become believers?Of course ... The Dao of death wasn't any better. It killed people, strengthened itself, and strengthened itself ...These great DAOs were all unorthodox and not considered Orthodox.And these obscure great DAOs seemed to grow stronger even faster.However ... What surprised Lin Hongyu even more was that in the distance, there was a person who was not talented and timid. Other than being good at flattering ... There was nothing special about him.At this moment, his aura surged and he jumped from level one to level two. The second rank wasn't rare, but this speed was also extremely fast!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the distance.Hu Qingfeng shouted in a low voice again,"please, King, descend to the world and kill the demons and monsters!"An illusionary image of Li Hao appeared and slashed with his sword. Although it was not as powerful as the real Li Hao, it was not weak either. A second level venerable sovereign in front of him was actually killed by this sword!It was like ... The popular saying of inviting a God.The technique to invite the gods!At this moment, Hu Qingfeng's aura also fluctuated. Soon, he officially entered level two. The look in his eyes became more intense and extremely pious. He looked at Li Hao in the distance as if he was looking at a God!What Queen ... That was a false god.The true God was this person.In his eyes, Li Hao was no longer a human, but a God ... It was not that he had not seen stronger opponents, but Li Hao had killed a stage seven.Also, Li Hao was only in his 20s!Hu Qingfeng had completely fallen for Li Hao since the day he condensed his great Dao. Today, he was already deeply trapped and unable to extricate himself. In his eyes, Li Hao would definitely be the number one man in the chaos, the number one God, no matter if he was present or future!  Best novel online free at n0ŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  It had only been a few years since he came out of an unranked world. He had created the entire Silver Moon system, more than 50 venerable sovereigns, and even killed a high-tier venerable sovereign. This was unbelievable!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Li Hao was also helpless.F * ck!Every time he saw this guy use the great Dao, he felt awkward."He's like a quack!"Li Hao was speechless. In the distance, the void that had destroyed several worlds also appeared with a bright smile."Interesting. This guy's Dao is getting more and more mysterious! I really didn't expect that it could be like this ... Didn't you want to create ten thousand worlds in your virtual world? His Dao, I think you can create a world. It's really special. Didn't you say that you need the divine Demon Realm? This Dao of his can be called the divine world ... Putting everything else aside, just a great Dao that can invite a God into one's body ... That's incredible!""Lin Hongyu's Dao can create a world of death. Your master, who is like a monster and calls himself the old demon, can create a world of demons!""Things are getting more and more interesting. You, Silver Moon Martial Master, are more interesting than I thought!""It's just a plan," Li Hao laughed."You took it seriously.""Why not?""It's good to have a plan," Kong Ji laughed."If we really do build a myriad of realms in the future, leave One World for me ... Let me think ... How about we build a six paths world?""The six paths world?"Li Hao laughed,"how?" Your DAOs are all the two extreme DAOs, light and darkness, life and death, destruction and revival ... You can't even create a six Dao world. ""Then ..."Kong Ji was a little depressed,"that's true. What a pity. You said you wanted to build a world with thousands of DAOs. Then my six Dao world is nothing special ..."He shook his head, still feeling a little regretful.Li Hao laughed."The Power of Six paths isn't simple. If you create a world on your own, no one might be able to learn it. Even if a living being is born, it might not be able to inherit it!" Why don't we ... Open up another domain in the infinite worlds ... We'll not open up a world, but open up a domain as the place where the infinite worlds meet, communicate with each other, kill each other ... Life and death, Nirvana and recovery, light and darkness are all more suitable for killing ...""What?"Kong Ji was stunned, but he quickly smiled and said,"this is interesting!" However, the power of the six paths is still too little. It's embarrassing to have only six paths, let alone the power of all paths ..."He joked.The Power of Six paths was a lot, but if they really built a place where the infinite worlds converged like Li Hao said ... Wouldn't they be a joke to the infinite worlds?"That's good," Li Hao said with a laugh."Brother kongji, six DAOs isn't your end!""You're right!"Kong Ji laughed, and the two of them talked and laughed.The surroundings gradually became quiet.One by one, Silver Moon venerable sovereigns dragged their worlds and gathered over. They were all very excited. Many of them were level one venerable sovereigns, and they had already advanced to level two.This time, he had gained dozens of worlds.Li Hao said,"clean up the battlefield. Hurry up. Don't leave any traces!" The void realm and the corporeal realm, you will pass through the river of memories and pretend to be the Masters of the realms to maintain the existence of the world here ... You can not let anyone suspect you!"'I can't swallow the world now. If I swallow it, people will see ... I'm the first one to come?'It was obviously impossible!He would leave these worlds for now. Currently, he had gathered five tier 6 worlds, including planet Tianhuang and earth Dragon. There were also three tier 5 worlds, nine Tier 4 worlds, and a bunch of low-level worlds ...

Chapter 3258 Tianfang Is Recovering Again!
Li Hao was also very pleased to see these worlds."Continue to observe. Before the number of worlds exceeds 30, I'll make a move to clean it up once! I'm going to wipe out the entire Dragon World in one fell swoop!"‚Ä¶‚Ä¶On the other side, Li Hao was harvesting madly.As for the Thunder World.The Thunderbolt master had also received some news that the Earth Dragon World had reached Level Seven.Was that even possible?That was impossible.And he knew of one person who had a great Dao universe, the Silver Moon King.What a vicious kid. He was terrifying.With this, how many worlds would pass?How many worlds would he destroy?It was no wonder that this fellow didn't think much of those great Dao crystals before ... The Thunderbolt master wasn't stupid. He was shocked. Under such circumstances, it wouldn't be difficult for him to gather hundreds of worlds in the later stages.He was so F * cking vicious!But ... He frowned. A few hundred worlds, how many humans ... Had the Silver Moon King considered this?Even if there were only billions or hundreds of humans in a world, there would still be trillions of humans!This ... Were they all killed?The Thunderbolt master sighed in his heart. At this moment, he did not say anything, but he felt that ... This Silver Moon King was too vicious.He had seen the Queen once, but not the divine Kingdom ...Even if he had two beings similar to chaos beasts under his command, how many people could he hold in two worlds?At this moment, the Thunderbolt master did not say anything. He only felt that he had to stay away from this fellow in the future. He was too vicious.There were over a trillion humans. Even the beasts of primordial chaos had only killed this many humans over the years.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Time was still passing by.On this day, in the tianfang region.The world of light could not hold on any longer. The light Supreme Emperor was also ready to compromise.When they fought again, all the light venerable sovereigns were injured.The radiance Supreme Emperor appeared outside the realm gate. At that moment, he looked at the experts on the other side with anger and helplessness. He was going to surrender!If this continued, even if he had the advantage of being native, he would not be able to hold on.At that moment, just as the light Thearch was about to talk about the great Dao Alliance, everyone suddenly looked in one direction. In the distance, tianfang world suddenly burst out with a brilliant light!Apart from Hong Yue, the other eighth level venerable sovereigns had also taken a star of the great path.At this moment, the star of the great path actually burst out with some light."What?"Everyone was stunned, and in the next moment, their expressions changed slightly."The Tian Fang universe has recovered?"So fast!So fast?The last time everyone took away the great path stars, they also knew that it would recover sooner or later ... But, how long had it been?The level eight venerable sovereigns were in disbelief! As for the light Emperor, his eyes lit up instantly and he laughed."Tian Fang has awakened!"This was a good thing!He looked at the three people in front of him, and his expression changed. 'You ... Are you still going to stay and attack me?'All venerable sovereigns who had obtained the stars of the great path would know about the recovery of tianfang.Li Hao had sent out at least dozens of stars of the great way!Dozens of seventh rank venerable sovereigns knew that Tian Fang had awakened. With such a huge commotion, even those who didn't know would know by now."If you don't go ... Perhaps, you won't have the chance.At this moment, the Dragon Master and the others also frowned slightly.Tian Fang's recovery was a good thing!But ... It was too fast.Light was about to surrender, he couldn't hold on any longer.However ... At this time, they could still hold on for a few more days. Most importantly, Tian Fang had recovered ... If they did not go, the other Level Seven venerable sovereigns would not be polite!"So fast!"The Dragon Master had also obtained a star last time. At this moment, he was frowning. In his Dao universe, a star was also shining.How could he be so fast?According to his calculations, it could take at least a few years, at most a few hundred years.But now ... How did it recover?It was very strange!He looked in Tian Fang's direction and frowned slightly. This wasn't the only unexpected thing that had happened recently. For example, the Earth Dragon world's advancement, the lightning Lord's invitation for a battle, and the human cultivators who cultivated the Dao of faith and even integrated the Dao of chaos into it ... Perhaps it had all exploded now?And ... Tian Fang's recovery!While he was still thinking, the red moon venerable sovereign looked at the light Emperor, then at Yun Xiao and the Dragon Master. She cursed in her heart,"these two bastards, they're not willing to use their full strength!"Dragon Lord, this bastard, kept instigating me to make a move ... Screw you!He really wanted to take down light!In the end, these two bastards had a great Dao universe, but they were still unwilling to help. This made Red Moon master a little angry. He was an itinerant cultivator, and the power of his great Dao was limited. He was not as good as these two bastards!At this moment, Tian Fang had recovered, and there was no need to say anything!Expect them to continue to besiege the light?It was impossible!The world was more important than light.Damn it!The great Dao of the Crimson Moon had no other choice. He looked at Yunxiao, and as expected, the cloud heaven Thearch looked at him. The next moment, he hesitated for a moment, nodded, and opened the great Dao universe.I didn't say much. Let's go and take a look!In the blink of an eye, he had disappeared.At first, Red Moon sovereign thought that this fellow would bring him along ... In the end, he ran away by himself. F * ck!  Best novel online free at n0ŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Hong Yue was furious!He didn't say much and instantly disappeared. Clearly, the other party had run ahead of time and wanted to snatch the great Dao universe.When Dragon Master saw this, he frowned slightly and shook his head. He didn't enter the great Dao universe but returned to the dragon world. The next moment, three huge Dragons appeared and directly carried the dragon world forward!He wouldn't rashly descend from the great Dao universe. Even if Tian Fang recovered ... It didn't seem like the daosource would recover immediately.

Chapter 3259 Tianfang Is Recovering Again!
There's no hurry!No one said anything, and no one cared about the light Thearch.At this moment, the light Emperor's expression changed. He hesitated."Should I go?"If I go, will these three ... Continue to attack me?After some consideration, he realized that everyone wanted the tianfang great Dao universe. There was a high probability that these three would not be able to continue their alliance. He gritted his teeth and looked at Yao yang and the others."You guys stay here and be careful. I'll go take a look. Something's not right. I'll be back soon!"After saying that, he frowned and said,'Tian Fang's recovery is a little too fast ... It's strange! According to my calculations, a hundred years isn't a long time. But it's only been a few days ... And it's already fully recovered!"He couldn't understand!However, he still had to go and take a look.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶p At the same time.Tian Fang.The human King stood at the peak of the heaven. At this moment, the great path of the universe was fluctuating. If he wanted to conceal it from level 8 and make them believe that it was real ... Ordinary means would not work.At this moment, the human King's eyes were cold and sharp.It was a little solemn!Tian Fang universe had been opened by him, and Tian Fang's recovery ... Was also a true recovery. That was because, at this moment, the human king and emperor Cang had joined forces and executed the Dao of Yin Yang, reversing yin and yang!Reviving from the dead!After paying a huge price, this kind of recovery could only last for a short time. Moreover, it also welcomed an extremely powerful lightning tribulation. However, outsiders did not sense it.That was because the lightning tribulation had all been devoured by Emperor Cang.At this moment, Emperor Cang's entire body was trembling as blood gushed out. The human King gently caressed Emperor Cang, consoling the pained Emperor Cang and said in a low voice,""Endure it! Let's ... Eat the fish, the big fish!"He gritted his teeth. The human King rarely suffered losses in his life, but in order to deal with a strong enemy, it wasn't impossible for him to suffer some losses.But he would definitely take it back ten times!A hundred times, a thousand times!At this moment, the human King looked at the twinkling stars. The stars of the great path seemed to be recovering ... Yin and yang were reversed, and the great path universe seemed to be changing. The human King went deep into the great path universe and looked at the star that was still dead.He suddenly sneered,"I'll borrow your precious land ... After killing someone, you'll be able to recover earlier ... Don't keep staring at me!" I'm going to get angry if you keep looking!"With that, he chuckled and looked at Emperor Cang, who was still in pain. He said in a low voice,""Big cat, let's go ... Let's go out first ... We'll be the last to enter!"In an instant, he brought Emperor Cang and left the place.After the human Emperor and Emperor Cang left, the spatial Dao origin star started to shimmer with a faint radiance, as if an eye had appeared.After a long time, the light dissipated!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶An unknown place in the primal Chaos.Among the countless statues, one statue opened its eyes again and raised its eyebrows.The group of youngsters from the four-sided domain really dared to do so.Time and time again, he had used the universe to scheme against others. He was really bold and bold. He even used the reversal of yin and yang. If he had the energy, wouldn't it be good to reverse and resurrect a rank seven?He was really bored!Of course, I was just thinking about it. The young man sure has a temper. He even threatened me."It seems ... Like they're from that world ..."He thought about the time cultivator from last time and the person who reversed yin and yang today. These two people might be of the same origin and come from that world.Interesting!  Best novel online free at n0ŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Were these two people from the same world?Was this world full of monstrous talents?What was he trying to do by creating the illusion that Tian Fang was recovering in advance?As this thought emerged in his mind, the sculpture quickly closed its eyes.Tian Fang's official recovery still needed some time, and reversing yin and yang wouldn't work either. However, he did see quite a few interesting things, and it wasn't in vain.
