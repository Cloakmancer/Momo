"Yes,""Can ... Can you bring us along?""You're soldiers, so just follow my orders. You're not my subordinates, so I have no right to interfere ...""No! Wasn't the military governor the commander of the heaven battling Army? The heaven battling Army is a large Army while the star Army is a small army. Since the governor is the division commander of the heaven battling Army, his position in the star Army is comparable to a vice Commander-in-Chief ... If the governor gives the order, we can also go to battle!""Then isn't that overstepping my boundaries?""It's easy to be criticized. Forget it ..."Li Hao laughed."Governor li, the enemy is right in front of us, but we can't take revenge. Are you forcing us to break into the remains and leave by force? "If that happens, it might even interfere with the governor's plan ..."The silver-armored man was a little unwilling."We made a mistake back then and trusted Sun Xin wrongly. Now, we hope to atone for our crimes and perform meritorious deeds. If the military governor didn't say anything, we wouldn't have known that the enemy's whereabouts had already been discovered. Since he has appeared ...""The other party is a Heavenly King!""The Heavenly Star Army is fearless!""So what if he's a Heavenly King?" the silver-armored man roared. Even if we can't defeat them, we must bite a piece of their flesh. The neo martial Army has never been afraid of battle!""Let's forget it ...""Is the military governor still a soldier?"The silver-armored man was furious,"why are you hesitating?" Didn't the governor think that neo martial artists were cowards? The governor was wrong. We neo martial artists may have cowards, but they definitely don't exist in the Army! Our comrades in the Army never fear battle or death!"Li Hao frowned."That's what you're saying ... I won't let a group of neo martial artists who disobey my orders interfere with my plan. Once the other party uses their status to suppress me, you might attack me instead ... Who knows?""Governor, do you think we're idiots? "Once the battle begins, soldiers are only responsible for fighting. No matter what, words ... Will not make us retreat or change ...""That might not be the case. That day, when Division Chief Zhang made his announcement, didn't you all not even believe in Sun Xin? The Heavenly Star Army has a tradition. Mutiny before a battle is a great taboo!"As soon as he said that, the faces of the group leaders instantly changed. One of them said in pain,""Division Chief Zhang is the descendant of the Supreme martial artist, Sun Xin is a traitor ... We ... We ...""Then if another director Zhang comes and also says that I'm an enemy of new martial arts, what should we do?"Li Hao still shook his head,"it's too unstable!" I'm afraid that if I don't die in the enemy's hands, I'll be captured, killed, and given to some venerable sovereigns. Wouldn't I be in deep trouble then?"“……”The faces of the group leaders changed.These words ...Another Regiment commander said in a low voice,"the governor can't be a neo martial rebel because he's not a neo martial artist!" At this moment, the chances of the rebels and the Crimson Moon people stopping the governor from killing the enemy are higher ... We won't have to do what we did last time ..."Li Hao laughed."Then what if director Zhang comes again and asks you to take me down?" he asked."How is that possible?""Director Zhang is a descendant of a Supreme martial artist, and he's determined to fight his enemies ..." The silver-grade Regiment commander quickly replied.Li Hao sighed and chuckled,"perhaps director Zhang has his own difficulties?" "When the rebellion took control of the world, he might have contacted new martial, which would be safer. I stopped his plan instead ..."As soon as he said that, the group leaders seemed to have thought of something and their expressions changed.Someone said in a deep voice,"that won't happen ... A soldier would rather choose a direct path than a crooked one!" If he placed his hopes on the enemy to control the world and connect with the neo martial arts world, wouldn't that be losing the neo martial spirit? Neo martial fought against everything. Even if they couldn't win, they had to fight! The governor must have misunderstood!"Li Hao turned around, faced them, and said in a deep voice,""What if ... They, and I'm not talking about director Zhang, but the powerhouses from the other main cities also have the same idea? Then, are you still going to insist on it? Do you still want to fight? Do you still want to go against them?"The moment he said that, the group leaders were completely speechless.Seeing this, Li Hao turned around and left.Behind them, the group leaders stood still.What if the higher-ups were not willing to fight back?The moment Li Hao walked away, one of the regiment commanders suddenly shouted,""Governor Li can look down on us and underestimate the remnants of the neo martial arts in the entire small world, but he can't look down on the neo martial spirit! "If it really comes to that moment, even if they're still officers, they'll have betrayed the neo martial spirit. Betraying the neo martial spirit is a rebellion of neo martial, and they must be executed!"As soon as he said that, a group leader's body trembled. The next moment, someone shouted,""That's right, anyone without the spirit of neo martial arts can be killed! New martial arts ... Can't be underestimated, can't be vilified, and can't be damaged by anyone using the name of new martial arts!"  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  Li Hao turned around and said in a deep voice,"are you ... Serious?""I'm not lying!""Don't resist!" The group leaders shouted at the same time."Surrender and wait for death. No matter who it is, they are all traitors and can be killed! Even descendants of venerable sovereigns can be killed!"Li Hao looked at them for a long time before he nodded.""This time, you can go out with me! It's just that ... Once you betray the spirit of neo martial arts that you speak of ... At that time, I won't be polite! I feel that even your higher-ups don't have this spirit, but you still have it. I ... I can't believe it. "The regiment commanders were furious. Who had given Li Hao such an impression? How could a neo martial artist betray the neo martial spirit?That was faith!Resist everything, fight everything, how could you compromise with the enemy?Why would they hope for the mercy of the enemy?How could they hope that the enemy would be in control of the world and contact Neo martial? They were traitors!Li Hao, on the other hand, left with a smile in his eyes.Li Fuhai ... Your words are really interesting. And I seem to have discovered how to rope in a group of new martial artists.It doesn't matter if they're willing to pledge their loyalty to me or not.The key is that the people I want to deal with are also the people they want to deal with.Whoever stopped him ... Would be a traitor!This was very good!If I had such a concept earlier, perhaps I would have roped in a large number of strong people. Seeking common ground while reserving differences is a good idea. Sure enough, neo martial artists understand neo martial artists better.The point was that li Fuhai had explained it clearly. Director Wang and the others might have a lower status, but they couldn't say it clearly. Li Hao had suffered a lot.See, this time, it was much easier.He had easily taken over the Heavenly Star Army and the monster plant clan!As for the students of Yuanping martial arts university who were secretly spying on them ... Li Hao didn't care about them. Perhaps, they were also in a complicated situation at the moment.All of this was within Li Hao's expectations.The huge mineral vein was being mined crazily.The group leaders quickly left and began to gather their subordinates to prepare to leave the ruins and face the strong enemy.They didn't care about the strength of their enemies.To wash away their shame and take revenge was their obsession.At this moment, even Zhang an could not stop them. Not to mention, Zhang an was not the commanding general of the Army, while Li Hao was the commander of heaven battling city.At this moment, Li Hao had already entered the mine and taken away the somewhat broken body of the quasi-Heavenly King.Ever since it had modified the physical bodies of some people, it had become a little incomplete. It was not as good as before, but it was just what the ninth master had in mind.If there were any extra, perhaps it could even help some people recover their physical bodies.At this moment, Li Hao's mood became even better.……They didn't stay in the Heavenly Star Town for too long. Soon, Li Hao left with 36 monster plants, five Regiment commanders, and thousands of soldiers of the Heavenly Star Army.The current him was even stronger, and his domain covered the entire area.These people didn't even have Saints, so they didn't feel any pressure.The Heavenly Star Town quieted down in an instant, leaving only a few students from Yuanping martial arts university.After Li Hao's group left, one of the puppets suddenly smashed a table and a chair with a punch and gnashed his teeth.""Our teacher is not that kind of person ... He would never make peace with his enemy ... Li Hao is slandering our teacher!""Li Hao ... Will he come here again? We haven't been able to recover our physical bodies, and our battle prowess is weak. Are we ... Really going to just wait like this?""I want to leave!""Me too ... Maybe some people aren't willing. I ... Don't care anymore!""Jiang Ying, li and the rest have left. Are we staying here to watch? Wait? Wait for the return of the ancestors? I've been waiting for 100000 years ..."On this day, an argument broke out. Some people wanted to leave immediately, while others remained silent.For the first time, the entire Yuanping martial arts university had a huge disagreement.As for Li Hao, he had already left with his men. On the way, he even wanted to hum a little tune. Sure enough, after the endless city was destroyed, everything was developing in a good direction. Teacher, the light that you brought is now covering the Silver Moon land!

2061 Chapter 350
Heaven battling city.Li Hao acted as a Porter and moved the goods back and forth a few times.He had left most of the fake Heavenly King's body for the ninth master to recover his body.At this moment, Li Hao, accompanied by the old turtle, general Huai, and Li Fuhai, entered the depths of heaven battling city's military camp for the first time.Originally, this place was dark and deathly silent.When they walked deeper, Li Hao discovered that this place was extremely solemn. There were many military camps, and heaven battling city's 100000 troops were stationed here. Most of the heaven battling Army had not yet recovered.A tall building stood in the distance.The old turtle said,"the commander of the reserve guards is over there. His name is Wu Peng, and he has the battle strength of an early stage Saint. He took a risk and left heaven battling city, but he was suppressed by the heaven and earth's counterattack. He was seriously injured and returned to heaven battling city. After that, he has been in a deep sleep." Li Hao nodded.The ninth Division commander had been promoted that year, but he had not been promoted to the commander of the reserve guards, but to the commander of the main force. This commander Wu Peng was the most powerful person in the military who had stayed behind in heaven battling city.However, he had taken the risk to leave the city at the beginning of the world's transformation, which had led to his serious injuries. After so many years, he had not recovered.At this moment, Li Hao was full of confidence because he had a few more Saints with him."I'm not familiar with this commander Wu, and I'm not sure about his character and personality. There are some things that I still have to investigate. Do you have any objections?""That's for sure,"The old turtle nodded."We don't want any traitors of the Crimson Moon to be in the city either. It's best to be able to identify them."Li Hao nodded slightly.He did not know how many people the red moon sovereign had infected.He was not sure how many people had been infected by the Crimson Moon's power in the major cities.It was hard to tell whether these people were loyal to the red moon sovereign or the red dust.However, they were all enemies.……The few of them continued forward.In the depths, Li Hao sensed some auras too. Some experts and teachers might be recovering, but it was not an urgent matter to do so at the moment.Soon, the group of people arrived at the foot of a building."I don't know if commander Wu has any consciousness," the old turtle said."I'll call out to him first to avoid any misunderstandings."Li Hao nodded slightly.Soon, the old turtle's body emitted a faint fluctuation of origin, and his voice reverberated.""Commander Wu, are you still there?"The fluctuations came one after another.The few of them were waiting.After an unknown period of time, a faint wave of Origin Energy burst forth, and a weak voice rang out,""Turtle Guardian? And general Huai ..." General Huai and Guardian turtle were overjoyed.The other party's source was still there, and it seemed to be showing signs of recovery.It was a good thing!It should be related to general Huai's absorption of heaven and earth energy after his recovery, as well as the large number of energy stones given to him by Li Hao, which made heaven battling city rich in energy."You're awake?"The old turtle was overjoyed, and a man's weak voice came from the building.""You've woken me up ... Come in ..."The two saints of heaven battling city were very happy, and they hurriedly led the way.This man was a genuine Saint of the human race in heaven battling city.Although the ninth master was powerful, he was not a Saint in the past. Now that his physical body had not recovered, it was hard to say whether he could truly become a saint. Wu Peng, on the other hand, had been a Saint back then.He was also the only human Saint left in heaven battling city.They moved forward. Along the way, Li Hao saw many armored warriors standing still.Among them, there were even many silver-tier Warriors.At the end, there was even a gold-tier warrior, but his aura was not obvious, and there were signs of death.Behind the gold-tier warrior, there was a small independent building.At this moment, the old turtle's voice sounded in Li Hao's mind.""This is the military headquarters of the reserve army. The general we see now is the brigade commander of the defense Regiment directly under the defense Army back then. It's equivalent to military commander Wu's defense Regiment. Ever since military commander Wu returned with injuries, the general has been unwilling to sleep and took the initiative to guard this place for many years. Later, he ran out of energy and whether he can be resurrected today ... We can't be sure. Sigh!"  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  Li Hao glanced at the gold-tier warrior, who was still standing there. He had not fallen for ten thousand years, but his aura was almost gone. It was indeed hard to tell whether he could recover or not.Just as he said that, the door of the small building behind him opened.The first thing Li Hao saw was an orange light, and the next moment, he saw an orange armor. Commanders were one level higher than division commanders like Li Hao, and they could choose their armor freely.Division commanders like Li Hao were all generals, but they were all major generals.As for these commanders, they were at least lieutenant generals, and some of the commanders of the main forces were even higher. Of course, they were very rare.At this moment, the dark eyes of the orange-armored figure shone with a bright light, but it seemed extremely weak."General Huai, Guardian turtle ..."After looking around, he seemed to have a reaction and said,""Li Zhenhai is also here ... This ... 11th Division's master?"He looked slightly puzzled.This was because he could sense Li Hao's organization. Moreover, he was a member of the Reserve guards.However, he knew that there were only 10 divisions and one Regiment.Where did the 11th Division come from?But since the other party was, then he must have obtained the support of the two guardians and other people in the Army while he was in deep sleep. That was how he could become the division commander of the 11th Division.

2062 Chapter 350
"Commander Wu is finally awake!"The old turtle was extremely excited, and general Huai lost some of his Sage-like air and had more of an ordinary air. He smiled and said, "It's been so many years. We all thought that ... It's fine. Since he's awake, it means that his injuries are much better than before.""I also thought that I wouldn't be able to wake up. When the turtle Guardian's voice sounded just now, I thought I was dreaming."The few of them exchanged pleasantries for a while, and the old turtle also briefly explained what had happened recently.After hearing this, the commander sighed."In the blink of an eye, 100000 years have passed. I can't believe it ... The 11th master is the descendant of the sword venerable. No wonder his sword intent is so strong ..."After sighing for a while, Wu Peng's voice was heard.""In that case, you're looking for me this time in hopes of reviving me so that we can fight against that expert who might be Zheng Yu?"Li Hao nodded."I suspect that he's Zheng Yu. Of course, I can't be sure yet."It was just a suspicion. Whether it was true or not, no one could be sure unless they really fought."Since it's a rebellion of neo martial, it's naturally unshirkable! Since the two guardians and the sea Protector are willing to help, I naturally won't refuse if I recover!""Ninth Division commander," Wu Peng said,"there's hope for you to become a saint after you recover your physical body this time. This way, there's a few of you who have the confidence ... But ... As for the eleventh Division commander, the turtle Guardian just said that the starry sky sword has been shattered. In this case ... Can you still use your Saint battle power? If you can't ... Then leave it to us. There's still a big gap between the king and the undying. "This military commander Wu was much gentler than the 9th Division commander. Perhaps it was because of the reserve guards, but the other party was good at defense and not so cold."I'm repairing the starry sky sword now," Li Hao said."It'll be difficult for me to kill a Saint, but I can still fight ordinary saints ...""That's good. You're indeed a genius after the sword Saint!"Wu Peng nodded. The orange armor was exceptionally bright.Li Hao continued."Commander Wu, let's not waste any time. We'll start reviving you. I still have a lot of immortal energy. With some spring water of life and a large number of energy stones, it should be enough ...""Then ... Thank you, Eleventh Division commander!"Military commander Wu didn't hold back and laughed,"After so many years, it can still recover and fight again. It's quite a different feeling."Li Hao smiled, nodded, and said,""Then ... Here?""Let's do it here,""Alright!"Li Hao nodded."Before that, I'll need commander Wu to accompany me on a trip to the new Dao universe and obtain its recognition. That way, I can avoid some trouble after leaving the relic. I'll be contaminated with the new Dao aura and won't be targeted by the heavens and the earth."The old turtle didn't mention this earlier, but when commander Wu heard it, he was a little shocked.""New Dao universe? The 11th Division commander can come and go freely?""I can barely do it.""That's interesting ..." Military commander Wu was a little emotional,'I didn't expect that a new Dao would be born in Silver Moon after a hundred thousand years! It's a little unbelievable ... No wonder you were able to enter this realm at such a young age. With the great Dao universe as your support, you might be able to enter a deeper level before long. ""It's just that ..." He asked."If you bring me in, will it affect the eleventh Division?""That's fine. As long as commander Wu doesn't disturb the universe, there won't be much of an effect.""Definitely not! It's my fortune to be able to see the new Dao universe ..."Wu Peng sighed and looked at the others.""Have you guys gone in to take a look?"The old turtle nodded and said,"I've been there once ... And it was spectacular!" I did gain something, but I know too little about the new Dao. I can only feel its magnificence. If I want to gain more, I'm afraid I'll have to walk on the new Dao. "Commander Wu nodded."A new Dao ... A new Dao has appeared. It's indeed touching. I wonder where the universe of origin is now?"Then, he looked at Li Hao."Eleventh master, you're really majestic. When ordinary people discover a new Dao universe, they wish that no one could see it. As expected of the descendant of the venerable sword. You're actually willing to take us to see it ..."Li Hao smiled but didn't say anything.However, he took a few more glances at the other party and didn't say anything.This military commander Wu's tone was gentle, but he was a little talkative. As for the 9th Division commander, he was a typical man of few words. He wished he could not say a single word to you.Time was of the essence. Li Hao's main goal was to confirm his identity, revive as soon as possible, and go to the ruins of Star Town City.He didn't have much time for small talk. "Since the 11th Division is willing to take us there to observe, I can't turn down your good intentions ... Then ... Can we enter from here?""Yes, I can.""Guardian turtle, general Huai, are you still going in? Will the 11th Division commander hurt himself if he brings so many people with him?""Just commander Wu and I will do," Li Hao said."We've brought many saints with us, so it's still a little stressful ..."He felt that this person might have been a Chatterbox when he was alive.He talked too much!Of course, after sleeping for many years and just recovering, it was normal for him to talk a lot. It had been too long since he last spoke to anyone.Li Hao didn't say anything else and tore through the void again.A universe appeared above his head.Even though they had not entered yet, commander Wu was amazed by what he saw."I can sense the great Dao before I even enter! If there's a chance, I'd like to learn more about the new Dao. I hope that you'll be willing to teach me ..."

"No problem," he said.Li Hao didn't say much. He stepped into the void and said,""Commander Wu, come up!"Commander Wu said no more. He stepped into the air and entered the crack.……In the bright star sector.Li Hao frowned for a moment, but his frown soon disappeared.He reached out and the sky turned dark.Darkness enveloped the entire area.In the next moment, commander Wu stepped into the room.At this moment, the crack behind him disappeared.Military commander Wu walked in and looked around. He was a little puzzled."Is the universe so dark?"Not far away, Li Hao was frowning.Around him, the void trembled slightly, and there was a faint Thunder of the great path. He frowned and did not speak. How could this be?This was a high-ranking member of heaven battling city, the commander of the reserve guards, and the current number one person in the military.Li Hao had originally thought that there might not be anyone from Red Moon or red dust in heaven battling city.However, now ... It was hard to say.Was it like li Fuhai, accidentally contaminated with the power of the Crimson Moon, or ... Was it not an accident?In fact, the moment the other party entered, he knew that something was wrong.There was no other reason. After the other party entered, the pressure on him increased greatly.If he brought someone in and the outsider was too powerful, he would put pressure on himself.However, a Saint who had been dormant for 100000 years and whose body had not recovered yet might not be stronger than an undying. Li Hao did not feel any pressure bringing an undying in.Li Hao didn't say anything. Darkness enveloped the surroundings, and the Thunder in the surroundings were all suppressed by Li Hao.Li Hao's voice resounded."Wait a moment, commander Wu. After entering the Dao universe, you'll have to travel through time and space for a short time. You'll be able to cross it soon!""Yes, I'm not in a hurry."Military commander Wu was also very calm.Li Hao was still frowning. He had a lot of trust in heaven battling city.Otherwise, the eight major cities would not have only sought out heaven battling city to cooperate.Furthermore, this time, the more Saints they had, the more confident they would be.He had also sincerely supported this person who had recovered, but the result ... Seemed to have exceeded his expectations.Li Hao didn't say anything. The great path of darkness continued to envelop the surroundings, and he quickly disappeared. His voice echoed,""There will be some turbulence during the travel. There might be some lightning in the surroundings. This is a necessary experience for crossing the barrier of the universe ... Commander Wu, be careful. Just stand still and don't move. I'll open the passage soon ..." After saying that, Li Hao disappeared.As for military commander Wu, he quickly felt some fluctuations. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Not long after, a bolt of lightning struck from the darkness.With a loud boom, it smashed into the orange armor.……At this moment, Li Hao disappeared and reappeared in the small building.When the few of them saw him appear, they were all stunned for a moment. So fast, he came out as soon as he entered?Li Hao also frowned. He glanced at Guardian turtle and general Huai and pondered for a while. He did not avoid them and said,""There might be some problems with commander Wu ... Of course, I can't be 100% sure! Right now, I might need a helper. I can't support too many saints to enter. Who is willing to enter with me?"The old turtle and general Huai were both stunned. The old turtle said in disbelief,""That's impossible. He's the number one guard. Besides, I've always been clear-headed. If he really ..."Li Hao didn't say anything. It's precisely because you've been awake this whole time that the other party hasn't made any moves.If you weren't clear-headed ... Perhaps the outcome wouldn't be like this.As for heaven battling city, the old turtle was their greatest assurance.Because it was clear-headed and had the battle strength of a Saint, it would not act rashly even if someone from the red moon or the red dust invaded.As for whether there was a problem with Wu Peng ... There was a high probability.Li Hao continued,"I suspect that he still has his physical body. The pressure he feels when he enters the universe is similar to that of the sea Guardian. Under normal circumstances, a Saint without a physical body won't give me such pressure. I'll have to move faster. Who ... Is willing to enter with me?""Me!"The old turtle's eyes were extremely complicated."I've been awake the whole time. I know him best. I'll go in."Li Hao nodded and didn't say much.Li Fuhai coughed."I'll go with you. Otherwise, once the universe is sealed and we can't enter, the old turtle might not be able to deal with it. If there's a problem, it'll be troublesome ...""Sea Protector, don't you trust me?" the old turtle asked in a deep voice. "No, I didn 't,""If I didn't trust you, then heaven battling city ... Might have fallen into the enemy's hands many years ago!"The old turtle's expression became a lot more serious, and he said in a deep voice,""Heaven battling city is extraordinary. I don't believe there's a traitor. I want to see it for myself ... If it's true, I want to ask why it's like this!"Seeing them arguing, Li Hao said directly,""I'll go with the turtle Guardian then. However ... Don't reveal yourself so rashly. I'll test you first to make sure. Otherwise, it'll be awkward if there's a misunderstanding!"As soon as he finished speaking, he tore open the void again. Soon, the man and the turtle entered the universe of the great path.The Dao universe disappeared.General Huai, who was left behind, looked at li Fuhai and said softly,""Do you think ... Governor Li's judgment is accurate? Wu Peng is the commander of the guards ..."Li Fuhai said indifferently,"anything is possible!" I'm even more curious if that old turtle ... Will take this opportunity to join forces with Wu Peng and seize this great path universe. Li Hao actually didn't call me along. I don't know if he trusts heaven battling city too much, or if he has other plans. "

2064 Chapter 350
"General Huai, what do you think of Li Hao?""Me?"General Huai was silent for a moment before he said,""It's hard to say ... Before the boundless city incident, Li Hao was tolerant, trusted, respected, and even relied on neo martial and heaven battling city to a certain extent. He hasn't changed much after the incident at boundless city, but ... I can sense that he's a little suspicious of us, and his trust ... Has actually declined a lot. "In the past, Li Hao wouldn't have taken them in even if they could identify the enemy in the Dao universe.That would make him seem too petty.But later, when Li Hao came to heaven battling city, he directly said that in order to distinguish the enemy, everyone had to go there. This was actually a form of distrust.The Li Hao of today was actually different from before.Although he looked the same, and his attitude had not changed much, general Huai could sense that Li Hao's slight distrust in him when he was resuscitating him would mean certain death!To revive a Saint!How strong was Li Hao at that time?But today, Li Hao had always been on guard. When Li Hao came to heaven battling city again, he might have come alone, but in fact, he had come only after he had gained a certain level of strength.As general Huai spoke, he suddenly whispered,"Is he really unable to bring the four sages in, or ... Is he worried that the four sages will betray him at the same time? he won't be able to deal with them, but two ... Can he deal with them?"After saying that, it stopped talking.Li Fuhai's eyes moved slightly, but he didn't say anything.What was Li Hao thinking?Was it because he really couldn't bring everyone in? or was this just a test? even if the old turtle had betrayed him, he was confident that he could take on the old turtle and Wu Peng alone?Li Fuhai didn't feel much of Li Hao's change in personality.However, general Huai felt it more deeply.It suspected that ... Li Hao could bring more people in.Instead, it was because his trust in everyone had dropped a lot.Was this a good or bad thing?Who could say for sure?Even heaven battling city, which they had the deepest cooperation with, was like this, so it could be imagined that their trust in the other ancient cities had been greatly reduced.……Bright star sector.Lightning flashed.Bolts of lightning exploded in the darkness. Wu Peng shattered the lightning again and again. At this moment, he was a little uneasy and said loudly,"11th Division commander, when will the lightning end?" After a long time, Li Hao's voice reverberated. "It'll be soon. Because the commander is an outside path expert, it's more targeted. If he's a new path cultivator, it won't be like this."With that, the darkness gradually dissipated, and stars appeared indistinctly.Wu Peng's eyes lit up.​ The stars in the universe!This was the appearance of the great Dao, right?New Dao ...While he was thinking, Li Hao showed up and waved his hand. A big star rotated rapidly. Li Hao's expression was grave."Commander, an essence Dao expert must leave a great Dao imprint here. Only by leaving this place with an essence imprint will he not be targeted by a new Dao. Otherwise, the heavens and earth will be extremely hostile!""This is my Natal star. Commander, use your power of the great Dao's origins to leave a mark on this star and some power of the origin. Otherwise ... The lightning around here won't stop!"The lightning was still striking all around.Wu Peng looked like he was unable to fight back. He was in a sorry state, and his battle armor was slightly charred.Hearing this and seeing the star, he was a little surprised.""Natal star?""Yes, just like the essence Dao, once it's broken, it's the same as the great Dao being broken ...""Eleventh Division commander, this ...""It's fine, we're all family, I trust everyone!"Li Hao quickly appeared and smiled brightly.""My fate with heaven battling city is very deep! Even if I can't trust others, I can still trust the seniors of heaven battling city. Even if this is the first time they've recovered and I'm not too familiar with them ... We're still family! Senior, you don't have to worry about anything. Just leave your origin power on it. Do you think I'm worried that you'll use your origin power to shatter my Natal star of the great path?"Wu Peng quickly became serious."Of course not. It's just that ... This is too risky. You can't take such a risk, Eleventh Division commander ..." n(0)velbIn[.]nEt "Don't use the person you doubt, and use the person you don't doubt!"Li Hao smiled."I've always been like this. Don't be wishy-washy, commander. I can even trust a demon like the sea Guardian envoy, let alone a human. Commander, we can't stay here for too long. Please hurry up, I'm under more and more pressure. I'm trying to stop the lightning, but if I can't stop it, there will be even more lightning coming ...""Then ... I won't stand on ceremony!" Wu Peng could only say when he saw the situation.He looked at the star, which was shining with a dense light power. He was a little puzzled."11th Division commander, you major in the power of light?""No, I major in sword principle, but it's difficult to cultivate. I haven't condensed a star of the great path yet, so I can only minor in the power of light. When I master my sword principle, I'll form a star of the sword principle.""I see!"Military commander Wu did not say anything more. Waves of Origin Energy emerged, very weak.It began to surge into the Star.Li Hao frowned."Commander Wu has just recovered. His origin force is too weak. It'll be difficult to leave a mark!" It didn't matter if commander Wu went all out, even if he used up all his Origin Energy! When his body recovers, I've prepared a lot of Origin Energy and immortal energy for commander to recover. If I don't leave a mark now, I'm afraid he won't be able to use much of his combat power when I get out. "

2065 Chapter 350
Wu Peng didn't know much about the new Dao sect, nor did he know much about the outside world.However, he knew that the world had not yet recovered for the second time, so it was indeed impossible for the strong to go out.After thinking for a while, he said weakly,"then I'll try to extract more power of the origin. However ... The universe of origin is isolated now. I might not have much.""It's fine, the more the better!"Wu Peng did not say anything more and continued to channel his Origin Energy.Li Hao watched silently. After a while, seeing that Wu Peng had stopped, he said regretfully,""Is that all you have? This way ... I'm afraid commander Wu won't be able to display the battle prowess of a Sage outside. At most, he'll be an undying ... The imprint he left behind is too shallow!"Wu Peng looked at the origin vortex that was about to form on the star and could not help but say,""This ... Isn't this enough? Guardians, did they input more?""More!"Li Hao nodded."Their Origin Energy has already penetrated deep into the Star. It's condensed and not leaking!" The commander's Origin Energy has only formed a vortex outside the planet, so it's much weaker than them. However, it's normal that the commander has just regained consciousness. "Was it normal?Wu Peng thought to himself. He felt that he had inserted quite a lot of Origin Energy. Putting aside the old turtle, general Huai had only just recovered. Did he really have that much Origin Energy?"Then ... I'll try again.""Alright," he said.A moment later, Wu Peng inserted his Origin Energy again.As for Li Hao, he just watched from the side. A large amount of lightning gathered around him. He thought to himself,"there's quite a lot of lightning, which means that the Crimson Moon Power in Wu Peng's body is definitely not weak."The source that the other party was pouring out was also very dense. How could a Saint who had just recovered ... Have so much?At this moment, the origin had already completed one round above the Star of Light.Li Hao looked at it for a while and frowned."This might not work. Commander Wu, is it convenient for you to take off your armor?" he asked."What?""Battle armor! The commander's armor must contain a large amount of Origin Energy. Of course, the commander doesn't have a physical body ... He can create a temporary physical body for backup ..."Then, Li Hao said,"forget it. Let's give the commander the body that director Wang used the other day. The commander will take off his armor and attach himself to director Wang's body. I'll put the armor into the Star and wash it with the power of the great Dao to wash out some of his Origin Energy. This way, we can reduce the targeting of the new Dao on the commander.""This ...""11th Division commander, why don't we just forget about it ..." Wu Peng was a little unwilling."That won't do!""Since I've already done it, of course I'll do my best!" Li Hao said in a deep voice. He threw out a body that director Wang had used before."This body is slightly weaker, but commander, you can use it first. Take off the armor, and I'll place it inside the star to nourish it for some time ..."Wu Peng was a little hesitant.Li Hao said again,"don't worry, commander. After the armor is washed, it will only be more suitable for the outside world. The world has changed. Otherwise, the current armor might not be suitable for the outside world!""Alright," Wu Peng said."I'm just worried that you'll be hurt.""That won't happen. Even if there is, it won't have much of an impact.""Alright then ..."With that, a blinding light erupted. Li Hao's eyes flickered, and a ball of light appeared. The next moment, a suit of armor floated in the air, and director Wang's body also appeared.At this moment, his body was no longer dead, and his eyes had a little more spirit.Li Hao glanced at it and said nothing more. He put the orange armor into the Star, and the star began to devour the armor.Director Wang ... Or rather, commander Wu, frowned."It won't wash away my origin mark, will it? If that's the case, the battle armor ...""It won't ... Even if it's washed away, I'll just brand it again later."After Li Hao finished speaking, he asked,"commander, do you have any weapons you use?" If there is ... Throw it in to wash it. Otherwise, it won't be easy to exert the full power of the weapon outside, and it will be targeted by the heaven and earth. ""Weapon?" Wu Peng shook his head."This armor is enough. I'm mainly on the defense. I'm a reserve guard, not a frontline Army, so ...""Understood!"Li Hao nodded. Wu Peng looked around and said,""These Thunderbolts have been gathering and not dispersing. Is the new Dao very targeted at the origin?""It's alright. After all, the two worlds are of the same origin. However, it does seem like he's stronger than others ... Strange?"Li Hao was a little confused."In the past, they would gather for a while before dispersing. This time, it's lasted for a long time. It's still getting stronger!" It's the first time I've encountered such a situation ... It's fine. I'll ask the sea Protector and the others later. These people actually know more than I do. Neo martial and silver Moon are connected, and they are so targeted ... Could it be that they have discovered an external force?"Li Hao chuckled."The great Dao universe can be unreliable sometimes too. Only commander and I are here. Unless it's from a third party, which is said to be the power of the Crimson Moon world, it shouldn't be like this. It's really strange."When he said that, Wu Peng's eyes flickered."What Eleventh Division commander means is that once the power of the Crimson Moon world enters, it will be greatly impacted?" n(0)velbIn[.]nEt "En!"Li Hao nodded."It's said so ... But I'm not sure about the details. Until now, I've never seen this kind of power. I've only heard about it from a few seniors, so I have a rough idea."Wu Peng nodded and did not ask any further.

2066 Chapter 350
He looked around and asked doubtfully,""Then when we go out later, are we going to go back the way we came?""That's not for sure. "Li Hao said, do you see the stars here? Each star is a new path, and as long as you tear the void near the new path, you'll be able to get out, but the exit might not necessarily be here, it might appear near the owner of the new path ... Right now, I'm the only new path in heaven battling city, so commander, don't run around randomly. Once you tear the void and appear in the outside world, the situation outside is still unclear, and if you're targeted by someone, it'll be easy for you to get into trouble. "Wu Peng looked around again but did not say anything.A star, a new path.If he tore apart the void elsewhere, he would appear in the outside world.Li Hao, who was also polishing his armor, continued,""The sealing mark is about to form. Once it's done, there won't be any pressure. When commander goes out, he won't be targeted by heaven and earth."After saying that, he was puzzled again,'why is the lightning still here? It was really strange. Logically speaking, it should not have lasted for such a long time, unless the power of the Crimson Moon appeared. Could it be that someone from the Crimson Moon world had entered? That's impossible. I'm the only one who can enter this place ..."After saying that, he turned to look at Wu Peng with some doubt. His eyes gradually revealed some suspicion.Wu Peng's expression was calm. When he saw Li Hao looking at him, he shook his head and said,""I'm not sure either. Could it be that the 11th Division commander was accidentally invaded by the Crimson Moon?""Invasion?"Li Hao looked suspicious, can the power of the Crimson Moon invade people? Has commander Wu seen him before?"After saying that, he took a few steps back, and his eyes seemed to reveal a strange look.The next moment, the air trembled slightly. Wu Peng raised his brows slightly."11th Division commander ... You're opening the universe void?""Um ... This ... It's almost time, let's go out first! I'm afraid that the others are getting impatient ..."The suspicion in Li Hao's eyes grew. He said carefully,""Commander Wu, let's go out first. I'll come back for the armor. The lightning is getting more and more serious. I'm afraid I can't withstand it. Let's retreat first ...""That works too!"Wu Peng nodded, but he knew that Li Hao was suspicious.It turned out that the great path universe had such a use.It would detect external forces.Li Hao might not understand, but if he went out and talked about it, the others would probably know.He had originally wanted to get in touch with them and go deeper.But now ..."Let's go out first, in case everyone gets worried ..."Wu Peng said.Then, he suddenly said in surprise,""What's that?""What?"Li Hao turned his head. The next moment, a powerful force erupted and swept toward him!Wu Peng's expression was cold. As long as they didn't return through the original passageway and could use other stars to appear in the outside world, that was enough.This Li Hao was still too inexperienced! Otherwise, if he had known that the great path universe would reject the power of the Crimson Moon, perhaps he would have understood long ago. He was too young!BOOM!Wu Peng, who was good at defense, punched out with an extremely powerful explosive force. With a loud boom, Li Hao's body shattered. He turned to look at Wu Peng in disbelief."Commander ... Why are you doing this?"Wu Peng did not say anything.Why was he still like this now?This Li Hao ... Was he really not on guard at all?How could such a person succeed?The next moment, an even more powerful force swept toward Li Hao. Wu Peng's voice was calm.""I didn't want to do this either. It's just that after we get out ... You might bring me trouble ... If you want to blame me, blame it. This is the universe of the great path, and it can even distinguish energy. This is my first time coming into contact with it, so I don't understand it either. Thank you for reminding me!"It was not until this moment that Li Hao seemed to have realized what was going on. He was extremely shocked."You ... You're from the Crimson Moon ... Impossible, heaven battling city is my best ally ...""That's them, not me. "  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  BOOM!A punch was thrown!With a loud bang, a shield appeared and blocked the fist.Wu Peng's expression changed slightly.The next moment, the shield turned into a human figure. The old turtle's eyes were complicated."Why would I?""Guardian turtle?" Wu Peng's expression changed."Guardian turtle?"Why was it here?Not far away, Li Hao's broken body quickly disappeared. When he reappeared, he was already on the bright star. Wu Peng's expression changed. The next moment, countless origin forces on the star were about to explode!Not only that, but the battle armor was also trembling as if it was about to explode!However, Li Hao sat on the star, allowing the origin Energy to shake and the star to be broken. He only suppressed the armor and smiled.""Commander, shattering the stars won't have much of an impact. What's the point of wasting time?"“……”Wu Peng's expression changed. At this moment, his body suddenly expanded. As his expression changed, a golden light flashed and a golden body appeared beside director Wang.Director Wang's body exploded with a bang.In an instant, the other party's original physical body appeared, and his expression was somewhat unsightly. He looked at Li Hao, then at the turtle Guardian."You guys ... Already found out?"Li Hao didn't say anything. He just looked at Guardian turtle in silence."What has heaven battling city done to you?" the old turtle sighed.Wu Peng's expression changed as he looked at the two of them.""You're not doing me any wrong. It's just ... I'm just a Guardian. I also want to know, in what way am I inferior to Li Daozong? Even an undying can become the commander of the main Army, and I, who has been guarding heaven battling city for many years, am the commander of the reserve army! "When the Third Army's commander was promoted, I thought that it would be my turn, but in the end, the higher-ups took a fancy to Li Daozong. He's an undying, while I, a Saint, am still the commander of the guards! Everyone knows that the defensive Army is inferior to the main Army. Li Daozong taking over my position was already his limit, and you saw the result?"

2067 Chapter 350
Li Daozong had been promoted, and he was going to the main Army!And I'm still the commander of the guards!"Just because of this?"The old turtle sighed,"the guards have more responsibilities!" To ensure the safety of one party ..." "Do you believe that?"Wu Peng laughed."That's what everyone says. But if I were to ask the commander of the main Army to switch positions with me, do you think anyone would agree?"The old turtle was speechless.He would definitely not agree!Indeed, the commander of the guards was not as good as the main force.However, the higher-ups had also considered everything.It didn't mean that he was more suitable just because he was stronger."Isn't it because he's from the Li family?"Wu Peng laughed."Because we're not descendants of venerable sovereigns, even if there's a chance, they'll be given priority. They'll be promoted to general once they enter the Army, while we'll have to work hard for many years ... In that case, we can only fight for our own opportunities! Whether it was a human King or a venerable sovereign, everything had been fought for by oneself, hadn't it? Wasn't the spirit of neo martial to resist everything? Then is it wrong for me to resist injustice?"His words fell, BOOM!The old turtle's eyes changed slightly, and his voice reverberated,""So, you've been clear-headed all these years? And the last time you went out, you weren't injured at all?""It's a pity that you've always been clear-headed, otherwise ... Heaven battling city would have been taken over by me long ago! It's such a pity ... Old turtle, you're just the soul of a divine weapon. Why do you have to work so hard for the human race?""You betrayed ..."The old turtle's true form appeared in an instant, and a huge shield covered the sky as it pressed down on the other party!One man and one turtle quickly began to fight.As for Li Hao, he continued to suppress the armor. After a while, the armor stopped moving, and Li Hao let out a breath.The armor and the origin mark had been washed away!Wu Peng ...Once the origin mark had been washed, he would be able to brand it. He reached out and grabbed some origin power. After analyzing it for a while, a faint trace of origin power appeared in his hand.He pondered for a while. 'How about I pretend to be Wu Peng?'The armor was there, and the origin Energy was there.Following that, he began to observe Wu Peng's every word and action, including his combat techniques, moves, habits ...However, he was still lacking a little bit of the Crimson Moon's power.What was on his body had been washed away.Perhaps ... I should go to the seal again and let that venerable sovereign infect me a little.From the beginning to the end, he did not make a move.He had never expected a traitor to appear in heaven battling city, and one with such a high status at that.This also disrupted some of his original plans.However, it didn't matter.It didn't matter if there was one less Saint. Those monster plants could also replace a Saint.He did not interfere and only continued to collect the other party's overflowing aura, Origin Energy, energy, and even blood essence power ...Now, he only wanted to know whether this guy was a member of the red moon or the red dust World.If he was from the Crimson Moon, then he would be of little use.After an unknown period of time, Wu Peng let out a shrill cry and tore open the void near a star. However, the next moment, his expression changed drastically. After tearing open the void ... It was still an endless void!"Are you lying to me?" he roared.Li Hao sighed."Even the turtle Guardian appeared. Of course I was lying to you ..." He said."You only understand now?"Your reaction is too slow! Wu Peng was furious. He roared, and his powerful qi and blood surged out.And just at this moment, a huge sword appeared in the world.The huge sword appeared in the entire universe.Endless energy, the power of great DAOs, and the surrounding lightning all surged into it. At this moment, the huge sword took form.Li Hao chuckled."Commander Wu, take this!"In an instant, the sword seemed to contain the power of the entire universe. It shattered the world and slashed down!Wu Peng's expression changed drastically!The old turtle's expression also changed. The next moment, he locked onto his opponent with his sword. With a loud bang, his saintly way body was cut in half.And the other party was still rapidly healing.Li Hao only slashed once and didn't attack again.The old turtle sighed. The next moment, a huge shield appeared and smashed down, directly smashing his body into pieces. A trace of spiritual energy appeared and the old turtle shouted, BOOM!The big shield smashed down again, and with a bang, the mental energy was smashed into pieces!Wu Peng's voice reverberated with a hint of anger,""Old turtle, I didn't betray you long ago. It's just that the Stargate was closed when we went out that time, and we had no way out. Since that's the case, why can't I seek my own way out? We've been comrades for many years, but you've broken my body and shattered my spirit for an outsider ..."At this moment, Li Hao controlled the power of a great Dao. In the next moment, a great Dao appeared in the void. It was the origin great Dao. It trembled violently and collided with the great Dao universe.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  The old turtle suddenly turned around and looked at Li Hao.Li Hao's face was calm.Traitors ... Shall be killed without mercy!I didn't say that.The old turtle's expression changed, and many thoughts ran through his mind. Li Hao ... Was really different from before!From the beginning to the end, he had only slashed out with his sword and destroyed his opponent's physical body.After that, he only presented the other party's great Dao of origins.Li Hao didn't say a word.The old turtle let out a soft sigh, and in the next moment, he let out a fierce roar. A shield shot into the void, and with a loud boom, a scream resounded through the universe, and the great Dao collapsed.Wu Peng's voice resounded."You guys ... Cut off my source ... Old turtle ... You ... Are too vicious!"……In an instant, the old turtle transformed into his human form and appeared beside Li Hao. He had a complicated look in his eyes."Governor li, are you ... Satisfied?"Li Hao bowed slightly."Senior, please don't misunderstand. This is how we should treat traitors. Otherwise, it doesn't matter to me whether we kill them or not. Even traitors have a chance of survival, and others might follow suit.""AI!"The sigh resounded through the heavens and the earth. The next moment, the world spun and a man and a turtle appeared in front of everyone.General Huai's expression changed slightly while li Fuhai remained calm.The eighth and Ninth Division commanders arrived quickly. They were in disbelief. Their commander ... Had fallen!He had completely fallen!As the teachers, they could receive the message.How did this happen?The one who had killed their commander was The Guardian turtle. They could sense that as well. At that moment, they could feel the resentment surrounding The Guardian turtle.Li Fuhai didn't say anything. He only glanced at Li Hao, who was playing with the armor, and thought to himself,'this kid ... He looks like a gentle scholar, but he's really ruthless!'Not only that, but this armor ... How did he completely strip it off?At this moment, Li Hao also looked up and smiled. He nodded at li Fuhai, but his smile soon turned into sadness. He said softly,""I didn't expect that our commander would be attacked by the Crimson Moon. What a pity ..."Li Fuhai cursed in his heart. F * ck, the human race was indeed terrifying!If such a bastard could appear in the new generation of humans, it was no wonder that the demon race could not win against them. Even the old turtle had been fooled by this person. He was really not a good thing!

2068 Chapter 351
The eighth division commander, Yang Wei, still couldn't believe it. He looked at the crowd with a shocked expression,""The commander is a traitor?"Li Hao didn't reply.I don't know.The old turtle killed him!The reason I called the old turtle along was for this, and it had nothing to do with me.He wasn't trying to shirk responsibility.Instead, he understood the neo martial artists better!If he had killed them, regardless of whether the other party was right or wrong, these new martial artists would feel uncomfortable and disgusted. They would think that Li Hao was too vicious for killing their commander.The cooperation with heaven battling city had finally been reached.Li Hao didn't want to cause any trouble.The old turtle was a clear-headed person. It was sometimes easier to talk and communicate with strong people. However, a boorish man like the eighth division commander might be resentful even if he knew that killing was necessary.It was as simple as that.Sure enough, the old turtle sighed."Yes, Wu Peng said that he was dissatisfied with Li Daozong becoming the commander of the 3rd Army, while he was still the commander of the reserve guards. That's why he was roped in after he went out last time ...""But ..."The eighth division commander still found it hard to accept. He said,""What's wrong with being a reserve guard?"  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  He felt that it was very good!They were all soldiers, just in different positions. Was it that important?The front line was a battle, but wasn't staying behind also a battle?The few of them did not speak.It was hard to say or comment on this. For some people, the commander of the main plot Legion was much higher than the guard Legion.None of the defense Legion commanders had ever become a Legion Commander, but the Legion commanders of the main plot Legion had reached the sky in a single bound and become Legion commanders!This was the difference!At this moment, the ninth Division commander's body did not seem to have fully recovered. There were still some wriggling blood vessels, and his eyes were a little complicated."Is it because of me?"The old turtle remained silent.Not only because of this, but also because Wu Peng was dissatisfied with the people of the eight great families, so the starting point was high.For example, Li Hao, who had come from many generations away, would have been a master at the very beginning if not for the ninth master's suppression. It was normal for them to be dissatisfied. At this moment, Li Hao could actually understand this feeling.At this time, he changed the topic and asked with a bit of confusion,""Actually ... I have some doubts too. I don't know if it's a good or bad thing that the second generation has a high starting point. If they don't have a high starting point, then aren't their fathers working hard all their lives for glory, wealth, and rank? "But if the starting point is high, it's very unfair to others ... Can't neo martial arts solve this?"This was a problem that had always existed since ancient times.The emperor's son would never start off with the beggar's son.The starting point of both sides was different!How could he avoid this conflict?Neo martial didn't seem to be able to solve this problem.If everyone was treated equally, then for many people, they would have dedicated their entire lives and fought. Wouldn't that be unfair?The old turtle frowned slightly and said,'actually, it's just a slightly higher starting point, but neo martial arts is also about those who are capable rising and those who are mediocre falling! If he didn't do it well, he would be kicked down very quickly! It didn't mean that if you started high, you would be high for life! "The reason you start off high is to give some people who have contributed a lot peace of mind. You want them to understand that your efforts are worth it, but your descendants are incompetent. That opportunity was given to them, but they didn't grab it."Li Hao nodded."But there will still be people like Wu Peng. They think that this is unfair, right?""There will definitely be something unavoidable."The old turtle sighed."This is also a test. It's a test of one's mentality and ability to bear. We can't make all the heroes who have made great contributions dissatisfied just because some people are dissatisfied, right?"Li Hao pondered and said, what if I give some honorary merits to the descendants of the heroes?The old turtle nodded."Actually, it's fine. It's just that ... Sometimes it's not that simple. You give some nominal merits, but some people will be dissatisfied. Some people feel that you should give nothing at all, but ... The governor also said that they have all worked hard for their entire lives after achieving merits. When they die in battle, get old, or retire, don't you take care of them at all?""If that's the case, these people will think that we've been fighting for our entire lives. When we're old, we can't fight anymore, our strength will be weakened, and we'll die in battle ... Won't we have nothing?"That was true! Li Hao nodded again."That's a problem. Fortunately, in the world of cultivation, the average lifespan is long. I kind of understand why the human Emperor doesn't care about those behind him. He can 't!" I can't even take care of the contribution points that we've earned from fighting together in the same era. "He was just changing the topic and didn't plan to delve into it.Some things were hard to distinguish between right and wrong.It was also a good idea to reward the meritorious official, but when the meritorious official was in a high position and had great power, how could his descendants start from the bottom?This thing was too complicated, and not everyone would be satisfied with it.Li Hao changed the topic and said,"now that something has happened to commander Wu, I'm worried about whether the other heaven-battling armies have been affected!" Fortunately, the turtle Guardian has been in heaven battling city all these years. Even if the other party wants to, they won't have the opportunity to do so. What I'm afraid of is that some people will still be affected. "Everyone revealed a worried expression.If that was the case ... Wouldn't that mean ... He would have to kill more of his comrades?

2069 Chapter 351
They were extremely unwilling to see this happen.Li Hao continued,"if the impact isn't serious, it doesn't matter much. I'm just afraid that the impact will be too great. I suggest ... We do some investigations on the experts who have recovered. As for those who haven't recovered, we'll leave them alone for now!" "Also, if the impact is not big, and only the power of the Crimson Moon slightly affects them, we will remove the power of the Crimson Moon and monitor them. If we can prove that the other party did not do anything wrong, we may not have to kill them.""Even if Wu Peng has roped in a group of people, the other side may not know his true purpose. Not to mention, heaven battling city has been dormant for many years, Wu Peng may not have this opportunity, so everyone doesn't need to worry too much." Li Hao quickly took the initiative and said,""Don't worry about that for now. Ninth Division commander, you should continue to repair your body. We are pressed for time and can't delay any longer. Now that Wu Peng is in trouble, we are in even more trouble!""Also, I have an idea. If Wu Peng is in cahoots with the Zheng family, I can impersonate Wu Peng and maybe I'll get some unexpected gains ... Do you mind telling me more about Wu Peng's situation? Including his life and his network of connections ..."In a few words, he skipped the topic of killing Wu Peng.The eighth division commander wanted to say something, but he did not know where to start.When he saw Li Hao holding the commander's armor, he had wanted to take it back, but now that Li Hao said he was going to pretend to be Wu Peng and deceive the enemy, he couldn't ask for it back.He was useful!Li Hao continued,"in order to make my disguise more convincing, I'm considering whether I should temporarily take over Wu Peng's position as the commander of the reserve guards. According to the wartime regulations, the two guardians and several division commanders have agreed. I'll have the right to take over!"“……”There was an instant silence.The commander of the reserve guards!He was currently the number one person in the military.Even the 9th Division commander was only a temporary commander."How can we do that?" the eighth division commander was anxious.This won't do!Even if the commander had really betrayed them, Li Daozong could still take over the reserve guards. How could he let an outsider like Li Hao take over?Even if it was only temporary ... That would not do!It was temporary, but if Li Hao didn't give up his position in the future, it wouldn't be good to fire a commander and two guards. Would they be able to give up their pride and force Li Hao to quit later?If he didn't quit, Li Hao would be the official commander!From now on, he would be the official head of the reserve guards!This Li Hao ... Has bad intentions!  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  If he had such a thought, one could imagine the complicated look in the eyes of the others, even the ninth Division commander.You ... You've been planning this for a long time, right?I haven't even been promoted to the position of the Army commander yet, but you're the one who wants to be promoted first.Li Hao said softly,"don't worry, everyone. After I deal with the Zheng family, I won't need this position anymore. I'll naturally give it to you. A mere commander is not what I want, right?"“……”The few of them were silent.They looked at each other and didn't speak. This ... Could he refuse?Why did he feel like he had invited a Wolf into his house when he cooperated with Li Hao this time? Li Hao was more aggressive this time!When Wu Peng was killed, the old turtle felt a sense of powerlessness.Now, he couldn't refuse!Li Hao had said that he was going to impersonate Wu Peng, enter the enemy's rear, and give the enemy a Thunderbolt strike. This was a risk, not an enjoyment. In order to make his impersonation more rigorous, it seemed inevitable that he would be given the authority of a commander.If he didn 't, it would be very dangerous. He might even get Li Hao killed.Was this still considered cooperation?Therefore, he could only give it to her!The old turtle was in a dilemma. General Huai, on the other hand, sighed inwardly and quickly said,""Sure ... As long as the eighth and Ninth Division commanders have no objections, then today, the three sides will carry out the wartime decree and let Governor li take charge of the reserve guards!""General Huai!"The eighth division commander was anxious.Li Hao said softly,'the eighth division commander doesn't agree? "Forget it, how about this, the position of the reserve army commander will be given to the eighth division commander. The eighth division commander will be in charge of dealing with the Zheng family's rebellion. He is just a King. Of course, boorish men like to slap their faces until they are fat. What I am afraid of is that if they don't deal with the other party, they will harm themselves. That's fine, but what I am more afraid of is that they will harm everyone!""There are some people who can't do it themselves and insist on being reckless. It's fine if they kill themselves, but they implicate their comrades, friends, and family and still think that they are not in the wrong ... Such people must be kept away from them!"The eighth division commander was furious!These words were too hurtful."Cough cough!"The old turtle coughed and interrupted the two.""Let's do as Governor li says. Everything is to kill the enemy and get rid of the traitors. Yang Wei, unless you have a better idea, otherwise ... Execute the order!"The eighth division commander was speechless.Li Hao, on the other hand, revealed a faint smile.At the side, li Fuhai was also secretly speechless.Of course, such a result was also because heaven battling city was willing to compromise. Otherwise, Li Hao wouldn't have been able to take it away so easily.In the past, Li Hao had relied more on heaven battling city than heaven battling city.Now, it was the opposite.Heaven battling city seemed to rely more on Li Hao.The two guardians did not say anything else and looked at the ninth master.""Dao sect, do you have any objections?"Li Daozong was silent for a moment before saying,"No... It's just ... Forget it, let's just leave it at that!"He didn't know what to say.They only knew that Li Hao had changed a lot today. And, without them knowing, he had forced everyone to make this choice. He had easily taken the position of general of the heaven battling Army.
