Those who didn't know would think that the other party was from neo martial.Li Hao looked at Tian He. The deterrence of neo martial ... Was not enough.He didn't care at all.This also meant that he was determined to win over this third rank venerable sovereign. As for anything else, it was all nonsense. A few seventh rank venerable sovereigns had failed to scare the other party. As a first rank venerable sovereign, even if he told the other party that he was from the Silver Moon, it would be useless. The other party might even turn hostile and arrest him!At this moment, Rainbow Rising venerable sovereign let out a breath and looked at Li Hao with cold eyes."Fellow Daoist Hao Yue, did the Dragon return temple send you to inform me?"He had just thought that this person was from neo martial arts and had a sense of deterrence.When he heard the other party say that he was from the Huilong temple, he felt a little more at ease.Li Hao shook his head."No... Of course, this isn't the point. The point is, now that venerable sovereign rising rainbow has joined the Tianhe zone, does that mean that he is on the same side as the Tianhe zone?"Rising rainbow frowned.This person was very strange!Of course, he didn't say much because the other party was from the Huilong temple. On the other hand, Tian He thought that this guy was here to poach him and was instantly very dissatisfied!Huilong temple has already roped in the venerable sovereigns of the two worlds. I've finally managed to rope in a third rank venerable sovereign, and you're here."Of course!""Although neo martial is strong, they are now enemies both inside and outside. They will be destroyed sooner or later!" The heavenly River Thearch said coldly. The Tianhe zone will avenge the destruction of the Yunyang world for brother Shenghong! The Dragon Temple would not need to worry about this matter! If fellow Daoist is here to verify something, then let me tell you, if the new martial artists dare to come, I, Tian He, will be the first to not let them off!"Were these words appropriate?Li Hao thought for a while and glanced at the man again.What else can I say?"Venerable sovereigns?" he looked at the other three venerable sovereigns and asked,"do the three venerable sovereigns have the same idea?"Yuji frowned slightly and said indifferently,"fellow Daoist Hao Yue, you're asking without any sense of propriety!" This was the Tianhe zone, not the return Dragon Zone. Even if it was the return Dragon Zone, since the Tianhe zone had been United, they would certainly advance and retreat together! Do you really think that the Tianhe zone will collapse on its own with just a few words and a so-called threat from a neo martial artist?"What are you thinking!This was the time to express his stance.Even if the Dragon returning temple wants to rope us in, we won't care.As expected, Tian He's complexion improved.As for that rising rainbow, his face was a little cold,""Yun Cang was killed by a neo martial artist? Who did it?"Then, he glanced at Li Hao in disgust.He didn't like this person at first glance.In addition, he didn't like her tone and style.If it wasn't for the fact that he had some qualms, he would have attacked this person at this moment. A very disgusting aura emerged from this person's body.Sword Saint!Of course, there was a high chance that it was not venerable the sword, but a swordsman. He also hated it. "It's said to be the Silver Moon King!""From the world where new martial arts was born, the Silvermoon world!" Li Hao explained seriously.As soon as he said that, the few of them were stunned. Sheng Hong was instantly enraged,""What? The king of the Silvermoon world? Bastard, you're looking for death! A venerable sovereign from an unranked world dared to be so impudent! You bastard!"Silver Moon King? What the hell!It was a new world that had just appeared, and it was said that it was not popular.Such a king of the world deserved to die for killing Yun Cang.As for how he killed Yun Cang, he wasn't sure.Li Hao ignored him and looked at Tian He.""Sky River venerable sovereign, after killing Yun Cang, the Silver Moon King is still clamoring to kill Sacred Emperor Shenghong ... At this moment, if the sky River region tries to protect Shenghong, it would be equivalent to going against the Silver Moon King."Tian He laughed.This time, as he laughed, he was also somewhat angry,"Hao Yue! Are you representing the Huilong temple? Even fellow Daoist Huilong wouldn't dare to question me like this! Silver Moon King? What a joke! If a mere world Lord dares to appear here, I'll tear him into pieces and avenge fellow Daoist Yun Cang!""And ... Don't think that you can do anything just because you joined the Dragon Temple!"He frowned and looked at Li Hao. This person made him even more uncomfortable.Those who didn't know better would think that he was the Abbey Dean of the Huilong temple!How dare you be so impudent to a fourth level venerable sovereign!Li Hao didn't say anything else. After a moment of silence, he looked at the others, raised his head, and said,""Then, seniors, can you give me some time?"The few of them were stunned. What did he mean?At this moment, Li Hao sat cross-legged, and a long river appeared.The few of them were stunned. They were completely confused by Li Hao, not quite sure what he meant.Moreover, it was only a first level venerable sovereign ... They didn't care about the danger.One should know that there were five venerable sovereigns here, including a medium-level venerable sovereign!That River ... n(0)velbIn[.]nEt The few of them observed it carefully, but they weren't too sure. What was this?The great Dao?It didn't seem like it. It wasn't connected to the Dao universe.What kind of method was that?Beside Li Hao, Imperial Emperor Yu Ji was also somewhat dissatisfied. He shouted in a low voice,""Fellow Daoist Hao Yue! Since you're from the Dragon Temple, we won't argue with you, but at this moment ... What are you doing? It's simply ridiculous to damage the prestige of a venerable sovereign!"Li Hao used winding river to surround the area, and even venerable sovereign Tianhe could not hold back.At this moment, he wanted to directly attack and seriously injure the other party.

p This is too much!What is this place? is this a place for you to act so atrociously?You're cultivating here?Or what?Ever since he had entered, he had been baffled and angry, but Li Hao didn't care.Since this person insisted on going forward and retreating together ... Then it was fine.He cast winding river and asked,""It is said that this place was left behind by a rank six venerable sovereign, and it was left behind by a venerable sovereign who specialized in water. I wonder if there is a big difference between the rank six venerable sovereign Tian He and the rank six venerable sovereign?"Tian He's eyes were cold. At this moment, he directly walked down from his throne and walked toward Li Hao, his eyes cold.He was not interested in answering!At this moment, he only had one thought. This person didn't put him in his eyes at all. This time, even if he didn't give face to the Dragon returning temple, he couldn't lose face in front of Shenghong.A mere first level venerable sovereign dared to be so presumptuous. How could he establish his authority?As he walked toward Li Hao, Li Hao didn't hesitate at all. Since you're still so insistent, then come!Do you think that I don't have enough life and death power to kill one?What about killing a group of them?It might even be enough to advance to a rank three venerable sovereign.That's good!It was just nice to settle it in one go.He just didn't know how much strength he could borrow from that Tian Fang grade six sovereign venerable.Could he borrow the power from the other party's Taoist connotation?Under normal circumstances, it would be possible.The premise was that the opponent's main body was still alive. If he died, his past and future would be gone, which would be difficult to deal with. Li Hao didn't know whether the opponent was alive or dead, and that the two level 7s he met were both alive.As for Tier 6 ... He would just have to give it a try."If the experiment fails ... I'll just say that I'm here to cultivate. At most, I'll be beaten up and return to the Dragon Temple with the identity of a member of the Dragon Temple. The other party won't dare to kill me.That was what Li Hao was thinking.As the celestial River Thearch approached, his time star suddenly exuded a powerful time power. The chaos lightning tribulation that had dissipated outside the skyward world reappeared!Even though Li Hao had sealed off both ends, the other party still appeared.However, he seemed to be looking for something, searching for something, and locating something.The vastness and power of the Outlander world seemed to be interfering with the lightning tribulation.……At this moment, Li Hao's life and death Star disappeared and was replaced by the time star.The entire River turned into a river of time again.However, Li Hao was more knowledgeable now. With one look, he knew that his river of time was actually very thin and didn't have the mysterious impermanence of the power of time.He began to reverse time, and his lifespan began to deplete.The long river instantly pierced through the heavens and earth!He seemed to have come into contact with something.This was the first time that Li Hao had turned back time to draw in the past of another expert ... The king of Dali and the others had done the same before, but they had only used weapons to draw in the afterimages of the past. This time, Li Hao was using the Dao reserve to lure out a level six venerable sovereign!Suddenly, Li Hao's expression changed.Within his body, his lifespan was being consumed rapidly.He was visibly aging!Li Hao's expression changed. Was it so exhausting to guide a Tier 6?I'm already a venerable sovereign!To venerable sovereigns, their lifespan was clearly being consumed. This meant that the consumption was huge. Moreover, the other party had not appeared yet. If they were to draw the other party out ... Wouldn't it mean ... They would need countless years of lifespan?As his expression changed, he instantly appeared in his own River and stepped into the upper reaches of the river. There, a shadow could be seen.At this moment, that person seemed to have seen Li Hao.It was actually a woman!The woman looked at Li Hao and sized him up across time and space.Li Hao also looked at the woman and said,""As Dao master punctuality, I'll borrow fellow Daoist's power. If you're willing ... I'll owe you another favor. If we're fated to meet again, I'll definitely repay you!"At that moment, the woman seemed to have heard his words. Without much consideration, she replied with one word,""Yes!"Daoist master punctuality!A cultivator with the power of time borrowing the power of time?Borrow!To anyone, as long as it didn't involve a critical moment of life and death, as long as they were alive and met in the future, they would definitely reap some benefits.At this moment, the shadow crossed the river and instantly merged into Li Hao's body. At this moment, the water element in the river of time suddenly became incomparably powerful!The great Dao of water instantly appeared.In fact, at this moment, life and death, time, and the Tier 6 great Dao of water had already transcended time and life and death. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt The entire River had turned into water element power.At this moment, the firmament sword appeared!The sword pierced through the world!As for venerable sovereign Tian He, he had already sensed that something was amiss. When this sword appeared, his expression changed drastically. He instantly shuttled through the void and was about to escape. It was too powerful!Sixth rank?How was that possible?Was this venerable sovereign Hao Yue a sixth rank venerable sovereign?And it's even Water-type?He was a Water-type venerable sovereign from the same origin. A sixth rank venerable sovereign could completely suppress him.At the same time, the river transformed into heaven and earth.In an instant, it covered the entire Tianhe mansion.In an instant, ten thousand long swords converged.The five venerable sovereigns were all shrouded in it.Li Hao's long sword cut through the void. Heavenly River Supreme Emperor fled, but Yu Ji, a level two Supreme Emperor, was unable to escape. In an instant, the sword pierced through the chaotic great Dao, and countless great Dao origins collapsed.

2632 Chapter 437
Yuji was still a little confused.Li Hao's original body could kill a second stage venerable sovereign, not to mention that he had borrowed the power of a sixth stage venerable. Even if it was a bit superficial, it was still not something a second stage venerable could compare to.With just one sword, he had pierced through it!"Longevity sword!"At this moment, Shenghong's body suddenly trembled. He seemed to see the longevity swordsman in this sword!​ Sword Saint!That day, it was this sword that had killed master of Yunyang. He was a peak fourth-rank venerable sovereign who had a medium-level world and was about to enter the fifth-rank, and he had world power.In the end, he was killed by the other party with a single sword strike!At this moment, it was as if he had returned to the time when he was terrified, afraid, terrified, and uneasy ...All of this turned into a single thought in an instant.Escape!He was skilled in the rainbow transformation Dao and was extremely fast. In an instant, he turned into a red light and wanted to escape from this place. He did not dare to collide with such a sword!Li Hao, on the other hand, did not care about the others, not even the heavenly River Thearch.At this moment, a water wall, like a heavenly chasm, blocked the path of the rainbow Rising venerable sovereign.Rainbow Rising venerable sovereign charged at the water wall with a loud bang. A dent appeared on the wall, and his expression changed drastically.How could this be!Water?Wasn't it the way of the sword?Longevity swordsman was only good at attacking. It seemed that he was not good at other things, such as blocking."Who are you?"His expression changed drastically, and he transformed into a red light to escape again.At this moment, a sword light, like a real longevity sword intent, was mixed with the power of water. At this moment, it even seemed to affect the whole world!……At the same time.In the outside world.The Skylands world.All of a sudden, the venerable sovereigns were shocked. They walked out of their seclusion and looked at the end of the world, confused and shocked.As Li Hao used the power of a level six venerable sovereign's great Dao, something seemed to have been drawn out.The great Dao universe!Back to the Dragon field.Hui long Emperor was a little excited, but also a little scared ...What was happening?Why ... Did he seem to feel the tianfang world trembling? it was as if ... The universe of the great path was about to appear.How did this happen?Didn't they say that one had to advance to Level Seven in their own land to have a chance of drawing out the great Dao universe?"Why is it that ..." He looked in the direction of the Tianhe zone and frowned slightly. It seemed that something had happened in the Tianhe zone. A powerful water-elemental force seemed to have attracted something.What was happening? Not far away, venerable sovereign Kong Ji raised his brows slightly and revealed a smile.Interesting!This person actually managed to borrow power, and it was the sixth level power of the great path of a Water-type venerable sovereign. It should be the Water-type power of the great path of Shui binghong, one of the five elements emissaries of the tianfang world.That person, along with venerable fire Yan of the fire element mountain, was one of the five-element emissaries.However, Shui binghong was slightly weaker. She was only at the peak of the sixth step and had yet to enter the seventh step.If it was Level Seven ... It might really draw out something on this day. There was even hope that a new great Dao universe would be born."It's really done ..."How did he do it?Why so?Could it be that this person's main cultivation wasn't the Dao of life and death? or could it be that the Dao of life and death could draw the power of death from the dead?All sorts of thoughts surfaced in his mind. At this moment, he had not considered time.The more he understood, the more he felt that it was impossible.Because time was indeed too magical.This day was destined to not be peaceful. The entire tianfang world was disturbed. He looked at the monastery master Hui long, who was not far away. As expected, the monastery master suddenly shouted,""Fellow Daoists, come with me to the Tianhe zone!"The Dragon field was the closest field to the Tianhe field.Something seemed to have happened over there. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt If he didn't go and take a look, wouldn't he die of regret if it was an opportunity?At this moment, a fifth and fourth stage venerable sovereign appeared in the temple. The other venerable sovereigns didn't go over because even if they did, it would be too late. As lower stage venerable sovereigns, they couldn't move that fast.As for Kong Ji, he only took a look and said,""I'll stay here!"Supreme Emperor Hui long did not say anything. It was not a bad idea to have a middle-stage Supreme Emperor stay behind. Besides, if the three of them went, it would not matter if there was one less fourth-stage venerable Emperor.The three of them quickly moved in the direction of the Tianhe zone!……The Tianhe zone.Li Hao's sword pierced through heaven and earth again. A red light instantly dispersed, revealing the true appearance of the rising rainbow. His face was full of fear as the sword pierced through his head, and the power of his great Dao instantly dissipated!But a stage three venerable sovereign was killed with a single sword!The two first level venerable sovereigns were already pale with fright.They were all fleeing!However, this place was already covered by the river. The entire sky and earth were covered by the river. The waves were turbulent, slapping in all directions. The monstrous power of water swept in all directions, and the two level one venerable sovereigns were directly swept back."I have nothing to do with the rising rainbow ..." Someone exclaimed.In just an instant, a single sword strike had resolved life and death.The power of life and death swept over the two first stage venerable sovereigns. They instantly aged, and the air of death filled the world. In the blink of an eye, they seemed to have experienced the five decays of heaven and man. They completely aged, and their strength was drained. The sword slashed again!Kachaa!The two of them turned into dust, not even leaving behind an expression of shock.In the distance, a person was resisting the huge wave. At this moment, he suddenly turned his head and looked at Li Hao with an unsightly expression."Time ... Borrowing power ... You're not really at the sixth step. You're only borrowing the power of the owner of this land of Dao reserves! Who are you?"The power of time!

"Li Hao, the new king of the Silver Moon!"Li Hao held his sword and left."I didn't want to target you, but you insisted on going with rising rainbow. In that case ... I'll send you on your way!""The new king of the Silver Moon?" venerable Lord Tianhe glared at him. Li Hao! Li Hao, do you really think you can kill me with the help of some ancient experts? Let's see how long you can last!"He was a fourth stage venerable sovereign!He wasn't like those initial stage venerable sovereigns. At his level, he had already undergone a transformation and was much stronger than a third stage venerable sovereign.If Li Hao thought that he was as easy to kill as those people, he would be underestimating himself.At this moment, Li Hao's aura declined a little. Not only that, but his body was still aging. This was the price of overusing time. His lifespan was being consumed rapidly.There was also a Primal Chaos lightning tribulation that was about to strike!And the opponent was a genuine rank four venerable sovereign.Not easy to kill!Not only that, there was a Tier 5 outside!Li Hao had actually sensed it, but he didn't care. As long as that person didn't attack, he wouldn't care. That person ... Might be related to the void.As for the things that the other party could sense ... The long river covered the area, so the other party's senses were limited. However, he knew that he had borrowed the power of this place and had a rank 6 Water-type aura.If the other party dared to infiltrate the river to spy on him ... Then no matter what, he had to make that person stay today!As long as he didn't penetrate the river, Li Hao wouldn't care.Grade 6 and Grade 4 were both in the middle level.However, there was still a gap.However, Li Hao's strength was weak and he couldn't last long. Killing the four venerable sovereigns took some time.At this moment, venerable sovereign Tian He had a good eye.In front of him, great Dao that were like giant Dragons appeared and surrounded him.A wall of water instantly enveloped him.A weapon even appeared and turned into a defensive shield.He had to defend!As long as they could defend against Li Hao's attack, they would definitely come after Li Hao's power faded or the return Dragon Emperor arrived.He was also saying, Li Hao, why aren't you running? 'I have no grudge against you. If you don't run now, you'll have nowhere to run once the Supreme Dragon Emperor arrives!' He's a genuine sixth-stage venerable sovereign, and in fact, he's from a great world. Although he's no longer involved with the great path universe of the great world, he can actually return to the great path universe at any time. At that time, he'll be a sixth-stage venerable sovereign of the great world ..."He wanted to intimidate this person and make him give up on pursuing him.Wavering a little was fine!As for Li Hao, he didn't say anything. He slashed out with his sword. At this moment, his powerful sword intent was ever-changing and incomparably powerful. His sword pierced through the layers of defensive barriers, but in the end, it exhausted its strength in front of the defensive barrier formed by his opponent's weapon.It actually didn't pierce through!Tian He heaved a sigh of relief.This was good!With that, he was safe.Li Hao, on the other hand, frowned. Water-type didn't have very strong offensive abilities.He was good at defense.Borrowing the power of a sixth-grade water element wasn't very good. If it was a fire element, he could break through the opponent's defense in an instant. What a pity. He didn't say anything, nor did he delay.At this moment, Time and Stars appeared once more.Suddenly, time seemed to reverse again.In an instant, all the defenses in front of the heavenly River sovereign seemed to have returned to how they were before. They disappeared all of a sudden. Before the heavenly River sovereign could recover, the sword had already pierced through him!Even venerable Emperor Tian He was stunned!At this moment, he was truly stunned. Why ... Was this so? Flowing time?A sword was stabbed into his head. At that moment, not only was his great Dao shattered, but it seemed like an internal world had been pierced through by the sword.Li Hao, on the other hand, gasped for breath. There wasn't much energy left in his body.He didn't say anything. He pulled out his sword again and pierced through the heaven and earth! n(0)velbIn[.]nEt BOOM!The sound of an explosion was heard and the powerful shockwaves shook the entire River. Supreme Emperor Tian He was in disbelief, unwillingness, despair, and frustration."How could this be?"I've just recruited a third rank venerable sovereign and I'm about to show off my skills.Why did he provoke such a fiend?Suddenly, he was killed by the other party."More importantly, I saw some hope just now and felt that the other party couldn't do anything to me. Why did all my defenses break in an instant ..."Was the power of time really omnipotent?Then, he looked at Li Hao ... At this moment, Li Hao looked so old that he seemed to be dying."I see!" He suddenly laughed.He suddenly felt a little relieved.You will die too.It's already extremely dangerous to use the power of a sixth-step cultivator, and it will consume a lot of my lifespan. Just now, he even reversed time and broke my defense. At this moment, Li Hao actually saw signs of infinite aging.This person didn't have much time left!He would also die!Since that's the case ... I'm at ease.Li Hao didn't say anything. He slashed again and destroyed everything. Everything turned into energy ripples and was suppressed by the river.I will die?He was a good person, and he didn't like to make people die in despair.I'm in control of the Dao of life and death. At most, I'll do it again.Although the Dao of life and death wasn't omnipotent, at the very least, it could resolve the consumption of one's lifespan.BOOM!The river shook.Li Hao turned his head and looked in a direction. At this moment, a crack appeared in the river. He looked in that direction, and a figure appeared in the void. The figure also looked at Li Hao, and Li Hao politely said,""Fellow Daoist, please stay away from me. The primal Chaos lightning tribulation is about to descend. I don't really wish for anyone to interfere while I'm undergoing the Tribulation."

2634 Chapter 437
The other party hadn't explored too deeply before, so Li Hao was quite polite.Even at this moment, he looked extremely old, but he was still gentle and polite.You leave now!The primal Chaos lightning tribulation was about to arrive. This time, with the help of the sixth stage venerable sovereign's power, the lightning tribulation would not be weak.In the distance, the expert in the dark void glanced at Li Hao. Seeing Li Hao's aging and weakness, he frowned slightly. At this moment, he really wanted to test him, and even ...Of course, he also thought of His Highness.That terrifying existence!From level five venerable sovereigns, because he had given up on the Dao universe and his status as a great world venerable sovereign, he had fallen to level three. Then, he had re-cultivated and stepped into level four again ...Many thoughts emerged in his mind. In fact, he was not afraid of Li Hao at the moment. He was more worried that Li Hao would be dissatisfied.Such a ruthless person ... He was very afraid.Moreover, His Highness "status was not ordinary.As this thought emerged, he instantly fled, and his voice resounded,""I don't mean to be your enemy, but ... You're dying. Even if you survive the lightning tribulation, you ... Don't have much time left. Also, venerable sovereign Hui long will be here in half an hour at most. He's a sixth level venerable sovereign, and he's very fast!"Li Hao had spent a day, but the other party should be able to arrive in half an hour.The difference in speed between the two sides could be seen!Of course, Li Hao wasn't in a hurry, but the other party was definitely in a hurry."Help me thank Dao friend void!""Alright, but ... Forget it." The man laughed.His Highness didn't like people calling him fellow Daoist.Of course, this had nothing to do with him.He quickly escaped.At this moment, a massive dark cloud of tribulation lightning appeared above the Tianhe zone. Outside the long river, countless tribulation lightning bolts appeared. Second cat was a little unhappy and depressed.What a huge dark cloud!This was really ... The death of the cat!Li Hao said nothing. He used up the last of his borrowed power and suddenly slashed at the sky. He wanted to see if he could break the dark clouds with his remaining power. Even if he couldn 't, he would consume some of his energy.A sword that could break the heavens and earth!"Neo martial artist li Changsheng, sword breaks the firmament!"Li Hao's shout echoed throughout the Tianhe zone."I'm killing people for venerable the sword ... Not for myself. Venerable the sword has to take the blame for this!"Otherwise, I won't have an easy time in the future. A sword shot through the heavens and earth!The sword light shone in all directions and was extremely powerful. This sword was as bright as the longevity sword. The pure sword intent was extremely powerful! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  With a loud boom, the sword cut through half of the dark cloud.However, it didn't completely shatter the lightning tribulation.Li Hao, on the other hand, had aged to the extreme in the blink of an eye, and the aura of decay emerged from his body.Taking advantage of this moment, second cat swallowed the heavens and earth. It opened its mouth and swallowed the entire starry sky.More than half of the remaining dark clouds were devoured again.As for second cat ... His entire body was charred black from the lightning in his body. Even the good-tempered second cat couldn't help but curse,""You bad thing!"It was hard to say whether it was Li Hao or Thunder.It was highly likely ... That it was Li Hao.There were still Thunderbolts.In an instant, it surged into the river. At this moment, Li Hao dispersed the power of time, and a life and death Star appeared. The life and death Star destroyed the remaining lightning tribulation!The Qi of life and death surrounded the Tribulation lightning and shook.The entire River was in a state of violent turbulence!Li Hao's body was getting weaker and weaker. He was going to be reborn and abandoned anyway, so he didn't care about that. He took advantage of this moment and suddenly wanted to experience something. He instantly entered the lightning.It opened its mouth and instantly devoured all the remaining lightning energy.Within his body, the sound of explosions continued.A destructive force spread out from his body. Li Hao's body was constantly shattered, but his broken body was integrated into the four barriers of the river.Using the physical body to forge the wall of heaven and earth!BOOM!His body exploded.A moment later, an extremely weak figure appeared in the river. Li Hao raised his eyebrows. His body exploded and merged with the barriers around him. At this moment, he was only an incarnation of Dao power.He quickly gathered the river and swept it away, disappearing from the spot in the blink of an eye.Although he had lost his physical body, this time, he did not feel that it was a pity.A fourth-rank, third-rank, second-rank, and two first-rank venerable sovereigns 'power had been swept away by him. His physical body and the power of the Thunder tribulation had also been swept away by him.'When I walk the path of life and death and appear again, I'll be able to secure the 2nd rank. As for the 3rd rank ... I'll have to depend on my luck!'Li Hao instantly disappeared.However, the words "neo martial artist li Changsheng, sword breaks the firmament" were still reverberating in all directions.Sword Saint!

2635 Chapter 438
Not long after Li Hao left, the world shook.In an instant, several venerable sovereigns appeared.There was more than one person.The Dragon sovereign had arrived along with two of his middle-stage venerable sovereigns. In addition, there were two more fourth-stage venerable sovereigns near the Tianhe zone, making it a total of five middle-stage venerable sovereigns.At this moment, Li Hao's shout was still echoing in the world.Sword intent, lightning, and water energy surged."Sword Saint?""Neo martial!"Some people were shocked. The Hui long Emperor frowned slightly and looked around. The Tianhe mansion was in ruins. Except for a few venerable sovereigns who had died and a few guards who had disappeared, the rest of the people in the mansion were unconscious."No..."Hui long Emperor shook his head and frowned.""How could it be the neo martial art longevity sword? his sword intent ... Although I have never touched it personally, that person's sword only has killing intent. The sword intent here is obviously mainly Water-type."Someone was fishing in troubled waters?A sixth rank venerable sovereign!However ... He looked around for a long time before he said,""He might not be a sixth level venerable sovereign. He might be a middle level venerable sovereign who used the special Taoist connotation of this place to trigger the water. He might be a swordsman ... He might be a middle level swordsman!"He quickly made a judgment, but he guessed that the person should be an intermediate water swordsman.He had used some unknown method to borrow some of the Water-type Dao accumulation here.As a result, the Water-type Dao accumulation of this place was completely destroyed.As for Tier 1 ... He had never thought of it.His guess was that it was either the fourth or fifth rank."It seems like he has provoked a Primal Chaos lightning tribulation!"However, it was quickly defeated by the other party. This also meant that the other party was powerful. In addition, this method of borrowing power was also a heaven-defying move. However, the lightning tribulation ... Was not necessarily very strong. Otherwise, it would not have been defeated so easily."Tian He is dead. There should still be rising rainbow and the others!""Five venerable sovereigns!"Even the Dragon Emperor looked solemn.Five venerable sovereigns had died!This was a venerable sovereign. Unless there was a war in the great world, it was rare for a venerable sovereign to fall, not to mention that a middle-stage venerable sovereign had died this time.This meant that the other party was already a threat to him.To be able to kill a rank four meant that his strength was definitely above that of a rank four, and it was possible for him to be at the fifth or sixth rank.He looked around and found that the other party should have escaped.At that moment, the fifth rank venerable sovereign said softly,""There's a rotten smell left here ... It might be an old sword cultivator who took a risk to obtain some opportunities ..."Decaying and aging. The hearts of the few people moved. Such a venerable sovereign ... Was actually very difficult to deal with.Some venerable sovereigns were too ancient and on the verge of death. Such existences would do anything to achieve their goals.It was normal for an ancient venerable sovereign to have some special means.The air of decay made them think of many things. They even guessed that a venerable sovereign, who was about to die, had to take the risk and borrow the power of the land of Taoist connotation to kill the heavenly River sovereign.Venerable sovereign Tian He was a Water-type venerable sovereign ... That person could borrow the power of water, so he might belong to the same category as venerable sovereign Tian He.In that case, there was such a possibility.Such a fellow was really not to be trifled with ... He was about to completely fall, so who was afraid of who?In addition to the chaos in the nearby Hongyue region, it was in line with his expectations to use the name of the sword Saint to confuse the line of sight.The few of them did not think that it was the neo martial Swordmaster.If the other party was really here, why would he kill Tian He?As for Shenghong, he was a third level venerable sovereign. If he wanted to kill him, he might not have had the chance to escape last time. If venerable sword attacked, he would at least be a fifth level venerable sovereign."He's still in the tianfang world!"At this moment, Hui long Emperor frowned and said,""The four realm gates. They probably haven't left yet. If it's really an old and rotten venerable sovereign, then we have to be careful. A venerable sovereign who has reached the end of his life will do anything to prolong his life!"At this time, another fourth level venerable sovereign from the neighboring domain said uneasily,"Fellow Daoist long, will this man continue to attack venerable sovereigns?"It was too dangerous.He was only at the fourth step.But this time, from the start of the battle to the end, it was completed very quickly. Moreover, five venerable sovereigns had fallen at once. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  After some consideration, the Supreme Emperor said,""It's possible! If you're worried about your safety, venerable sovereigns, you can come to my Dragon Temple for a few days to discuss the Dao. "This was also his chance.Other than the three of them, there were two other rank four venerable sovereigns from other domains.In the southern region, besides the Hui long region, there were nine other intermediate-level sovereign-level region Lords.Today, one died, leaving only eight."If these two come to the Hui long temple, we'll have six middle-stage venerable sovereigns. The fifth-stage venerable sovereign from The Dark World has been in contact with him recently. If we can rope him in, we'll have seven middle-stage venerable sovereigns!Such strength was enough to suppress the other three major forces.Of course, the fellow who killed Tian He was also a problem.As he was thinking, the other fourth level venerable sovereign hesitated and said,""By the way, fellow Daoist Hui long, before I came here ... I seemed to have sensed that a medium-level venerable sovereign had left and met him. He might have been a fifth-level venerable sovereign, and I felt that he was slightly stronger than me ... But at that time, tribulation clouds had appeared here! Thus...It's possible that it's an expert from nearby who came to investigate, and not the one who attacked. ""What?"Supreme Emperor Hui long was confused,'fifth rank? Do you know his exact identity?"

"I've stayed far away. "Huilong fell into deep thought. This was a little complicated.Did that mean that there was another fifth rank venerable sovereign who had participated in the previous battle? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Or should I say, watch from the side?What was going on?He knew exactly how many medium venerable sovereigns there were in the southern region, but now, it seemed that he was losing control.Could he be from the other three regions?Otherwise, it would have been difficult to hide from him if he had gone through the southern realm gate."Everyone, it's an eventful autumn today! The battle in the Crimson Moon region has already affected the tianfang region and the tianfang world. It will be difficult for everyone to stay out of this!"When venerable Dragon Emperor said this, he looked a little serious.""More importantly, there was some commotion in the tianfang world. I'm sure you all sensed it! This could be a sign ... If that's the case, the celestial world will definitely become the core of the nearby region!""If a great world really wants to give birth to a great path universe world again ... As you can imagine, even seventh-level or eighth-level venerable sovereigns might be tempted.""Of course, at the current stage, the majority are still middle-stage venerable sovereigns."He didn't hide it anymore. At this point, there was no point in hiding it.He was a little serious,'the key is that a large number of sixth level venerable sovereigns are trying to advance to the seventh level and become true advanced venerable sovereigns! Right now, there are only four rank six venerable sovereigns in the Outlander world ... But that doesn't mean that there will still be more!"Everyone was deep in thought.The two territory Lords from other territories looked at each other and considered for a long time. One of them said,"Then we'll have to trouble fellow Daoist Hui long. Next ... We may go to Hui long temple and stay there for a few days.""Welcome!"Hui long Emperor was overjoyed. This was his lucky chance.All of a sudden, the two middle-stage venerable sovereigns had chosen to join them ... Although it was not certain, if there was any turmoil, there was a high probability that these two would not leave.The number of venerable sovereigns in Hui long temple had increased again. This time, with the addition of these two, it could reach 18 ... No, 19. He had forgotten that there was one more who had joined previously.There were several venerable sovereigns under these two. Although they were only at the first or second level, they were not weak.More than 20 venerable sovereigns ... Even a medium-scale world could not afford to support so many venerable sovereigns.At this moment, he couldn't care less about the murderer.This person had killed someone ... And had given him a chance.It could be a rotten fifth rank venerable sovereign, or even a sixth rank venerable sovereign with some special means. It was best not to provoke such an existence. In fact, he could track him down, but after thinking about it again and again, he gave up.Thinking of this, he suddenly laughed. With a wave of his hand, all the water power in the air dissipated, leaving only pure sword intent.When the venerable sovereigns saw this, they were all moved.The Dragon Emperor smiled and said,'neo martial immortal swordsman, you actually dared to attack tianfang world ... You're really bold! The other region Masters of the southern region, everyone, please remind them to be careful. Neo martial artists are extremely crazy. Be careful not to be killed by venerable the sword!""Send someone to tell the powerhouses of The Dark World and the Elysian world to be careful. The sword Master killed Tian He and Sheng Hong. It's possible that he's here to deal with the new martial arts world's enemies. They should be careful too. The other three sixth level venerable sovereigns should also be careful. If you take in the people from these forces, be careful of the sword Master's Revenge!" In the blink of an eye, he had a rather perfect plan.The one who attacked this time was Sword Saint!Even if he wasn 't, he was!"Venerable sword's arrival can intimidate the other three forces. This is the first reason. They won't dare to take in another two rank five venerable sovereigns. If they have no choice, they might even join the Huilong temple.In addition, there were two worlds and some venerable sovereigns. In that case, the power of his Dragon Temple would soar instantly!Second, it could also increase the hatred between the tianfang world and neo martial.In this way, there would be an opportunity to deal with new martial in the future.Third, if the region Masters of the southern region knew that revered sword was here to kill ... They might come to him.Venerable Dragon Emperor even thought that he could carry the flag and deal with new martial arts, thus expanding his own power.A hidden top-notch swordsman, and a crazy killer at that. Such an existence would make everyone extremely afraid.The premise was that they didn't provoke any top-tier great world experts for the time being.Otherwise, he would be in trouble.He had to control the news and try not to let it leak out. Many thoughts flashed through his mind ... As for chasing after the rotten venerable sovereign, that was one thing. The other party's existence could still help him. If he really caught up to him, it would be bad.The other venerable sovereigns were also enlightened.He didn't feel that there was anything wrong with it. It was good. If the Huilong temple could really be strengthened, it would be good for everyone to gather together. The Huilong Emperor had great ambitions, which was not a bad thing for them.At this moment, the venerable sovereigns didn't mention tracking him.His life was his.Who knew what a middle-stage venerable sovereign who was approaching the end of his life would do when he went crazy? moreover, how long would a middle-stage venerable sovereign have lived for to reach the end of his life?Three hundred thousand years?Five hundred thousand years?Or a million years?Who knows!After living for so long, he still had some trump cards.……On this day, news quickly spread throughout the tianfang world.The neo martial Swordmaster had infiltrated the southern region.

He had killed Shenghong, Tian He, and the other three venerable sovereigns. He had killed five venerable sovereigns!The entire tianfang world was shaken.Five venerable sovereigns had fallen!The other party might still be in the tianfang world and had not left. The venerable sovereigns from the darknorth world and the Elysian world were all extremely nervous.Although both sides were led by fifth stage venerable sovereigns, venerable sword ... Could be a sixth stage venerable sovereign, and a swordsman who was extremely good at attacking!This was not a small matter. For a moment, everyone was jittery!As for now, when he returned to the Dragon field, he took the opportunity to recruit two middle-stage venerable sovereigns. Under such a fluctuation, not many people paid attention to it. If it were any other day, it would have caused a great stir.……Back to the Dragon Temple.Kong Jing listened quietly.When he heard that Li Hao was old and didn't seem to have much time left, he didn't pay much attention.So what if a cultivator of the Dao of life and death was older?The other party had really killed a fourth stage venerable sovereign.As he was thinking about something, a jade talisman suddenly appeared in his hand.It was the communication talisman of the Dragon Temple."Celestial Emperor Hao Yue, please invite Celestial Emperor Kong Ji to come here!"Kong Ji's heart moved. So fast.The news came from the giant pincer.This meant that Li Hao had returned, and he had returned very quickly.If he was called up ... It meant that he was about to advance.This was normal. Li Hao said that he needed the power of life and death. If it was not enough to kill a level four venerable sovereign and several low-level venerable sovereigns, it would be too difficult for him to advance.Kong Ji looked at the rank five venerable sovereign beside him and thought for a while.""Forget everything that happened before! Even if we return to the outside world, don't reveal this ... If the news is leaked ..."He looked at the other party and said softly,""It's nothing. I'll just be more careful in the future. "The rank five venerable sovereign's heart skipped a beat."Rest assured, Your Highness!" He hurriedly nodded."By the way, Your Highness," he said carefully,"when this person borrowed that power, the entire tianfang world seemed to ... Change. I saw something different at the scene. A star seemed to have appeared ... It could be the foundation of the great Dao universe!"A great Dao universe might be born in the tianfang great world.This was great news!It was an extremely important matter for anyone, even the Lords of major cosmoses.Kong Ji nodded."I think so. You can go back and report this news. As for the rest, there's no need to say more."Seeing that Kong Ji didn't ask him to hide it, this person felt a little more at ease.Otherwise ... It would be hard to explain.He immediately said,"alright, I'll go back and report the news. By the way, Your Highness, this time at the Dragon Temple, the venerable Dragon Emperor is quite ambitious. Your Highness is cultivating here. If a conflict occurs ...""I know. Don't worry."Hearing him say this, the other person didn't say anything more and quickly retreated. If your Highness doesn't mind, then I have nothing to say.Moreover, even though His Highness was only a fourth level venerable sovereign, he was still nervous every time he faced him. Perhaps His Highness still had some trump cards. After all, the other party had already reached fifth level venerable sovereign a few years ago. It was not easy for him to re-cultivate and enter the intermediate level twice.Kong Ji looked at him and waited for him to leave before he left. His voice echoed,""I'm going out for a while. When the Abbey Dean returns, tell him that I'm going to cultivate!"The others didn't dare to stop him.At this moment, venerable sovereign Hui long was not here. He was the only middle-stage venerable sovereign, so no one dared to provoke him.……Fire element divine mountain.Li Hao felt like he was struggling at death's door.At this moment, the giant pincers were both afraid and uneasy.What was this good?It was as if Li Hao was about to die after a single trip ... Of course, what was even more terrifying was that the communication system inside the Dragon returning temple was operating crazily, and countless messages were being sent in.The entire Tianhe zone's venerable sovereigns had been annihilated.Five!This included the fourth rank venerable Emperor Tian He. It was simply shocking.Was this really the doing of the person in front of him?If that was the case ... That would be too terrifying. Killing a rank four venerable sovereign ... It was difficult for someone of the same rank to do so, so he must be at least a rank five venerable sovereign, right?At this time, in the midst of his uneasiness, he said cautiously,""My Lord, if venerable Emperor void ... Really came, would he ..."That person was a fourth stage venerable sovereign.This Lord seemed to be seriously injured.At this moment, he had killed a few venerable sovereigns. If Kong Ji took the opportunity to deal with this Lord, he would be in big trouble.Li Hao smiled."Killing me will only get him some venerable sovereign treasures. However, there are several venerable sovereigns, and only one of them has the power of a middle-stage venerable sovereign. It's not worth it for him to kill the goose that lays golden eggs!" Besides ... This is the fire element divine mountain. Even if he really wanted to do that, he wouldn't do it. "He explained.Moreover, that emptiness would not be so short-sighted.To him, killing him was just a one-time use of treasures. Did Kong Ji really lack treasures?On the other hand, it might be more beneficial for him if he was alive.For example, this time ... Li Hao didn't leave. Instead, he prepared to walk the Dao of life and death again.Walking the path of life and death once was both a crisis and an opportunity.Of course, the consumption was not small.One of the reasons was that energy was essential.Second, it was very likely that he would lose his memory, or even completely sink into it and become another person.Third, one would definitely encounter a Primal Chaos lightning tribulation.If he didn't care about these things ... He could walk a few more times.

2638 Chapter 438
However, Li Hao also knew that if he kept using the Dao of life and death, there would definitely be some drawbacks. He might even encounter some unpredictable dangers. If he could avoid using it, he would try to avoid using it.This time, he had gained quite a lot.After killing the five venerable sovereigns, the five venerable sovereigns had some reserves. They had many great Dao crystals and a venerable sovereign treasure. Ordinary venerable sovereign weapons were not of much use.However, the defensive weapon that venerable Emperor Tian He used in the end was not weak. Li Hao's previous attack had not been able to break it. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "I owe him another favor!"Li Hao calculated in his heart and sighed.This sixth-tier water elemental, that seventh-tier Dragon, seventh-tier fire elemental, neo martial human King, neo martial Supreme, er Mao ...These were the debts he currently owed.There were four advanced venerable sovereigns, one sixth-rank venerable sovereign, and one cat.As for Kong Ji ... He wasn't in debt. Both of them had their own needs. Even if the other party came to protect him, he would also help him observe the Dao of life and death. This was an exchange of great DAOs, so it wasn't a debt.Li Hao felt bitter.How could there be someone like him, a mere first level venerable sovereign, who owed so many advanced venerable sovereigns favors ... He really didn't have to worry about his debts, did he?This kind of thing should be done less.It was beyond his current ability.It was not worth it to owe a Tier 6 to kill a Tier 4.There was a high chance that these people were still alive. Otherwise, it would be difficult to go back to the past.There were rank nine venerable sovereigns in the tianfang world.However, these people were still willing to do him a favor ... If they really didn't need it, why would they do him a favor? it meant that these people felt that they needed it!This was the real trouble!For Li Hao, he was already deeply connected to Tian Fang. He might die of exhaustion because of what happened to Tian Fang.One neo martial was enough for him to suffer.If a level nine tianfang world appeared ... It was hard to imagine how much trouble he would be in in the future.But now, he couldn't care about that.……After waiting for a while, a person silently descended."Fellow Daoist li!"Kong Ji looked at Li Hao, sized him up, and smiled.""It doesn't look good.""It's alright!" Li Hao also laughed."I'm dying of old age ... But this is only my soul. My body is gone."Kong Ji saw this. He glanced at Li Hao and asked in confusion,""Life and death reincarnation. From the looks of it, you've probably already experienced it. Isn't there a limit to this kind of life and death reincarnation?"If not, it would be too terrifying."A few." Li Hao didn't hide it. As for Kong Ji, it was normal for him to see through it. Besides Samsara, Li Hao was almost beyond saving. How could he be so calm and invite Kong Ji to protect him?"After too many times, one's original mark will be erased ... And when resurrected, one will be a new life, not one's own self!"Kong Ji frowned slightly and nodded,"that's true. In that case, it's better to use it less!" Under normal circumstances, in your case, nine is the limit ... If this is the second time, then I think it can only be done seven more times. After nine times, it will be a new beginning, a new cycle!"Li Hao's heart moved,"is that so?" I didn't consider it many times before, but now that you've said it, it's possible! Nine was the extreme? That's really possible!""It's usually like this!"Kong Ji explained,"for example, the primal Chaos lightning tribulation. Nine is the number of cycles. Venerable sovereigns, nine is the extreme!" Under normal circumstances, venerable sovereigns can live for 99999 years ... This is normal, but there are also some abnormal situations that I won't talk about. "Li Hao nodded again.He was a little enlightened.Nine!This number might not be ordinary."Reincarnation?" Kong Ji looked around."En!"Li Hao nodded and smiled."It's just in case ... I really have no choice. I'm in danger. I'll see if I can borrow the power of the seventh step again.""You will encounter the lightning tribulation?""I will."Li Hao nodded."If it's not a Samsara, it's not necessarily true. But this time, it's bound to happen. Fellow Daoist, you just have to cover up the early stages!" When I advance to the second stage, the lightning tribulation will definitely fall, but it won't be too strong ...""I'd like to see it for myself. ""Of course!" Kong Ji laughed."Chaos lightning tribulations don't usually target third parties! If it's possible, I'd like to try. If not, then forget it. What do you think?"Normal people would be extremely afraid of being infected by the chaos lightning tribulation, but this person was excited.Li Hao smiled.As for whether he could receive it or not, it would depend on this person's ability. If someone was willing to help him receive the lightning tribulation, why would he not be willing?"Then I'll have to try!"Kong Ji laughed.Primal Chaos lightning tribulation ... Good stuff.In a cultivator's life, if they didn't experience it once, they would be embarrassed to say that they were a heaven-defying cultivator.Clearly, this wasn't the first time the young man had experienced this."By the way," Li Hao added,"I'm going to take a life-and-death walk. I need to activate my memories again ... I'll have to trouble you with this process!""Me? How do we do it?""There were some images last time ... Fellow Daoist can take a look!"Li Hao extended his hand, and some memories appeared in his mind. He chuckled."If I do this, fellow Daoist won't come looking for trouble with me when you become stronger in the future, right?"

2639 Chapter 438
It was an interesting method of recovery.However, if he did that ... Would he be retaliated against in the future?I'm not his teacher."If I don't recover your memories, what will happen?""It's nothing ... I just lost some memories and lost some humanity!"Kong Ji was deep in thought. He was lacking in humanity. Was the great Dao heartless?If that was the case ... It would not be good."Is there anything else?"He asked again,"from what I can see in my memories, there seems to be a universe of the great Dao ..."There was no such thing here.Li Hao smiled."It's fine. This time, it's a little special. This is a fire-elemental mountain. I went to the water-elemental mountain before and gained some understanding of the Dao of water and fire. This time, with water and fire as the foundation, I activated the power of Dao and used the life and death Star as the boundary ..."This time, he didn't use the two Dao universes, but the Dao of water and fire.The effect should be similar.Perhaps, he could even strengthen his comprehension of the Dao of water and fire. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "That works too!"Kong Ji didn't say anything more. He didn't say anything more. In an instant, all of a sudden, the surroundings became silent!The entire world seemed to have been completely destroyed in the blink of an eye.It was clearly a fire-type mountain that was roaring with power of fire, but at this moment, it seemed to be in an absolutely silent void. There was no movement or fluctuation at all. It was completely enveloped.Li Hao was also moved.Nirvana, revival.Life and death, yin and yang.These DAOs were all similar.This person's Dao of Nirvana had reached a peak. Unlike Li Hao, this person walked the Dao of Nirvana. If he were to resurrect in the midst of Nirvana, perhaps ... Reaching the sixth step would only be a matter of time.Neo martial human Kings actually walked the path of yin and yang. Now, they were already at the seventh rank. This meant that as long as they reached the peak of one path, they could actually reach the eighth or ninth rank."Good move!""In this case, ordinary venerable sovereigns won't be able to sense it," Li Hao said with emotion.In this case, there would not be much movement. He didn't say anything more, and a long river appeared.A long river crossed the Nirvana land.As for Kong Ji, he didn't say a word. He just watched silently. He watched as a life and death monarch walked from destruction to revival, from death to new life. As for advancement, it was secondary. This time, what he saw should be much more profound than simply advancing.This could be considered his own opportunity.Kong Ji laughed. He actually saw an opportunity on a first stage venerable sovereign ... He had to admit that opportunities were really amazing.He had been stuck at the fourth rank for a long time. In fact, he didn't care too much about the fifth or sixth rank, as it didn't mean much. The key was that he wanted to understand the will of Nirvana and revival, not just the pure power of the Dao of Nirvana.That would be meaningless. It was almost impossible to reach the seventh rank.However, if he were to be resurrected from the state of Nirvana, he would have hope of reaching the seventh step! At this moment, Li Hao was rapidly erupting. Endless energy from the five venerable sovereigns gathered and transformed into rivers of water and fire.Fire and water blended!In the middle, the river of life and death appeared.Second cat had disappeared and the Stargate was opened again. The Three Rivers ran through it.Kong Ji watched for a while and sighed.If this person walked the Dao of water and fire alone, it wouldn't be a problem for him to reach the mid-grade.From the looks of it, he had gained a lot.Li Hao, on the other hand, repeated the previous process. At this moment, there were two more spectators. One was Kong Ji, and the other was the giant pincer. At this moment, the giant pincer was so excited that its hands were trembling.'I ... Perhaps I've seen something incredible again.Everything else aside, just the appearance of the empty world of Nirvana made him feel ... As if the entire world had changed. It was as if a small world had been born in this large world.When Li Hao's River appeared, he felt that he had seen something even more incredible.The river of life and death, the river of water and fire.Li Hao walked through the water River, ready to experience life and death, walk towards the fire River, and rise from the ashes.The power of several venerable sovereigns gathered in the Three Rivers. As he walked into the water-type River, a part of the river collapsed with each step he took. All the power gathered in Li Hao's body.Li Hao began to age again.His soul was withering.One step after another!Kong Ji watched silently and didn't interfere. When Li Hao reached the end of the river, the river suddenly collapsed, and Li Hao died completely. He turned into a huge ball of light and flew toward the life and death Star."Giant pincer, as long as we cut off this River of Life and death ... This person will be completely dead!" Kong Ji suddenly laughed.The giant pincers 'faces turned pale!What did that mean?If venerable sovereign void were to attack now ... With his Heavenly King Power, even a first rank venerable sovereign would be able to kill him easily, let alone a fourth rank venerable sovereign.Kong Ji laughed and didn't say anything.It was just a joke.This place was too quiet.Unfortunately, the young man before him wasn't someone who would joke around.The cycle of life and death ... At the last moment of death, one would explode to the extreme and bloom with the brilliance of life?Then, when the state of Nirvana reached its peak, would it be resurrected?Many thoughts appeared in his mind. All great DAOs were the same. The Dao of Nirvana should have something in common with life and death.At this moment, he suddenly made a move.He threw the ball of light into the river of life and death!The river was turbulent!At the same time, in the river, a huge cat's head appeared for a moment and then disappeared.As for Kong Ji, he seemed to have seen it. He smiled and didn't say anything.
