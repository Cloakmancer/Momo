The five realms were in a state of panic. Some entered the divine Kingdom, while others stayed where they were.In just a moment ... The humans who stayed behind were all teleported into a world. It was the rank six world he had obtained from the fire Phoenix realm. It was also the largest world here and could accommodate more people.There were more than 50 worlds, and other than a few that were empty, the rest were filled with people.Some were worth tens of billions, while others were worth billions.In the human world, it was not unusual for a medium world to have a population of over a hundred billion.However ... In this world where there were almost no 100 billion people, perhaps even the great worlds did not have that many people, the Dragon Lord had still placed great restrictions on the crazy reproduction of the human race.Even so, the population of more than 50 worlds reached hundreds of billions!A large number of humans entered the divine Kingdom in a frenzy. At this moment, the divine Kingdom of the Queen was also expanding crazily. There had never been a time when so many humans would worship the same sovereign at the same time!Moreover, he was just a level two venerable sovereign who had just advanced! Almost in an instant, the moon that the Queen had transformed into expanded crazily. With a boom, some cracks seemed to appear on the moon ... But her aura had entered stage three.At this moment, even the Queen was a little afraid!It was too fast!The power of faith was even trying to convert herself!With the addition of countless amounts of Primal Chaos energy, she was almost stunned. In the next moment, she no longer cared. She had originally only poured Primal Chaos energy into the river of time, but at this moment, countless amounts of faith energy suddenly surged into the time star.Li Hao instantly sensed it. He turned his head and couldn't help but curse,""What are you doing!"Damn it!Who told you to give me so much power of faith?At this moment, countless amounts of power of faith gushed out madly from the time star system. He was speechless. What was this fellow doing?The Queen didn't say a word and pretended to be dead.She had no other choice.There were too many. Hundreds of billions of humans had been absorbed in an instant ... The densely packed amount was simply unbelievable and incomparably crazy. The divine Kingdom was expanding to its limit, and it was almost unable to fit in all the humans. It was so crowded ... This was no longer a divine Kingdom. It had already become an ant nest that made one's scalp tingle!But even so, there were still countless people entering and providing her with power of faith.Even though she could increase her strength as long as she had enough faith, she still needed some time to consolidate her strength.Moreover, the stronger he was, the more chaotic force he would have.At the first stage, she could absorb a lot of chaotic force, which was difficult for an ordinary sixth stage cultivator to absorb. But at the third stage, Li Hao felt that the chaotic force transmitted by the Queen was comparable to that of a seventh stage expert!This was equivalent to a Type 7 expert doing nothing but madly absorbing the primal Chaos energy into the river.At this moment, small worlds were being filled up. At this rate ... It might really only take a little time, two to three days, to fill a realm. And this was a 3rd rank Queen. If it was a 4th or 5th rank Queen ...Then, in the later stages, he would be able to fill up a realm a day?It was even faster!If that was the case ... Even Li Hao gasped. This was crazy. Currently, he only had four to five hundred little realms that had not been filled. New realms had not been born yet. Four to five hundred little realms would be filled in less than a year.At that time, if he was still unable to quickly comprehend the new realm ... He would most likely have to kick the Queen away. Otherwise, both of them would explode!This was still the fourth or fifth level. If it reached the seventh level ... With the Queen's speed, she might be able to fill up several little realms in a day. That was simply ... Shocking.How troublesome!At this moment, he couldn't care about this anymore. He cursed, but he still had to deal with the sudden explosion of power of belief. Power of belief was a good thing, but it was also a troublesome thing!Faith had both advantages and disadvantages. Even if the Queen cultivated the power of faith and absorbed too much, she would be able to brainwash herself!Terrifying!This thing was even mixed with many other things ... It was a kind of ... Unspeakable responsibility.Yes, hundreds of billions of humans believe in you, trust you, and are willing to follow you.F * ck, this thing is going to kill me.At this moment, Li Hao was helpless.He gritted his teeth and suddenly let out a low shout. An ethereal extent turned into a ball and directly absorbed the overflowing power of belief. Countless amounts of power of belief surged out and entered the ethereal extent. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Faith?This wasn't faith, this was responsibility. Li Hao really didn't dare to absorb it. It was fine if the Queen had fallen into the trap herself, but she couldn't drag him into it.It was too terrifying!"Suppress!"With a low growl, the firmament sword appeared and suppressed the illusionary world. The world was suppressed into the depths of the river of Dao. Li Hao's face was full of fear."This realm can't be opened in the future ... Once it's opened, whoever cultivates the Dao of this realm will have to serve the people for the rest of their lives!"He shook his head!Terrifying!Hundreds of billions of people suddenly burst into a belief, a trust, and a reliance ... Whoever cultivated this path would be doomed to be associated with the human race for the rest of their lives. Li Hao was no saint. He felt that he ... Really couldn't do it.I'm afraid I'll go crazy if I fix it.'Forget it, I'll keep it. It's a pity to waste it. What if ... A great resentment seed is willing to absorb it?'He looked around, and the Queen avoided his gaze."Don't look at me. The Queen can still control herself now, but once she absorbs so much faith power, she knows that she's finished. She'll be dominated by these faith for the rest of her life!"

Chapter 3221 Sour And Stinky (3)
She could control faith, but she didn't want to be controlled by faith. She could only input faith into Li Hao. Otherwise, right now, at this moment ... She might become a servant of the path of faith, a poor venerable sovereign who would only serve the human race.That was not the result she wanted!In other places, the venerable sovereigns avoided Li Hao's sight. Some even whistled to the sky, as if they were not that kind of person and would not absorb it!Kong Ji, on the other hand, was rather interested."So much power of faith that exploded in an instant. The trust and reliance of hundreds of billions of humans ... Whoever cultivates this path will be the true Emperor of the human race!"Li Hao coughed and nodded."That's right. This realm should be called the emperor's realm!" Of course, even if this world has a source of life, it's difficult for it to give birth to living creatures. Why don't we refine it later? why don't we ... Refine it into the seal of renhuang?"He suddenly smiled, showing his teeth.Anyway, I won't cultivate it.Whoever wanted to fix it, he would."It can't be stopped if someone wants to become stronger, or if they're really willing to serve the human race wholeheartedly ... Anything is possible. I can only say that we're all a group of selfish mortal martial masters, and there's no such selfless person.If there were, perhaps they would be eager to absorb it!He then looked at the Queen."You cultivate the path of faith, but you are unwilling to absorb the power of trust and reliance that exploded in this instant. You are really a selfish person!"The Queen was helpless.He didn't say a word.I'll take it as a silent agreement.Yes, I admit it, okay?Do I look like a selfless Saint to you?Do you think ... I look like one?Do I deserve it?I'm not worthy, alright!Also, you didn't absorb it either, did you?He was even suppressed in the depths of the long river. Clearly, he didn't want to absorb it either. Why did big brother have to scold second brother?This was just a small interlude. Li Hao cursed for a while and let it go. This ... Was not something ordinary people were worthy of practicing. Well, he was not worthy either. Perhaps the Supreme of neo martial arts would like it ...Alright, there was a high chance that he wouldn 't.This was because the Supreme neo martial liked the neo martial humans, not the humans of the myriad world. If he absorbed this, he could overturn Silver Moon, provided that he was not affected by it and could still overturn the human world. It was scary just thinking about it.This Dao ... It's better not to easily reveal it to the world!……Without this interlude, Li Hao was about to purify the five realms when Yuan Shuo suddenly said,""Jade light, come here!"“……”Li Hao was startled. What are you doing?In the distance, jadesword was also startled. "Why are you calling me?""Why are you cultivating the Dao of the Silver Moon? the sword Dao of the Silver Moon has been dominated by the earth-overturning sword and the heavenly Sword. You'll never be able to surpass them even if you spend your entire life in the Silver Moon. Come to my side. The Dao of the sword will merge with my Dao domain. My Dao domain will only accommodate you in this life!"“……”  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  艹!At this moment, everyone was stunned.Spreading dog food!This old thing was really shameless. Jade lightsaber's face was also flushed red as he looked around. He was speechless for a long time. This ... This ...Yuan Shuo was incomparably overbearing as he shouted,"come!" If I don't come, don't tell me I'm going to be Hong Yitang's concubine?"Hong Yitang was speechless!F * ck, who cares?Get lost!With one person gone, one less, one more spot, who didn't want to prove their Dao as venerable sovereigns these days?You can take your wife away. I don't care.Really!In order to vindicate Dao for your wife, I even gave up some sword Dao. You old thing, you don't appreciate it, not only did you show your affection, but you also taunted me.You're really not a good thing!The Emerald light sword was a little embarrassed and shy at the moment. The next moment, it flew out. Before it even arrived, the river of the great path rippled. Suddenly, a branch broke. It was only a first level venerable sovereign. It would not cost much to leave now. Besides, the harvest from this battle was huge, so there would not be any problems at all.Everyone was speechless!Good fellow!His Dao domain hadn't been proven yet and you ... You left. If you failed your Dao validation, would you become an itinerant cultivator?The Jade light sword flew over, and its sword Dao soared to the sky!The five-element Dao domain instantly appeared and covered the heavens and earth. It wrapped around the Jade-light sword Dao and he laughed,""My territory will only merge with one person. The others don't even deserve to look!"“……”The group of people rolled their eyes.Hehe!He didn't leave behind a level-five great Dao universe and went to your place?Hehe!Who cared?Who wants it?You're not even a venerable sovereign, what are you pretending for!Li Hao was also speechless. My teacher is already so old, but at this moment, he actually ... Actually has the nerve to show off his affection in front of everyone. This is a battlefield, what are you doing?He looked around ...It's finished!At this moment, he saw hou Xiaochen, who had just charged out from a distance away. Hou Xiaochen was still a little dazed, but Yu Luo's gaze was filled with resentment, trust, and desire. Hou Xiaochen felt a little uncomfortable, and when he looked at Yuan Shuo, he couldn't help but curse!艹!The old thing was so annoying.Could anyone open a Dao domain?Even if it opened, could everyone do it?Even if it's successful ... Fine, it's very troublesome anyway. I ... I didn't even consider opening a Dao domain. I also think it's too difficult. I'm afraid there's no chance. What you're doing now is really annoying!Not far away, Liu Yan glanced at Liu Long ... But quickly retracted her gaze. 'Forget it, this blockhead of mine probably doesn't stand a chance. I can't count on him.'Liu Long was speechless and did not say a word."You're right. I probably ... Won't be able to open a Dao domain in this life. I'm already being taken care of by Li Hao by becoming a venerable sovereign. It's useless for me to open a Dao domain on my own.

Chapter 3222 Sour And Stinky (3)
"We're already an old couple, so he doesn't care anymore. There's no point in looking at him. I'm not hou Xiaochen, who likes to be romantic. Now that I'm riding the tiger, I can't back down ... What should I do about this sick ghost?"I should just continue pretending to be sick!As for the light sword, it looked around and glanced past Li Hao to look at the desolation sword. The desolation sword also had a Dao domain, and it was the six paths of two poles, which included light and darkness. It was the most suitable for the light sword ...Kong Ji trembled and hurriedly looked at Li Hao.Oh my God!How could you, Silvermoon cultivator, be like this?What are you looking at me for?My Dao domain doesn't tolerate anyone else!Li Hao couldn't help but shout,"enough!" "Teacher, focus on cultivation. It's not the style of a Martial Master." Immediately fuse the realms and vindicate the Dao. The Dao of the five realms and the five elements Dao domain will probably welcome the primal Chaos lightning tribulation. I will open the realm of concealment ... You can undergo the Tribulation yourself!"“……”Yuan Shuo was speechless. Good fellow, I was just showing off a little.Why do you all look like you don't like me?I'm going to transcend the Tribulation myself ... So what if I'm going to transcend the Tribulation?The five-element Dao domain was considered a special Dao domain. Dao vindication would inevitably lead to a chaos lightning tribulation. However, Yuan Shuo was not afraid. After all, he had just vindicated his Dao. Even if the lightning tribulation came, it would at most be stage two or three. If he succeeded, he would definitely become a stage three venerable sovereign.Not to mention the third stage lightning tribulation, he even had the guts to try the fourth stage!"I'll go through the Tribulation!"Yuan Shuo didn't care. He glanced at the aquamarine light sword and laughed,""In a moment, I will vindicate my Dao, and your sword Dao will fuse with my Dao domain. My Dao domain can only accommodate you. You can absorb as much great Dao power as you want. Don't worry. I don't cultivate the Dao of the sword. From now on, I will cultivate the five elements of the five elements sword domain, and you will cultivate ...."Before he could finish, the five worlds suddenly shattered!Five extremely powerful forces of the five elements instantly merged into his Dao domain. Many people looked at Li Hao and nodded in approval. Well done!Li Hao, we'll support you even if you have to betray your master!This old demon Yuan was too much.Li Hao, on the other hand, looked calm. He crushed the five worlds in this calm state. He didn't even bother to tear them apart. If he continued to do so ... He didn't know how long his teacher would have to talk to him.That's enough!Who was she showing off her love to at her age?Who was he showing off to?Five extremely powerful forces of the world surged into his Dao domain. Yuan Shuo quickly circulated his cultivation technique and roared. He could no longer care about showing off his love. He had no time and energy!BOOM!His body grew rapidly and his Dao domain continued to absorb the power of the great DAOs. A mighty pressure emerged from the God of the five Forces behind him. Yuan Shuo roared,""Lend me a strand of longevity sword will!"Li Hao raised his brows. The next moment, the river of the great path fluctuated, and a monstrous sword intent appeared. The sword intent instantly merged with the Dao domain. Yuan Shuo laughed and reached out to grab it. In an instant, blood splattered from his arm, but he ignored it and forcefully suppressed it!Sword intent filled the entire Dao domain!Under everyone's shocked eyes, he compressed crazily. The sword intent seemed to turn into stars, decorating the center of the Dao domain. It turned into the Dao domain's star, the only star!"Open my Demon Eye!"BOOM! The third eye on her glabella opened, and the star instantly fell into it. In that instant, the Azure light sword was somewhat shocked, and her sword Dao instantly merged into the third eye and the star."You're in between my brows. I die, you die. I live, you Live!"At this moment, jadesword was dazed and lost in thought.At this moment, he suddenly felt that the world's destruction was nothing. Yuan Shuo, the devil, a true demonic cultivator, dared to think and do, dared to say and did!He fused the Dao of the Jadestone sword into his domain, fused it into the space between his eyebrows, and opened his third eye. The five elements Dao domain transformed into the five elements sword domain!I am strong, you are strong.If I die, you die.If I don't die, no one can break my third eye.The group of people almost lost their teeth from the jealousy.On the other side, Lin Hongyu glanced at Li Hao, but Li Hao did not seem to see her. He quickly looked at the sky and frowned, as if he was thinking about something.Not too far away, Yu dami looked at hou Xiaochen with a face full of love and envy ...The men were so jealous that their teeth fell out, while the women ... Were madly envious.Heavens!The old devil was too manly!She looked at hou Xiaochen, and her eyes seemed to be able to speak. "Will I ... Wait for this day?"Hou Xiaochen couldn't stand any longer!This was crazy!We are killing people.We're doing serious business here. Are you all crazy?He had not coughed for a long time. At this moment, he could not hold it in anymore."Cough, cough, cough ..."He felt as if he was about to cough his lungs out. Why did hun Dun smell so sour?I can't take it anymore.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ The instigator, Yuan Shuo, did not care about this anymore. His five elements sword domain expanded rapidly. Wherever the sword domain went, it became his own world.In the world, there were only the five elements and the sword Dao! The five elemental DAOs seemed to contain thousands of DAOs. The gods of the five Forces were crazily powerful. They appeared behind him like a demon that had descended into the human world. The monster was a fusion of the five spirits and the five birds. It was extremely ferocious.At this moment, Yuan Shuo seemed to have really turned into a devil."Deal!"With a loud shout, his Dao domain was devoured. The power of the five worlds was directly swallowed by him. In the sky, a cloud seemed to appear. The dark clouds descended instantly, and Thunder appeared.Primal Chaos lightning tribulation!It wasn't too strong. Li Hao could tell at a glance that it was only around the 3rd rank. However ... This seemed to be his teacher's first time experiencing a lightning tribulation. Could he withstand it?

Chapter 3223 Sour And Stinky (3)_5
Just as he was thinking, Yuan Shuo let out a fierce roar. His three eyes appeared, and a sword light shot into the sky!"I vindicated my Dao and you dare to be so arrogant!"BOOM!The old monster charged straight into the Thunder and fought the Thunder tribulation. At this moment, he seemed to be really arrogant. His sword intent was monstrous, the five elements suppressed, and the cage wrapped around the Thunder tribulation as if he was going to refine the chaos Thunder tribulation!This was a ruthless man!He had been too weak before and had been suppressing himself. Today, he had proven his Dao and was arrogant as if no one in the world could control him!Behind him, a green sword light shot into the sky!She was the only one who could resist the lightning tribulation together at this moment. The sword light rushed into the sky, but her eyes were filled with endless tenderness ...Sour!Stinky!It couldn't be heard!The surrounding cultivators all turned their heads!Even the silly cat covered its eyes with its paws. It smelled sour. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Li Hao's master was so sour.At this moment, a man and a woman-the man was overbearing while the woman was gentle-were acting tenderly in the chaotic void, where corpses were everywhere. Li Hao and the others all looked up and sighed.Old demon five birds was nothing more than this.In the end, he still fell into the hands of a woman, and his life was ruined just like that.What a pity!BOOM! The Thunder tribulation exploded, and the five elements sword domain expanded crazily. With a loud boom, the three-eye sword intent burst out again, completely shattering the dark clouds. A monstrous Qi emerged from Yuan Shuo's body, suppressing a group of newly advanced venerable sovereigns in an instant.Only a group of middle-stage venerable sovereigns could resist it.Yuan Shuo was domineering as he looked at the crowd and Hong Yitang.""Next, I'll surpass you! Give me some time. Out of the thirty-six males, only one male has thirty-five failures!"“……”Hong Yitang had a good temper and couldn't be bothered with him.It'll be fine once you get used to it!At this moment, Yuan Shuo's aura was still growing, and his strength was still growing. He rapidly advanced from Level 1 to Level 2, and even to Level 3.At this moment, he had indeed surpassed everyone else, including Nan Quan and the other venerable sovereigns who had proven their Dao first.Everyone was somewhat unconvinced!But ... He had no choice.He was a little depressed.Apart from Li Hao, Yuan Shuo was the first venerable sovereign to vindicate his Dao in Silver Moon.Even Li Hao did not open his Dao domain when he vindicated his Dao.He could only say ... He was half convinced. Although he was not convinced verbally, he was convinced in his heart.He could reach Tier 3 in a day, so he couldn't be jealous.They didn't say anything. On the other side, Yu Luosha suddenly snorted,""My Minister will definitely open a Dao domain and become a venerable sovereign again tomorrow!"“……”When hou Xiaochen saw that everyone was looking at him, he realized that his hands were clenched so tightly that they were turning white. What ... What could he say?"Alright, I'll be waiting for you, hou Xiaochen!" Yuan Shuo laughed heartily.“……”Wait your ass!Hou Xiaochen didn't say anything. "Don't wait for me. If you want to wait, wait for someone else."What an annoying fellow.I already knew you were troublesome years ago, but you're still so annoying now!This fellow should have been stuck at the pseudo-Emperor stage for the rest of his life. Only then would he be obedient and do whatever he was told to do. But now ... Forget it.At this moment, Li Hao was also having a headache. It's just that ... After opening a Dao domain, it's not easy to raise a Dao domain. Since teacher has advanced to venerable sovereign, teacher will find a way to fill it with the power of great DAOs!"Teacher, since you're so powerful, you can play by yourself."I'm having a headache. I have to raise another Dao domain. Why do you have to show off like this ... You can think of a way in the future. Venerable the sword opened a Dao domain and reached Level Seven. He absorbed a level Seven macro world and was still at the peak of level six."You've just entered level three. It'll be a big problem for you to enter level six. To enter Level Seven ... I think it'll be difficult for you not to absorb an level eight great world! Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Yuan Shuo instantly fell silent.He looked at his disciple, then at the Azure light sword, who had a look of admiration on his face, and curled his lips. 'I'll do it myself then ...'He was still speechless.This grandson was actually jealous of him. He really had no choice.As the group laughed and chatted, Yuan Shuo completed his Dao domain and instantly broke through the chaos lightning tribulation. It had to be said that this strength made even Kong Ji, an outsider, look at him in a new light!Silver moon's group might look weak, but they were not simple.Even the ridiculed Hu Qingfeng's Dao was extremely special, and no one dared to underestimate it. Today, Li Hao wasn't invincible. If one day, Li Hao was truly invincible and incomparably powerful, then perhaps Hu Qingfeng could really create a great Dao that no one else could surpass!Since ancient times, there had never been a venerable sovereign who proved his Dao because he believed in others.Under normal circumstances, venerable sovereigns, even rank eight Masters, wouldn't make people act like this ... In Kong Ji's opinion, this person might also be the only seedling in the myriad worlds, an extremely strange one!"All right, quickly clean up the battlefield and absorb the power of the world and the great DAOs. Qian Wuliang, senior uncle Hong, quickly absorb the scattered great DAOs. With dozens of venerable sovereigns, even if they can't help Silver Moon reach level six, they can at least build a foundation. He swept the nearby worlds clean! We'll Enter the Dragon world and devour the surrounding worlds!"Everyone's hearts instantly froze!This was only the beginning. Li Hao wanted to first invade the various worlds within the dragon world. After all, there were hundreds of worlds near the fire Phoenix World, and the dragon world only had more. This time ... It seemed that Li Hao really had to reach the sixth stage first."Clean up the battlefield!"With Hong Yitang's order, everyone began to clean up the corpses of the venerable sovereigns, the scattered great Dao crystals, the broken world, and the scattered power of the great Dao ...

At this moment, they were quickly devoured and digested by the crowd.As for the Black Panther, it was like a Night Elf. No one asked it to do anything, but the Black Panther wandered around and lurked in the dark, helping everyone clear the area. At this moment, everyone seemed to have found the value of their lives.All of them were beaming with joy!Li Hao, on the other hand, was also smiling radiantly. He continued to absorb the power of great DAOs and the power of worlds to fill his little world.At the same time, second cat was also wandering around, devouring some world origin.It didn't feel embarrassed. Although it didn't participate in the battle, it still had to carry the rank six world. Running with the ball was also physical work, so how could it not eat its fill?Eat!Everyone was satisfied. ……At the same time.Fire Phoenix World.The Thunder World was still lying dormant and waiting. As for the fire Phoenix realmlord, he was starting to feel impatient!She was eager to take over the Thunder World.And now, there were some people who were currently leaving the Thunder World. However, there weren't many of them and they weren't any important characters. At this moment, the fire Phoenix realmlord gave an order,""Quickly eliminate all the spies of the Thunder World and wipe out the remaining spies in the Thunder World. Do not allow the Thunder World to bring back a great Dao crystal. I want the Thunder Emperor to come out personally and seize the great Dao crystal!""Yes, sir!"The fire Phoenix realm had long grasped some of the channels in various parts of the Thunder realm. At this point, they had to force the Thunder Emperor to go out alone and risk his life!If they didn't come out, they wouldn't be able to obtain any resources and they wouldn't be able to cross the lightning territory.He had been waiting in the realm all this time ... Other than him, a tier 7, if anyone else came out, they would all die. The Thunder Emperor would not be able to hold back sooner or later!The arrangements that he had made for so many years were finally put to use.The flame Phoenix World Overlord revealed a smile. At this point, it's no longer up to you to hide.If you want to hide, I'll force you out!At this moment, someone stepped forward and quickly said,""Realm Lord, the Dragon Lord has ordered us to search for the human race's venerable sovereigns who have proven their Dao through the path of faith. Someone seems to have found something. Previously, they seemed to have seen a bright moon in the distance, wandering the void. It seems to be heading ... Heading towards the eastern border. That is now the territory of venerable Emperor Black Dog. According to his Highness 'orders, no one is allowed to trespass without permission. Should we let venerable Emperor Black Dog capture this person who has proven his Dao through faith?"The fire Phoenix realm Lord looked at Feng Yan. The Phoenix Flame Thearch didn't expect that the person wanted by the Dragon Lord would go that way. He nodded and said,""It's just a small matter. He's just a first level venerable sovereign, and the Black Dog is a fifth level venerable sovereign. He's also in charge of hundreds of worlds around here. Just give him the order to capture that person alive!""Yes, sir!"This was indeed a small matter. It was only a first stage venerable sovereign. Of course, it was not simple to make the Dragon Lord order a warrant.However, the Black Dog was at the fifth rank. No matter how monstrous the other party was, if he really encountered it, he would be captured in an instant.On the other hand, the fire Phoenix World Overlord frowned slightly,"he's headed in that direction. He has just left the dragon world, yet he's so bold. Does he think that it's safer over there after leaving the dragon world?"After saying that, he laughed and shook his head," The Dragon Lord was incomparably wise. How could he really leave behind a flaw? Although there are no seventh-rank great worlds in the dragon world region, there is still a peak sixth-rank world. Most importantly ... The realm Lord is a seventh-rank venerable sovereign!"That's right, a seventh rank venerable sovereign.However, that world could not enter the seventh level because the great path universe had not been born yet. Now, that seventh level venerable sovereign was waiting for the great path universe to be born and then merge with it. Perhaps he could still enter the peak of the seventh level.His strength could not be underestimated!Did they really think that there were no more peerless experts in the dragon world?What are you thinking!Not to mention a first rank venerable sovereign, even a seventh rank venerable sovereign would not be able to escape. Once the battle broke out and they were entangled, countless venerable sovereigns would come to their aid. No matter how strong a venerable sovereign was, once they were entangled in the Dragon Realm, they would be dead!Did he really think that the dragon world had left and that it had become an empty area? Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 However, that was a trap for the Thunderbolt master and the others. He didn't know if the Thunderbolt master would step into it. If the Thunderbolt master came out, perhaps ... He would also have the same thought. He would avoid the seventh-rank world and go to the Dragon Realm region first to seek some benefits. If he were to be entangled in the Dragon Realm region, then even the heavens would be on his side!…… At this moment, Li Hao didn't care about this. He crazily absorbed the power of the world, filling his ethereal extent one by one.These days, he had consumed too many resources, so much that it was terrifying. At this moment, his ethereal extent had officially completed filling 600 regions. Before this, he had only filled 500 points.If he had not broken through the four great realms last time, he could not even hope to reach level five.However, 600 was still not enough.In Li Hao's estimation, 1000 was probably enough. It was enough for him to officially enter the sixth step. Now, his comprehension of the great Dao was no longer a restriction on him. Only energy, countless amounts of energy, was!"There are still 400 Jie ..."After all, the fire Phoenix realm was still here. Even if he devoured all the other realms around it, it wouldn't be enough. He could only advance towards the Dragon Realm.Three days later, many illusory worlds remained in the area, floating in the air. Li Hao gave an order and led all the venerable sovereigns to the dragon world.He didn't even leave a single person to guard this place."If someone comes, he'll sense it. Moreover, he's set up the time river here, filling the world again. I don't believe that you can still sense this place after going to the chiyang region and the tianfang region!" He thought.After laying down the river, he might be able to escape into the chaos in an instant.The illusory world was like a real world, spreading in all directions.As for Li Hao, he had already left with his men. Black Panther rode the Silver Moon, and two cats rode the level 6 Water World. The group of venerable sovereigns were like locusts, all of them excitedly crossing the boundary and heading for the dragon world.Dragon World, here we come!This time, the Silver Moon would sweep across the world!……At this moment, near tianfang world, the Dragon Lord frowned slightly and turned his head to look behind.In the Dragon field ... There was a vague sense of uneasiness.Was it the Thunder World or the demon world of five directions?Soon, he relaxed his brows and stopped thinking about it. At this moment, he had more important things to do. There were 12 large chaotic worlds and 11 other families there. If he couldn't even suppress those guys ... He could only say that they were too useless. Maybe he needed to eliminate some of them."I can't wait any longer ... Three days later, I'll Attack the Light! We can either destroy them or force them to sign a contract to jointly suppress new martial arts. Otherwise, no one will be at ease if we leave behind great threats like Guangming!"The Dragon Master chuckled.""I have no objections! Actually, I don't even need to participate in the battle. Perhaps brother Hongyue can take it down by himself!"“……”F * ck you!At that moment, Red Moon master could only feel anger. This bastard, how did I offend him?It was really annoying to see him like this recently.In the past, he had never felt that the Dragon Lord was so annoying. This time, he really felt that there was something wrong with this fellow's brain. A Chaos Beast was a Chaos Beast. We didn't interfere with each other's business. Why did you keep insulting me for no reason?I can fight light alone. How can my world be broken by a few little guys?Who are you mocking?What a F * cking bastard!Red Moon master was not very angry now. Otherwise, she would have been furious.The more he looked at the Dragon Lord, the more displeased he was!As for the Dragon Master, he also raised his brows slightly. In fact, he didn't like him either. 'You've already exposed yourself in front of me, so why do you have to keep pretending? what's there to pretend for? we know each other very well. It's fine if you pretend in front of Yunxiao, but you also pretend to me. He's actually very annoyed.'The human race was truly hypocritical.There were a few times when he wanted to discuss this with Hong Yue, but this fellow was acting like he was weak and Yun Xiao was in charge. This simply disgusted the Dragon Lord to the core. 'Bastard, I'll kill you sooner or later!'

Chapter 3225 Battle Encounter (1)
The four-sided domain was in chaos.Each had their own plans.The Dragon Master's three sides were planning to deal with light, while new martial arts was thinking of creating another trap to attack cloudy sky.On the Dragon field's side, the Thunder World and the demon clan were waiting for the other side to make the first move. The chaos alliance worlds like the fire Phoenix World were also forcing the other sides to take action, luring the snake out of its hole.Mutual deception filled the entire square domain.……On Li Hao's side, it was a wide expanse of flat land as he headed straight for the dragon world.At this moment, Li Hao no longer had anything to do with the schemes of the four parties.The whale swallowing the world!This was Li Hao's goal. He wanted to reach Level 6 as quickly as possible, so that he could block or even kill a level 7 and participate in the high-level battles in the four-square domain.Along the way, there were also some worlds.Li Hao's side easily dealt with a few worlds, but Li Hao felt that it was too slow and not fast enough. The worlds were scattered, and it would take a day to deal with one. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 If this went on, who knew how long it would take for a whale to devour hundreds of worlds?Was one day long?It really wasn't much.In the primordial chaos, one could attack, seize, and finish a world in a single day. If this was considered slow, then no one else was efficient at all.,m In the chaos, what did a few years or a few decades count for?"It's too slow!"After breaking through three worlds in a row, Li Hao stopped. He was getting impatient and frowned.At this moment, the experts around were all very excited. They were like wild horses that had been let off their reins. They didn't feel that it was slow, but that they were free."Slow?"Stunned, Kong Ji looked at Li Hao. Was this slow?He really wasn't slow.They had been flying all the way from the border of the dragon and phoenix. In three days, they had broken through three worlds. It was impossible for all the worlds to be together. There must be a distance between each world.In a single day, they had to travel, locate, search, conquer, and clean up the battlefields ... Taking down three worlds in three days, and you still feel that it's not fast?That was a special situation, and everyone was gathered together.But now, everyone was scattered.In the chaos, maintaining the speed of One World a day was already unbelievable. It could even be called a lightning battle."No!"Li Hao frowned."If this continues, I'll need at least a year to reach the sixth step!" One year ...Kong Ji didn't say anything. Was one year that slow?Perhaps.However, it made sense when he thought about it. Would the war in the chiyang region continue for another year?Not necessarily.If the Dragon Lord stopped fighting and returned quickly, Li Hao would have yet to reach level six while he had yet to reach Level Seven ... It would indeed be very troublesome. However, in Kong Ji's opinion, this speed was already his limit.Everyone rushed forward with all their might, killing, ambushing, and cleaning up the battlefield. No one wasted any time.Lin Hongyu's expression was cold."Why don't we split up? now that we have a certain level of combat power, we can split up and attack. With a middle-stage venerable sovereign as the leader, we can split into several small teams. This way, our efficiency will increase by several times!""That's too dangerous!"Li Hao shook his head."The Dragon field doesn't lack experts. It's possible that there are level six or seven itinerant cultivators ..."Today, Yuan Shuo had a rare interest and joined in the discussion,""Why don't we do what we did before? we can pretend to be the so-called Lords and let the venerable sovereigns in the surrounding worlds come here and kill them together!"But who should he impersonate?Now, what everyone wanted was the same as before, a group of venerable sovereigns. In this way, everyone could attack together. In the past few days, they had attacked the three worlds. Although some people had attacked, they were not as happy as before.Many people could only watch.He could no longer participate in it!As a result, he could not try it himself.Li Hao didn't say anything. He fell into deep thought for a long time before he suddenly said,""Void...In the primordial chaos, what sort of treasure can possibly attract so many powerful experts to gather together ...?""A treasure?"Kong Ji thought about it and shook his head."Unless a world like tianfang can make venerable sovereigns stronger, or ..."Suddenly, Kong Ji's eyes moved."Or, a level-six world is about to give birth to a great Dao universe. At this time, whether it's to watch the show, to scheme, or to take advantage of other things ... People like Tian Fang will be interested.""If a level six world was about to advance to Level Seven, you saw Senlan at that time. It already had a Dao universe and a master! If a universe of the great path is born naturally and has no master yet ... Once people know about it, it will attract countless venerable sovereigns!"Li Hao laughed!Chao kongji showed an approving smile. He looked around and then at Qian Wuliang and Hong Yitang. His smile suddenly brightened."Right! "That's it. It can't go on like this. It's too slow. Find the most powerful level-six world and the great Dao universe will fluctuate. A great Dao universe will be born soon. When you enter Level Seven, the power of the great Dao universe will spread in all directions. The fluctuations will be obvious and will definitely attract countless experts to spy on you ...""Will it attract a Grade 7?"Some people looked solemn, but Li Hao's eyes instantly brightened. "That's good! If a Type 7 powerhouse really did come ... A Type 7 powerhouse wouldn't rashly take the world away at the moment. If a Type 7 has left the native world, then ... We'll fight and kill the other party!"Everyone's heart skipped a beat!Killing a Grade 7!Back then, he had done it once and killed venerable sovereign Qi Shui. Although he had succeeded, there were many unexpected factors.

Chapter 3226 Battle Encounter (2)
While he was thinking, Li Hao unfolded a map. It was not from Red moon's side, but from the fire Phoenix realm. The fire Phoenix realm did not have much information about the dragon world, but some of the Tier 6 worlds were marked.It was all very simple, just saying that it was a Grade 6 world and one shouldn't provoke it.He didn't say how it was.Li Hao quickly looked through it and said,""My Silver Moon great Dao universe is now a Double fifth-tier great Dao universe. It's not inferior to Senlan, who hadn't advanced back then, and it also matches the fluctuations of the newly born great Dao universe ... My Silver Moon Dao is currently still mainly sword Dao. However, the great Dao universe has all kinds of Dao. In fact, it's difficult for everyone to tell which Dao is the main Dao.""Choose a world that's slightly further away from the other rank 7 worlds ..."He looked left and right for a while before pointing to a place."Here!"When everyone saw this, they were shocked.'What a crazy and bold guy.'This was the core region of the dragon world, which was ... The place where the dragon world had originally left. There were a few Tier 6 worlds nearby, and the fact that these worlds were so close to the dragon world meant that they were all direct descendants of the dragon world, and were truly subordinate worlds of the dragon world.Where the dragon world originally was, there would naturally be no other tier 7 worlds.Li Hao looked at the crowd and smiled.""Hurry over here as fast as you can, take down a rank 6 world, and create the illusion of advancing ... Lingyue, what you need to do is to sweep up the primal Chaos energy in the surroundings and create the illusion of a world advancing. Make it as big as possible!""Dao Masters, what you need to do is to spread the fluctuations of the great Dao universe as wildly as possible. The bigger the fluctuations, the better ... At this moment, don't worry about being discovered. It'll be troublesome if you worry about no one discovering you. I want all the worlds in the Dragon Realm to sense that a world is going to advance here!"After taking a deep breath, Li Hao said,"in addition, I need four venerable sovereigns to guard the other directions. They'll keep an eye on the movements of the powerful worlds in the four directions. They can't let the enemy enter the area without being noticed. It's very dangerous ... But someone is indeed needed to do it.""I'll bring along an Ethereal Plane as a means of communication. It'll be just nice to expand the river of time's range ...""Which four venerable sovereigns are willing to come and act as my Scouts?" he looked at the crowd.Once there was a level 7 world, he could directly teleport into it and cause a huge commotion. He would definitely be able to notice it and warn Li Hao in advance so that he could be prepared.However, it was rather dangerous.Once he was discovered, he would die without a doubt.Everyone looked at each other, and soon, the Black Panther shook its tail. Its hiding ability was strong, and it could occupy a side ...However, the Black Panther was a rank five venerable sovereign and a world Lord. Silver Moon might need to advance to the world realm during this period, but Li Hao did not want it to leave. He hoped that a few weaker venerable sovereigns would serve as sentries.He still hadn't thought of a good candidate. At this moment, Liu Long spoke,""I'll stay behind to guard a region. If there's any danger, a level 7 will bring the world across the border and I'll warn them in advance ... I'm just afraid that they'll be silent and I won't be able to capture them!"As soon as Liu Long opened his mouth, someone else quickly said,""I'm fast, I'll stay on the side!"Thunderbolt kick didn't have a good reputation in the martial arts world, but sometimes, it was very direct and straightforward. Without saying much, it directly took on the task of guarding a side. In fact, everyone somewhat understood what Li Hao was thinking.It was best for those who stayed behind to be weaker and have less potential, because the others might still need to advance. During the process of fighting and devouring other realms, there would be opportunities, and these opportunities were not available to those who stayed behind.Liu Long and Thunderbolt kick clearly understood this principle. Their potential was limited."I'll also guard one side!"Jin Jin said.Just as he finished speaking, Hong Mu quickly said,""Lord Marquis, I've also taken root in a region. I'm a monster plant, so my senses are stronger. I can guard a region!" Li Hao was slightly surprised, but he didn't find the other three strange at all.They were both silver Moon martial masters, and they knew what they were thinking.The Redwood ...At this moment, the Redwood was very active.It had also entered the venerable sovereign level. From a monster plant that was almost trapped to death in the ruins, it had reached the peak of the monster life. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 He didn't know if there was a Yao plant Supreme Emperor in new martial arts, but there wasn't one in the past.Today, there were a few Silver Moon monster plant Supreme emperors.It, little tree, and general Huai. Compared to the new martial era, it was already unbelievable that there was not a single monster plant Supreme Emperor after so many years.However, the Redwood ... Was now somewhat dissatisfied.It had always been bound to Lin Hongyu, and now, Lin Hongyu's status ... Seemed to be in danger. The Queen had been improving rapidly recently, although Li Hao had never shown anything or had any romantic feelings for the Queen ...However, this did not work.The Redwood tree was also one of the few wise ones among the monster plants. It was a thankless task to stay behind for this mission, and it was easy to miss the opportunity and opportunity, but it also depended on who it was working for.This was Li Hao!Had he ever mistreated anyone?Even if it lost its chance ... At the very least, it represented Lin Hongyu. Li Hao and Lin Hongyu would remember that it had given up all chances to advance by staying in one place.Therefore, at this moment, Hong Mu was still afraid that someone would snatch the opportunity and quickly said,""My Lord, I cultivate the Dao of chaos, the Dao of chaos, and I'm also a monster plant. In fact, I'm very similar to chaos beasts! Even if we do encounter a Beast of Chaos, it might not recognize me. It might even think that I'm from the lineage of chaos!"

"My Lord, I think it's best if the human race doesn't appear rashly. It's too dangerous!" Once they were discovered, there was a 99% chance that they would be killed ... On the other hand, demon beasts and demon plants would be safer! Even if other powerhouses discovered him, they might not care. Besides, we have the aura of a major world, so they might mistake us for venerable sovereigns of a major world ..."Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. Before he could speak, li Fuhai of the demon clan suddenly said,""That's right, I think so too! Why don't I, Sequoia, the Imperial Guards, and general Huai stay behind?"This was also an opportunity for the new recruits.At this moment, li Fuhai quickly seized the opportunity and said,""We're from the demon race, and the demon plant is more similar to the chaos race. As for the demon race ... There are five demon race macro worlds here, and they haven't fallen out yet. However, there's only one human macro world, and it's a lightning-type one ... Once a human appears, he'll definitely be targeted!" Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 "Lord Marquis, it's not only safer for us to appear, but the demons can also adapt to the chaotic environment of the chaos ..."Li Hao's eyes flickered. He nodded."Alright, then the four of you!"Liu Long wanted to say something but stopped. Li Hao directly interrupted him,""Alright, let's do this! If you encounter a seventh-order world, don't think about anything else. Just use the ethereal extent I gave you to connect to the river of time and tell me directly!""This time, I also intend to spread the river of time across the entire Dragon field to make it easier for me to communicate and control!""Hurry up," Li Hao said."When you reach your position, place your ethereal extent into the chaos!"He marked four locations on the map and said,""Will the four of you ... Get lost?"“……”The four venerable sovereigns were speechless.Would he?It definitely wouldn 't!We're not the human Emperor.Li Hao had underestimated them, but there was nothing he could do about it. Among the four of them, apart from the little tree Thearch guard, which was considered half a neo-martial monster plant, the others were all neo-martial era monster plants and monsters.The human King's reputation was too great, so he had to specially ask.Seeing them shake their heads, Li Hao smiled."That's good. After you're in position, we've almost reached the center of the dragon world ... By the way, the Thunder region is at the eastern border, and there's only the Thunder World over there ... However, we have to be careful. Hong Mu, you go to the East. Now that the Dragon Lord has left, the Thunder World may also take some action. Be careful that the other party will cross the border and come here. Don't mess up my plan!"The four venerable sovereigns nodded quickly and memorized everything. Then, Li Hao gave them four small realms, which were all filled. The ethereal Plane was different from the real world. Even if it was filled with energy, it didn't have much weight. They were all the power of great DAOs, and it was fine as long as they were stored in the body.The four worlds were connected to Time and Stars. They were not too far away from each other, and they could still contact Li Hao. It was the most effective way for them to contact each other in the chaos!The four venerable sovereigns quickly disappeared and went their separate ways.At this moment, the Silver Moon Martial Master was feeling a little uncomfortable. This time, the task of guarding the four sides had been snatched away by these neo martial cultivators, making them seem a little timid and incompetent.Li Hao glanced at them. He knew what they were thinking, so he smiled and said nothing. In the past few days, the competition within Silver Moon had been very intense.All of them were performing madly!Even the two notorious neo martial Supreme emperors, celestial pole and King Huai, had been working these days, whether they were putting in effort or otherwise ... Each and every one of them was afraid that they would be seen by others if they were idle.The inner scroll was extremely serious!It was a good thing!Previously, everyone had been so idle that they almost fell ill. Afraid that they were useless, Li Hao took them into the Silvermoon world to live out their retirement with the ordinary people.Heaven's Fate wanted to, but he couldn't bring himself to do so. In fact, he could, but as one of the few middle-stage venerable sovereigns, he was worried that he would be dragged out and beaten to death if he didn't put in any effort.After much consideration, he decided to put in some effort."Let's go. Our destination is Tianhuang world!"Li Hao set a goal. This world was a Tier 6 world. He didn't know the specific situation, but he knew that it was very close to the original location of the dragon world and should be a direct force of the dragon world.In the Dragon field, if you didn't have some real ability or capability, how could you get so close to the dragon world?In this case, it seemed normal for the world to advance.A rank-seven advancement in a world would definitely attract the attention of the venerable sovereigns of the four worlds, whether they were here to snatch, congratulate, or just watch the show. Moreover, everyone felt that the Dragon Land was safe, especially the dragon world ... So there was nothing to be afraid of.As for the four seventh rank worlds, they were very far away and might not receive the news. Even if they did, they might not come. This was because rashly entering the dragon world was a world that had advanced to the seventh rank. It was a great taboo for a seventh rank venerable sovereign to come.It would easily attract the hostility of venerable sovereigns in the dragon world!……Li Hao didn't think too much about it. He felt that they were too slow.Even if it was fake, he had to create a level 7 world!In this way, he could complete the gathering of venerable sovereigns as soon as possible. As for the future troubles ... It was none of his business. At this time, he could not retreat. He would be exposed sooner or later. Who cared about these things?……Dragon World region.With the departure of the dragon world, a huge circle was left in the central region. Even if the Dragon Lord had left with the world, no one dared to occupy the territory of the dragon world, even if the chaotic energy there was denser and even had a trace of Dao accumulation.

Chapter 3228 Battle Encounter (3)
However, the dragon world was only going out to battle, not destroyed. Who would dare to occupy the territory of the dragon world?Near the dragon world, there were some rank six worlds. These rank six worlds were the ones with the highest chance of reaching the rank seven realm. Every single sector Lord was at the peak of the rank six.It was precisely because there was a chance of reaching the seventh rank that these chaos beasts could bring their worlds and live around Dragon World. Dragon World swallowed and spat out chaos power. It was also known as the universe cover. The pure chaos power would often be transferred to the surrounding worlds.Tianhuang world.This Type 6 world wasn't considered weak, the sector Lord was a peak Type 6 giant lizard, it could be considered a side branch of the Dragon race. Of course, whether it was true or not, no one knew, and no one really cared.There were still many venerable sovereigns in the world, and they were one of the few that had hopes of entering the rank 7 world.In this world, there were many humans who were contributing to the advancement of this world to Level 7.Compared to The Outer Worlds, planet Tianhuang was much more prosperous.The suppression on the human tribe was very strong. However, it was not like the outer region where there was only killing and devouring. The oppression here was more of a kind of oppression on the great Dao. Every human here would work hard to cultivate.He had to comprehend different DAOs because he had received some guidance from the dragon world. In order to become a great world, the great DAOs had to be perfected. The more types of great DAOs one cultivated and the deeper one's comprehension, the more hope one had of driving the world to Level Seven. The human race was very strong in this aspect because they could cultivate almost any great Dao. However, there were some restrictions on the Beasts of Chaos. Most of them cultivated one kind of great Dao and were inherited. From the day they were born, they might have been destined to only cultivate one kind of great Dao.In Tianhuang world, countless humans cultivated numbly every day. They cultivated the mantras that the Lord of Tianhuang had obtained from all over the world. Talented cultivators actually lived pretty well here.Those without talent ... Would quickly disappear.However, talented cultivators also had a lot of trouble ... The biggest trouble was that those beasts of primordial chaos didn't care about anything else. Since you have talent, you should have more.Aren't you humans capable of giving birth?If you have the talent, then give birth to ... Give birth to 100,1000, or even more ...The descendants of talented cultivators would more or less inherit some of their talents, which was better than those without. As a result, some human cultivators were desperate. When giving birth to children became a task, they were stipulated how many children they had to give birth to every year. They had to give birth, or they would die if they didn't ...Under such circumstances, regardless of whether one had talent or not, they would all be in despair.And these beasts of primordial chaos did not care about so-called human relations. It did not matter who they gave birth to. In order to nurture those with stronger talents, even if they were siblings, father-daughter, mother-and-son ...The beasts of primordial chaos did not care! Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 As a result, the entire Tianhuang world was deformed. However, the effect was not bad. To the Lord of Tianhuang's satisfaction, he could sense that the entire world was changing over the years under such crazy pressure.His Dao had become even more perfect.All kinds of great DAOs seemed to appear in the world. Although it had not officially entered Level Seven, the master of planet Tianhuang could already feel the bud of some great DAOs. Perhaps, in a few years, planet Tianhuang would officially enter Level Seven, and it could take the opportunity to break through to Level Seven!In the past million years, only 11 tier 7 worlds had been born in the entire chaos race, excluding Dragon World.Only one family could be born every 100000 years.The master of planet Tianhuang's greatest wish was for planet Tianhuang to become the 12th tier 7 world and the 13th great world of the chaos.Although the guy in the Earth Dragon World nearby seemed to have entered Level Seven ... It was only Level Seven for the original body and Level Seven for the chaos. It was not that the world had entered Level Seven. So what if the other party was a level Seven venerable sovereign?You're at the seventh step, but that doesn't mean your world will advance faster than mine!When my world reaches the seventh step, I will have a world of the seventh step, and my status will definitely be higher than his.The Lord of Tianhuang was even happier after the dragon world left.With the departure of the dragon world, a large amount of chaotic force in the nearby area surged toward Tianhuang world. The entire world seemed to have become much more active. It seemed that without the chaotic force of the dragon world, the chaotic force in this place was even denser.Of course, the Lord of planet Tianhuang remembered one thing ... Before he left Dragon World, he had given a secret order to the surrounding powerful worlds to take note of one thing.After the dragon world left, the Thunder World in the Thunder region might not be satisfied and choose to leave. They might even Enter the Dragon world to plunder.Thunder World Master was very strong!Therefore, he had to be careful, but he didn't have to worry too much. If the other party really appeared, the sleeping Earth Dragon in the Earth Dragon World next door would make a move and wait for him.As long as they could hold the other party back, someone would come to deal with the Thunderbolt master very soon.What the Lord of Tianhuang and the others had to do was to control the flow of the great Dao crystals in the realm. They couldn't let a single great Dao crystal flow into the Thunder World. Everyone knew that the Thunder World lacked great Dao crystals!As long as he could control the great Dao crystal, even if the lightning Master really came, he would be helpless.The surrounding realms had been dependent on Dragon World for many years and had gradually built a complete defense system. It would not be easy for the other party to break into a rank six world!……

Chapter 3229 Battle Encounter (3)
 At the same time.In the darkness.There was a faint flash of lightning.A man stood in the void, frowning slightly with a heavy expression.The lightning Lord!Yes, he had come out. He had to come out. Recently, the fire Phoenix realm had cut off all the sources of great Dao crystals in the Thunder World. Without great Dao crystals, the Thunder World could not support itself.What was even more abominable was that there were originally some great Dao crystals in the realm ... But ... Unexpectedly, recently, a venerable sovereign he trusted more had betrayed him and destroyed all the storage."Fire Phoenix ... Dragon Lord ..."The Thunder Emperor's face was cold and indifferent. He knew that he was almost at his wit's end. These guys had recently increased the pressure on him and the Thunder World. Now, it was no longer a conspiracy.It was an Open Conspiracy!Lightning Lord, how do you choose? Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Are you coming out or not?Where can you go after you come out?"If you want to plunder some great Dao crystals ... Perhaps you'll die the moment you make a move!He knew, but he had no choice.He couldn't go in any other direction except for the dragon world. At present, it seemed that it was the safest. However ... The Thunderbolt master knew how terrifying the Dragon Lord was. Was his territory really safe?He looked around at the shining worlds.They were all rank six worlds!If he broke through a rank six world, he might be able to obtain many great Dao crystals.However ... If he broke through one, he might be discovered in the blink of an eye and be besieged from all sides. There should not be many great Dao crystals in the storage of a rank-6 world. The other party also knew that he urgently needed them ... Perhaps even fewer.At this moment, the Thunderbolt master was having a huge headache. How should I choose?It was impossible to take down a rank 7 world in a short time, so he could only attack these rank 6 worlds.But ...He was a little conflicted!These Level-6 worlds ... Did not seem to be that safe. Could he go to the outer regions and deal with the weaker worlds? but in that case, even if he was fast and broke through One World a day ... Regardless of whether anyone discovered or tracked him, how many worlds would he have to break through to satisfy the consumption of a Level-7 world?Currently, he had quietly left the Thunder World without being discovered by the other party. If they were to discover him, the Thunder World might be surrounded and attacked by them. Therefore, he could only use his fastest speed to obtain the greatest benefits and return to the Thunder World as quickly as possible.He couldn't stay outside for too long.Just in case, he didn't even dare to cover this place with the aura of the universe. He didn't want the experts to sense him and know that he had come out. That would be even more troublesome.Just as he was feeling conflicted about which family was the richest among all the Tier 6 worlds, he suddenly frowned.Looking in one direction, it seemed like ... Another Chaos Beast was coming this way.It was a somewhat complicated aura! The Thunderbolt master looked in one direction, but he couldn't see clearly. Who would come to this place at this time? the Dragon Master wasn't here, but he moved the worlds randomly and messed up the deployment of the entire Dragon field. Wasn't he afraid of being killed by the expert of the dragon world?……In the distance.The Black Panther continued to control the Silvermoon world, and there was a cat next to him, second cat!2nd cat was also controlling a rank 6 world.At this moment, he was rapidly approaching planet Tianhuang.At this moment, Kong Ji suddenly opened his eyes. Li Hao quickly looked around and scouted the surroundings. Kong Ji was silent. After a while, he said telepathically,"You sensed it?""Yes."Li Hao nodded and sent a voice transmission, it seems that an expert is spying on us ...Kong Ji instantly frowned.Seventh-rank?There was a level 7 being nearby?In terms of realm, he had already reached the seventh step, so he was extremely sensitive to the seventh step. The eighth step was a little better, as it was hard to be discovered, but he could easily sense the seventh step experts.Li Hao, on the other hand, had a high level and strength due to the convergence of 10000 DAOs. In addition, he had comprehended a lot of DAOs and learned a lot of DAOs. He could easily sense that someone was spying on him.It shouldn't be rank eight, but rank seven venerable sovereign!"There's no aura of the great Dao universe ... Pretend that we don't know anything ... Lingyue, release some power of faith. If it's a rank seven venerable sovereign left behind from the dragon world ... We ... Can just lure the snake out of its hole and kill it!""Everyone, get ready. There might be a tier 7 being nearby. I didn't expect to encounter a big fish as soon as we arrived. If the other party really has their eyes on us ... We'll eat them!"Rank 7 venerable sovereign!However, Li Hao and Kong Ji weren't afraid of each other.At this moment, although the coincidental meeting of a seventh-tier powerhouse had somewhat broken his plan, but ... If it was really a seventh-tier, then he would eat it.
