What to do?The new martial artist was trapped. It was good enough that he could protect himself. The human King was just saying harsh words. How could it be so easy to kill a few rank-8s under the siege of 15 rank-8s?Long Zhan might even attack their group of people and not Samsara.All the grade-8 powerhouses in the East had joined the battle.What else could he do?Countless thoughts rose up in his mind. At this moment, even he was very depressed. Was the path to the eighth rank really so difficult?"Thump ..."It sounded like the beating of a heart, but it also sounded like the footsteps of reincarnation. In this endless void, the sound of footsteps could be heard. Every step seemed to be stepping on the hearts of Li Hao and his group.The reincarnation Emperor looked at Li Hao and gradually approached him.He's so young!He looked at Li Hao and sighed with emotion. He was really young. A cultivator's age did not depend on their appearance. The strong could naturally sense the other's age. This young man was so young that he could not believe it.You ... Are you not afraid?Li Hao didn't retreat, run, or tremble. He just looked at him silently, as if he was waiting for him to come.At this moment ... Samsara actually felt some pressure, laughable pressure.If Li Hao was panicking, he would be very happy. But now that Li Hao was extremely calm, he felt some pressure instead. He laughed and continued to move forward, closing the distance between them. The level eight venerable sovereigns behind him followed. Samsara's laughter rang out."Li Hao, I'm also curious about something. Just now ... Just a moment ago, why did that wave of time ripple disappear?""Fellow Daoist reincarnation, do you want to know?" Li Hao also smiled."A little!"Samsara nodded. The distance between the two was extremely close. At this point, a rank eight could even attack.Li Hao took a deep breath, and the chaotic force around him trembled. His eyes flickered with golden light as he looked at the opposite side, as if he could see through everything. Dao laws appeared in his eyes.The Dao of chaos.He merged into the chaos, just like the last time he saw the Dragon Master. At this moment, he looked at the experts in front of him. Great DAOs filled the entire chaos. They were extremely powerful. Among them, there were two huge great DAOs revolving around the Samsara Emperor-life and death!They were like two giant Dragons that circled the heavens and earth. As for sovereign Peng Cheng, there was only a kun Peng floating around him. The area around sovereign Feng Ming was filled with a dark and poisonous gas that seemed to corrode even the chaos.The Earth Spirit Emperor was surrounded by mountains, which suppressed the chaos.These eighth level venerable sovereigns all had their own unique points.The Earth Spirit's defense was unparalleled, Peng Cheng's strength was boundless, his buzzing speed was extremely fast, his poison was extremely strong, and Samsara was even more powerful ... The weak ones were only the two Samsara sovereign and the two eighth rank venerable sovereigns who were rushing over. A sword appeared in his hand.The peak Tier 6 firmament sword was now in a state of complete destruction. However, in an instant, the firmament sword seemed to have melded into the chaos, absorbing the chaotic energy around it and rapidly repairing itself."Are you still going to resist at this point?" the reincarnation Emperor frowned.Li Hao was unmoved.However, when he looked at Samsara, venerable Lord bee whine, who was standing beside Samsara, seemed impatient. The countless poisonous stingers on its body trembled as if it was going to shoot thousands of arrows at once to poison Li Hao and his group to death!Behind Li Hao, the three level eights unleashed their auras to the extreme. The chess board turned into a chessboard and enveloped everyone, guarding against the sudden attack of the bees. Giant Thunder Dragons emerged from the Thunder monarch's body, and his face was extremely solemn. Wu Shan was beating a big drum in his hand, and the muffled sound was suffocating.At this moment, Li Hao, who hadn't moved at all, suddenly took a step forward.He was not pretending.Instead ... He had been waiting, digesting, and merging. He didn't care why Samsara wasn't in a hurry to take action. As for himself ... He purely hoped to give himself some time to merge with the great Dao stars formed by those spiritual bodies.That was why ... He didn't know why the cycle of reincarnation had to stop. He didn't care either. He only knew that he had completed it!At this moment, Li Hao smiled.The clouds were light and the wind was light, without a hint of smoke or fire. He floated up, and his voice was still gentle."Since things have come to this, let's fight!""Kill!"Samsara hadn't even spoken, but the other rank eights couldn't take it anymore.The distance between the two sides was so close, and the gap was so big. What were they waiting for?They couldn't wait any longer!Kill them first.At this moment, the buzzing reached its maximum speed. It was good at speed, so it pierced through the void like a sharp sword and appeared in front of Li Hao in an instant. Countless poisonous stingers shot out from its body!It felt that if it was lucky, it could kill all of them by itself!Kill Li Hao and take the time seed."I knew it, you're the fastest!"Li Hao's voice rang in his ears. At this moment, Li Hao seemed to be smiling. I knew it. This guy would be the fastest to arrive. He would be the first to arrive at his fastest speed.Today, I'll use it to test my Dao integration sword.With the sword in his hand, the myriad worlds merged together. At this moment, the river of the great path appeared and countless stars emerged. Among the stars, there was a figure looming. Countless venerable sovereigns were watching nervously!They ... Were really as Li Hao said. At this moment, they felt the sword intent, the fusion of thousands of DAOs, and the pressure and power of a top-tier level 8.

Chapter 3511 Sword Out, Time Sword!
And they, at this moment, were all a part of this sword."This sword is the time sword!"One sword merged with 10000 DAOs, and thousands of figures appeared. At this moment, under Feng Ming's disbelieving gaze, Li Hao's sword slashed out at an extreme speed, even faster than Feng Ming 's.Hurry up!It was so fast that it was as if time had stopped, as if the world had frozen.For the first time, Li Hao used the sword of time, which he had expected to reach level 9 after comprehending thousands of DAOs!Although this sword was not as powerful as a true rank nine expert, the reincarnation Emperor was still a step slower. He stopped and his expression changed.How much?Five thousand?Six thousand?​ For a moment, he could not make a judgment. That sword covered the entire heaven and earth, shrouded in all directions, and shrouded the small buzzing within.  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  This so-called number one expert under the command of the southern Overlord had the power of more than 4000 DAOs. At this moment, under this sword, countless poisonous stingers shot out from his body, but they were instantly shattered by the sword light.The buzzing made a sharp sound, but it had no effect on Li Hao. The sword still fell.In the distance, a giant dragon instantly transformed into a human and landed in the distance. His expression changed slightly and he stopped in his tracks.On the other side, the human King, who was fighting madly, suddenly turned his head and looked over.In the dark, countless venerable sovereigns who were watching the battle held their breath!It was as if this sword was the only thing in the entire world!The sword fell!In just an instant, Feng Ming's powerful body seemed to be dissolved by time and shattered by the sword intent. His body crumbled in an instant, and venomous liquid seeped out, corroding the primal Chaos void with sizzling sounds.A Dao domain that was primarily made up of poison gas appeared and shattered instantly.Countless great path nomological laws were shattered at this moment.Venerable Lord bee Ming's spirit instantly overflowed. At this moment, there was only shock in his compound eyes, but he didn't dare to be confident.How could it be!6,000 great Dao?Or ... More?It didn't know. It only knew that time seemed to have stopped under the sword. It took the sword head-on, and the powerful sword instantly shattered its body, Dao domain, great Dao laws, and soul!I ... I'm a top-tier level eight Dao law with 4000 Dao laws!In the South, I'm known as the number one demon under the spring and autumn era ... Everything was destroyed and dissipated with this sword.Venerable sovereign Feng Ming was a top-notch expert. With just a single slash, he had shattered the illusory figure completely. He was in disbelief, unable to understand what was going on even until his death.What a joke!It was said that Li Hao was only at Level Seven. A level Seven venerable sovereign ... Could kill him with a single strike?Who started this rumor?Who was it?BOOM!It was not until the shadow shattered, the world trembled, and the chaos roiled that Li Hao's laughter resounded in the air."Venerable sovereign Feng Ming, it seems like ... You're just so-so!"It was nothing more than this!Everyone was shocked.The reincarnation sovereign stopped in his tracks. Peng Cheng and the others, who were about to charge forward, were forced to step back in shock.Feng Ming ... Died?How could it be!At this moment, in the South, in a distant place, a huge shadow that covered the entire void seemed to spread over, and an aura spread in all directions.Far, far away!However, at this moment, it was as if a great Dao universe had spread over. It seemed to have sensed and even seen Feng Ming's death.However ... Very quickly, that incomparably powerful shadow gradually began to return and dissipate from the world.At that moment, the entire world seemed to be on the verge of collapse.Countless worlds were on the verge of collapse.The Overlord of the South, Supreme Emperor spring and autumn, was furious!As for Li Hao, he laughed heartily and slashed out with his sword. At this moment, sword shadows covered the entire area, and countless sword intents, like ten thousand swords, charged toward the crowd."Reincarnation! You ... Can you kill me?"The sword essence was monstrous!The chaos energy around him surged, and the entire chaos great Dao began to shake.The battle had completely erupted.It started with the death of a top-tier level 8!

Chapter 3512 Devil, Saint!
Li Hao had been preparing for this attack for a long time.In fact, the most important time star was completely broken on this day. Such a decision was difficult to achieve even if there were 10000 copies.And this moment was enough to repay Li Hao. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  Feng Ming, who had killed 4000 Dao laws with a single sword!The great demon of the South had fallen.The Samsara emperors retreated.The reincarnation Emperor was shocked.Even he couldn't kill the buzzing with one sword.He had more than 5800 Dao laws, and an expert close to 6000 Dao laws could not kill his opponent with one strike. In his eyes, other than the few overlords, the only one who could do it was long Zhan from the four regions.Long Zhan was a peerless expert with 7000 Dao laws.Those overlords were probably above 8000, and 9000 would be the ninth rank.As for Li Hao, how much did he get?Could it be that he had surpassed him in the eighth step?This was impossible!Samsara, who thought they were well-prepared, was shaken at this moment. Behind them, several rank eights, including the Earth Spirit monarch, were all shocked. Feng Ming, who was on par with him, was killed with a single sword strike.Venerable Pengcheng's face turned ugly as well. His strength was at most equal to Feng Ming 's, or even slightly inferior.How could this be?Countless venerable sovereigns were shocked.In the distance, long Zhan was floating in the air, his face solemn. Behind him, several eighth rank venerable sovereigns were shocked. Even hei Hu and Feng Yan, who wanted to take revenge, were stunned.Red Moon sovereign was also at a loss.How could it be like this?Was this still Li Hao?Or was it the Silver Moon King who was attached to neo martial?Even though Silver Moon and neo martial had always been independent, in everyone's eyes, wasn't Silver Moon just a subsidiary of neo martial?But today...While the human Kings were still fighting, the Silver Moon King had already killed a peak type 8 expert with a single strike.It was too unbelievable! ……At this moment, the Thunder monarch and the others were in a frenzy. They were shocked and overjoyed.How could it be?He had killed a top-tier level 8 existence, who was even more powerful than them, with a single strike from Li Hao!Behind Samsara, two type 8 experts had just arrived. They were experts from the Western huntian.The moment they arrived, their expressions changed.The seven powerful auras were a little turbulent at this moment. The reincarnation Emperor retreated and didn't attack. If you don't know your enemy well enough and think that he's in a weak state, you'll probably lose your life.He kept retreating, pulling away from Li Hao.Peng Cheng and the earth Spirit, who had been so eager just a moment ago, also retreated quickly without any hesitation.When Feng Ming, who was at the same level as them, was killed, they ... Felt the danger of death. They were no match for Feng Ming, and they were suppressed. However, killing Feng Ming ... Was a completely different matter!The seven grade 8s were all retreating.The Thunder monarch, Dao Qi, and Wu Shan stepped forward excitedly. The few rank Sevens from the middle world Alliance were so scared that they almost ran away, except for myriad transformations.At this moment, however, he was inexplicably stunned. His eyes instantly brightened. He no longer retreated, no longer feared, and his legs stopped shaking. He quickly followed!They ... Seemed ... To be ... About to turn the tables!It was not a reversal of adversity.It was just that ... From the very beginning, the Silver Moon King seemed to have a plan in mind, and he had made ample preparations.As for neo martial, they were used to turning the tables in battle. Silver Moon seemed to have the initiative in the war from the beginning to the end.He rarely turned the tables when he was in an unfavorable situation. The only time he did so was when many people died in battle. After that time, Li Hao would only do anything and fight a battle when he was extremely confident.That kind of experience, one was enough.Turning the tables in adversity and breaking through in battle ... Li Hao felt that he ... Might not be able to do that."Li Hao!"The reincarnation Emperor looked at Li Hao with a grave expression, as if he wanted to see through him."You ... Have completely mastered time?"Li Hao did not cultivate time.This was something that many people knew, and it probably came from others.Could it be that Li Hao had completely mastered the way of time?At this moment, the spiritual bodies of thousands of venerable sovereigns in Li Hao's long river of Dao were also shocked and excited, as if they were the ones who won.The elegance of that sword was something they would never forget in their lives.Was this Li Hao's sword, the Dao master of the heavens, Supreme Emperor Hao Yue?For the first time in this chaos, Li Hao's fame surpassed that of the neo martial King.In the eyes of others, he was no longer the Silver Moon King who could only attach himself to neo martial.He was Li Hao.Li Hao shook his head, still smiling.""Daoist Samsara, you've overestimated me! If I could control time, I'd probably be at the 9th rank already. I can kill anyone here, so why waste my breath on you?"He didn't like to waste his breath.With absolute strength, why bother to argue with the enemy? unless they were evenly matched or slightly inferior, who would be willing to say such things?He wasn't the king of humans who had a foul mouth. He had to satisfy his craving before he would be happy.At this moment, Li Hao looked into the distance. Over there, he had already felt the fluctuations just now. Long Zhan was indeed nearby. Clearly, he had also been shaken by his sword just now and exposed his whereabouts."Long Zhan is nearby. Dao friend Samsara, do you still want to attack?"At this moment, the reincarnation Emperor's face turned ugly. The next moment, he laughed and suddenly shouted,""Long Zhan! There's no blood feud between you and me. Li Hao, with the help of new martial arts, is guarding the East and blocking your way out of square domain. He's full of malice towards the chaos. At this moment, are you still going to breed a Tiger that will bring trouble?"

"Pengcheng is also from your chaos race ... At least there's still some room for us to work together ... Is there any room for you and him to work together?"He let out a roar. Even at this moment, his side's combat strength was still strong, he still chose to rope in long Zhan.In the distance.Long Zhan knew that he had already been exposed and could no longer be concealed. At this moment, he walked out from the endless darkness. Beside him were black Tiger, Feng Yan, Red Moon, and Qingqiu, four rank eight venerable sovereigns. There were a total of five rank eight venerable sovereigns.The other few people's combat strength was average. Only long Zhan was incomparably valiant.The appearance of these five experts shocked countless cultivators who were watching the battle. They had thought that Samsara would be unable to deal with Li Hao after he killed Feng Ming with one strike. But now, the situation had completely changed. Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't seem nervous.He just looked in that direction. Looking at long Zhan, a golden light appeared in his eyes. He looked at long Zhan and a smile appeared on his face.After a long time, Li Hao suddenly said,"you and I have a grudge. Fellow Daoist long Zhan, it's better to watch this battle!" Don't look for trouble and lure out an unknown person. At that time, neither of us will benefit!"Long Zhan was slightly shocked in his heart!He looked at Li Hao in the distance, not saying a word.As for Li Hao, he was still standing in his original position. At this moment, his aura appeared, like a king High above, looking down on the world. At this moment, a wave even spread toward long Zhan.It was as if a giant dragon had appeared beside long Zhan. It came into contact with Li Hao's aura, and in just an instant, it was as if it had seen something. It had seen ... A passageway!It led directly to the four-sided domain!Long Zhan's heart trembled. He looked at Li Hao again. Over there, Li Hao was still indifferent, looking at long Zhan, not saying a word.You're an idiot, so there's no need to talk about it.If you're smart, you should know that if we start a war, perhaps ... It will draw out some things.You might not be able to bear the burden of time being completely shattered.Long Zhan did not speak.He just looked at Li Hao, and Li Hao looked back at him. Then, he suddenly smiled and ignored him.If you want to interfere, then try me.He did not want to draw out something because it might be very troublesome. However, if long Zhan insisted on intervening, then this time ... It might really draw out something.He no longer paid any attention to long Zhan. At this moment, he was only intimidating him. But an Overlord like long Zhan might not be intimidated.Li Hao didn't waste any more time. He shouted in a low voice,""Kill!"There was no need for words.He drew his sword!With his sword shining in the sky, Li Hao's voice resounded,""Human King, this junior will kill a demon first and become the pioneer of the human King. The human King is good at fighting and turning the tables in adversity ... Today, this junior also wants to see it!"……New martial.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ The human King heard it.At this moment, he was very angry.He felt that he was being looked down upon.Good at turning the tables in adversity, you mean ... I'm not as good as you? Bastard!Surrounded by 15 rank eights and even a rank seven, he was surrounded by powerhouses. At this moment, he was being attacked by many rank eights, including the extreme frost Thearch.The human King's eyes were cold. He liked to scold people, but this time, he didn 't.He waved his long saber with a powerful aura, but it was difficult to hurt the enemy.The human King looked at the extreme frost monarch coldly, which actually made the extreme frost monarch a little scared. At this moment, the human King was extremely cold."Extreme Ice, I'll give you one last chance ... Now, get lost! You guys, you've angered me!"Extreme frost Thearch's expression was a little ugly. Although one stage eight had died on the other side, there were 15 stage eight experts surrounding him. Human King, what are you so arrogant for?You only have 5000 Dao laws, and he's about the same.He wasn't much weaker than a human King.What right do you have to be so arrogant?"It looks like ... He won't shed tears until he sees the coffin!"At this moment, the human King seemed to be really angry. Even the Supreme-beings nearby were frowning. It would be fine if Fang ping was not angry. When he was really angry, he really did not care about anything. Once the battle broke out, it was easy to completely lose control, regardless of the consequences.Just as he was about to speak, he was quickly interrupted by an eighth rank venerable sovereign.The Grandmaster immediately lost interest in talking.As for the human King, his face turned ashen. Suddenly, he gritted his teeth and roared,""All of you, explode them!"As soon as he finished speaking ...An unbelievable scene appeared.There were many seventh rank venerable sovereigns in neo martial arts. At this moment, even the powerful seventh rank venerable sovereigns, including venerable blood Emperor and venerable sword, were somewhat helpless, speechless, and wanted to ridicule ...He was depressed because he couldn't complain.Even Li Zhu, who had always been against him, cursed in a low voice!Other than this, what else do you know?What else can you do?[You're really not a good thing. For the sake of your face ... You don't want anything, right?]Thousands of thoughts ran through their minds, but at this moment, the new martial emperors didn't seem to be unwilling or have any thoughts of resisting. In just an instant, the sword realm of the sword Saint appeared, tens of thousands of swords came out, and countless blood Qi emerged.The surrounding seventh level venerable sovereigns merged into one. The self-destruction of a neo martial artist was very experienced.With so much experience ... Everyone already knew how to maximize the power of self-destruction.How to injure the enemy the most, how to prevent the enemy from escaping, how to choose the target ...The entire set had a process.After self-destructing, even if he was resurrected, he would have to return to his previous state ... With insufficient yang energy, he would have to face the same predicament as before, where he would be facing a lack of energy and yang energy.However, at this moment, no one hesitated or thought about it.In just an instant ...BOOM!It was earth-shattering and resounded through the chaos. A huge ball of light swept through the entire world. Countless energy fluctuations spread in all directions. Below level eight, there were many Level Seven venerable sovereigns. Many of them had just advanced a few days ago, such as Qin Fengqing. While cursing, they rushed into the crowd and joined in the self-destruction.

Scolding voices rang out!“艹!”"Again!" "This time, resurrect me first!""If you dare to side with anyone else, I'll kill you ..."“……”Curses erupted, and even the few who were usually calm couldn't help but curse. They trusted the human King so much that they thought they could still be resurrected. At worst, they would fall from their cultivation realm and lose their Yang Qi, just like they did in the past.He was used to it!This was also the most direct, most powerful, and craziest method of neo martial.It was a habit.Boom! Boom! Boom!Many rank seven venerable emperors, including Sword Saint, who had condensed his Dao domain and thousands of Dao laws, exploded at that moment!The powerful explosive force swept in all directions.The level Seven experts around him were all blown to pieces. Their targets were none other than the level eight experts surrounding the human King. The human King seemed to have anticipated this and had already started to defend himself.As for Emperor extreme frost and the others, they clearly did not expect that a single sentence would cause so many rank 7s to self-destruct. They did not seem to be worried that the human King might not be able to resurrect them.Even if he could, he would have to face the embarrassment from a thousand years ago again after climbing from the seventh rank to this level with great difficulty.They didn't seem to have considered it.Boom! Boom! Boom!The sound of explosions, the sound of the great Dao shattering, the sound of bones breaking, the sound of blood Qi surging, and the sound of chaotic power exploding reverberated through the entire chaos.“……”It wasn't just one or two people who had their mouths wide open. Even Li Hao, who was charging forward, was affected. He suddenly stopped and was dumbfounded!He knew that neo martial liked to self-destruct, and the human King had even set up many self-destruct places. Back then, Silver Moon had one. Almost all the mines had self-destruct devices set up by the human King.The self-destruction of the entire neo martial seemed to have become a normal state, even a morbid state!However, Li Hao did not expect that with just a little stimulation, these neo martial Supreme emperors would self-destruct in an instant.Boom! Boom! Boom!  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Violent fluctuations shook the entire chaos. At this moment, the human King's Blade silently projected itself into the world. A long blade illuminated the heavens and covered the entire void!The blade fell!An eighth level venerable sovereign from the extreme Ice world, who was attacking the human King together with the extreme Ice Thearch, was instantly blown apart. Before he could recover, he was shocked. Beside him, the extreme Ice Thearch was even more shocked. He roared,"You dare ..." BOOM!The long blade was filled with killing intent. The human King's face was cold and boundless, like a Demon King from hell. His cold voice resounded through the world,""Today, I'm going to kill the three emperors of Extreme Ice!"He had always been like this, always doing what he said and never going back on his words."Old Zhang, listen up!" A cold voice shouted."Ignore the others and kill the three emperors of Extreme Ice. If they don't die, you'll explode!"BOOM!The long blade fell with a loud bang. An eighth rank Supreme Emperor of Extreme Ice was completely shattered by his blade. The self-destruction of many seventh rank Supreme emperors only resulted in the death of one eighth rank venerable Emperor and the injury of a few others.However, at this moment, the other venerable sovereigns were all terrified.All of them turned pale!At this moment, the Supreme, Emperor Cang, and the sun god did not hesitate at all. They charged towards the other eighth rank Extreme Ice venerable sovereign. Even the cunning Supreme shouted,""Kill him! Don't care about anyone else. Those who are still alive, attack him!"The other extreme frost monarch was instantly terrified!His face turned pale!Even though there were a few grade 8 experts around, they were terrified to the extreme. This was what it meant to be brutal.So what if they were ganged up on?The five level eight venerable sovereigns did not care about anyone, whether they were injured or dead. They only had one goal ... To kill the three emperors of Extreme Ice even if they had to die!As for the human King, he brandished his long blade. He no longer cared about defense or the surrounding rank eights. His long blade slashed towards Extreme Ice Thearch madly. Like a mad demon, one blade could break tens of millions. No matter how the other thearchs attacked, they would still leave a bloody mark on Extreme Ice Thearch's body.This was the neo martial artist human King!The human King was crazy, extremely crazy.At this moment, extreme frost monarch was terrified. He was truly terrified. He even wanted to cry but had no tears.Not just my family!"It was a decision made by the three overlords together. It was a decision made by all the tier 8 powerhouses in the entire Eastern Region. I'm only the strongest, so I took on the role of an Alliance. That doesn't mean that I'm the one making the decision.Neo martial had gone crazy ... He knew about neo martial and had some understanding of it, but he was not so clear about it. Today, he knew that this group of people were crazy, through and through. Even if they had reached tier 8, they were still crazy.He felt danger, the danger of death.The other venerable sovereigns did not dare to take the risk out of fear and thought that it would be better for Extreme Ice to stand in front of them. At this moment, they were all guerilla warfare, surrounding and killing a few tier eight neo martial artists. However, they did not expect that the three emperors of Extreme Ice might all be buried with them!Have you thought about it?Maybe ... I've thought about it, but I'm not the one who's going to die. Neo martial arts are crazy. It's not a bad idea to let Extreme Ice die with them.However, to the person involved, how much despair did he feel at this moment?The frost monarch was at a loss as he was being attacked by the human Kings. On the other side, the Supreme-beings at the eighth level were also going crazy. They were charging towards another eighth level venerable sovereign. They were surrounded by eighth level venerable sovereigns, but no one dared to stop them. Even the few eighth level Supreme-beings in front of the frost monarch avoided them subconsciously.

Chapter 3515 Devil, Saint!
Avoid the blade!Extreme frost Thearch was unable to breathe. At this moment, he was in despair. He wanted to roar in anger. It wasn't me ... I'm not the mastermind!……Li Hao was shocked by the madness on the other side.He suddenly turned his head and looked at Thunderlord and the others ... The three rank-8s had very stiff expressions. To be honest, they knew that such a battle technique was simple and easy to understand. They could understand it with one look. Furthermore, generally speaking, the effect would definitely be good.In fact, anyone would understand and know how to do it.But ... Seriously, don't joke around. At the seventh or eighth level, they could explode and die as they wished. They just focused on one party. This style ... Even if they wanted to learn, it would be difficult.He really didn't dare to learn!At this moment, Li Hao seemed to have understood something. He stared at the Samsara Emperor and sneered.The human King ... Was really something.I've learned!I might lose my studies, but I know what to do.The old senior had a personality."The heavens and earth are overturned!""Die!" A soft cry shook the heavens and earth. The rank eight venerable sovereigns on the other side trembled. Under such circumstances, the two rank eight venerable sovereigns behind Samsara suddenly seemed to be flipped over.In just an instant, the two of them suddenly landed behind Li Hao. Li Hao, with his sword in hand, was fighting one against five. At this moment, the ground was like a prison, and a wall of the great path rose around him!"Kill them!" Li Hao shouted angrily,"you guys, kill them!" For those who have died once, they should stop!"Earth overturning sword!At this moment, the earth overturning sword appeared. Li Hao transformed into his Dao domain and blocked the path in front of him. As for the Samsara Emperor, he came back to his senses in an instant. His expression changed drastically as he roared,"Break the wall of beds!"He instantly made his move and attacked crazily!Li Hao was going to kill the remaining two emperors of Samsara.At this time, the three level eight venerable sovereigns and the six Level Seven venerable sovereigns were shocked to see two level eight venerable sovereigns suddenly appear in front of them. The next moment ... The Thunder monarch's expression changed."Kill them, kill them. We can't let them look down on us!"BOOM!Countless Thunderbolts erupted. Li Hao was actually going to fight against the five experts alone and stop them so that they could buy time to kill the two rank eight venerable sovereigns and weaken the power of the entire Samsara realm.It was obvious that he had learned this move from new martial arts.Just like how the human King specialized in dealing with Extreme Ice, these people had only joined forces temporarily. After killing two of the Samsara venerable sovereigns, the other venerable sovereigns might not have risked their lives to save them.This was the human heart!The premise was that they had to be fast. They had to kill the two of them before Li Hao was defeated. The two eighth rank venerable sovereigns also knew about this. At this moment, the two venerable sovereigns, who had died once, turned pale. The next moment, they roared. Life and death emerged, and countless spirits appeared, covering the sky. They were killed by the Thunderbolts."Hold on for an instant!"The calm reincarnation Emperor was no longer calm. He roared,""Last for an instant ... Li Hao won't be able to block it ..."No matter how strong Li Hao was now, he couldn't resist the joint attack of five great experts.As long as they could hold on, they would be able to destroy Li Hao's Earthcover sword defense.The millstone of life and death appeared!At this moment, the Samsara Emperor didn't dare to hold back anymore. He summoned the life and death millstone and smashed it down on Li Hao's wall of Dao without using any means!The powerful Dao law power caused the entire Dao domain to explode into small worlds.In the thousands of small worlds, some spiritual bodies exploded, but Li Hao couldn't care about that. He had fought five people alone, and he had already overexerted himself to stop them.Peng Cheng turned into a kun Peng and charged forward. His strength caused some of the small worlds to shake.The Earth Spirit also roared in anger. Countless mountains appeared in its hands and it smashed down madly.The Dao domain trembled violently.Although Li Hao was strong at the moment, he was not strong enough to fight five people at once. The power of nearly 6000 Dao laws was very strong, but the entire Dao domain was still collapsing and showing signs of instant collapse.​ Three rank eights and six rank eights surrounded two rank eights, but the two were focused on defense and did not resist. They only wanted to protect themselves for a while. In a short time, they could not see any hope of killing them.Thunderlord and the others 'expressions changed.Whoever broke through the defense first would be the winner. The three of them, together with myriad transformations, were unable to break through the defense quickly ... If Li Hao's defense was broken first ... They might be defeated.Learn new martial arts?In an instant, this thought emerged. Self-destruct?The self-destruction of one rank eight was enough to break through the defense of two rank eight experts, but ...Yes, it was really difficult for them to make such a decision.Even if they really trusted Li Hao, at this moment, that was how the human heart was. It required long-term cooperation, which was too difficult.At this moment, the Silver Moon martial masters in Li Hao's Dao domain were all anxious.In an instant, someone looked at the Queen of a star.The Queen's expression changed.

The moment this person walked out, he didn't go to the back to join the battle. The person who walked out was actually the path master, Hong Yitang.Hong Yitang was extremely fast and instantly merged into Li Hao's River of Dao.Before anyone could come back to their senses, Hong Yitang fumbled in the river for a while. In an instant, a small Golden Ball appeared in his hand. The Queen's expression changed slightly. It was ... The way of faith. On that day, countless humans suddenly erupted with the power of faith. She couldn't withstand it and lost all of them to Li Hao.

Chapter 3516 Devil, Saint!
Li Hao, who was unwilling to accept it, suppressed it in the depths of the river.At this moment, Hong Yitang grabbed it and swallowed it.He was usually quiet and low-key. Even the master of the Dao had never considered himself a Dao master. In his eyes, his long river of Dao had been given to him by Li Hao, not by him. Everything had been given to him by Li Hao.His personality was actually quite calm, and he wasn't as competitive as the other Silver Moon martial masters.Even at the peak of the sixth step, he didn't feel that his talent was top-notch.His wife and daughter became emperors one after another, and he was even more indifferent to them, almost having no objections.But now, Qian Wuliang was even more active and enthusiastic than him. On the contrary, he had retreated behind the scenes and rarely expressed his opinion.At this moment, he broke away from the river of Dao and cut off one part of the river of Dao in the Silvermoon universe. In just a second, the river of Dao merged with Qian Wuliang, and his face changed dramatically!What was he doing?Are you trying to kill me?How would I dare to fuse two Dao universes!Hong Yitang's body instantly exploded with a Bright power of faith. It was extremely strong-protection and responsibility!It was the purest desire and desire of hundreds of billions of humans.At this moment, he was like the sun, exuding an incomparably bright light. In just an instant, he fell into the battle behind him. His expression was calm and had a hint of serenity.Standing aloof from worldly affairs had always been his belief.However ... The capable should do more work and help the world. This was also a principle that he had always believed in. If he had the ability, what was wrong with helping the human race?In the early years, he had been taking in orphans and had been doing it. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Today, countless power of faith had been integrated into his body. The repelling force was not strong, and there was no repulsion at all. Protecting the human race was a heavy responsibility, and it was not something he, a sixth rank venerable sovereign, could bear.But at this moment ... He still accepted it.He looked into the distance, at the neo martial artists ... All neo martial artists were willing to die to help the human King, create the best opportunity, and pave the way for the human King. I, Silver Moon ... Although I'm also very United, there are very few people who can bring Li Hao that kind of help.Only silver Moon continued to suck Li Hao's blood."I have a wish, for the human race to prosper forever ...""My wish is too big ... I only wish ... For the Silver Moon to live forever!"This was his heart.The ball of light fell into the battle. Under the shocked gazes of several level eights, an extremely bright great Dao appeared. It was not a great Dao of light, but ... Responsibility!All the great DAOs that got close to it were instantly assimilated.Billions of humans, trillions of humans, seemed to appear behind him. At this moment, they were worshiping the heavens. The two eighth level Samsara realm venerable sovereigns were still defending. Hong Yitang, who had appeared out of nowhere, was nothing in their eyes. It didn't matter even if he had broken through to the seventh level at that moment.However, in the next second, that special and terrifying great Dao began to spread. The two rank eight venerable sovereigns 'great Dao of life and death seemed to have been instantly spread. In just an instant, their expressions seemed to change.At that moment, a thought appeared in his mind ... I shouldn't have killed him. This man is the human Emperor?The human Emperor?What human Emperor?The two level eights struggled. What a joke. There was no human Emperor in the chaos. Even if it was a human King, it was only a self-titled human King. The human King of neo martial, not the human King of the human race!This sudden change created an opening for the two tier 8 experts. A crack appeared in the great Dao. The Thunder Emperor and the other experts saw an opportunity in an instant. It was a very obvious opening.Hong Yitang actually ... Actually broke through the defense of two tier 8 experts in an instant.How was that possible?'This ... This is impossible!At this moment, Hong Yitang was like a Saint who had descended to the world. He even gave up his status as the path master to help Qian Wuliang. Even though Qian Wuliang knew that if he merged with this path, he might not die, but in this life ... He might have to bear a huge responsibility!So what?Compared to neo martial ... I, Silver Moon, don't seem to have paid enough. Compared to those powerhouses who went through fire and water for the human King, I, Silver Moon, seem to only be a burden.It wasn't like this!"The sword of the Holy path!"The sword was like the sword of a Holy King, infused with the faith of the trillions of humans. The sword slashed out toward the two type 8 powerhouses. At this moment, it was as if countless humans were chanting,""The glorious human race will prosper forever!"The sword intent shone into the chaos, illuminating the darkness.The sword was not meant to kill, but to calm everything and to calm the evil thoughts. The two eighth rank venerable sovereigns were dazed for a moment. They could not kill the man in front of them.He was the Emperor ... The human Emperor ... The human Emperor acknowledged by trillions of humans ... Heaven and earth would not tolerate him being killed! The next moment, the two rank eights woke up.However, at this moment, their expressions changed drastically. At this moment, the three level 8 martial artists finally broke through their defenses completely. The Thunder monarch and the others were also anxious and crazy. BOOM!Countless Thunder emperors appeared and blood flowed from the fingers of the mist Mountain Thearch. It was as if something had been broken, causing the two rank eights to fall into darkness. The chess pieces covered the sky and space shuttled. In an instant, they were penetrated.The attacks from the venerable sovereigns of myriad transformations were the last to arrive.In an instant, there was a loud bang!The two level 8 martial artists were instantly destroyed. Even at this moment, the two illusionary figures were still looking at Hong Yitang and murmuring,""There's ... A Human Sovereign realm warrior in the chaos?"

How could that be possible?'What ... What is this?'BOOM!With a loud noise, Li Hao retreated, shaking the world and cutting off the flow of the river. At this moment, the Samsara Emperor had broken Li Hao's seal as fast as he could, but his expression changed in an instant.He had a complicated look in his eyes. At this moment, he couldn't hold it in anymore and roared,""Damn it, bastard, why?"Was the heavens against him?He was always a step too slow.Why ... Why would such a special great Dao appear?It was as if the Emperor had descended to the mortal world!Expelling the darkness triggered the resonance of countless humans, instantly assimilating the Dao of the two rank eight venerable sovereigns. Their defenses were broken, and they were killed on the spot. He roared,""Is this the way of the human Emperor? We, the reincarnation monarchs, are not human? What a laughable great Dao, shameless!"He roared!He really couldn't take it anymore. He was extremely angry.Where did this great Dao come from? Why would it appear here, on the body of a sixth stage venerable sovereign?A sixth-tier Human Sovereign realm warrior, even if he had reached the seventh-tier now, wouldn't he be laughed at if word got out?It was only for an instant!Feng Ming had died first, followed by the death of two Samsara realm level eight experts, and even before that, Fu Sheng and the others had died one after another ... Was the chaos really going to change?At this moment, the reincarnation Emperor was filled with despair.Even though he had broken through Li Hao's defense, he was in despair. No matter how well-prepared he was, it seemed that he would always be full of surprises. Who would have thought that a freak would appear?And Li Hao only had the time and mood to turn his head to look at it ...After taking a look, his expression changed.He did not know ... What to say.He didn't like this great Dao at all, and he had never let anyone touch it. He felt that no one could accept this Dao, and they shouldn't accept this Dao. This was a road of no return!Perhaps, this great path should be buried in the depths of the long river, and no longer need to surface in the human world.It was said to be faith, responsibility, and the human Emperor, but in fact, it was a great Dao of puppets. The puppets raised by the human race, the puppets who believed in absolute justice and absolute protection.But at this moment, he couldn't care about this.The death of two rank eights was a great joy for Li Hao.Eight grade 8s attacked, and three of them died in an instant. Even he didn't expect such a result to be so fast.At this moment, the Samsara Emperor coughed as well. The great Dao was in turmoil. For a moment, he was in a daze. The three rank eights had been killed once before. He had spent a lot of effort to resurrect them, and even paid a huge price to join huntian.However, they were killed again in such a short time. This time...It would be difficult to resurrect them.Why?In the end, it was all for nothing? He was a little dazed.He was dazed, but Li Hao wasn 't. With a shout, his Tao domain disappeared and the myriad worlds condensed, as if they had turned into time stars again, but not completely the same. Behind him, the expressions of several level 8s changed drastically!"Come back!" The Earth Spirit monarch roared."Come back!"Samsara had actually lost focus for a short while. This was unbelievable for a rank eight Supreme Emperor. However, the continuous losses had indeed filled the Samsara Supreme Emperor with frustration and despair.This time, in order to kill Li Hao, he had gone to various places, persuaded many experts, and still failed?Why?One had to know that Li Hao had only been at the seventh step before!Sovereign Pengcheng turned into a kun Peng and charged toward Samsara. The Earth Spirit sovereign and the others also unleashed their full power. Mountains surrounded them, not giving Li Hao a chance to kill Samsara.Samsara was the strongest. Once Samsara was killed ... It would be a complete defeat!The deaths of the two level-eights in the realm caused some fluctuations in his great Dao universe. In addition, his mind was shaken, making him even more dangerous.However, Li Hao wasn't here to deal with Samsara. Samsara was very strong. Even if they were interrupted, they wouldn't be killed so easily. Li Hao suddenly laughed.The power of ten thousand worlds emerged, but it did not transform into time ...Li Hao didn't understand the way of time. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Yes, even now, he still didn't quite understand.But he ... Had seen another Dao, and had even personally fused it into his body. He had felt it very clearly.It was just that he didn't have that many Dao laws to try out this Dao.The Dao of tribulation lightning, the Dao of tribulation.In the illusionary infinite worlds, more than 9000 great DAOs suddenly changed and formed a combination. The entire chaotic region and the distant thunder region suddenly became violent.The power of the God tribulation lightning suddenly disappeared.In an instant, a flash of lightning appeared on Li Hao's sword.In the distant depths, a statue's eyes instantly widened. The next moment, it cursed,""You stole my Dao, you shameless villain ..."At that moment, the power of some special great DAOs among the countless Dao laws outside the statue was lost.It followed the chaos and disappeared.And Li Hao's sword emitted an extremely powerful tribulation lightning energy.In the distance, Supreme Emperor Phoenix Flame suddenly felt a splitting headache. At this moment, she saw countless lightning tribulations appearing in front of her eyes, as if they were going to strike her to death!Long Zhan's expression changed slightly. One punch, one punch towards the sky, he shouted coldly,""Li Hao!"Li Hao had actually ... Attacked Feng Yan!What was he thinking?Was he crazy?The battle between him and Samsara hadn't been decided yet. Li Hao was already rejoicing that he didn't interfere. Yet, he ... Took the initiative to summon the Tribulation lightning to strike the Phoenix Flame, who was somewhat related to him.

What was he trying to do?Even the reincarnation Emperor was startled. He turned around in surprise. Li Hao, are you too proud?You ... Took the initiative to attack the Dragon battle's side!To attack Feng Yan with the power of the lightning tribulation was to attack long Zhan. Even if he was unwilling, he would still attack.  n0vel online free at 𝓷0𝓿𝓮𝓵𝓫𝓲𝓷 Li Hao didn't care about that. Countless lightning bolts appeared!He seemed to have turned into a giant of Thunder tribulation. The Thunder tribulation flashed on the long sword and connected with the Phoenix Flame in the distance. The venerable sovereigns around the Phoenix Flame seemed to be affected. The Thunder tribulation kept emerging and even started to fall.Long Zhan was furious. He punched out. His fist was like a dragon, shattering the void!Li Hao, you're courting death!He no longer watched the show. At this moment, he stepped forward and was about to beat Li Hao to death. Originally, he didn't plan to do this. After all, Li Hao could still be a barrier for the East.But now, he could not tolerate it anymore.His daughter's original plan was to have her kill Li Hao, but Li Hao had taken advantage of her.At this moment, he didn't care about anything else!However, at this moment, a word appeared in Li Hao's hand:Li Hao chuckled, and the huge word 'calamity' suddenly flew into the distant void, penetrated the universe, and landed in the lightning territory.At this moment, countless lightning tribulations seemed to have gone crazy and exploded. The entire lightning territory was in an uproar!Countless Thunder Giants seemed to have gone crazy at this moment. They instantly charged into the four-direction domain and chased after the 'calamity' word.Long Zhan was still stepping on air. He suddenly turned his head, and his expression changed instantly. Suddenly, his face turned cold as he looked at Li Hao. His gaze changed. He gritted his teeth and said in a deep voice,""You ... You're crazy!"Li Hao was too ruthless!Li Hao, on the other hand, said coldly,"go back and defend the square domain. Otherwise ... You'll probably lose all your clansmen and the square domain will be buried with me. I ... Am not a Saint!"Long Zhan's expression changed again and again. In the next moment, he gritted his teeth and roared. The roar reverberated through the heavens!In an instant, he covered the Phoenix Flame with one hand, and countless lightning bolts fell into his hand. He roared,""Let's go back!" BOOM!The void trembled as if it was about to shatter. Long Zhan turned into a huge Dragon and instantly shot towards the four-sided domain.Li Hao ... Triggered the lightning tribulation just to condense a piece of divine text to fall into the square domain and turn it into a lightning domain. Could the square domain stop it?Since they were not here, they obviously could not.At that time, the people would be plunged into misery and suffering!More importantly, countless members of the chaos race would be buried there. Of course, there would be countless humans as well!Li Hao was too ruthless!He wasn't a Saint or a Savior. He was a demon!In order to eliminate interference, he actually triggered the lightning tribulation to destroy the entire square region, not to deal with reincarnation ...'Damn it!'At this moment, only by returning and using the Phoenix Flame to attract the lightning tribulation and the divine text of the word "tribulation" could they restore peace to the Thunder region. This sudden change caught everyone off guard.Obviously, Li Hao had never treated them as life-saving straws from the very beginning. Instead, he had always treated them as enemies and forced them to return while they were still in a gap.Long Zhan's furious voice reverberated over from far away,""Li Hao, you've ruined the plan of a level 9, attracted the lightning tribulation, and even ignored the lives of countless living beings ... You'll be punished!"Li Hao's face was calm."If I die, who will cry for me? Long Zhan, I'm not the human Emperor, I'm not the human King, I'm ... Li Hao! So what if the common people died? If I want to help the weak, I'll have to wait until I have the ability. If I don't have the ability ... Then ... You'll be buried with me!"The surroundings were silent, and the sky was silent.At this moment, the reincarnation Emperor suddenly burst into laughter. He pointed at Li Hao and Hong Yitang and laughed wildly!One was a demon.One was a Saint!Here, they were actually fighting together ... What a joke!

Chapter 3519 Dao War, Dao Perishing, Death Of Samsara!
Li Hao was extremely calm at the moment.He didn't like to deal with anything before the battle. It was very uncertain who long Zhan would help. Staying behind would be the greatest unstable factor. Since that was the case ... This person had the heart to achieve hegemony and wanted to lead the chaos race to change their fate and become the chaos Overlord!Since that was the case, he would definitely return to defend.He would not let the four-sided domain be destroyed by the Thunder domain.This was the human heart.Killing Li Hao and killing reincarnation couldn't compare to the countless chaos creatures in the four-sided domain. Now, a large number of chaos beasts had entered the four-sided domain. It could be said that the four-sided domain had been destroyed, and the number of chaos creatures had been reduced by 90%.Even if long Zhan was heaven-defying and could change one's fate, whose fate would he change if the entire chaos race was gone?At this moment, in the distance, the human King sent the extreme frost Thearch flying with a single slash. He laughed and his laughter resounded in all directions,""Ruthless enough! Li Hao, you brat ... You're really ruthless!"He was truly ruthless.A dog that bites doesn't bark. This was the human King's impression of Li Hao. He knew that Li Hao was heartless, but he didn't expect that Li Hao was so vicious that he gambled with countless worlds, countless humans, and countless creatures in a realm!Wagering that dragon battle would return to defend.This was Li Hao.Once long Zhan didn't care ... Then the four directions would be destroyed by the lightning tribulation. Those tier 7 humans wouldn't even have time to escape. Who would go against the lightning tribulation for the four-direction region?Moreover, it was the lightning tribulation of the entire lightning territory.It was too terrifying!Samsara Emperor was still laughing. Li Hao just looked at him silently. At this moment, the surrounding Dao domain appeared again. He looked at Samsara and the others."You ... Do you still think you have a chance?"The reincarnation Emperor stopped laughing.Did he still have a chance?At this moment, there were still a few tier 8 and tier 7 experts around him. Were there any more?There were!However, the chance was not great. Now, long Zhan was also forced to return to the four-square region by Li Hao's vicious plan. By the time long Zhan finished dealing with the lightning tribulation, the battle would probably be over.Although there were many venerable sovereigns on the human King side, once Extreme Ice died, they would definitely collapse!Even though everyone knew that they shouldn't collapse, who would want to die when they reached the eighth rank?With Extreme Ice dead, even a dozen level eights would be useless.It would definitely collapse!Samsara turned back to look at the West. Chaos heaven, spring and autumn, five elements, these overlords didn't appear. They should have known, but they didn't appear. What did this mean?He felt that these people didn't need to worry, that was impossible. If he really didn't care, why would he send people over?Or was it that ... The East was not a place they could easily come to?There was a heavenly square here, a lightning territory here, and many things here. Perhaps ... It was related to tier 9. Were these existences afraid to come here rashly because they were afraid of triggering something? At this moment, Pengcheng's voice rang in his ears,""Samsara ... Let's retreat!"The kun Peng seemed to have retreated at this moment.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Retreat!Feng Ming was dead, the two Samsara emperors were dead, chaos heaven still had three rank eights here, plus the Earth Spirit ... The Earth Spirit clearly felt that its chances were not great, it might as well retreat.In this battle, Li Hao had already broken the stalemate.It was clear that the heavenly Daoist sect could be established. It would be difficult to organize such a force again. Each party still needed to hold the fort in their own territory. Now, the chaos was not unified. The so-called Overlord had yet to take down all the worlds in the region.If they were to act rashly, it was very easy for unforeseen circumstances to occur.In the eastern battlefield, many level eight venerable sovereigns had died."Retreat?"The reincarnation Emperor laughed.To the West?Would Li Hao let him go?Even if he did ... The three level 8s had completely fallen and could no longer be resurrected. Last time, a group of Level 7s had died. This time, the dream of becoming an Overlord was completely shattered.Huntian treated him as a slave. Going to the West to be huntian's slave, was he the same as this guy?This time, since he had already started, he had no intention of retreating.Whether he lived or died ... As the strongest Man in the East, he would not leave again.At that moment, he suppressed the fluctuations of the great path.He looked at Li Hao and took a deep breath. With the millstone above his head, the path of life and death was activated. He looked at Li Hao and laughed."Silver Moon King, you and I don't have much enmity between us ... Of course, there's no point in bringing this up today!""Since things have come to this, the hegemony has come to an end. There's no hope for me to become a grade-9 ... I want to see time!"He laughed."I know of life and death. Li Hao, will you enter the gate of life and death and have a fight with me? What do you think about a battle without anyone else?"Li Hao was a little surprised.He looked at Samsara, then at the people behind them. Some of them were already backing out, and he laughed."Reincarnation, the Dao of life and death. I've also dabbled in it and know how powerful life and death are ... Now that you've retreated, I have no intention of chasing you ..."Of course, it might not be able to kill Samsara.After all, they still had a number of eighth and seventh ranks, and their strength was quite formidable.Getting rid of long Zhan could only be said to give both sides more room to perform. It did not mean that Li Hao had them in the palm of his hand. Moreover, using big moves in succession was actually very exhausting.In the river, the world trembled a little.If this continued, he might not be able to maintain it for long.If Samsara really did run, Li Hao might not chase them. Every failure was a blow to these people. One failure after another, and one tier 8 player after another died. It might be better to weaken them bit by bit.He killed a few at a time, a few at a time ... By now, a large number of grade-8 cultivators had already fallen here.
