The next moment, Li Hao's face appeared in the sky.Everyone was excited to see Li Hao.Marchioness Silvermoon!But now, the worship and faith of billions of people toward Li Hao had exceeded a limit. If Li Hao had built a temple, people would have worshiped him very soon.A new god would be born.In fact, there were people who worshipped Li Hao in private. In everyone's eyes, he was no different from a God, or even more powerful, and more like a real God!"I'm Li Hao!"It was his usual opening speech.At this moment, Li Hao was still gentle, elegant, and calm."Citizens of Heavenly Star, I shouldn't be taking up your time. What I'm about to say might not have much to do with you ..."At this moment, everyone was even more curious.What was it?……Heavenly Star City.At this moment, everyone was also looking at the sky screen. They were somewhat curious. Did something big happen in the past two days?Why did Li Hao open the sky screen?While he was thinking, Li Hao continued,""It's a private matter ... But it's also business. "Li Hao smiled."The world is recovering on the bright star continent. Of the four nations, only the Li Dynasty is independent. But there are still powerful enemies!" Not only within this world, but outside this world, there are also powerful enemies ... The day before yesterday, I, tu Hedao, have dozens of them ... They are powerful enemies!""However, my injuries are not light. I'm afraid I'll need to go into closed-door cultivation for a while."For a time, many people around the world looked worried.He was injured?He had killed dozens of Dao integration experts?Oh my God!Where did so many Dao integration experts come from?"Martial arts have been passed down for countless years. These strong enemies are all traitors who betrayed the new martial era a hundred thousand years ago, which is the previous great glorious era! After cultivating for a hundred thousand years, of course they're very powerful ... But that's not important. I'll deal with them!""A few days ago, the world erupted with energy. Even if I killed dozens of Dao integration stage super mighty figures, they would have been annihilated sooner or later. They're also resources for our cultivation. The more, the better. I was afraid that there would be too few of them for us to kill or cultivate!"The worried citizens were relieved to hear Li Hao's words.That was true."Lord Marquis is invincible in the world. All along the way, he has swept through everything. The nine divisions and the three major organizations have all been defeated by Lord Marquis. No matter how strong the enemy is, it doesn't seem to matter. Li Hao continued,'but this time, I'll need to go into seclusion for some time ... I don't know how long I'll need, because I need to be stronger! Only then can we better protect the bright star land!""But before that, I need to do something ..." He said. Li Hao was silent for a while, then smiled.""The people of the world should know Governor Lin Hongyu, right? It's the lady who often appeared in the sky before ..." Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Everyone was stunned. People from all over the place began to discuss in low voices. Of course, they knew each other.Lin Hongyu had been in the sky longer than Li Hao had.No one knew why the Marchioness of Silvermoon had mentioned Lin Hongyu."Lin Hongyu is now the new governor of the Heavenly Star military governor's office. She was originally the castellan of the city of supers. She once took the initiative to let a million supers join the bright star continent, contributing a great deal to the peaceful unification of the people of Heavenly Star!"……At this moment, people were discussing something from all directions.At this moment, director Zhao, Qian Wuliang, and the others all frowned.At this moment, he suddenly showed off his power to Lin Hongyu.Was this ... To give the other party greater authority?Of course, this was not a big deal.To director Zhao and the others, Lin Hongyu's authority was not low to begin with. She was the second Heavenly Star military governor after Li Hao and was in charge of the military governor's office. Almost half of the world's military forces were under the control of the military governor's office.Strictly speaking, he had more power than director Zhao and could be considered the number one person in the military.Some people were envious, such as Qian Wuliang and Chen Zhongtian.Was he ... Going to be promoted again?How could he be promoted?There's no promotion, right?Someone secretly glanced at Lin Hongyu. She was in the middle of a phase summary meeting. Halfway through the meeting, they found out that Li Hao had opened the sky screen. At this moment, Lin Hongyu, in green, was silently looking at the screen.On the screen, Li Hao chuckled and said,"my parents died early. My master in martial arts and learning ... Unfortunately passed away a few days ago. Perhaps he's in a deep sleep. Perhaps ... He's completely dead!" "In order to protect the world, in order to create peace, many people have actually died .... My master, the captain and the head of the Silver Moon division, the Big Brother who protected me, the seniors who took care of me, all of them died in battle ...."The world was quiet.Many people didn't know about this."There will always be sacrifices," Li Hao said softly."However, the ones who will be sacrificed are our family, friends, and elders. Perhaps it will be difficult for them to accept this.""I'm the only one left in the Li family!""The war is still continuing!""I don't know if I can bring everyone to welcome a greater light! "But I will always fight for my life. I will fight for a future for the heavenstar, for the world, for everyone, for the world, for the people! Our future generations can cultivate in peace, enjoy wealth and luxury, eat well and wear warm clothes, become the best of the best, have books to read, have more knowledge, satisfy material needs, and achieve spiritual satisfaction!""Maybe ... This is just a dream ... But people still need to have dreams in life! We have many enemies ... The traitors of neo martial, the powerhouses from foreign worlds, and even those venerable sovereigns and world Lords who claim to destroy the world and universe with one punch!"

"Heavenstar, in the vast universe, is just a small world ... Perhaps, you may not understand it today, but I believe that in the future, everyone will understand!"Li Hao said softly, I'm telling everyone that the war ... Is not over! Be prepared for danger in times of peace. I hope that everyone won't forget the sacrifices they made today, including those who died in battle! They might not have cared about this when they were alive, but I think ... Everyone should remember them!""And I ... Also announce something to everyone today ... I ... Will be marrying the Heavenly Star military governor, Lin Hongyu ..."BOOM!The world changed color!At this moment, the auras of countless people burst forth, shaking the world.Waves of powerful auras instantly went out of control in Sky Star City.Everyone was shocked!Everyone in the world was also stunned, but they didn't react as strongly as they did.Li Hao was as calm as ever. He chuckled and said, "There's no need to be surprised ... I hope that my descendants can live on this land with everyone. I hope that they can take on the heavy responsibility and protect this land for generations to come!" "While I'm in seclusion, I'm worried that something might happen to everyone ... So, for the time being, Lin Hongyu will be in charge of everything!""I believe that she has the ability to do everything well. Wait for me to come out of seclusion!""In the future, I think I might give her a grand wedding ... But I'm not sure now. It might take a long time ... From today on, Lin Hongyu will be my fiancée ..."……The star military governor's office.Everyone looked at Lin Hongyu in shock, astonishment, anger, frowning, disbelief ...Too many emotions were mixed in.Director Zhao also frowned and looked at her in disbelief.How did you do it?Lin Hongyu saw everyone looking at her and nodded slightly. She smiled slightly as if she was a little shy ... But no one would believe her. Everyone was shocked. How did she do it?Why would Li Hao publicly announce that he was going to marry Lin Hongyu?The two of them had interacted with each other a lot, but ... But he had never seen any private relationship between them.Of course, Li Hao didn't have many women around him.More importantly ... Li Hao was still very young and had yet to achieve anything. He seemed to have never considered the matters between men and women. All of this happened too suddenly!It wasn't impossible, but it was too sudden!Political marriage?Did Li Hao need it?They thought to themselves, but they were still at a loss.Li Hao's voice continued,""Lin Hongyu, the holder of the bright star token! Ling Zhi, as if I'm personally here! "I hope that the people of the world can understand and give more blessings. Today, the sky screen has been opened for this ..."The sky screen disappeared. The world was silent.The next moment, some wild shouts came from all directions.To the people of the world ... This was actually a joyous occasion, so they didn't think much about it.They were a perfect match. The Marquis was invincible and Governor Lin seemed to be a good man. He had once controlled the city of the supers with a million apostles and was of great benefit to the Marquis. Since that was the case ... What was there to worry about?It was just that the Marquis had said several times that he was going into seclusion, and everyone was slightly worried.In addition, many women were envious, jealous, and expectant ... In this era, a King like Li Hao didn't necessarily need a wife. Now that Li Hao was getting a wife, and the Marquis had a wife ... Didn't that mean that all the women in the world had a chance?All of a sudden, countless girls were moved.……However, the Heavenly Star military governor's office was frighteningly quiet.After a long time, Qian Wuliang's mouth twitched and he said,""Congratulations ... Governor!"For a moment, he did not know how to address her. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ At that moment, director Qi arrived with a token. He handed it to Lin Hongyu and said softly,""The Marquis has asked me to pass this token to Madam. In addition, the Marquis has already gone into seclusion and will not see anyone. He is preparing to recover his strength in preparation for the Sage's reappearance in a month!"He looked around and said,"before the Marquis went into seclusion, he asked me to tell everyone that everyone has their own duties. Normally, their rights and responsibilities will not change. However ... At a critical moment, the governor's office will take control of the world! Madam has the right to give orders and control everything ... I hope that everyone ... Can assist her well!"With that, he left.The crowd was silent for a while.After a long time, a series of not-so-uniform voices sounded,""We will obey Lord Marquis's orders! Congratulations Lord Marquis, congratulations Governor!"At this moment, he was not the only one with complicated feelings.Lin Hongyu's eyes were filled with complicated emotions.He had agreed ...He had made it public to the world!Unfortunately ... Even at this moment, Li Hao himself did not come. It was as if he was saying,"what you need is a name, then I'll give it to you!"Wasn't this what he wanted?But ... Why was it that at this moment, he felt a little unwilling?Li Hao ... In your eyes, you can even give away your wife so easily?Have you really become a heartless demon?Other than your parents, your brothers, your teacher ... You don't seem to be able to tolerate anyone else, do you?Did I ... Have too high of an expectation?All sorts of thoughts appeared in his mind. At this moment, those congratulatory words, those insincere ones, were a little harsh.Lin Hongyu gave a faint smile and said softly,""I still need the help of all my seniors and colleagues. Let's bring light to the bright star continent!"

"The Marquis ... The Marquis is in seclusion. Powerful enemies are waiting for him. We need everyone to work together to fight them!"As usual, Lin Hongyu continued to address him as "Lord Marquis." She smiled slightly."Everyone, Wuhao star! I hope that after the Marquis comes out of seclusion, he can see haoxing become more prosperous! From today on, I'll travel the haoxing continent in the name of the Marquis and pacify the world! Pacify the people of the great wilderness and water cloud, inspect the world, and reward the heroes of the land!""Director Zhao, director Wang, Secretary Chen, and the others, please come with me. There are now more than 100 provinces in the world. Within 20 days, we will complete the heavy task of patrolling the world! Let all the people of the world know of Lord Marquis's name and his contributions!"Everyone's expression changed slightly.Was this ... A display of sovereignty?You're still my fiancÃ©e!But ... It seemed that there was no way to refute it."Isn't that too rushed? to complete the important task of governing the world within 20 days ..."Lin Hongyu said softly,"I won't be in a rush. I'm familiar with some of the provinces in the central region. It's not a problem to patrol three to five provinces a day!" It's mainly to show off Lord Marquis's might, to show off Lord Marquis's name, and to help Lord Marquis Award meritorious services to various places!""There's also one more thing to do,"he added," build a temple for the Silver Moon heroes who died in battle!"Everyone was taken aback. Silver moon's group, who had been a little unhappy, was stunned.Lin Hongyu said softly,"Southern Fist, Minister hou, Captain Liu Long, professor Yuan Shuo, Minister Yao, Secretary Yu, senior thunderclap kick, senior golden spear ... These seniors have died in battle. They should be remembered by the world!""But ... Before ... Before, the Marquis said that he was just sleeping," Tian Jian said gloomily. "Will the temple ... Be ...""No, senior Tian Jian, you don't have to worry. This was my idea as well. In addition, it was also to make everyone believe in me and give birth to some power of belief. This will make it easier for the Marquis to find the Natal locations of the heroic souls of our seniors who have died in battle!"As soon as he said that, many people's eyes flickered.That's true!The reason why gods could be resurrected was because of their Natal stars."But ... This ... This temple, isn't it ... Isn't it to create a God? Lord Marquis doesn't want to see any more gods ...""It's not a God creation!"Lin Hongyu shook her head slightly and said,"this is the temple of merits!" It was not the temple! It's a temple for the heroes who died in battle. Not only those experts, but also the soldiers who died in battle will be included in the temple!""To enjoy the incense of the world is not a God. He is a hero, a hero who protects the world!""Today, I want the millions of superpowered construction soldiers to complete the construction of ten thousand temples within 20 days. I want the world to remember the names of these heroes, their contributions, and their names ..." p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Everyone thought about it and felt that this was a good thing!The war hadn't ended yet, and they shouldn't have built a temple of merits so quickly. No one dared to mention this in front of Li Hao. However, at this moment ... It seemed to be a good idea.The originally unhappy crowd suddenly felt that ... It was really not bad!Those who died in battle were all their friends. They died without a name, and no one knew about it. Everyone was very sad.But ... Now that he had built a temple for them and made the world remember them, it really ... Was a worthy death!"Then ... If we die in battle, can we enter the temple?" Tian Jian asked.At this moment, many people widened their eyes.Wasn't the Silver Moon Martial Master just asking for a name before and after death?To be able to enjoy the incense of ten thousand generations after death and be remembered by the world ... This life was not a loss!He suddenly felt that the woman in front of him understood them too well.Although Li Hao had once said that he would leave his name for all eternity, he had never done it. Everyone felt a little regretful, but they did not dare to say it out loud for fear of Li Hao getting angry, because he firmly believed that Yuan Shuo and the others were still alive.Now, this newly-promoted Marquis's wife had done this ... It was hard for everyone not to support her.Even if Li Hao isn't satisfied ... You can go find your wife!All of a sudden, the tense atmosphere relaxed. Even director Zhao said,""This can be done! I'm also very supportive of this! 20 days ... That's enough! These were all done by superpowers, so it wouldn't take too long to build a temple! It doesn't have to be too luxurious, as it doesn't suit our style. It's good to be simple and solemn. If we leave one day, we can enter the temple of merit, and it can be considered ... A good name!"Everyone nodded. This time, Lin Hongyu gained everyone's approval.Just based on this point ... For the other party to become the Marquis's wife ... It was up to him! In any case, if Li Hao were to get married, he would have to find a wife sooner or later. If he were to find someone he was completely unfamiliar with, or someone who had no ability at all and only knew how to interfere ... It would be more troublesome.Lin Hongyu was ambitious, but she was capable.Lin Hongyu smiled and nodded,"okay, we'll do it now!" Now that the world was at peace, he should quickly complete the construction of the temple while no one was causing trouble! In addition, in 20 days, I hope to be able to pray for all the heroes ... I hope that everyone in the world can follow us and pray for them!"At this moment, he did not mention anything about resurrection.Pray for blessings!She didn't ask him to attend the wedding or give him a surprise. It was too small a scale, and it wasn't a good thing for her or Li Hao. Instead, it would make her seem too selfish.She had only said that to Li Hao before.Now, to call upon the world in the name of a hero's blessing ... It was more majestic, more solemn, and easier to gain the recognition of the world.

As expected, no one objected to his words and they all nodded.Even Huang Yu, the commander-in-chief of the army, kept nodding his head and said,""After 20 days, the world will still be peaceful and healthy. If we pray for the heroes who died in battle, the soldiers in our Army will be more enthusiastic and have more morale! The Army will give full support ... But, won't it be too big a move? why don't we let the soldiers pray for blessings ..."Lin Hongyu shook her head and said,"no, no!" If we don't let them participate, they won't understand ... How much these heroes who died in battle deserve to be respected and loved ... I also hope that in the future, when we die in battle, we can enter the temple and the world will pray for us. Perhaps, the Marquis can find us and revive us so that we can fight the world again!"As soon as he said this, everyone nodded. For a moment, they really didn't care about the madam.Lin Hongyu valued the sacrifice of heroes so much ... She was worth it! Beside them, Qian Wuliang took a look at Lin Hongyu. Although he didn't know the details, he was still amazed by her good method.What a good method!The Silver Moon Martial Master was too straightforward. With just a few words and a simple operation, he dispelled all of his fears. This ... As expected, the city Lord of SuperPower City was still as good as ever!At this moment, some people were secretly amazed.Director Zhao and the others could tell that ... The Temple of Heroes might not be the key. They did not know the details, but Lin Hongyu was a woman with her own tricks.At this moment, both sides were in a rare moment of harmony. Even some small conflicts were left out.Lin Hongyu smiled."Then, everyone, please work hard for the time being. Calm the people and the world. Urge the construction of the Temple of Heroes to be completed. No one can be left out!" "When everything is in place ... We'll start to pray ... We'll first publicize this matter and even print it into a book to spread the heroic deeds of all of you! His outstanding contributions could not be forgotten! "Regarding the martial arts Academy and the literacy classes, I'll still have to trouble senior uncle Hong to focus on the recent heroic deeds and publicize them ..."Hong Yitang nodded.This was a big matter. He also hoped that Yuan Shuo and the others could be resurrected. If the blessing could really cause some fluctuations, the power of faith would appear, and the Natal star would be found ... That would be a good thing. He had no reason not to support it!For a time, everyone was happy and harmonious.Soldiers, martial masters, and scholars were all looking forward to it.Lin Hongyu heaved a sigh of relief.This was good!He looked at the crowd, smiled, and turned to look at a certain place. Did Li Hao ... Really go into seclusion?Or was he silently observing?It's too late for this guy to regret now!……At this moment, Li Hao was indeed observing ...   n0vel online free at 𝓷0𝓿𝓮𝓵𝓫𝓲𝓷 After a long time, he touched the Black Panther and said softly,""What a powerful woman! I knew that she had other ways, and she was just coveting my body. You see, there's no need to make it so complicated. A heroic temple could actually solve the problem, but in the end ..."Woof! Woof! Woof!The Black Panther cried out,"don't say anything!"If you don't want to, who can force you?It's obvious that you don't have much of an objection to this!How shameless!Li Hao laughed and touched the Black Panther again. "Let's just leave it at that. It's actually pretty good. This woman ... Is very powerful! I knew it before, but now that she has a name ... I think old Zhao and the others probably can't win against her. "Shaking his head, Li Hao laughed again. The next moment, he tore open the void and disappeared from the world."Heibao, let's get to work. 20 days, let's lay the foundation first. After 20 days ... We're going to take action!"Woof! Woof! Woof!"Trash who can't speak ... Be careful that I forget about dogs after I get married ...""Woof woof woof woof!"The Black Panther's voice was much more urgent. After a moment, the man and the dog disappeared from the world.……At this moment, the aftershock shook the world.In Hurricane city, Zheng Yu was stunned.Getting married at this time?Li Hao ... He really didn't play by the rules.What was he doing?Or ... Was it really for the sake of marriage?What a strange fellow!However, it was a good thing. He couldn't wait for Li Hao to get married and have children. After Yuan Shuo's death, this man had nothing to worry about and had gone crazy. Getting married now was a good thing for all his enemies!Lin Hongyu ... Couldn't die. It would be best if she gave birth to Li Hao's child. Otherwise, everyone would be forced to their deaths.

2234 Chapter 375
The universe of the great path.Li Hao was still looking for the two experts he had lost.The Redwood and the old turtle had yet to appear. He didn't know where she had run off to.If he didn't find these two, it wouldn't be easy to work.This place was densely covered in stars, so the two of them should have arrived very soon, unless they were thrown too far away. However, Li Hao tore apart the sky and earth, so he shouldn't be too far away from this place under normal circumstances.Did that mean that he had really lost these two saints?Wandering in the universe, Li Hao stepped into the dark Zone. The universe of the great path was too vast, and he had not explored many areas. Many places were dark, and he was mainly worried that he would go too far. If he rushed back, it might take a long time."Turtle guard!"Li Hao's voice reverberated between heaven and earth, shaking the universe.Why are these two running around?If they had remained where they were stuffed, Li Hao might have been able to find them when he returned. But now, he couldn't find them even after tearing open a space Channel.It was very strange!Li Hao continued to wander in the air, his body bursting with brilliant light like the sun and moon descending. This was also a direction for the two experts to move forward. He wondered how far away they were from him.Black Panther was a little bored. He'd been running around with Li Hao recently, but hadn't gotten any benefits. Instead, he was exhausted and looked pitiful. Thinking that he might have to help Li Hao with chores later, Black Panther lost all interest.At this moment, it didn't care if it couldn't find the old turtle and the others ... It didn't mind if they were lost. It could take a break.While it was thinking, Li Hao patted it. "You have a sharp nose. Are they nearby?"“……”I knew it!The Black Panther was helpless and its nose twitched. In fact, it had already smelled something, but it was too lazy to run.In his heart, he was also thinking that maybe later on, those two would appear on their own.But these two had not appeared yet ... Forget it, I'll just make a trip."Woof!"The Black Panther barked and wandered in the air. Li Hao quickly followed it and cursed in his heart. This dog is not a good thing. He had already smelled it, but he was still slacking off.If his teacher was around, he would have stewed this fellow long ago!A man and a dog quickly moved forward.He traveled through the void. There were some stars scattered in the universe. They were all very dim and seemed to be some Dao meridians that had not been opened.After wandering for a long time, there seemed to be some light in the distance.A moment later, Li Hao arrived at the light.At this moment, Li Hao saw the old turtle and the Redwood tree.However, it seemed a little unusual.The two of them seemed to have been confined by something at this moment. They even seemed to have turned into statues, standing in the void without moving.Li Hao immediately frowned. "Turtle Guardian?"He called out, but there was no response from a turtle and a tree not far away.Li Hao looked around and frowned again.Why so?There didn't seem to be anything special in this place.However, these two stood still, and there was a faint glow on their bodies.Li Hao's heart skipped a beat, but he didn't approach.He struck it from a distance.BOOM!The void trembled and a ripple spread out. These two were Saints while he was only at the seventh level of the sun Moon tier. For some reason, these two seemed to have been confined. He couldn't get close to them at will in case he fell into a trap.He felt that he had a good understanding of the great path universe and that there should not be any changes.But ... What if it was related to the void Dao universe?Also, he had not found Zhang an's Natal star. Who knew if there was anyone else in the world who was secretly cultivating a new Dao and hiding the great Dao star in the universe?The void fluctuated for a while.The ripples fluctuated.A moment later, as if something had been broken, the tree and the turtle came back to life. The branches of the Redwood trembled and swept in all directions. It was only when it sensed Li Hao's aura that it was startled.He hurriedly transformed into his human form and instantly appeared in front of Li Hao."When did Lord Marquis come?"The old turtle's eyes also flashed with suspicion.Li Hao frowned and looked around.""It's been two days. This place isn't far from the star River. The two of you seem to have been imprisoned and haven't returned. I came to find you. Did something happen?""Two days?"The two experts were stunned, and Hong Mu was extremely shocked.""We ... Just entered not long ago ..."What was going on?The old turtle suddenly said,"two days?" So fast! If Lord Marquis had not awakened us, perhaps ... We would have stayed even longer! Suki and I saw a rather special star ... With just a glance, it was as if we had fallen into the passage of time and were unable to extricate ourselves!"Li Hao was dazed. What and what?Stars?He looked around but didn't see any stars. Frowning slightly, he said,""Tell me in detail, what did you see?"The old turtle thought for a moment and said,"previously ... That day, we entered this place. The great Dao universe was sealed. Suddenly, a star appeared in front of us. It was very bright, like a star! We thought it was the Natal star of some expert, so we took a second look ... But when we woke up, Lord Marquis was right next to us. "At this moment, Hong Mu was also a little scared,""It's been two days ... I don't feel anything at all. I only feel that I'm still looking at the star. It's just a moment. How did it take me two days to turn my head?"  n0vel online free at 𝓷0𝓿𝓮𝓵𝓫𝓲𝓷 If Li Hao hadn't come ... Wouldn't they have been watching?He had been imprisoned here?Li Hao was also at a loss. He said solemnly,""You're saying that even though you were actually looking at this star just now, I appeared in an instant, right?"

2235 Chapter 375
"Yes, I am.""That star ... Is there anything special about it?"The old turtle thought for a moment, and the image of the star appeared in his mind. He was a little frightened, and after a long time, he said,""There's nothing special about it. It's just ... A little bright, and a little illusory, as if it doesn't exist in this world. It's like it's flowing ..."Hong Mu added,"if you ask me, time is like an arrow. A white stallion flies past a crack. That kind of awkwardness. Just one look at it feels like a thousand years.""Is it man-made?" Li Hao asked solemnly.The two of them were stunned.The old turtle shook his head and said,""I'm not sure! It's hard to judge. In our minds, we only took a glance ... Right, I ... I think that the star is half illusory and half real. It's a little strange ..."Li Hao's mind was full of thoughts.The White foal flew past the crack, half illusory and half real.The stars ... Were bright ...With just a glance, the two saints were trapped as if they had been sealed. If Li Hao hadn't been nearby, they might not have woken up for thousands of years.Was that even possible?The Natal star of a new Dao cultivator?Or ... Were they natural stars that existed in the Dao universe?Why would he suddenly see a special star?Li Hao couldn't understand."The real and the virtual ... The real and the virtual universe ... Could it be ... The place where the two universes are connected, which is the center of the universe mentioned by the power destroying sea?""But ... It's moving?"Li Hao was shocked!If it was as he had speculated, the center of the universe was actually moving and not a fixed location?And ... It seemed to be very dangerous.What was going on?Was this a good or bad thing? If that was the case ... It was difficult to connect the virtual and real universes. Even if li daoheng was on the other side, it would be difficult for him to come over. Similarly, it seemed difficult for him to go over.The two saints were already lost from just one look, so how could he be any better?"Don't ... Tell anyone about this!""Two days have passed," Li Hao said in a deep voice."If I don't come to call you, it'll either be ten thousand years in a single glance or I'll be imprisoned forever. Will my life be gone, or will I be eternal?"The two saints felt some lingering fear.At this moment, the old turtle was also experienced and knowledgeable, and he said in a deep voice,""This ... This might involve some concepts of time! Time is the most difficult thing to figure out in the world. No matter how magnificent you are, even if you become the master of the world ... In theory, you can live for countless years, but you will still die in the end!""Therefore, no matter how powerful an expert is, they will die eventually. They may be able to live for five million years, ten million years ... Or even to an unbelievable extent. However, as time passes, their lifespans will be washed away, and they will eventually die of old age ..." It was a little frightened."But ... Will this new Dao universe involve such an ability and nomological existence?" it asked."In the universe, time and space are chaotic, and time and space are very complicated ... When you take a step in the chaos, it may be a second, a year, or even ten years ... In the past, the human King almost lost himself in the chaos. After defeating the celestial Emperor and the world seed, he almost lost himself in the chaos. When he turned around again ... Several years had already passed."Just like earlier, they only felt like they had taken a glance at it ... In the end, it was gone in two days.He was lucky that he didn't fall into it.If he was unlucky and no one woke him up, the next time he woke up might be several years, or even decades, or longer.Li Hao kept raising his eyebrows.Looking around, he didn't see this star. It was illusionary and ten thousand years passed in a single glance. Could it be that the Dao of time really existed?Was that even possible?Life and death were impermanent, and time was merciless. This was the only complicated thing in the world. Life and death and time, the reversal of life and death, and the pursuit of time ...Whoever could compete with the speed of time flow, wouldn't that mean that they were completely immortal?I'm more eternal than time!Just one look at me and ten thousand years have passed.How terrifying!Li Hao's mind wandered for a moment, but he quickly said,'don't think about it, don't care! After all, it's a Dao universe, and there are some things that we don't understand. Right now, we don't have the strength to explore these things. "Shaking his head, Li Hao decided not to think about it.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  Of course, he kept this in mind.He looked at the two saints and said,""The two of you should leave as soon as possible. Now that the outer world can not accommodate Saints, I will send you to the ancient city! I can't stay in the Dao universe for long. "The two powerhouses didn't say anything else.However, they were a little afraid.They had thought that the universe of the great path was rare and ordinary, and that there was nothing to be afraid of. Li Hao had been walking here all this time, and they felt that they were Saints and posed no threat. They never thought that they would almost fall.Li Hao quickly left the place with the two of them.It was only when they returned to the Galaxy area and saw the familiar Galaxy that the two of them felt a little more at ease.There was some lingering fear.Li Hao didn't say anything. He quickly opened a cosmic passage and waited for a while. An ancient city appeared in front of him. It was heaven battling city. The ninth Division commander was in the city. Seeing the two saints return, he felt much more at ease.He was almost worried that the two of them wouldn't be able to come back!It was still alright!The two saints quickly entered the city.The ninth Division commander also said to Li Hao,""The four main cities have absorbed a lot of heaven and earth energy. The energy in the cities is still considered rich ..."

Chapter 2236 Merging One's Body Into The Dao (Happy New Year!)_3
"Let the demon-hunter guards move into a city!""Let's go!" Li Hao said."Let Lin Hongyu make arrangements for the remaining three main cities. Whoever is suitable to move in can do so!"The ninth Division commander nodded."Lin Hongyu ..." He said after a moment of hesitation."I'm going into seclusion. If you need to communicate with her about the world, just ask her. ""This ..."Before the ninth Division commander could say anything, Li Hao sealed the Dao universe and disappeared.The ninth Division commander felt helpless.Hong Mu was a little confused and could not help but ask,""Ninth master ... You were talking about Hong Yu ... What's wrong?"The ninth Division commander glanced at it. He didn't really like these guys."It's nothing," he said calmly."Li Hao announced to the public that he'll marry Lin Hongyu soon. That's all." n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  The Redwood was stunned for a moment.His heart was beating fast.Is that true?There was no warning!Why did such a sudden change happen?It felt its mouth go dry. Lin Hongyu was the person it had been supporting all this time. Why did she suddenly become like this?"Ninth master ... Are you joking?"The ninth Division commander was too lazy to say anything more. Although he was also very confused, the matter had already come to this. Strictly speaking, it was Li Hao's private matter, so he could not say anything more. Seeing Hong shanmu's disbelieving yet ecstatic look, he said calmly,""Fellow Daoist Shanqi, you've fallen too deep. If you lose in the future ... You'll have no way out!"It may not be a good thing for you."Oh?" Hong Mu suddenly laughed."Ninth Division commander, do you think that we still need a way out now that we've come this far?"Li Daozong had underestimated him!At this point, what was the path of retreat?The ninth Division commander didn't say anything else. Perhaps.To the Redwood, staking everything on one throw might be the right way. Heaven battling city instantly disappeared.Li Hao had gone to great lengths to move heaven battling city to the Dao universe, and not long ago, he had moved it out again. Now that the Dao universe could be opened, Li Hao wouldn't let heaven battling city enter the Dao universe again. It was a little strange.But he didn't say anything.The current Li Hao had many thoughts on his mind. He was no longer the little Invisible Man who needed their guidance and promotion when he first entered heaven battling city.Even though Li Hao was only at the seventh stage of the sun Moon tier ... The threat he posed was not any weaker than that of a Saint.Back when they attacked boundless city, Li Hao might not have been as strong as he was now.……In the Dao universe.Li Hao stood on the Galaxy and looked into the distance, frowning.The illusory star.The center of the universe?He didn't say much when the two saints were here. Now, there were only him and black Panther. Li Hao said softly,""Black Panther, what do you think is at the end of the universe? What was at the end of the great path? Among the DAOs of heaven and earth, which great Dao was the strongest? Is the master of the world stronger or the master of the great Dao?"The Black Panther was silent.I'm just a dog, a dog that's been following you all this time. You don't even know, and you're asking me?How could I know?"Moreover, I'm still a single dog, so I'm even more miserable. You said you'd give me the White Horse, but in the end, the will of chaos exploded, and the White Horse was gone. It's very miserable, okay?Li Hao didn't seem to expect it to answer.After a long time, he muttered to himself,"the great Dao is too complicated. I only understand a little bit of it now. It's a pity ... It's a pity that no one will discuss the Dao with me anymore. Everyone has their own thoughts. People like Zheng Yu and Ying Hongyue only pursue benefits and don't really discuss the Dao with me! When he was alive, he felt that I had already surpassed him, and that I didn't need his guidance. But after he left ... I felt ... Lonely!"He pointed at the star River and said softly,"the star River is still here. Now, only you and I can stay here!" The land of the Silver Moon was only a small world, but it had left behind countless problems ... He had to solve the problem of the Silver Moon as soon as possible! Although the time may not be the same, whether the new martial arts or the Crimson Moon world wins, maybe ... Silver Moon will face one of them!"He looked at Black Panther and said softly,"if Hongyue wins against new martial, then we'll fight Hongyue again!" If new martial arts Beat Red Moon ... What do you think I should do? Silvermoon originated from neo martial, and the ancient masters in heaven battling city also originated from neo martial. Am I, the Silvermoon Martial Master, going to hand over the New World? The neo martial human King was unparalleled in his overbearing manner. Was he going to take over a territory under his eyes? If it's you, would you agree?"He was thinking very far ahead, and he had even thought of the future.Black Panther had not thought so far ahead.Li Hao softly said,"I originally have no ambition, but ... I don't want Silver Moon to live under someone else's roof either. It's been 100000 years, and perhaps only a few years have passed on the other side, but Silver Moon has indeed cut off a lot of connections with neo martial. I have no intention of opposing neo martial, but ... If neo martial wants to take Silver Moon down, what should we do?""The Silver Moon originated from neo martial arts, and since venerable sword is in charge, neo martial arts has no objections, and I am in charge. Silver Moon and new martial might be able to attack each other. Even if I don't have such an intention, and the human King doesn't have such an intention ... But the relationship between the heaven and earth of the two sides may be destined to conflict!""Why do you think I want to sort out the great Dao universe? I want to study this chaos, this universe, this great Dao, this heaven and earth ... To prepare for the future. In fact, I don't have the heart to devour the Silvermoon. I think that if the neo martial art wins and the Silvermoon people are willing to leave with me, I will open a new world in the land of chaos!""The world is not the only one! Silver Moon was able to use some of the new martial arts 'energy to strengthen himself to this day ... Everyone wants to devour the world's will, and I ... Want to plant the seed of the world. It's just a world, and everyone wants to fight for it. If I lose my Dao heart ... It shouldn't be like this!"

2237 Chapter 375
Black Panther revealed a strange expression.This ... Isn't this too far away?Li Hao wasn't actually saying this to it, but to himself. He was telling himself that if neo martial won and encountered each other, and the other party wanted to take back silver Moon ... Then he would give it to them.This was because it was originally a new martial art."But I also need a piece of land to take those who are willing to leave with me.If the new martial artists were defeated ... And the Crimson Moon world attacked, Li Hao was willing to fight with all his might. Whether he won or lost, he had no fear!How could an outsider understand the myriad of thoughts in his heart?Whether it's Li daoheng or Zheng Yu, they only want to seize the small world ... But I don't have such intentions.What a pity ... Even if I tell others, who would believe me?Li Hao laughed at himself.He had great ambitions, but wasn't he still being controlled by others?"Time to work!""It's been a long time since I've gained any new understanding of the great Dao," Li Hao said with a smile."I hope I can gain some new insights this time!" n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  The Galaxy trembled.Countless stars trembled.Li Hao began to sort out the galaxy of stars again. This time, Li Hao didn't simply move them. Instead, he stripped off some of the power of the stars, bit by bit, very weakly.The power of the great DAOs of countless stars had been stripped away a little.He himself was also swallowing and spitting the power of the great Dao, gathering it here.He wanted to create a real river and place the stars in it like a long river. The stars would be embellishments, and the long river would be the foundation. If he hid the long river ... Even if a powerful enemy discovered it and broke into the universe of the great path, he would still have the power to fight.From this day on, Li Hao began his cultivation career.The power of countless stars surged into his body. Divine runes appeared again.However, this time, it was slightly different.The star River region was further divided into some unique divisions. A non-elemental Dao Meridian formed an aperture acupoint, and 360 non-elemental Dao meridians formed a sword.That's right, the Galaxy no longer revolved around the universe, but ... Transformed into a sword!The tip of the sword pointed to the end of the universe, boundless!The circular Galaxy was actually very good, but Li Hao had made some changes to it. With the 360 Dao meridians as the main, it formed a sword-shaped, circular Galaxy.As a result, the cycle continued.However, the River of Stars had transformed into a sword.The edge of the sword was the star region.In the center, there was an empty area. This blank area was prepared for Li Hao himself, as well as for the future when he would be able to connect to both sides of the universe.This was a huge project!The power of the great Dao surrounded the heaven and earth. As the sword-shaped River continued to form, the entire universe seemed to have changed again. It trembled slightly and seemed to be more stable than the circular River from before!This was because the 360 Dao meridians were a sword!When the area of 360 Dao meridians was re-organized and formed, the universe seemed to shake violently. At that moment, a kind of resonance force seemed to be produced and shook the universe!In the depths of the universe, the power of a great Dao suddenly swept over.It covered the entire Galaxy!Li Hao's face lit up!As expected, only when one was compatible with it would one truly succeed.Previously, it was only a forced fabrication and did not really fit this great Dao universe, but ... Li Hao mumbled,""Heaven's will is the sword, the heavenly Dao is the sword, the Dao Meridian is the sword, everything is the sword!""Sword Saint ... Is this all just a coincidence?"He mumbled to himself. The will of heaven and the Dao Meridian did not say anything. Now, even the long river of the great path had formed a sword and could obtain the recognition of the great path universe. The great path universe had not appeared back then.When Swordmaster left, the great path universe had not yet existed.Why ... Did even the great Dao universe acknowledge that the Galaxy was a sword that was more suitable for the great Dao!"Why?"Was it the influence of the sword Saint or something else?It was said that during the era of the neo martial artists 'human King, Sword Master was only at the third level of venerable sovereign. The first level was the master of the world, King Wang. The second level was Supreme, King of earth, heavenly dog, blood Emperor, and the others. The third level was people like Sword Master."Sword Master ... Can the experts at the third level influence the great path universe 100000 years later?"At this moment, Li Hao suddenly felt that venerable the sword ... Was not ordinary.This ancestor of his ... Maybe.Was he really just a third-level venerable sovereign?10,000 DAOs return to one ... It was said that those who walked a new path didn't even need to devour the Silver Moon. The Silver Moon was coveted by countless experts, and even if the human King offered to give it to him, he didn't want it.Such a powerful person ... Was he really the so-called one sword Hero?At this moment, Li Hao's interest was suddenly piqued. He mumbled,""Maybe ... The sword Saint didn't devour the Silver Moon because he felt that he didn't need to do this! It was said that the Li family was good at attacking and not good at fighting for a long time, but this was a sword venerable in the early stage of neo martial! Venerable the sword once went to another universe and was sent out by the other world Lord ... He didn't even take his sword with him. When he went to war, he was all alone ..."To a swordsman, it was very special that he didn't even take his sword with him.Either he didn't need it anymore, or ... He felt that the sword was restricting him instead.The great path universe trembled slightly.At this moment, many stars from all directions were attracted over. The sword-shaped Galaxy was even more attracted. There was a faint tremble, as if the heart of the universe was trembling.It seemed to have attracted countless stars.

Chapter 2238 Merging One's Body With The Dao (Happy New Year!)_5
While Li Hao was in a daze, his expression suddenly changed.In the distance, a star that was incomparably bright, half illusory and half real, seemed to be attracted as well. It was breaking through the boundary at an unbelievable speed, instantly crossing the world and flying over.Was the turtle protecting the star they saw?Li Hao was greatly shocked!He didn't dare to look.He was afraid that he would be caught up in it and take ten thousand years in a single glance. That would be troublesome!The star flew over instantly and landed on the Xinghe sword!It was as if he was looking down on the world, as if he was a living being. He was somewhat curious as he swept his gaze across the world, across the great sword. At this moment, all the stars seemed to have frozen in place, not moving at all.All the stars that were attracted to it seemed to have stopped moving.Li Hao's eyes were covered.The Black Panther beside him looked up at the sky in a daze. It was motionless, just like the two saints from before.Li Hao felt an invisible pressure!He was still awake!However, at this moment, the incomplete "Dao" character in his mind flickered with radiance. It was as if Li Hao was not affected because he had closed his eyes and was not looking at it, but because the character was protecting Li Hao, preventing him from falling into silence.Li Hao's heart moved.The Dao text that was formed by the universe had almost been completely shattered last time. He didn't expect it to have such an effect!In that case ... I ... Can I observe this star that suddenly flew over?Li Hao was very worried ... Very scared!However, since he was already here, he would not be satisfied if he did not take a look. Perhaps, this star was the center of the universe that he had been searching for. If a Dao seeker saw the great Dao, he would be afraid of danger ... What was the point of seeking the Dao?I have the 'Dao' text, which is a rare opportunity in the world. How can I give it up?At this moment, Li Hao opened his eyes.He saw it! n(0)velbIn[.]nEt It was a bright star, but it was illusory and real. It was like a heart, and it seemed to be breathing. Every move seemed to be connected to the entire universe. It seemed to like this sword very much. It circled on the Xinghe sword for a while.Time seemed to have stopped in front of it.The entire universe was so quiet that it was suffocating.Even the River of Stars stopped trembling.A special fluctuation spread between heaven and earth. Li Hao couldn't move his body, and even his thinking seemed to slow down. He could only look at the star in a daze. At this moment, he was looking at the illusionary side.He was suddenly stunned!There seemed to be countless stars on that illusionary side, and on the back of that star ... Was a feeling that was beyond reach."The heart of the great Dao!"Li Hao came to a realization. This ... Was the center of the Dao universe. Behind it was the void Dao universe, the Dao universe where the moon goddesses and the others were.There, he seemed to see a bright star.He seemed to see a bright moon!He seemed to see ... Another sword! It was like a swordsman. There, he had condensed his own spiritual sword and his Natal star."Li daoheng ..."As Li Hao thought about this, he suddenly closed his eyes and sensed everything in silence. He silently absorbed some extremely weak and special great DAOs to sense and experience the special fluctuations.The fluctuation of Dao!In her mind, her memories seemed to be a little chaotic and jumbled up. It was as if she suddenly saw her past self.It was a child ... And he seemed to see his old self, waiting for him in the future.Flowing time!Li Hao murmured in his heart, can time really be reversed?In the void, the star hovered for a while and seemed to have lost interest again. It was as if the Xinghe sword had only piqued its interest a little. It stayed for a moment, then flickered and disappeared.The world returned to its original state.The star continued to move.As for the Black Panther, it was just looking at it in a daze, as if it had entered a dormant period."Black Panther!"Li Hao shouted, and the Black Panther suddenly woke up. It glanced at Li Hao, confused. Why did he call for me?It was as if it had only been an instant!Li Hao's heart moved. How ... How long had it been? He felt that it would only be a short while ... But perhaps ... It would be more than a short while?In an instant, Li Hao disappeared.He reappeared in the Silver Moon world.He listened carefully ... And instantly heard countless voices. His expression changed slightly, and he muttered,""I felt like it was only a dozen seconds, but it's been seven days ... Unbelievable!"He was still conscious!In the end, seven days still passed. This was too terrifying.That star was too extraordinary.He entered the great path universe again, looked at Black Panther, and said softly,""The moment you were stunned ... Seven days have passed!"At this moment, Black Panther was truly stunned.Is this a joke?He didn't feel anything!Li Hao was also shocked. He took another look at Xinghe sword, and his eyes suddenly flickered. Unbelievable ... I only simply shifted into a sword, but it wasn't very stable. The moment that thing appeared, it seemed to help me stabilize this Fang Xinghe sword!"At this moment, Li Hao was suddenly excited, as if he had a new goal."Black Panther, if this planet becomes the core of my Galaxy ... Then ... Does that mean I can control time?"Black Panther shook his head, not understanding.It only knew that it had stopped for seven days in an instant. It suddenly felt very scared!Li Hao laughed. At this moment, a faint fluctuation suddenly spread out from his body. It was a very weak fluctuation, and it spread out through the divine character "Dao."

2239 Chapter 375
The Black Panther was a little dazed. It looked at Li Hao and then fell into a trance.This time, Li Hao didn't need to shout. After about seven or eight seconds, the Black Panther woke up and looked at Li Hao in confusion.Li Hao's eyes flickered."You ... Did you feel anything just now?"Heibao shook his head and was a little confused about his question."I just took a look at you, what feelings can I have?"Li Hao's heart was beating fast.He actually didn't feel anything!The Black Panther was only at the middle stage of the sun Moon realm, but it was frozen for seven to eight seconds just by looking at him. This ... Was unbelievable!He seemed to have touched the core of the entire Dao universe.Li Hao took a deep breath and smiled."This is interesting. The character 'Dao' is extraordinary! The Xinghe sword is also extraordinary. And the stars, the heart of the universe, the heart of the great Dao ... They are so interesting!"Li Hao was overjoyed!At that moment, he smiled. More than ten days had passed in the outside world. He had spent a few days before this. Now, it was not far from the time when Lin Hongyu and the others would launch their attack.Li Hao took a deep breath and said,"work!" Another star had joined in! He would make this Xinghe sword even stronger! Also ... I ... Might have to make some changes. Black Panther, watch me, in case I die Here!"Heibao was a little confused. What are you going to do this time?At this moment, Li Hao's body grew rapidly. A thousand meters, ten thousand meters, a hundred thousand meters ...It expanded in an inconceivable manner!The next moment, 360 Dao meridians appeared in his body.Most of his Dao meridians had not been activated.Only a small portion of the Dao meridians had been opened.At this moment, Li Hao took another deep breath, which swept across the world like a hurricane. Li Hao's voice was like a great Bell."I want to ... Enter the river with my body!"Before the Black Panther could understand what was going on, the gigantic Li Hao suddenly took a step forward and stood above the Galaxy. At this moment, he slowly lay down. The 360 Dao meridians in his body corresponded to the 360 regions in the entire Galaxy.A Dao Meridian corresponded to a region, regardless of whether it was activated or not.Some of the activated Dao meridians had fused with the Natal stars in the area.Li Hao slowly merged with it and mumbled,""I'm going to merge into this River and use my blood as the foundation! The Dao is me, I am the Dao ..."Woof! Woof! Woof!At this moment, Black Panther became extremely anxious!At this moment, Li Hao's physical body seemed to be melting as he merged with the Black Panther. The Black Panther was extremely nervous. What was he playing at? n(0)velbIn[.]nEt This was going too far!Using his body to merge with the Dao!Li Hao's voice rose again, Heibao, I want to fight again! He would be a gambler through and through! All DAOs gather in my body, my body becomes the heaven and earth, the great Dao is controlled by me, all living things are born for me!""If I don't do this ... How can I, Li Hao, surpass my predecessors?""Heibao ... I can win, right?""Woof!"The Black Panther roared a few times with some worry and nervousness.At that moment, giant Dragons appeared on the Galaxy Sword and quickly merged with the regions. The giant Dragons roared and some of the Dao meridians that hadn't been activated couldn't hold on and started to crack!How could it be so easy to merge with the heaven and earth without opening the Dao Meridian? As for Li Hao, he ignited the aperture acupoints on his Dao meridians, turning them into light spots that swallowed the heaven and earth!The word 'Dao' suddenly appeared.The next moment, the Holy prose disappeared and reappeared on Li Hao's forehead. In an instant, it turned into a red dot and was imprinted on Li Hao's forehead. At this moment, Li Hao looked more demonic and charming.Even so, his Dao meridians still showed signs of bursting.At this moment, a faint special fluctuation spread out of Li Hao's body. The power of his great Dao calmed down and gradually began to adapt to Li Hao's body.In the universe, at this moment, only a giant could be seen lying in the dark space.And beside him, there was only an extremely small dog.……In the outside world, all sorts of things were happening like a raging fire.However, at this moment, the world suddenly turned dark.Pure darkness!Countless people were suddenly terrified. It was still daytime just now, but in an instant, it had turned dark!Why?It was as if someone had devoured the world!At this moment, countless curtains appeared in the sky. Lin Hongyu's voice resounded through the heavens and earth."The Marquis is currently expelling the impurities of the world and purifying the environment. He needs some time, so everyone, please remain calm!"It was unbelievable!At this moment, everyone was a little shocked. This ... Could make the entire world instantly turn dark?Lord Marquis, have you reached this stage?,m He was too powerful!In the next moment, it turned into excitement, excitement, and agitation.The Marquis seemed to be getting stronger and stronger!Lin Hongyu and the others looked solemn. Many of them looked at Lin Hongyu. Lin Hongyu's expression did not change. "Don't be impatient. I need some time. It's not a purification. The Marquis is trying to capture the moon goddess herself. The Silver Moon has been covered ... It'll be fine in a while. "Is that true?Even though it was unbelievable, they didn't know why the sky had suddenly turned dark.Fortunately, the darkness did not last long.After about a minute, the world regained its brightness.……At this moment, Zheng Yu was frowning in Hurricane city.It was dark!The entire Silvermoon world suddenly turned dark for a minute. Why was this happening?It was a change that had never happened before!It was still daytime just now, but in the blink of an eye, it was dark."Damn it ... Why ... Do I feel like I'm losing control!"He mumbled. Beside him, new Dao Zheng Yu also said softly,""Losing control is still a small matter. I don't know if it was Li Hao or li daoheng who did it, but to be able to do this, it's even more troublesome than we thought! They might be doing something in the universe of the great path ..."
