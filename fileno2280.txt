A shrill scream reverberated in all directions.The blood-red Tree was in disbelief ...It had been a hundred thousand years!They had never been attacked before, and they had never experienced any battle. Just as Li Hao had said, they had long forgotten their fighting instincts.He was born in suffering and died in peace and happiness!This was the result of living in peace for a hundred thousand years!When the heart of life shattered, the tree of the Heavenly King was still a bit Dazed and Confused. As a Heavenly King ... It was a complete failure!The starry sky sword pierced through his opponent.In the next moment, Li Hao slashed his sword lightly and cut off the upper part of the tree at the waist.The Heavenly King Tree!A Heavenly King with extremely strong defense.However, at this moment, they seemed to be unable to resist Li Hao's sword, because these Heavenly Kings could only be considered fake Heavenly Kings.In addition, the starry sky sword was too sharp.The most crucial point was Li Hao himself.This original body was born from the Galaxy.He was truly powerful!In the Li Dynasty, it was Li Hao's clone ... In fact, it was hard to say who was the clone and who was the main body, but the physical body in front of him was indeed stronger!  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  That body had opened 99 meridians.This one didn't open a single vein."Because this true body is no longer just opening meridians, it is constantly absorbing the power of the River of Stars, absorbing the power of 10000 DAOs. In the true sense of the word, I am cultivating 10000 DAOs at the same time. My fleshly body has entered the Dao, and I am the Dao!Therefore, Li Hao slashed down with his sword, and the entire treetop fell.Li Hao reached out his hand and grabbed the tree crown. The tree crown disappeared, along with the 99 so-called sky fragrance fruits!The Heavenly King's fruit ... From new martial arts until now, there was probably only one tree that had it.Cat tree!The Imperial Guard's father had once swallowed a cat-like fruit. That tree was very, very strong, infinitely close to the level of venerable sovereigns. Its origin was not to be underestimated. In addition, there were many Heavenly King trees, but none of them bore fruit!p At this moment, it didn't matter if this guy was a fake Heavenly King or not. The fruit was definitely good.The first sword pierced through the heart of life, and the second sword cut off the tree crown.After two strikes, the entire ancient city was revived."Who is so bold?" an angry roar resounded through the heavens and earth.As soon as he finished speaking, many auras rose to the sky!Who dared to be so bold?How dare he attack the Heavenly King in the red moon's lair!At that moment, shadows appeared one after another. A book appeared and the book was flipped open. One after another, peerless experts walked out. They were all peak neo martial artists.There was more than one person! Some of them held long sabers, some of them had blood bows, some of them could break the sky with one hand, and some of them could split the soul with a long spear!The book of Dao!It was a book of the great path that Zhang ancai had forged from many of the strongest neo martial artists.The moment Li Hao made his move, the book of ways appeared. Zhang an walked between heaven and earth, and figures merged into his body. Not only that, but at this moment, a star seemed to flash and fall into the book of ways.New Dao, old Dao ... Zhang an had not completely abandoned the origin Dao of the neo martial art. Instead, he was trying to merge these two DAOs.The origin Dao and the bright star Dao had many similarities.At this moment, countless phantoms entered Zhang an's body one by one, and they even corresponded to each Dao Meridian. Zhang an and Li Hao's cultivation methods were slightly different. The saber-wielding human King Phantom entered the saber Meridian, the spear-wielding God-splitting Emperor entered the spear Meridian, and the bow-wielding blood Emperor entered the bow and arrow Meridian ...His path was completely different from Li Hao 's.It combined the strengths of both sides.At this moment, the aura in his body burst out instantly, and a monstrous force swept out. Zhang an held the book in his hand and suppressed the heaven and earth. A Heavenly King who had unleashed the power of the Crimson Moon roared in anger, but he was suppressed by a book!BOOM!At this moment, the swords, Spears, and halberds were like the attacks of human Kings or venerable sovereigns ...In an instant, the sky fell and the earth cracked!The Heavenly King was terrified and he screamed,""Zhang an?"What was Zhang an doing here?The Grandmaster's grandson!Supreme martial artist Zhang, one of the strongest neo martial artists, a true strongest powerhouse, the peerless powerhouse who helped the human King to reach the top of the world. In the past, he had made countless people tremble with fear!When the Crimson Moon great cosmos attacked new martial, Supreme martial artist Zhang was one of the top three targets to kill!This person was also the think tank of neo martial!At this moment, Zhang an did not move at all. He only glanced at Li Hao, and his expression changed slightly. At this moment, Li Hao also drew his sword. With a light sword, the tree of the Heavenly King, which barely managed to take human form, was split open with a loud bang!The giant tree that had transformed into the old man was filled with disbelief ... As it split open!At this moment, there were still three Heavenly Kings who had not been attacked.In an instant, the three Heavenly Kings charged at Li Hao.There was no other reason ... Zhang an made people a little afraid.The Grandmaster's grandson!As for Li Hao ... At this moment, they were not that terrifying. They would kill Li Hao first, then Zhang an!Zhang an's expression changed slightly. The book of Dao rumbled. He held a long spear in his hand and struck out. The spear instantly turned into a long saber. With another slash, it turned into a long bow in the blink of an eye. The bow shot an arrow ...It was ever-changing!The trapped Heavenly King screamed in agony. Crack, crack, crack ... Countless bloody wounds appeared on his body as he continued to scream.Zhang an's face was slightly pale.After all ... He could be considered a Heavenly King!If he wanted to kill Li Hao, he would need some tricks and effort. His expression changed. This is troublesome ... He might not be able to help Li Hao block the attack in time!He had originally thought that at least one or two of the remaining three Heavenly Kings would come to look for him.

In the end ... No.These cowards were so scared that they all went to find Li Hao.Zhang an cursed in his heart!This wasn't the result he wanted to see. With the book of Dao, even if another Heavenly King came, it wouldn't be so easy to break through his defense ... But he didn't even come!"Li Hao ...""Die!" He shouted. A long sword appeared in his hand and he stabbed it down. The book of Dao flickered with light and suppressed the man!Crack!The long sword pierced through the other party!With this sword, the other party instantly stopped screaming. The Heavenly King's body was directly split open, and an illusionary figure appeared. The moment it appeared, the book of Dao flashed with thousands of Thunderbolts. Boom, boom, it instantly exploded!Boom! Boom! Boom!In the blink of an eye, the illusionary figure shattered.A Heavenly King was killed instantly!Although he did not kill the Heavenly King in one move, Zhang an's strength was evident. With the suppression of the book of Dao, the Heavenly King was quickly killed!Zhang an didn't have time to break the Dao, and there was no need to do so at this moment.Once their bodies and minds were dead, the other party had almost no power to fight back. Furthermore, these guys had changed to cultivating the Crimson Moon Power. Whether or not the origin Dao still existed was a question.He put away the book of Dao and went straight to Li Hao. However, in an instant, a group of Saints appeared in front of him, and his expression changed.This was big trouble!These guys hadn't fought for a hundred thousand years, and their reactions were actually not too slow!Just as he was getting serious, a shrill scream came from the distance. In an instant, a large broken tree was split into pieces!Li Hao's long sword cut through the void, and the blood-red Tree was instantly reduced to dust!As soon as his spiritual power was released, it was also shattered in the blink of an eye.He was dead!The second Heavenly King!Li Hao's killing speed seemed to be slower than Zhang an 's.He made the first move, but the result was that he was slower than Zhang an.The remaining three Heavenly Kings were already on their way. Zhang an's expression changed and he shouted,""Li Hao, meet up with me!"  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  Quickly come!At this moment, he also wanted to break out of the encirclement. However, under the joint efforts of more than 10 sages, the power of countless Crimson moons erupted in an instant. Zhang an's mind was slightly dazed, and the book of Dao rumbled!In the distance, one of the three Heavenly Kings shouted angrily,""Surround him!"It was not to kill Zhang an, but to trap him.When the three of them finished off Li Hao, Zhang an would be dead for sure!At this moment, everyone recognized the two of them. One was Zhang an, and the other was Li Hao ... What was even more terrifying was that it was said that Li Hao went to the forbidden Sea today, and there were even saints in the city who went out to help!It was a conspiracy! No matter what ... He had to kill these two people now.Li Hao put away his sword and looked at the three of them. The three of them instantly formed a triangle and surrounded Li Hao. Their faces were extremely ugly, and they were all furious!"Li Hao, you're really audacious. You're looking for death!""Kill!"The three of them roared at the same time and attacked at the same time. Li Hao didn't seem to have the time to teleport the entire city.However ... At this moment, the three Heavenly Kings seemed to have seen something. They were in a daze for a moment ...They seemed to have seen a star.Half illusory and half real!In their impression, it was just a short moment, so short that it was unbelievable ...However, at this moment, the three Heavenly Kings suddenly stopped moving ... Li Hao didn't take advantage of this moment to kill them. If he did, he would kill one at most. The remaining two would be enough to make him suffer!At this moment, without the power of the Heavenly Kings suppressing the ancient city, the ancient city suddenly trembled, and a huge crack appeared in the sky.The ancient city suddenly trembled, and in an instant, it rushed into the sky!The three Heavenly Kings suddenly woke up.They didn't even notice that time had passed for a moment, and they still attacked as they had before. BOOM!The three experts attacked, and with a loud bang, the water on Li Hao's body surged up as if he was bleeding, but also as if it was just the sound of water flowing!The three of them were stunned!But at that moment, they suddenly sensed that something was wrong. They looked up ... And saw that it was no longer the starry sky from before. Their faces changed!This is ... The great Dao universe?How was that possible?The three of us have been pestering Li Hao. How did we suddenly enter the Dao universe?At the same time, countless Thunderbolts suddenly appeared in the great Dao universe. In an instant, the entire universe seemed to be shaking!He was furious!Boundless anger!There was too much Crimson Moon Power. Three Heavenly Kings, more than ten Saints, more than a hundred undyings ... All of them cultivated the Crimson Moon Power. There was even a Crimson Moon above the ancient city, containing countless Crimson Moon Power!The great Dao universe was completely enraged!BOOM!Tens of thousands of Thunderbolts instantly attacked!This time, no one stopped him. The power was not as strong as the gathered lightning, but in an instant, countless people screamed. Some of the ancient God guards in the city screamed as the power of the red moon evaporated!Some of the weaker ones were directly turned into ashes by the lightning!Zhang an's heart trembled!He knew that the Dao universe was targeting them, but ... He didn't even see how Li Hao had teleported them in. How ... Did he do it?He didn't know that Li Hao had once been illuminated by the star of time. The star of time had even swam in a River. In fact, it was equivalent to swimming in Li Hao's body. Li Hao had sensed a trace of the power of time.In the past, Gou 'Zi, who was close to the Dao integration stage, had been dazed for seven to eight seconds. At that time, it had only been Li Hao's clone controlling it.

Chapter 2282 A Great Harvest (3)
And this time, his true body was personally controlling it.The three Heavenly Kings paused for about one-hundredth of a second, which was enough time for Li Hao to do something!For an expert, this amount of time was enough for him to kill a Heavenly King!However, Li Hao didn't choose to kill them. Instead, he moved the ancient city!"Why would I?"One of the Heavenly Kings was extremely shocked. He destroyed the lightning with a punch, and the next moment, the lightning swept over again.The three of them were shocked!The next moment, they all shouted angrily,"kill Li Hao first!" If we kill him, we might be able to get out!"Damn it!They had actually been teleported into the great Dao universe.At this moment, Li Hao chuckled and suddenly transformed into a giant. In an instant, blood flowed, and billions of stars flickered in the sky, corresponding to the Galaxy and the river in Li Hao's body!The power of countless great DAOs began to flip!Li Hao was getting higher and higher, bigger and bigger!He didn't even look at the attacks of the three Heavenly Kings. He didn't even fight back. He just looked into the distant void and into the depths of the universe. At this moment, a star seemed to have sensed something.With some curiosity and excitement, he shuttled through the void.At this moment, Li Hao chuckled and said,""Guys, look over there ..."He pointed with his giant hand!Some people looked over subconsciously ... But there was silence. Some didn 't, but in the next moment, a star flew straight at Li Hao. Everyone saw it. The entire city, including Zhang an and the three Heavenly Kings, froze!Li Hao smiled!The word 'Dao' appeared on his forehead.This was the killer move!This was the true power of invincibility!This was the power of the master of the great Dao!Why bother?Why fight to the death?When this planet was drawn to him...These people were destined to die.The river was connected to the star, and the power of great DAOs erupted. It had attracted the star before, and this time ... Was no exception. However, the star was a little disappointed that it didn't seem to see anything new. It rolled around Li Hao, and the star disappeared in an instant!The next time, perhaps if there was nothing new, this star would not come!The stars had disappeared, but the entire universe seemed to have been frozen!Li Hao raised his hand, drew his sword, and stabbed it into the heart of a Heavenly King!The Heavenly King looked like he was about to scream in pain. He was instantly enveloped by Li Hao's domain and came to his senses, his face filled with endless fear!What's wrong?All he saw was a star. When he woke up again, Li Hao's sword had pierced his heart and minced his internal organs. Then, with a crack, his entire head was crushed! He was confused and in disbelief ... How could this be?All of a sudden, the others stopped moving!He ... Was killed just like that?I am a Heavenly King!His mind power spread out instantly and formed a blood giant. This seemed to be the correct way to use the Crimson Moon Power. The blood giant looked to the side and saw that the others were not moving. In shock, it seemed to have realized something!Perhaps ... He had to wake them up!p He let out an extremely sharp cry, but at this moment, the entire great Dao universe seemed to have quieted down. The power of 10000 DAOs formed a domain and completely enveloped him!"In my domain, you ... Can just call me that!" Li Hao's voice rang out softly.The sword was drawn!The long sword was invisible, and it pierced through the body. Li Hao smiled and said,""In the past, the blood God of the Crimson Moon was everyone's favorite ... No one was willing to eat humans, but everyone liked to eat the blood God! All of you ... I'm going to refine you into clones of the blood God!"Yes, the blood God!These Crimson Moon cultivators were actually exactly the same as Ying Hongyue's blood-red shadow in the past!If the red blood shadow could be refined into a Blood God, then the spiritual power of these guys could do it too! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  A Blood God at the Heavenly King level!Who dared to imagine it?The bloody shadow seemed to be extremely frightened, but Li Hao's sword had already pierced through it. The starry sky sword trembled violently, and the cracks on it were repaired by the bloody energy!The blood shadow was constantly being compressed!The blood shadow screamed and said,"the venerable sovereign won't let you off!" If you kill us, the venerable sovereign will definitely know ... Li Hao, if you kill us, you'll be making an enemy of the venerable sovereign ...""It's good that he knows!"Li Hao was compressing him. He smiled."The venerable sovereign is a good person. He's even better than the Queen. To be honest, I can't believe that there's so much Crimson Moon Power!" He would first compress them into clones of Blood God and then use the great Dao lightning to baptize them. The clones of Blood God and the great Dao lightning ... This was definitely a Supreme treasure! A Heavenly King-ranked treasure!""Li Hao!"The blood shadow was completely shattered and refined by the starry sky sword. Soon, a Blood God appeared.The lightning in the sky seemed to have stopped.Li Hao wasn't in a hurry. He would probably recover soon.After being baptized by the lightning, the blood God clones would definitely be the most precious treasure in the world. They would definitely be more powerful than the sky fragrance fruit. After all, the sky fragrance fruit was only condensed by one Heavenly King, and it was divided into 99 pieces.However, this Blood God was condensed from almost all the power of a Heavenly King!Was it cruel?Perhaps!But Li Hao ... Didn't care. After the lightning baptism, this thing would be cleansed by the Crimson Moon's power, making it the best pill.The Crimson Moon cultivators were not human.These fellows should be called bloodshadow puppets.

2283 Chapter 382
In the blink of an eye, Li Hao had dealt with a Heavenly King.In addition to the two who had died earlier, there were only two Heavenly Kings left in an instant. At this moment, Li Hao's eyes flickered and he frowned slightly. The stars disappeared, as if the force was also dissipating.It was not infinite!In addition, there were too many powerhouses here, and there were also many great Dao thunders ... A Heavenly King seemed to be trembling slightly. Perhaps ... He would recover soon!This won't do!The domain instantly enveloped the trembling Heavenly King, and he fell into the 10000 domains. Li Hao slashed out again. This time, as soon as he touched the Heavenly King, the Heavenly King came to his senses. However ... It was too late!The Heavenly King's expression changed drastically as well. He looked around and said in shock,""I ... Was suppressed for a moment?"He finally reacted!He must have been suppressed by some incredible power for a moment. Therefore, when he woke up again, he didn't feel the passage of time. However, he knew that something must have gone wrong when he lost a Heavenly King!However, it was useless now that he realized it!The Heavenly King's face changed. In a blink, blood energy gathered. He was going to explode!That damned Li Hao!He was going to wake everyone up!At this moment, Li Hao frowned slightly. In an instant, he turned into a River and surrounded his opponent, drowning him in it. The power of countless great DAOs swept over!The Heavenly King roared madly, but it was too late!The stars continued to smash down, causing him to collapse continuously. His body was soon smashed into pieces, and a bloody shadow appeared. The starry sky sword had long been eager to try, and it stabbed into the bloody shadow!"Ah!"Screams erupted again, and the compressed mode was activated again. The river surged, and Li Hao gradually took on his human form. His face was slightly pale. The Heavenly King ... Was not easy to deal with!Although the power was strong, it was fading. Before the long sword could enter the other party's body, the other party had already regained consciousness. This also meant that he could only use his strength to suppress the Heavenly King.Fortunately, if you didn't touch her, she wouldn't wake up.He only needed to deal with one of them!Otherwise ... There would be a little trouble!The long sword rumbled and pressed down, compressing. Soon, another blood-colored pill appeared. An extremely powerful aura overflowed. It was the same as the other one, a Heavenly King level Blood God!Li Hao looked at the third Heavenly King ... Whose body was trembling. It seemed that he would wake up soon!Li Hao instantly attacked!This time, as soon as he arrived, the other party's eyes suddenly became clear. Seeing the longsword in front of him, his expression changed, but he quickly retreated, as if he wanted to escape from Li Hao's attack!Such a huge commotion also caused some abnormalities to appear in other places.On the other side, Zhang an suddenly opened his eyes!When he suddenly looked at Li Hao ... His expression changed drastically!What about the other two Heavenly Kings?What was going on?BOOM!The lightning of the great path also began to recover and struck down again. The Heavenly King who had just retreated was suddenly struck by a bolt of lightning. He staggered a little from the strike and the long sword pierced through him! Li Hao shook his head!  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  The right time, place, and people are all with me.After entering the great path universe, the fate of these people was determined. The other party had awakened, but even the great path lightning had awakened and recovered. There was only one Heavenly King left, and almost all the lightning had gathered here.If a lightning bolt struck, the other party would be considered lucky if he didn't die!Boom! Boom! Boom!The Thunderbolts continued to fall, and Li Hao's sword also left deep bloody marks on the opponent's body one after another. After countless slashes, the opponent could no longer withstand the two-way attack and exploded with a loud bang!A blood shadow shot up into the sky, trying to escape! However, there was no chance.The sword pressed down, and the word "Dao" appeared. With a loud explosion, it suppressed the blood shadow. The long sword pierced into it in an instant, and a boundless devouring power swept out. The Heavenly king's blood shadow that was suppressed screamed in pain again and roared,""Li Hao ...""The venerable sovereign won't let me go! I got it!"Li Hao instantly appeared with a long sword in his hand. He burst out with the power of great DAOs and laughed."Someone threatened me like this just before you!""You ...""I'll die a horrible death without a burial place. Sooner or later, I'll be buried with you ... I've heard this many times, but I haven't been buried with you yet!""Ah!"The Heavenly King was on the verge of collapse. He was about to roar again,""I ...""You won't let me go even if you become a ghost ... Unfortunately, it seems like you can't become a ghost!"BOOM!An explosive sound rang out, and a wisp of resentment burst out. It was too unbearable!The sword light flickered, and with a boom, the resentment was shattered and instantly dissipated.Li Hao said calmly, you can't help it anymore? Such weak willpower! If even Heavenly Kings are like this ... Neo martial arts would have been destroyed a long time ago, but fake Heavenly Kings just can 't!"All five Heavenly Kings had been killed!The three Blood God illusions floated in the air.Li Hao threw the three Blood God illusions into the Thunderbolts. The Thunderbolts struck the blood God illusions, and they gradually turned golden!On the other side, because Zhang an had woken up before the sages, he had killed a few of them in the blink of an eye. However, at this moment, the others had also woken up, and Zhang an was somewhat unable to follow his heart.In the end, the other Saints 'expressions changed drastically!"Run!"Some people roared and turned to escape!Li Hao had killed all the Heavenly Kings!What an incredible result!"You're still ... Trying to escape here?"Li Hao laughed evilly. His long sword pierced through the sky and the earth. A Saint was instantly pierced through. A bloody shadow emerged and was suppressed by the long sword almost instantly. After a while, it turned into a Blood God!

2284 Chapter 382
A Saint-level Blood God!Zhang an's expression changed slightly, and he opened his mouth to speak,""They are just enemies. The Crimson Moon world is not human. Humans eat demons, demons eat meat, big fish, small fish, small fish eat shrimps ... It's just a biological chain!"Zhang an didn't say anything else. His expression was serious as the book of Dao suppressed the surroundings!Now that a few Saints had died, the remaining people couldn't resist the two of them at all. Li Hao's combat strength was even more terrifying. Almost no saint could resist his sword!In the blink of an eye, more than 10 Saints had been slaughtered!They turned into blood gods and were thrown into the lightning by Li Hao to receive the baptism of lightning!As for the remaining undying, paragons, and ancient God guards...Many of them had already been killed by the lightning!However, a portion of them were still madly fleeing.Some people escaped into the universe, but in the vast universe, there was nowhere to escape to!In the blink of an eye, Li Hao had caught up with them!Slaughter!Endless killing!Screams reverberated through the universe.No one could have imagined that the powerful red Moon base would be wiped out by Li Hao just like that. The threat of the five Heavenly Kings was not even as great as that of the head of the Zheng family. Li Hao had become stronger and had more tricks up his sleeve!The benefits he gained from this slaughter were even greater!Also, the power of the Crimson Moon in these people was too strong!Zheng Hongyuan's Crimson Moon Power was actually far less concentrated than theirs!Sword after sword, the clones of Blood God were thrown into the Thunder of the great path.To experience the baptism of lightning!Li Hao returned to the ancient city in the blink of an eye.Zhang an had also cleared the remaining people, but there were still a few people alive in the city. Li Hao looked at a woman not far away and smiled.""Blue Moon?"The woman was trembling, but she gritted her teeth and shouted in a low voice,""It's your great aunt! Li Hao, don't be smug! If you come here and win, you'll kill us ... But you'll also be dead in the forbidden Sea! Your people will all die. It's just a life for a life!"Li Hao smiled and grabbed it with one hand. One hand covers the sky!Blue Moon was also a tough girl. She was about to self-destruct, but she didn't have the chance to do so in front of Li Hao. Li Hao instantly suppressed her and captured her. "Don't die now. We haven't even seen Ying Hongyue yet! He killed my parents, my friends, my brothers, and even dug up my parents "graves ... Ying Hongyue wasn't there when I killed chengyue and the others. She didn't see it with her own eyes ... I'm going to kill you in front of him!"Li Hao's eyes suddenly flickered with boundless killing intent!Zhang an wanted to say something but stopped. Li Hao's voice was cold."Senior Zhang, don't try to persuade others to be magnanimous! My family is ruined, and my parents "bones are gone. If you persuade me to be magnanimous, I'll be angry!"Zhang an sighed and did not speak again.Just as Li Hao had said ... He couldn't persuade her.He and Ying Hongyue had a blood feud!They wouldn't stop until they were dead, even if their friends and family were all dead. Since Li Hao won today, he naturally wouldn't let Ying Hongyue have an easy time!In an instant, ten thousand swords pierced through the world, and countless corpses were shattered. Li Hao killed them all, leaving no one alive!The Thunderbolts in the sky still hadn't dissipated. The Blood Moon in the city was still fighting the Thunderbolts with its power. Li Hao looked up and was surprised. What was this Blood Moon?Not to mention providing for the cultivation of the entire city, he had actually managed to resist the lightning of the great path until now!As the number of lightning bolts increased, the blood-red moon also gradually weakened.Gradually, the blood-colored moon revealed its true appearance!"Venerable sovereign's blood essence!" Zhang an's face changed slightly."Venerable sovereign's blood essence!"What?Li Hao was shocked!Was that the blood essence of Red Moon sovereign?BOOM!The Thunderbolt of the great path erupted again. The drop of blood struggled violently at this moment. Suddenly, it transformed into a human figure, revealing the appearance of the sealed venerable sovereign. He looked at Li Hao, then at Zhang an. At this moment, he actually said in a human voice,""What an incredible junior! They actually broke through Thunder City ... It seems that I'm going to lose a drop of my blood essence ... What a pity!"After he said that, his blood essence scattered and turned into countless blood-colored forces that pounced toward the lightning!  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  Obviously, this venerable sovereign knew that this drop of blood essence couldn't escape, but he didn't want to let Li Hao take advantage of it.Li Hao finally came back to his senses!At this moment, he couldn't care less about Zhang an's eyes anymore. He suddenly let out a loud roar, and like the stars, the sun, and the moon, he shone with rays of brilliance. Time seemed to have stopped for a moment, and the expression of the blood venerable sovereign changed."This is ... The power of time ..."BOOM!The world fell silent for a moment!Meanwhile, Li Hao broke through the void and reached out to grab the blood. Zhang an was not affected at all, as Li Hao was not targeting him. At this moment, he was also dumbfounded. He suddenly roared,""Don 't!"It was the blood of venerable sovereigns!​ Li Hao didn't know how powerful venerable sovereigns were. Blood was too dangerous. Even a drop of blood could possess you!Sure enough, that drop of blood instantly merged into Li Hao's body. In an instant, Li Hao's eyes turned red!"Greedy boy!" The venerable sovereign's voice was heard.You actually dared to steal my blood essence!In the next moment, he suddenly let out a muffled groan with a strange tone,""What?"What?Zhang an was also shocked. At this moment, Li Hao roared and transformed into a long river. The river surged, and the billions of stars in the sky suddenly burst out with rays of light, covering the entire River!"You dare to possess me?"Li Hao's voice was cold."It's more like it's me. A drop of blood essence? you want to possess the body of a master of the great Dao?"

2285 Chapter 382
Boom! Boom! Boom!The long river gushed forward, and in the river, a drop of blood was being washed away!Zhang an was dumbfounded!"Crazy!" He muttered.Using one's body as a River!Ten thousand rivers!How was that possible?The power of 10000 DAOs washed the venerable sovereign's blood again and again. Soon, a shadow slowly appeared and sat on the blood like a lonely boat, being washed by the power of the great DAOs!At this moment, the venerable sovereign was also a little surprised and emotional.""Good move! What a good method! Using one's body as the Dao, and merging one's body as the Dao! Li Hao, you're a genius of this era, a true genius ... However, this is only a drop of my blood essence. I'll also know that you've taken it today! When my true body comes ... This incomplete great Dao universe won't be able to stop my true body!""We'll talk when your main body comes!"Li Hao's voice was extremely loud. With a loud boom, the river of the great path instantly extinguished the shadow. The next moment, Li Hao turned into a human, and a blood-red bead the size of a human head appeared in his hand!He instantly charged into the lightning and countless lightning bolts bombarded him!Li Hao, on the other hand, was extremely delighted!A drop of venerable sovereign blood!It wasn't ordinary blood, but blood essence. Even if its true combat power wasn't as strong as a Heavenly King 's, the blood deity it had formed was far superior to a Heavenly king's blood deity!This time, he had really earned big!Meanwhile, Zhang an also came over quickly. He looked at Li Hao in disbelief."You ... You seized it?"It was unbelievable!Not only that, but Li Hao's method of instantly freezing the venerable sovereign blood was also unbelievable. He finally understood why a few Heavenly Kings were suddenly missing. They were all killed by Li Hao in such a way!​ It was too terrifying!The power of time?That was impossible!Who could control time?He looked at Li Hao in a daze. For the first time, he felt that he no longer understood Li Hao. Li Hao had merged with the river and grasped a tiny bit of the power of time. This kind of Li Hao was very terrifying!After the lightning was extinguished, the starry sky was filled with blood gods!There were Heavenly Kings and even venerable sovereigns!Li Hao ... He had really destroyed the red moon Emperor's lair this time!……At this moment, within the seal.Red Moon sovereign suddenly opened his eyes!That drop of blood ... Is gone!He had lost contact!Even if it was brought into the universe of the great path, it could still be connected and could even be used as a coordinate. However ... When Li Hao used the power of the river to extinguish the shadow, the connection was completely cut off!Red Moon sovereign looked at the sky in silence as the connection was cut off. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ Who took my blood?Who could do it?Even if it was a Heavenly King or a pseudo-Emperor, their blood would explode in an instant and it was impossible for anyone to take it away. And the current situation didn't seem like it had exploded, but more like it had been taken away!The universe of the great path?Li Hao?Or was it another guy?He looked at the sky and fell into deep thought. Soon, a smile appeared on his face. My blood ... Is not that easy to get!……At the same time.In the outside world.It was dark."Are you still not going to do anything?" the king of Dali was extremely anxious. What time was it?Wait a little longer, it's dawn!At this moment, Li Hao smiled. He stepped into the air and said,""What's the hurry ... Let's go and meet Ying Hongyue!"The Dali King was stunned. Wasn't it a surprise attack?F * ck!You directly charged out, what kind of surprise attack was this?"Come out!" Li Hao's voice was loud."Today, we will suppress the forbidden Sea!"One by one, Saints appeared!Not only that, Li Hao shouted again,""Martial uncle, Hongyu, Heibao, come here!"At this moment, the few people who were hiding were also slightly stunned.Very quickly, the few of them also broke through the void and arrived.In the distance, Ying Hongyue's expression changed. It was extremely unsightly, and she was becoming more and more uneasy!He no longer concealed himself and instantly appeared on the forbidden Sea. Looking at Li Hao from afar, he said in a deep voice with a grim expression,""Li Hao, didn't you say that you'd let it go after taking the item? why did you come again today?"Li Hao laughed."Ying Hongyue ... You and I have a blood feud ... If I speak, you think I'm farting. If you speak, I'll do the same!" Is there any trust between us?"At this moment, Ying Hongyue didn't say anything else. A skeleton appeared behind her, and an extremely powerful aura erupted in the sky above the forbidden Sea.At the same time, Ying Hongyue's expression became more and more grave. She shouted,"All of you, gather!"He had changed his plan!A moment later, auras quickly gathered. In the blink of an eye, a total of eight auras of Saints floated over.If the Saints in Thunder City were included, there were actually quite a number of them, a total of 20 Saints.They hadn't mobilized all of them ... Because they were worried that they would scare Li Hao away. They were also worried that they would make too much of a commotion and attract the attention of others.But at this moment ... He couldn't care anymore!Li Hao also had many saints!The key was not the number of Saints, but the feeling that Li Hao gave him. Furthermore, he was extremely uneasy. This was the first time in so many years that he had felt this way, even though he had failed many times before.Because everything was actually going according to plan.Only today ... He didn't lose anything, but he was already extremely uneasy!There must be a problem!Where would the problem be?Li Hao's people were all here, not a single one missing. All the experts were here.His expression became even more solemn as the forbidden Sea churned crazily!The aura of the skeleton behind him grew stronger and stronger!The king of Dali could not wait and transmitted his voice,""Kill! Hurry up ... This skeleton seems to be absorbing the power of the forbidden Sea ... Ying Hongyue is doing the same. Hurry up!"What are you waiting for?Kill!He was about to go crazy!Li Hao, this idiot, this fool, is waiting for the enemy to be at their strongest before making a move?Eight F * cking Saints!There was also Ying Hongyue and the skeleton of a Heavenly King ... His scalp was going to go numb!How could they fight this?At this moment, not only did his scalp go numb, but even li Fuhai and the others became serious. This was not going to be an easy fight!Or rather, it was very difficult to fight!They could deal with the Saints, but that skeleton and Ying Hongyue ... Could Li Hao and the others deal with them?If he couldn't ... This battle was over!If Zheng Yu were to interfere at the critical moment ...

At this moment, the sky was already dark.One by one, the Saints hovered in the air, lighting up the sky.The king of Dali was impatient, and Ying Hongyue was vaguely uneasy.Just as the two sides were about to make contact, a fluctuation suddenly swept through the world. In the next moment, under the gazes of Zheng Yu's various spectators, a large city suddenly appeared in the air!The huge city soared into the sky!At this moment, Li Hao, who was with the king of Dali, suddenly laughed."Senior Zhang is here!"As soon as he finished speaking, he rose into the air.He headed straight for the big city!In the city, the book of Dao suddenly flew out. A person stepped on the air and came over. Ying Hongyue's expression changed slightly.Under the slight change, he felt slightly more at ease.Was this Li Hao's trump card?If that was the case ... He would be at ease!Who didn't know of Zhang an's group? Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ However, even though these people did not participate in the battle, they actually held back some people. For example, the many saints in Hurricane city did not dare to step out rashly. Even if Li Hao came out in full force, they would not dare to step out!Because Zhang an and the others were here!Now, if Zhang an and the others were to join the battle ... It would be equivalent to freeing this group of people!Therefore, Zhang an and the others were not considered trump cards.Of course, there were also a few Saints on this side. They were all veteran Saints and were not weak. For example, there were two saints from martial Union, a Saint from the Zhang family's heaven stabilizing city, an unknown saint, and Zhang an, a peak expert at the quasi-Heavenly King level!Although there weren't many of them, their combat strength was unquestionable!"Senior," Li Hao laughed heartily,"we haven't fought together before. Today, we can fight together!"Zhang an crossed the sky and arrived, followed by a few Saints.At this moment, the Saints looked at Li Hao ... With complicated feelings.Zhang an also sighed and said softly,""In this battle ... We must take down these intruders! I originally didn't want to pay attention to Ying Hongyue's matter, but these people were all invaded by the power of the Crimson Moon ... Ying Hongyue is extremely audacious. She dared to collude with the cultivators of the Crimson Moon world ... She must be killed!"At this moment, the Saints behind him said,""He should be killed! Don't worry, Marquis li. We are all new martial Saints. We will definitely kill these Eight Saints!"At this moment, li Fuhai and the others were stunned.I'll go!These few people ... Are so polite today!He used to be very arrogant!Neo martial artist, neo martial artist, neo martial artist solving neo martial artist problems, joining Li Hao, they were not considered as neo martial artists. Although they did not say that they were traitors, they really thought so in their hearts.Why did he change his attitude so quickly today?He kept calling him Marquis li ... He was so polite!Even though there were only five Saints on this side, their strength was not to be underestimated! At this moment, including li Fuhai, the old turtle, general Huai, Redwood, Diamond Wood, the ninth Division commander, Black Panther, Hong Yitang, Lin Hongyu, and Li Hao, they had the combat power of fifteen Saints!Moreover, most of them were veteran neo martial great saints!The so-called veterans were naturally experts who had truly stepped into the divine path. They were not comparable to those Saints who advanced later. Their combat power was quite fierce.……Within Hurricane city.Zheng Yu frowned slightly.Had Zhang an's side ... Chosen to participate in the war?This was really surprising!"I thought that these people wouldn't participate in the battle, but rather wait. Or rather, they're guarding against me. Last time, Hurricane city suffered heavy losses, but today, there are still nine saints in Hurricane city!Of course, it couldn't be compared to before.Now that the heavens and earth could accommodate Saints, these Saints didn't go out just in case they were surrounded and annihilated by Li Hao's group. However, if Zhang an and the others joined the battle ... Ying Hongyue's side might not be able to gain any advantage! "Saints, prepare for battle!"Zheng Yu said softly,'this is interesting ... Are we going to gather all the Saints in the world today? Both sides have already gathered more than 20 Sage-level experts. Even in the new martial era, it's rare to have so many sages in a small world ..."Of course, he didn't say anything when a bunch of them were killed before.With Zhang an there, even if the skeleton was powerful, when Li Hao and Zhang an joined forces to deal with the skeleton and Ying Hongyue, they should be evenly matched. However, Li Hao still had more than a dozen Saints.This way ... He might not be able to gain any advantage."Milord, aren't you going to attack now? Or should I ... Wait and see?"Zheng Yu pondered for a moment and said,"wait and see. There are only Eight Saints among the Crimson Moon cultivators that Ying Hongyue is working with?" Was this all of it ... Or a portion of it? Let's wait and see ... Unless a Sage dies, or if the other party doesn't send anyone, then we'll make our move!"The fact that no one had made a move despite the death of a Saint meant that there were indeed only so many saints on the other side.At that time, he could make a move!The few Saints nodded their heads and looked at him with eagerness!Last time, he had been screwed over badly!"Sir, if Li Hao ..." Someone else said nervously."I won 't!""No." Zheng Yu shook his head."The world is more stable than before. He might not succeed. Secondly ... This time, all of their people have made it out. It won't be easy to retreat! Unless he killed Zhang an and the others as well!"If that's the case ... All of you can just be buried with him!Of course, he just had to keep these words in his heart.When that time came, Li Hao would actually be more than willing to sacrifice a few of his Saints in exchange for the death of Zhang an and the others ... What a great deal!Zheng Yu thought to himself that perhaps all the Saints in the world would really have to participate in this battle!This was interesting!

……Li Hao and Zhang an met up at the gate of the giant city. The old saints were very polite.Li Hao also smiled brightly,"I've been waiting for you seniors for a day, and you've finally come!" If the seniors didn't come, it would seem that I've lost a little support and a little backbone ... Once the seniors arrived, I'm at ease!"He spoke as if he didn't dare to participate in the battle if these Saints didn't come.At this moment, Li Hao was a little haughty and arrogant. He turned his head to look at Ying Hongyue and laughed."Ying Hongyue! You're full of tricks, and I knew you were prepared. The eight Saints might not be all of them ... Today, Supreme venerable Zhang's grandson has come in person, and he has the power of a quasi-Heavenly King to fight against a Heavenly King. Today ... You're dead!"Li Hao shouted,"senior, I'll give the skeleton to you!" [Today, I will take revenge!] The rest of you ... Kill all the red moon disciples!"As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his hand and a long sword appeared. He shouted,""Kill!"BOOM!The sword light was monstrous! Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ Killing intent overflowed, and the world changed colors!A great battle had erupted!Ying Hongyue's expression also changed as she shouted in a low voice,"Then let's try. Li Hao, I've been wanting to fight you for many days. Let's see who can win today."BOOM!The blood Qi in his body burst out, and the eight blood veins instantly merged into one. A powerful force suddenly burst out. The forbidden Sea surrounded the world, rolling instantly. The monstrous waves moved with him and rushed straight at Li Hao.Behind him, the skeleton also flashed with a white jade light and disappeared from the spot. Zhang an, who was holding the book of Dao, also disappeared at the same time.Boom! Boom! Boom!The heavens fell and the earth cracked!The skeleton and Zhang an, one was almost a Heavenly King, and the other was half a Heavenly King ... At this moment, the battle between the Heavenly Kings had begun!As for Li Hao and Ying Hongyue, the two successors of the eight great families, they almost both had the battle strength of the peak of the Saint path. When the two sides came into contact, their qi and blood soared to the sky. A sword also appeared in Ying Hongyue's hand, and as she slashed out, eight colors split the world!The amorous swordsman Ying Hongyue was also one of the top swordsmen of Silvermoon in the past. This person was not included in the Seven Swords of Silvermoon because he did not specialize in swords, but he was indeed a sword expert. On the other side, Hong Yitang waved his sword and shouted,""Kill!"The earth-overturning sword shook the heavens and earth. As it slashed out, the forbidden Sea trembled. Suddenly, the sky and earth turned upside down. Lin Hongyu held her scimitar and a bloody look appeared in her eyes. She disappeared in the blink of an eye and merged into the forbidden Sea.She was not afraid of the forbidden sea's corrosive power.Li Fuhai, the ninth master, the saber Saint of the Zhang family ... All the powerful cultivators rushed out in an instant. The Black Panther even transformed into a huge golden dog that swallowed the heaven and earth. Both sides broke the sky in the blink of an eye!Although the eight Red Moon Saints were all strengthened by the forbidden Sea, one of the blood Saints suddenly cried out in pain. At this moment, a huge Golden Bull suddenly fell. With a boom, the entire Forbidden Sea shook violently!"I am the sea Protector!" Li Fuhai snorted.As long as the heavens and earth didn't perish, and the new martial arts didn't perish, he would still be the sea-suppressing envoy! All the seas under the heavens are my soil!Did someone forget that the water Tribe originated from the forbidden Sea? they lived in the forbidden Sea in the new martial era. Its grandfather, venerable sovereign li Wuqi, and its ancestor, Water Tribe, had been swimming in the forbidden Sea. They were all water buffaloes that roamed the sea!What's the big deal about this small Forbidden Sea?Is this little corrosive power just scratching an itch for me?BOOM!Under the suppression, the four hooves of the huge bull broke the sea. Even Ying Hongyue and the skeleton in the distance trembled slightly. They quickly realized that this was the other party's natural attribute!The sea Protector ... He was in charge of all the seas in the world, at least the Silver Moon sea!The eight Saints were originally quite powerful after being strengthened by the power of the forbidden Sea. However, their defenses were suddenly broken and they were attacked crazily!Which of these old saints wasn't a top-notch existence?As for the new ones, they were also the strongest of the new era.The Black Panther swallowed the heaven and earth, and countless seawater instantly fell into its mouth. The Black Panther swallowed without hesitation, allowing the seawater to gather and corrode its body without any fluctuations!The bloodline of the demon subduing envoy was not afraid of the forbidden Sea!In an instant, a blood Saint was sent flying by the saber Saint of the Zhang family. In the dark, a curved saber appeared, leaving a bloody mark. Blood splattered everywhere!Lin Hongyu was like a Night Hunter. She appeared in an instant and her scimitar cut through the sky.A great saint was severely injured in an instant!"Ah!"Screams of pain resounded through the heavens and earth. Saints were not afraid of ordinary pain, but if there was something else mixed in the blade, it would be so painful that they would wish for death!Lin Hongyu's knife did not contain anything special. It was just some filth left behind by the gods of misfortune and disaster after their deaths, including some special powers left behind by the gods such as the God of pain.At this moment, the saber burst forth and tore apart a saint's body. That Saint was in so much pain that he wished he was dead!A blood-curdling screech resounded through the heavens!……BOOM!At the same time, Li Hao and Ying Hongyue crossed their swords and fought. Their sword intent pierced the sky, and the two long swords cut through the sky!Li Hao said coldly,"years ago, you were suppressed by my master and knelt to beg for mercy!" Today, my master is not here, and you are still inferior to my five birds sect!"As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly abandoned his long sword and transformed into a fierce bird!"I'll use the five birds technique to suppress you, you beast!"

Ying Hongyue frowned slightly. Her longsword cut through the sky. Sword after sword, Li Hao continuously changed his stance, but ... He still couldn't break through the defense. The two sides exchanged blows, but Ying Hongyue's brows were still tightly furrowed.He looked around ... And felt a little puzzled.Li Hao ... Was very strong!He was quite powerful, but ... But ... He didn't bring him that kind of fear or uneasiness. In the past, even if Li Hao wasn't too powerful, he still felt uneasy when he met Li Hao.Strange!However, the person in front of him was indeed Li Hao. In this world, there was no one else other than Yuan Shuo who could use the five animal technique so well and sweep the world with five major forces!BOOM!Not far away, a loud noise came. A book of the great Dao trembled slightly, and one figure after another was destroyed!Zhang an, on the other hand, was floating in the air with the book of the great Dao in his hand. One after another, figures walked out and charged towards the skeleton. Zhang an's voice was calm. "You're a beginner martial artist. How dare you attack my neo martial?"The skeleton roared and punched out, shattering a figure in an instant. Zhang an staggered slightly and was somewhat shocked."Who are you?"Unfortunately, he didn't get an answer!As the two sides fought, Zhang an seemed to be at a disadvantage. Zhang an shouted angrily,""Kill them! Come and help us!"BOOM!In the distance, more than a dozen Saints attacked. At this moment, the sky and earth cracked. In the blink of an eye, a Saint screamed. At this moment, countless branches pierced through him. General Huai, who had been inconspicuous, suddenly emerged from the bottom of the sea and pierced through a blood saint's body.In the next moment, the old turtle pressed down, and with a loud boom, the saint's body shattered, revealing a blood-red figure!As soon as he appeared, a scimitar pierced through the void!Huala!The blood shadow wailed in pain again. With a crack, it broke apart!……"I'm going to die ... No one is coming ..."Zheng Yu looked around, and indeed, there were no fluctuations of any experts. Seeing that a Saint was about to die, he quickly said,""Attack, assist in the battle!""Yes!"The next moment, a large city appeared. In the blink of an eye, nine saints appeared on the forbidden Sea, and the large city disappeared.The Nine Saints had appeared!At this moment, Ying Hongyue also let out a breath ... I knew that Zheng Yu definitely wouldn't watch as we were killed. As expected, they still came. The arrival of the 8 Saints was actually within his calculations.Eight of them might not be a match for Li Hao's side, but Hurricane city still had Saints.When Zheng Yu saw that no one was assisting him in the battle ... He would definitely make a move!Since that was the case, why would there be more Saints?On the contrary, it made people vigilant!As expected, when the 17 sages gathered, there were only 13 sages on the other side. On the contrary, there were even more people on his side!He would still win this battle!The moment he had this thought ... The Nine Saints who had just landed suddenly saw an ancient city appear. It was the star River City that had been floating just a moment ago. However, there were no more experts in the city. There were only a few undying fighters and a few puppet students.Such combat power ... Was he here to die?The Nine Saints hadn't met up with the other blood Saints yet, but their appearance still made people furious. Li Fuhai shouted,""How dare you, Zheng Yu. Aren't you afraid of losing all the Saints?"  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  Originally, he had a huge advantage. In the blink of an eye, he was about to kill a Saint.With one dead, the other party would definitely cause a chain reaction, and they would be able to quickly kill the other seven!However ... Now there were suddenly 9 more ... Although it was somewhat unexpected, it still made him angry that they had come so quickly!……On the Cang mountains, the Queen pouted. She had just wanted to watch the fun ... But Zheng Yu's side had actually joined the battle again. This time, it was still lively, but it was not as interesting as before.The battle power of both sides was almost equal.The key was that Li Hao was actually somewhat unable to defeat Ying Hongyue, and Zhang an was also somewhat unable to defeat the skeleton ...If this continued ... Li Hao would suffer a great loss if these two were defeated!The Queen laughed in her heart. Li Hao was so arrogant ... But didn't he still suffer today?That's good!This guy was too Savage. It was better to suffer a loss!If he didn't suffer a great loss, he would really think that he was the strongest in the world.……At this time, the most nervous people were none other than King Dali and Jiang Li. At this moment, both of them were behind Zhang an, but they couldn't help at all. Zhang an couldn't suppress the skeleton at all!The two of them were useless!Seeing the Nine Saints descend, he felt some pain. Damn it!F * ck!The chance was gone!There was still a chance earlier, but with the nine sages participating in the battle, there was no chance at all. Right now, putting aside whether they could win or not ... Whether the two of them could survive was a problem!As for the appearance of the city, the king of Dali didn't take it seriously at all!,m Only a few undyings...Were useless!Nine saints!It's not just one, if it was just one, there's still hope for these undyings to act, but the key is the nine of you, aren't you just seeking death by appearing to block them?Zhang an's expression also changed as he shouted,""If you dare to hurt them, I'll definitely kill you!""You'd better take care of yourself!"A Saint from Hurricane city sneered,""You still think it's the same as back then? Zhang an, without the Supreme martial artist, what are you?"Was it still a hundred thousand years ago?In the city, the descendants of the venerable sovereigns, the elites of martial Union and dingtian city, were all key figures of neo martial in the past, but now ... Weren't they just going to be slaughtered?

2289 Chapter 383
"Kill them!"One of the Saints shouted, and the Nine Saints attacked at the same time!Destroy this city!At that moment, heaven and earth seemed to freeze for a moment. Suddenly, a dim sword light flashed in the city. The sword light didn't look too strong, but it only lasted for a moment before it slashed across a person!Hurry up!It was incomparably fast!There was only one word to describe it-fast!In an instant, the leading Saint suddenly felt that something wasn't right. His body was still flying into the city, but ... How could he see his body flying forward?He was a little suspicious ... But someone beside him revealed a look of shock!His head ... Fell off!The sword light flickered, and the world changed colors.As the sword slashed over, one of the Nine Saints 'heads instantly fell off. The remaining few turned pale with shock and immediately began to counterattack, attacking the sword radiance together!There was an expert!Who was it?At this moment, a soft shout reverberated in all directions."Suppress!"Suppress!A character appeared, and it was as if it had suppressed the entire world. In a moment of confusion, the Saints froze for a moment, and it was at this moment that a sword pierced through two saints!Like skewers, the two saints were instantly sucked dry by the long sword!In the distance, Ying Hongyue seemed to have sensed something, and her expression changed drastically. She suddenly looked at Li Hao, who was still madly attacking her, and roared,""Li Hao?"In the city, Li Hao was also there!Damn it!How could that be?Li Hao, who had transformed into a fierce tiger and attacked him, suddenly sneered, as if he was saying,"you didn't expect it either?"In Hurricane city.As soon as Zheng Yu left, his expression changed and he looked up.In that instant, the three saints were pierced through, and their physical bodies were instantly shattered!A figure was floating in the air.It was Li Hao!"Eh?"In the sky, above the Silver Moon, the man with the sword on his back exclaimed in surprise."Li Hao?" the moon goddess was shocked.……In the early stage martial sacred Hall.Someone mumbled,"I was wondering what was wrong. It's a clone ... Why does it look so real? it's almost as if it's the real thing. It even has the power of a peak Saint ... Can a modern Martial Master create such a clone?"How strange!No wonder he could deceive the world!More importantly, this fellow had yet to appear even at this moment. He only appeared after Zheng Yu had sent out the Nine Saints ... It was clear that he was trying to kill all the Saints under Zheng Yu!He was quite bold!But ... Soon, the God of beginner martial shook his head.""It's not worth it ... This clone is very impressive. It's not worth exposing it in order to kill a few more Saints!"Of course, that depended on Li Hao's personal wishes.If he thought it was worth it, then it was worth it! ……With Li Hao's appearance, the situation changed drastically!Three saints had been killed in an instant! Holding his sword, Li Hao smiled brightly and said,""Thank you for your kindness, senior Zheng. Next time ... Send me a few Heavenly Kings!"As soon as he finished speaking, the long sword exploded, and sword Qi swept across the world!The six saints woke up!But the next moment, the sky suddenly split open, and billions of stars descended. With a rumble, the sky changed color, and the Saints were all terrified. Li Hao's aura suddenly soared, and he slashed out with his sword.BOOM!A Saint was killed on the spot!Not far away, the ninth master's expression changed. He suddenly turned around. In the air, the man with the sword on his back also suddenly stood up and muttered,""Ten thousand DAOs return to one sword!"The sword of the sword Saint!Although it was not exactly the same, at this moment, Li Hao truly displayed the style of a revered sword artist. For the first time, his sword was truly similar to that of a revered sword artist.Ten thousand DAOs return one sword!An upper-level cultivator!  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  A rank-6 killing a rank-8, a Paragon killing an undying!This was the sword Saint!He could even defeat a Heavenly King when he reached the level of a Saint!In terms of fighting above one's cultivation level, venerable the sword was the best in the world, not even the human King could compare!"One sword for 10000 DAOs!" A Saint screamed and was instantly crushed. The others 'expressions changed."Sword Saint?"At this moment, everyone thought of venerable the sword.The sword of the sword Saint!The appearance of the second Li Hao shocked everyone, and the Supreme sword's 10000 DAOs return one sword shocked the hidden experts even more. Even Zheng Yu and the man carrying the sword were shocked!One sword for one!At this moment, Li Hao's world seemed to be only filled with swords!The few Saints only had this sword in their eyes!Puchi!Another Saint was pierced through!In the blink of an eye, the physical bodies of the five Saints crumbled. The remaining four turned pale and fled the next second!It was a trap!It was a trap from the beginning to the end.Li Hao's real body was here. He could kill a Saint in an instant. This was his real body!To be able to kill five Saints in an instant ... This battle prowess was no weaker than that of a Heavenly King.In fact ... He was even stronger!However, no one dared to think about it."Where should we run to?"Li Hao laughed. At this moment, the world changed color. In an instant, a long sword seemed to pierce through the world and illuminate the world!"Slash!"The four Saints suddenly stopped as their shouts shook the heavens. The longsword slashed down, and two of the Saints were instantly sliced into pieces. The remaining two regained their consciousness, and they felt that something was wrong. It was a little terrifying!Li Hao's roar seemed to have stopped their thoughts!What kind of ability was this?They didn't have much time to think. At this moment, Li Hao's sword light shot toward them again. The two saints looked at each other in despair. Nine saints!In the blink of an eye, seven of them were killed!They ... Could not escape!"Li Hao ... You ..."BOOM!Explosions resounded through the sky. One of them self-destructed while the other fled in the air, about to shout. No, something was wrong with Li Hao. He seemed to have some special ability that could freeze people for a moment.
