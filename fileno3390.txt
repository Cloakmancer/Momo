"You're Li Hao ... Li Hao, you dare ...""You're too noisy!"Sovereign Wushan snorted coldly. 'Is this guy looking down on me?Five fingers appeared and plucked a string in the heavens and earth, as if fate was being affected. This made Supreme Emperor di yang feel a little uncomfortable. The next moment, Supreme Emperor Wu Shan, who had been inconspicuous all this while, seemed to be holding his breath and wanted to prove himself.Suddenly, a drum seemed to appear between heaven and earth.His five fingers turned into a fist and he punched the drum.Bang! Bang!It was like a beating heart, like the heart of heaven and earth, or like a call from the ancient times, causing Supreme Emperor earth Yang's heart to tremble violently. Not only that, but different colored light pillars appeared in Supreme Emperor Wu Shan's eyes.It was like ... The threads of fate, but also like the condensation of destiny.In Wushan's view, this was a heavenly secret!He cultivated heavenly secrets!The huge drum beat sent out a wave of fluctuations that rushed towards one of the black and red threads, even the pillar, trying to break it. The mist Mountain Thearch let out a roar. Normally, this technique didn't seem very powerful, but today, it could instantly break the heaven and earth.Bang! Bang!The sound of the drum reverberated again. With a boom, it was as if his heart had exploded. Supreme Emperor di yang took a step back and his face was filled with shock. What was this?Where did these people cultivate such strange DAOs from?Li Hao and the others didn't even look at them. At this moment, the four powerhouses attacked the two remaining stage seven experts at the same time. In the distance, the human King laughed."Kill!"He roared and charged at Fu Sheng!Li Hao was quite bold. Obviously, he wanted to join forces. They would kill the great beings of the Twin universes as fast as possible, and then join forces with him to kill the reincarnation Emperor who came to help!It was a good idea, but ... It was difficult to realize!But ... What did it matter?Try it!The human King was also an extremely arrogant person. At this moment, Li Hao didn't run away. Instead, he showed up and wanted to kill four level 7s and one level 8s ... His setup was exactly the same as his.This was clearly a provocation! Do you think I'm afraid of you?A huge saber swept across the sky. The human King was also incomparably crazy. Blood-colored energy gathered, and his qi and blood fused as one. Countless Dao laws appeared ...On the other side, Li Hao felt it. Hmm, Blood Blade technique?Almost everyone knew the moves that neo martial used desperately.He ... Knew it too!He had always been able to do it, but he had stopped using it because there was a limit to how much he could improve. It was very limited, and it would also harm his body. It was actually not worth it. Even if he improved it by just a little bit, it was almost not of much use.However, at this moment, the long sword in his hand suddenly turned blood-red. Blood saber technique!The qi and blood in his body surged, and countless qi and blood power appeared. His spirit was one, and the God of the five Forces fused. The Dao domain appeared, and with a slash of the sword, a thousand worlds appeared, and a thousand Dao laws burst forth!"Kill!" The human King roared.Li Hao also shouted,"cut!"“Who was faster?At this moment, the gentle Li Hao was no longer gentle. The human Emperor was exhausted. Who was he showing his sudden outburst to?I'm here to help you, but you actually let me see you explode ... Although you're a little old, I still want to save face!All Silver Moon martial masters wanted face!BOOM!The two of them exploded at the same time, and their blood Qi rushed into the sky. One was a saber, and the other was a sword. The saber was strong, and the sword was weak. If one didn't know better, they would have thought that the two of them were fighting. But at this moment, they slashed down at the same time!BOOM!A loud sound rang out almost at the same time. Their opponent, Fu Sheng, who was at the eighth step, took a few steps back. A bloody wound appeared on his chest. He was shocked!The stage seven expert in front of Li Hao was cut in half by the sword, and his eyes were filled with despair and death.It was as if he could tell that ... These two were secretly competing with each other.But ... Did I offend you?You guys, then we'll be targets?One of his opponents was at the eighth-rank, while the other was at the seventh-rank. They could not be compared at all. But at this moment, Li Hao had completed the kill, and the human King had only left a bloody mark on Fu Sheng. The human King's face suddenly turned ugly.He didn't care how strong his opponent was, he didn't care if he was exhausted, and he didn't care that he was at the eighth step while Li Hao was at the sixth step. He felt that he had lost face.Because ... He was older!Age was the human King's favorite thing to compare with. There was no expert younger than him. Now, this kid actually wanted to compete with him just because he was young."Bastard, why didn't you die?"The human King was enraged!Fu Sheng was so angry that he found it unbelievable. At this moment, it was as if the human King was the biggest victim as he roared in anger. 'Why ... Should I die?"Earth Sun ..."He roared,"di yang, let's work together! Experts from our realm will immediately come to help!"Bang! Bang!With another loud bang, Kong Ji recovered himself and returned to his peak. He punched out six divine fists again. With a loud boom, the last seventh level venerable sovereign was killed on the spot by their joint efforts!Fast, very fast.The four level 7 experts were also facing four level 7 experts, but ... In the blink of an eye, they were all killed.It was as if these people were not of the same rank.In the distance behind them, the outsider, Imperial venerable Kang Han, stood motionless under the watch of the Black Panther and the Queen. It was as if he had been frozen in place. This might have been the most exciting day of his life.In an instant, eight rank seven venerable sovereigns had died.Yes, a total of eight.In just an instant, the neo martial King killed four of them in an instant. The Silver Moon King's Group also killed four of them in an instant. Although there were many of them, they were still unbelievably strong.It was as if the rank 7 and rank 8 experts of the four-direction region were on a completely different level from the rank 7 and rank 8 experts here!Why ... Why?At this moment, the reincarnation universe seemed to be torn apart and the world exploded. A fist burst out from the distant reincarnation realm!The two figures seemed to have broken through the heavens and the universe of the great path. One of them and one of his fists shattered the heavens and earth, interrupting the teleportation of the reincarnation realm. Their cold roars resounded in all directions!"Human King, Silver Moon King, light comes!"With a single punch, the heavens and earth shattered, and the power of light emerged. Even though it was a little dim ... It did seem to be light?But ... At this moment, the human King and Li Hao cursed in a low voice at the same time!He didn't feel great that someone had come to help him. Instead, he cursed in his heart.How shameless, he actually impersonated light!This person was definitely the Dragon Lord!The great Dao trembled, and the sky and earth cracked. In the universe, the two level-eights trembled and fell out of the great Dao universe teleportation. They were extremely shocked. What came toward them were only thousands of fists!It was unbelievably powerful! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Who was it?Light?Impossible ... The light of the four regions was definitely not this strong. He was even ... A little afraid. This person might be stronger than the Samsara realm Lord!At this moment, three drastic changes took place, causing the entire upper three heavens to shake.A few level eight venerable sovereigns appeared in the world of Extreme Ice, and they were all shocked.Four-sided domain?No, this was more like a tier 9 huntian attack!Damn it!What was going on?Had the three Overlord forces come?Samsara seemed to be in trouble!……At this moment, in the world of Samsara, the death of four rank seven experts and the death of one expert with his eyes closed had shaken the world. However, he still maintained his composure.However, when the great Dao universe was shattered by a punch, the two level-eights who went to help fell out of the great Dao universe at the same time.At this moment, this person woke up and woke up.In his eyes, life and death appeared.It was like reincarnation.He opened his eyes and looked outside. His eyes instantly turned cold and sharp. Light?No!It was not light, it was ... Long Zhan!It was him!The eyes of the Samsara master instantly turned cold.Wasn't he unifying the four-sided region?Didn't he already have a life-and-death battle with new martial and silver Moon?Why ... Did they all attack at the same time? what exactly happened in the four-sided domain?He didn't have time to think about it anymore. A monstrous aura fluctuated out, and a stern shout resounded in all directions,""You dare!"I, reincarnation, am in danger today!

Chapter 3391 The Calamity Of The East (1)
In the First World of the Eastern Region, there were four type 8 powerhouses and more than ten Type 7 powerhouses. Their forces were huge and they dominated an area.This was reincarnation!The reincarnation monarch, the realm Lord, controlled life and death and was extremely powerful.Although he wasn't the absolute Overlord of the East, he was still the number one expert in the Eastern Region. Even the extreme Ice Emperor admitted that he couldn't match him.But today, in the world of reincarnation, three rank eights were in mortal danger.Fu Sheng was attacked by the neo martial human King.The remaining two level eights were forcefully knocked down during the teleportation process of the great path universe. They fell directly into the great path universe. The two level eights attacked at the same time. One of them was extremely powerful. He suppressed them with a punch, and the expressions of the two level eights changed drastically!Light?Bullshit!It was long Zhan, a peak tier 8 powerhouse.An expert with more than 6000 Dao laws was even stronger than a human King. Even the reincarnation Emperor might not be able to defeat him.……At this moment, the three battlefields all exploded with powerful auras. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Di yang was currently being attacked by a type 8 and many Type 7 experts.Fu Sheng was currently being attacked by the human King and the two Type 7 experts of the iron-eating race.The two eighth level venerable sovereigns were also being besieged by the Dragon Master and red Moon.Almost all the places were in a suppressed stage.At that moment, the reincarnation sovereign stopped his seclusion and many rank seven venerable sovereigns appeared behind him. They looked terrible and could not believe that someone dared to attack the reincarnation realm experts.It was unbelievable!At this moment, the Samsara Emperor crossed the void. The great Dao fluctuated and the universe shook as he headed straight for long Zhan.The speed was extremely fast!Even if he couldn't kill long Zhan, he couldn't let him kill the two eighth level venerable sovereigns. If that happened, the losses would be too great.Behind them, the rank seven venerable sovereigns wanted to follow. Then, the voice of the reincarnation Emperor rang out,""Stay behind and protect the world!"He was in great trouble today.If someone decided to go straight to the Samsara after seeing that the Samsara was empty, it would be a big problem.Especially in the extreme Ice world, there were three rank eight venerable sovereigns.He had to be on guard!As for him, life and death appeared. It was as if he had transcended the cycle of life and death. His might shook the heavens and earth as he charged towards long Zhan. At this moment, in the nine Heavens, in the Eastern Region, countless powerful venerable sovereigns looked up at the sky, their hearts trembling!The First World in the East!Today, he was ambushed.What a bunch of crazy people. Were these people crazy?Was this an expert from the square domain?A war had broken out in the four-sided region before, and the participation of hundreds of advanced venerable sovereigns was already shocking. They knew that the barbarians of the four-sided region were crazy, but they had never thought that they would be crazy enough to come outside.As for the Dragon Master, he sensed the arrival of the reincarnation Emperor and was not afraid. He only said with a little ridicule,""You're very bold. The three emperors of Extreme Ice are blind. Wouldn't it be great to seize the reincarnation realm with such a good opportunity? Hahaha!"As soon as he finished speaking, his aura rushed to the sky and earth, and a fierce shout resounded in all directions,""If you're here, then don't leave. Reincarnation? Can you defeat my divine light fist?"As soon as he finished speaking, he punched out!The heavens were shattered!This punch made the rank eight venerable sovereign's face turn pale. It was as if countless DAOs appeared between heaven and earth. With this punch, it was as if a huge sun, a world, and a giant dragon had descended.BOOM!A loud sound was heard. The eighth level venerable sovereign felt as if he had been hit by thousands of mountains. All his bones were broken, and his soul seemed to have left his body. The great Dao, life and death, everything was broken by this punch!This punch sent the eighth rank venerable sovereign flying, crashing into the heavens and earth. Countless chaotic force exploded like a meteor, and the eighth rank venerable sovereign disappeared without a trace.,m Is He Dead?He was probably not dead, but ... At this moment, it was hard to say whether this eighth rank venerable sovereign would dare to return.At that moment, the Dragon Master flew up and went straight for the reincarnation Emperor. He laughed crazily,""Your underlings are useless. Samsara, take my fist of light!"BOOM!He punched!The expression of the reincarnation Emperor, who had just arrived, changed slightly. With a wave of his hand, heaven and earth seemed to turn into a cage. The sky and earth spun, life and death appeared, and a passage appeared in front of him. With a punch, the passage shook, but the fist force disappeared.The next moment, the passage trembled. Suddenly, a fist force burst out like a fist of death and attacked the Dragon Lord."Small tricks!""You're too arrogant!" The Dragon Master shouted. The reincarnation Emperor also shouted in a low voice,"How dare you!"He was too arrogant!He was in charge of the Samsara realm, which was not far from here. It was almost like he was fighting on his own territory. He had grasped more than 5800 DAOs and dominated the eastern chaos. This man ... This beast was too arrogant!With 5,800 Dao laws, one could almost be regarded as a top-notch venerable sovereign above 6000 Dao laws. Although he was not a peerless Overlord, he was still a peerless expert in the Eastern Region.Long Zhan, Savage!Heaven and earth changed color. The life and death realm seemed to have appeared. Countless dead souls and living beings appeared between heaven and earth. However, when the long Fist went in, the heaven collapsed and the earth cracked. Countless realms were shattered!The reincarnation Emperor was shocked. This person ... Was so powerful!He had more than 6000 Dao laws, but he had a chaotic body. His physical body was extremely strong, and he could even be seen as a peerless expert with 7000 Dao laws. Such an expert already had the power of an Overlord!The spring and autumn of the South and the five elements of the North should be around this level of strength, right?How was that possible?It was still possible for humans, but could it be the same for beasts of primordial chaos?

Chapter 3392 The Calamity Of The East (2)
He didn't dare to believe it, but he didn't have the time to care about anything else.At this moment, he had the advantage of being in his territory and didn't have time to think. A huge seal suddenly appeared in his hand and he shouted,""Reincarnation!"The huge seal floated in the sky, as if the great Dao was being rebuilt.There was originally a world in the surroundings, but at this moment, it was instantly sucked into it. Countless people died instantly, and even the world began to die. The heavens and earth reincarnated, and countless people were reborn. Life and death rotated in a cycle, and it was extremely terrifying.On the side of the Dragon Lord, he also aged instantly. In the blink of an eye, his hair turned white. However, it was only for a moment, and a monstrous force erupted. Like the final radiance of the setting sun, he instantly burst out with a powerful and unparalleled force as he punched out!No matter how complicated or mysterious it is, I can break it with one punch!BOOM!At this moment, some of the top experts of the Eastern Region saw a scene that they would never forget. The powerful and invincible Samsara realm Lord was forced to retreat under this exchange of blows. He stepped through the chaos and collapsed the space. Blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth and his hair was disheveled. He was obviously at a disadvantage.While long Zhan also staggered slightly, but smiled.Samsara was no match for him!Samsara was strong, but ... They were only so-so.No wonder there was no Overlord in the East!The power of reincarnation was strong, but it was difficult to suppress others. It was too difficult. Not to mention himself, even if the neo martial realm human King encountered him alone, even if he couldn't match him, as long as he escaped from the area covered by reincarnation, it would be difficult for the master of reincarnation to make the human King stay.At this moment, all four directions were silent. He even forgot about the other battlefields.He was too strong!This person was definitely not light. Even if they could not feel it clearly, they knew that this person was definitely not light. If the radiant sovereign was so strong and was chased away by long Zhan, how strong was long Zhan?Ninth-rank?This person ... No, this beast must be long Zhan!The Overlord of the four regions!The group of people who had been sneaking around had their identities exposed one after another at this moment. However, they didn't seem to care too much. It would be best if they could hide it, but if they couldn't ... So what?……The Dragon Lord's display of might instantly suppressed the situation on the human King's and Li Hao's side.At this moment, the human King's face turned ashen. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  It was only human nature to care about one's pride. Be it fear, anger, or hatred ...Whenever a King of another person went out, he would always be the center of attention.There had never been a day like today, when others were like the brilliant sun and he was like a floating duckweed, no one cared. Perhaps only the anxious Fu Sheng here would care.He didn't expect that the limelight would be stolen by someone else even though he was the one who made the first move and killed four rank Sevens in an instant!This ... Was so hateful!He cared more about his reputation than Li Hao did. Li Hao might not care much about it at times, but for the human King, today was his true battle after he had reached level eight. But now, someone was stealing his limelight!Hateful, hateful! Long Zhan, do you know that you've angered me?At this moment, the human King tilted his head and looked at Li Hao. He suddenly grinned, his eyes filled with coldness."Kid, Earth Sun is nothing ... Do you have any chemistry?"Li Hao and the others were besieging di yang.At this moment, Supreme Emperor earth yang was summoning the great Dao universe. He wanted to escape into the great Dao universe several times and return to his homeland. There were still two level-seven experts on his homeland, and there was also the power of the world. It would be much safer to return to his homeland.He wanted to escape, but he was stopped several times.At this moment, he was extremely angry and panicked.Li Hao, on the other hand, had been attacking crazily, but he still couldn't kill the level 8 monster. Today, however ... Li Hao was not as angry as the human King, because the human King had already stolen the limelight.It didn't make a difference whether he was the second or the third.There was only one person who was the most eye-catching in the crowd.The position of the boss had been taken away, the most eye-catching position had been taken away ... Was there a difference between the second and third positions?There was no difference!Whether it was the second or third place, who would care?When the human King opened his mouth, Li Hao exhaled. In an instant, he shouted in a low voice,""Kong Ji, Wu Shan ... Go and assist in the battle!"What?The two of them were shocked!At this moment, they were fighting an eighth-tier Earth Sun. The earth Sun wasn't weak. Even if the five great beings joined forces, they could only barely suppress it. After all, the other party came from the Twin universes. Moreover, he could escape into the great path universe at any time here, which was much stronger than the square region.Now that the two experts had left, how could Li Hao, Dao Qi, and ER Mao suppress them?But at this moment, she couldn't think about it.Kong Ji instantly understood.It disappeared in the blink of an eye, and the Nirvana recovery domain reappeared, covering the sky and earth. A small flower bloomed in the blink of an eye. One of the eight rank seven venerable sovereigns 'corpses was instantly turned into energy. The flower bloomed and bore a fruit, which appeared right beside the human king's mouth.The human King laughed.So what if he was eye-catching?Whoever killed a level 8 first would be the most eye-catching!"Today, I, Fang ping, will definitely be the first!When the fruit entered his stomach, he instantly recovered 80% of his strength. He sighed in his heart. Although this nephew of his, Kong Ji, was weak, this domain was really good. This fruit also tasted good!Very good, the taste was extremely good!Li Hao was quite sensible. He knew that he couldn't embarrass his seniors, so it was indeed the best choice to have Kong Ji and Wushan come to his aid. As for running away from earth yang, it didn't matter.After killing Fu Sheng, if long Zhan was still there, then they would go to the Twin universes together and break through the Twin realm by force!The human King believed that Li Hao would consider such a simple question.Therefore, at this moment, when Li Hao asked the two most important experts to come to his aid, he knew that this kid had given up on stealing the limelight today.

Chapter 3393 The Calamity Of The East (3)
Today, I'm the most eye-catching one!As he recovered some of his strength, Wu Shan stirred the heavenly secrets as if he was changing fate. A huge drum appeared between heaven and earth again. His five fingers formed a fist and he attacked again. BOOM!Heaven and earth shook, and venerable monarch fleeting life felt as if he was in a trance. It was as if he could see the darkness of his fate, as if he could see that he would definitely spill his blood here and die an unnatural death.Impossible ... It can't be!I'm a venerable sovereign of the reincarnation realm, in charge of life and death. This place is in the East. I'm the top venerable sovereign of the Overlord realm, how can I die Here?He wouldn 't!In front of him, a small house seemed to have appeared, and within a square inch, the ground was drawn as a prison.That was ... The technique of the human King!The human King was not only reckless, he was also skilled in techniques. At this moment, the 5000 great DAOs had turned into a cage. As the cage appeared, it was like a world of its own. In this world, everything was extremely plain, but it was also full of mystery. Human figures appeared on the great DAOs as if they were all one. They suppressed the heaven and earth and were all human Kings!Life was like a dream, but he also knew that he was in danger!The realm Lord ... Seemed to be suppressed by someone. This ... Was unbelievable. None of the three rank eights of the Samsara realm could come to help. One was sent flying by the Dragon Lord and disappeared. No one could care about it now. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  One of them was entangled by the red moon, and the other was engaged in a fierce battle with the Dragon Lord. Now, three level 7s, two level 8s, and even an existence like the human King, were surrounding him to kill him ... It didn't seem like it would be a loss even if he died?In a daze, she only felt that everything was like a dream.On the other hand, Earth Sun was overjoyed.I'd rather die than my fellow Daoist!Moreover, he and Samsara were technically competitors. Now that Wu Shan and Kong Ji had been transferred away, it would be difficult for Li Hao, er Mao, and Dao Qi, who were rank seven cultivators, to stop him.He had no intention of retaliating ... Putting aside whether or not he could kill the three of them, even if he could, he would be in trouble if he delayed it.At this moment, he only had one thought-escape!Let's return to twin worlds first!There were still two level Seven venerable sovereigns and hundreds of venerable sovereigns in the realm. If they joined forces, they could protect them for a while. This group of people was so crazy and unscrupulous that they would be annihilated by the Joint Forces of all the eastern realms!Because they were too crazy.They had killed eight rank seven venerable sovereigns in an instant and were still besieging rank eight venerable sovereigns. Even Samsara was facing a fatal threat today. If they did not join forces to eliminate them, everyone would be affected sooner or later.At this moment, Li Hao had taken away Wu Shan and Kong Ji. He was obviously no match for di yang, so he had given up on killing him.Second cat didn't care, but Dao Qi was still a little unhappy.It's finished!"Today, we didn't get any benefits, but someone else took the initiative instead. Be it the human King or long Zhan, Dao Qi is not happy. This group of guys, we were the ones who had the idea of the twins first, but you guys are here to steal the limelight!But did Li Hao really give up?No, there wasn 't. When Thearch earth yang escaped into the great Dao universe in the next moment and was overjoyed to see the hope of escaping back, Li Hao also smiled.The teleportation in the Dao universe was very fast.The power of bed could teleport anywhere it covered. It was frighteningly fast. This was also the most convenient way to travel in the entire Primal Chaos. It was also very safe. There were actually very few people who could forcefully break through the universe of bed and shake people out like the Dragon Lord.Li Hao naturally didn't have the ability to do so.However, he had another ability ... He summoned the chaos lightning tribulation. Time appeared instantly. In the blink of an eye, Earth Sun, who had just escaped into the great path universe, seemed to be reversed time. His expression changed drastically, and suddenly, the power of lightning tribulation appeared above his head.Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't stay. Instead, he allowed the lightning tribulation to descend. He didn't do it to kill di yang, and he couldn't kill di yang. The power of the lightning tribulation would also affect him. Even if he could dissipate some of it, the one who could kill di yang would definitely kill him.At this moment, a long river of time appeared in front of him.He took a step into the river and in an instant, the chess piece and ER Mao appeared.Li Hao calmly looked at Dao Qi.""Merge into the river of time ..."Dao Qi was stunned. He didn't understand, but he still did it subconsciously. In just an instant, the river of time was originally illusory and didn't have the power of space transmission.However, at that moment ... It seemed as if he had it.Dao chess had the power of teleportation.Under Li Hao's lead, the three experts traveled along the river of time. In an instant, the Twin realms appeared before them. Outside the realm gates, one inside and one outside, the two seventh level venerable sovereigns were still trembling.He was conflicted!Struggle!It's over, something happened.What to do?Before they could think of what to do, a shocking scene appeared in the next moment. A long river seemed to pierce through the void, and Li Hao's group of three ... No, a man, a cat, and a soldier instantly appeared before their eyes.It really only lasted for an instant.The power of time combined with the power of space. At this moment, an unimaginable power erupted.In an instant, she had arrived at the eighth heaven from the seventh heaven.He appeared in front of a tier 7!He drew his sword!Devour!Suppression!The three experts, even er Mao, had learned to cooperate. They attacked at the same time. Their swords were drawn and the Qianjie appeared. In the distance, the human King's angry roar resounded through the heavens,"F * ck your Grandpa!"Li Hao was so insensible. He had almost killed Fu Sheng when Supreme Emperor di yang was suddenly pulled back. Seeing this, Wu Shan and Kong Ji hurriedly went to fight di yang!

Chapter 3394 The Calamity Of The East (3)
Fu Sheng took the opportunity to stabilize himself and dodged the second blade, almost hitting the human King's waist. This was not the key point. The key point was that the second blade did not kill the other party. On the other side, the Dragon Master had forced the Samsara venerable sovereign to retreat again. He turned around and killed the other level eight venerable sovereign who was being pestered by Hong Yue.With the Dragon Lord's strength, he might kill that tier 8 in advance ...This was not good!Li Hao, this grandson, can't show off himself, but he won't let me?What's the point of killing a seventh-rank?Even if he killed the remaining seventh-rank spirit beasts ... A seventh-rank spirit beast would still be a seventh-rank spirit beast, and an eighth-rank spirit beast would still be an eighth-rank spirit beast!Do you understand?Don't you know how to respect the elderly?Was it that difficult to satisfy an old man's wish?What are you running for?'It's just a twin universe. If you want it, I'll kill this guy and give it to you. You still want to fight it yourself?'I'm so angry!……Twin universes.Li Hao didn't care about that. He slashed out with his sword, and with a boom, the sky was cut open. The Tribulation lightning appeared, and the Tribulation Dao sword descended like a chaotic tribulation lightning. The Tribulation lightning above his head just happened to enter.BOOM!There was an explosion. Outside the realm gate, the seventh rank venerable sovereign was cut in half by the sword before he could even make a sound. He was not completely dead, but with er Mao and Dao Qi's attacks, their cooperation was very pleasant.In an instant, with a boom and an explosion, the seventh rank venerable sovereign was killed by Li Hao and the other two.As for the other one, he had just flown out of the realm gate when he immediately ran back with a face full of horror!Why would he suddenly appear here?It was too fast!Even di yang had not returned yet, but these three had arrived early.Each of them was filled with killing intent. The remaining seventh level venerable sovereign did not dare to stay. He was afraid that he had not run fast enough. Seventh level venerable sovereigns were usually invincible existences, but today, they had died one after another.The earth Sun World originally had eight Level 7s, but now, there was only this one.Two of them had been killed by the Dragon Lord long ago.Four more had died, and now, another had been killed. Far away, Supreme Emperor earth yang was furious, crazy, and terrified. Why had he suddenly retreated?It was ... The power of time!Yes, it must be!The Silver Moon King Li Hao had mastered time. The other party had killed their way to their lair. This also meant that they were in big trouble. Even if he returned now, if he was too late, he might end up walking into a trap.In the next moment, a scream reverberated through the world.The eighth level Seven venerable sovereign of the Twin realms was once again besieged by Li Hao and the other two. Countless low-and mid-level venerable sovereigns rushed over from all directions. Li Hao's sword strikes were extremely ruthless!The sword of calamity continued to slash out. After a series of slashes, there was a loud bang. The only rank seven seedling was finally killed under the realm gate by the three of them. Most of the middle and low-stage venerable sovereigns around them chose to escape! The next second, Li Hao disappeared.He disappeared from his original spot and appeared in another space in the blink of an eye. There ... Was a heart-like object. It was the source of the world, the source of the world.When Li Hao's sword stabbed into it, the heart seemed to still be beating. It sensed danger, but ... It was still stabbed!The entire world seemed to have gone silent in an instant.The world was dead.Yes, he was dead.When the source of the world shattered, the world would still exist, but the world would die and no longer give birth to life. The great path universe that was connected to the world would also be affected to a certain extent.At this moment, the universe of the great path suddenly shook violently. Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ The expression of Supreme Emperor earth yang, who was fighting with Wu Shan, changed drastically!He seemed to know what those people and Li Hao were planning to do. He forced himself to stop the turbulence of the great path universe so that he would not be killed here. Strictly speaking, he would become a wandering cultivator like red Moon sovereign ...However, if he became a rogue cultivator, he would definitely die today.However, he was not an itinerant cultivator. At this moment, with the death of the six rank-7s, the destruction of the source of the world, and the trembling of the great path, he did not have enough worlds to suppress the rebellion of the great path universe.At that time, he would still die.Bastard!At this moment, the river of time still seemed to be fluctuating. Li Hao and the others ... Were rushing over. Clearly, they were forcing di yang to cut off his connection with the great Dao universe and become an itinerant cultivator, or suffer the fluctuations of the great Dao universe ...Of course, the result seemed to be the same.Supreme Emperor di Yang's expression changed!The human King gritted his teeth, raised his blade, and slashed at the heavily injured venerable sovereign fleeting life. He roared,""Still not dead? Self-destruct!"Damn, he had a tough life!Are you going to self-destruct?He was already seriously injured and didn't look like he was going to die. If di yang died first, how embarrassing would that be!Hurry up and die!At this moment, the other party had even shouted for him to self-destruct. Obviously, he felt that self-destruction was not bad.Meanwhile, Li Hao also frantically returned!Accelerate, accelerate, teleport!I have to kill di yang before the human King ... This way, I won't lose face.……All parties were fighting for it.The Dragon Master had actually sensed it a little, so at this moment, he punched Hong Yue's opponent one after another, causing him to vomit blood crazily.

He roared,""Six tier 7 experts!"Bastard!He was actually defeated by the Dragon Lord.

Chapter 3395 The Calamity Of The East (3)
The great Dao fluctuated. In the world of reincarnation, another six level-seven cultivators stepped into the great Dao universe and were quickly teleported over. At this moment, they had no time to think about Fu Sheng.Today, one careless mistake and he would lose the whole game!……At the same time.On the other side, in the extreme Ice world.In the darkness, the Grandmaster sighed."Damn it, I'm too timid. I miscalculated. I miscalculated this time!"“……”On the side, the light Thearch was speechless.Yes, they were not near the reincarnation realm, but near the extreme Ice realm. According to the Supreme martial artist, reincarnation was too conspicuous. Even if a fight broke out, the other party would definitely be wary and not open the realm.However ... As long as the second Overlord of the East had the slightest ambition, perhaps the three rank-8s would bring the other rank-7s to battle. At that time, it would be an opportunity for the new martial artists. Break the ice!That's right, the Supreme, light, Emperor Cang, and a large number of seventh rank venerable sovereigns were all here.They were all waiting!He was waiting for the three level 8s to leave, attack Extreme Ice, break the extreme Ice Universe, and destroy one side.But ...Now, the Grandmaster was thinking, where did I go wrong?Was my consideration wrong?The First World is in danger. Whether you want to help or make money, shouldn't you go?You're just going to watch?Not moving?The three grade-8 experts were all watching.Are you all idiots?He really wanted to curse. Anyone with a brain shouldn't be here watching the show.At this moment, he really wished that these few people had some brains. They were full of schemes, but once the opponent had no brains ... There was really nothing he could do!"F * ck!"He cursed again.If I had known earlier, I would have gone to Samsara instead. I would have had a chance. But now ... The few rank eights in this Extreme Ice world might have frozen their brains from cultivating the Dao of Extreme Ice.Forget it, forget it!The Grandmaster was also too lazy to move. He would just watch from here. There was no other way. Even if he went now, it might not be too late.In the distant Extreme Ice world, the three rank eight venerable sovereigns had long been tempted.Two of them wanted to take the opportunity to go to war, but the third was a little hesitant, a little worried, and had some ideas ... So the three couldn't come to an agreement. With this delay, the progress over there was too fast, and the few of them were hesitant whether they should go now.The first two were still scolding the third one for missing the opportunity. The group of venerable sovereigns felt extremely regretful.However, they did not know that if they were to leave at this moment, the first to be destroyed today would probably be the extreme Ice world. This kind of chaotic situation was also the most favorite and most suitable scene for new martial artists.Only in chaos would there be opportunities! Unfortunately, this time, new martial arts missed the opportunity. The three emperors of Extreme Ice were still regretful and unwilling. Little did they know that the Supreme martial artist beside them was about to crack open their brains!She couldn't wait for them to go out immediately. Only then would she have a chance.……Everyone was trying their best to be the first to kill a level eight venerable sovereign, so that the powerhouses from the outer region could see who would be the first to kill a level eight venerable sovereign in the outer region and become famous!It was meaningless to compete with vulgar people for fame and fortune, but to be their opponent, someone who was not vulgar ... Face was still important.At this moment, even the young Li Hao couldn't hold back anymore, let alone someone like the human King.Just as the three parties were going crazy and wanted to be number one.Suddenly, an explosion shook the world.In a distant region, thunder and lightning erupted as the plenitude hell appeared. At this moment, the Thunderbolt Lord's furious roar resounded through the heavens and earth. He was exasperated."Bastard!"BOOM!The sound of an explosion resounded through the heavens and earth. The Thunderbolt master was furious. He was truly furious.It was like the explosion of Thunder!He had been perfectly fine and hadn't provoked anyone. While he was discussing with Sen LAN whether to help Li Hao and the others, a person suddenly fell into the Thunder World and almost split it apart.All of a sudden, the entire Thunder World seemed to be experiencing a great earthquake. It was unknown how many mountains and rivers had been destroyed.The lightning Lord was a man who sat at home, but trouble came from the heavens.A rank eight was struck by a peak rank eight's full-force attack. The attack pierced through the heavens and earth, directly crashing into the realm. The Thunder World was not a complete rank eight world yet. One could imagine how destructive it was this time.How could he not be angry?In his anger, the other party had been seriously injured. The lightning Lord happened to be in his own territory and was extremely angry. There was also Sen LAN beside him. In one go, in two, he would go all out. At this moment, he struck out a Thunderbolt, and ten thousand Thunderbolts exploded!The heavily injured reincarnation monarch was killed on the spot by countless Thunderbolts and the Asura hell with grievance and unwillingness while he was at a loss. Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ BOOM!It was the first rank eight venerable sovereign in the outer region, or rather, the Eastern Region, in a million years, to fall here. There were already rank eight venerable sovereigns from the Western Region who had died in battle.No, not counting Supreme Emperor Tian Yang.This nameless rank eight reincarnation realm venerable sovereign was the first rank eight to die in battle.“……”The world seemed to have gone silent for a moment.Without a sound.The next moment, the master of Samsara's angry roar reverberated in all directions,""Don't you dare!"Who was it?It was clearly an open space over there. There was no one there and no world. Therefore, he didn't care even if the level eight expert had fallen there. Since he was injured, it was best to recover before coming back.But ... Why did this world suddenly appear?And an eighth-rank one?In this chaos, were there grade eight experts everywhere?

Chapter 3396 The Calamity Of The East (3)
The Thunderbolt Master's Voice reverberated, and it was as if Thunder had covered the entire area. The rumbling sound reverberated through the heavens and earth. "I'm the lightning Emperor! Cultivators from the Silvermoon clan ..."Yes, he even added a suffix.Although a rank eight master had their own dignity and face, the situation did not seem to be like this now. It seemed that everyone wanted to make a name for themselves. Since that was the case ... It was not a big deal to add one more.Besides, if he didn't cooperate with Silver Moon, the reincarnation Emperor would be very strong!He didn't seem to be able to afford to offend them!At this moment, the Thunder Emperor's horn resounded in all directions.He was the first to kill a powerhouse of the eighth step!The Thunder Emperor of the square region!……Li Hao landed.His face was expressionless. It didn't matter since he didn't embarrass himself.As for the human King, he let out a furious roar and slashed out with his blade, finally destroying that annoying Fu Sheng. However, he didn't have the time to take back the words that were about to come out of his mouth!"New martial artist Fang ping, today Zhan Fusheng is here ..."His roar resounded through the heavens and earth. However, the human King regretted it. What the hell was he shouting for!Isn't that embarrassing?The first one to kill a level 8 was considered to have some face, but the second one?He had lost face!He was a step too late!He was going crazy!In the distance, the expression of the reincarnation Emperor changed completely. In an instant, two level eight experts died, and the great Dao universe shook. At this moment, the Dragon Master seized the opportunity and punched out. He punched out continuously. BOOM!The third level 8 was directly blown up by him!The Dragon Lord was also expressionless.Third.It was average."I thought that I would definitely be the first one to complete the killing. In the end ... I underestimated these people. Of course, there's nothing that he can say about the lucky bastard, the Thunderbolt master. It was clearly him who sent the person flying with a punch. It was such a coincidence that he fell into the Thunder World and was killed by the Thunderbolt master ... This ... How can this be reasonable?"At this moment, the reincarnation Emperor's expression changed completely and he roared,""Retreat!"Retreat!Recall!Out of the four tier 8 experts, three had been killed in an instant. He simply couldn't believe it. It was as if the world had collapsed and he was going crazy.Moreover, one of them had been killed right under his nose!Bastard!Retreat!If he didn't retreat now, he might be in deep trouble today.He quickly returned, and six rank seven venerable sovereigns appeared behind him. On the other side of the realm gate of the reincarnation realm, four more rank seven venerable sovereigns appeared, and there were more than ten rank seven venerable sovereigns in the reincarnation realm. At this moment, in the blink of an eye, they all appeared.The venerable sovereigns looked as if they were facing a great enemy.The reincarnation realm Lord quickly returned. Behind him, many venerable sovereigns appeared. There were ten Level Seven venerable sovereigns, and there were more than a hundred of them. Among them, there were a bunch of level six venerable sovereigns.At that moment, they all looked solemn!There's big trouble. Today, there's the danger of the realm being destroyed.,m As for the Samsara Emperor, he didn't have time to think or speak. He quickly suppressed the great path universe and shrank its area. The power of the world swept over and instantly integrated into his body. Countless great path power was all absorbed into his body.He was already prepared to fight to the death, and he even roared,""The four regions are attacking. Today, my Samsara is destroyed. There is no power in the East that can rival them. The eastern realms will be broken through. These barbarians and beasts will destroy realms and realms. They will use all means to destroy them. They will not leave any survivors. Are the realms going to sit back and watch?"The reincarnation monarch, who once wanted to dominate the East, was now asking for help!If I'm killed, the teeth will feel cold if the lips die!……While Samsara sovereign was roaring madly, Li Hao and the others completely surrounded Supreme Emperor Earth Sun. Supreme Emperor Earth Sun watched helplessly as Fu Sheng was killed by the human King and the three rank-eights of Samsara died a violent death.The Samsara overlords were all asking for help, trying to work together to defend against the invasion.His face was deathly pale. Everywhere ...Who would have thought that the four powerhouses would be so crazy and ... Brutal!He looked at Li Hao's group and knew that he was probably finished today. Despite his unwillingness and hatred, he still smiled bitterly at this moment. In an instant, the power of the great Dao in his body surged wildly.Li Hao was also helpless!Self-destruction?I'm so F * cking unlucky!He was still too weak. There had never been a moment where he was as depressed as now. It was fine if he couldn't kill the first tier 8. Be it the lightning Lord, the human King, or the Dragon Lord, they didn't even give the other party a chance to self-destruct when they killed.When it comes to me ... The earth Sun is going to self-destruct!At this moment, Li Hao craved strength. Before, he had thought that level six and Level Seven didn't matter, but now ... It was different.It really did matter!The seventh step was still a bit stronger."Time stop!"Li Hao murmured and shouted in a low voice. Time seemed to have stopped. In an instant, countless lightning bolts appeared again. Li Hao looked at the lightning bolts in the sky and laughed."Since I can't kill a rank 8 today, then ... I'll use the Tribulation lightning to enter rank 7. This trip won't be in vain!"'Since I can't kill a rank eight, I'll step into rank seven right here and now and become a rank seven calamity Emperor!'Are you guys going to snatch it from me?At this moment, Li Hao tidied up his clothes and floated in the air like an immortal. Thousands of worlds and thousands of swords appeared in the sky. The Dao of tribulation, the Thunder tribulation, and the Dao of tribulation were all in his heart.Since I can't be the head of the Phoenix, I'll be the head of the chicken.At this moment, I'm going to reach Level Seven and show you that I, Li Hao, have some ability!"Under the chaos lightning tribulation, I will reach rank seven!

Chapter 3397 The Calamity Of The East (3)
A low roar resounded through the heavens and the earth. The Tribulation lightning was instantly shattered, and the power of thousands of tribulations rushed at Li Hao. With a low roar, another corner of the firmament sword in Li Hao's hand was shattered.The power of the Tribulation became Li Hao's tonic.A Grade 7 aura spread out.Li Hao wielded his sword and slashed at di yang. In order to save Li Hao's face, Wu Shan, er Mao, Dao Qi, and Kong Ji all went crazy and unleashed their full power to suppress di yang!All of this was so that Li Hao wouldn't lose face.He killed the earth Sun with one sword strike!The human King, who was not far away, pursed his lips.Forget it!With a wave of his hand, an invisible force appeared between heaven and earth, and a hidden saber intent instantly slashed toward the earth Sun!Li Hao's catastrophe sword principle also fell instantly!Supreme Emperor di Yang's face was filled with sorrow and helplessness.Isn't it laughable?These bastards!In order to let Li Hao kill them, they all unleashed their full power without uttering a single word. Even their energy fluctuations were being restrained.This ... What was he trying to achieve?Two level eight and many Level Seven experts, a group of people, were actually all trying to kill him ... His death could be considered to be more worth it than venerable sovereign Fu Sheng 's.It's more worth it than those two, right?BOOM!The sword fell, and it was as if tens of thousands of Thunderbolts had appeared. As the sword slashed out, the earth Sun instantly shattered and exploded in the chaos.Chaos fell silent.Four level 8s and 10 Level 7s were all killed on that day. In less than half an hour, the record for the most tragic death in the outer region in a million years was set.The number of grade 8 powerhouses participating in the battle was even more than he had imagined.Heaven and earth fell silent.The surroundings fell silent.The human King curled his lips, and Li Hao was expressionless. Neither of them seemed happy.In the distance, long Zhan and the Crimson Moon stood in the void. Long Zhan also had an indifferent look. He suddenly laughed coldly and said coolly,""Guangming still has something to do today, so he won't participate. Samsara, I'll spare your life, but I hope you can survive! That's ... Interesting!"In an instant, the two grade 8 experts disappeared from the world.In the distance, the reincarnation Emperor looked miserable.Long Zhan, what are you still pretending for at this moment?Today, three rank eights and four rank Sevens died in the reincarnation realm ... This was the most severe loss he had suffered since the creation of the world. His dream of becoming an Overlord was completely shattered at this moment!It was extremely tragic!"Four-sided domain!",m He let out a shrill cry, and his voice continued to spread, causing the nine Heavens and earth to tremble.Four-sided domain!On this day, everyone remembered the four-sided domain. They remembered that it was a barbarian's domain that they had previously forgotten.In one day, more than ten advanced venerable sovereigns had died.Terrifying, frightening, and hateful!Thunder world's Thunder Emperor, neo Martial Emperor, Silver Moon Li Hao, light Emperor ... Yes, there were still people who did not know long Zhan and only thought that he was really light Emperor.In the distance, the light Thearch was speechless.F * cking, long Zhan this bastard!'Although I've made a name for myself, most of the powerhouses know the truth now, but the other three regions might not. What should I do if a level nine like huntian doesn't know and insists on sparring with me?'He really ... Had nothing to say.However, at this moment, if he tried to defend himself, even if the weak believed him, so what?They might even think that I, the light Thearch, am afraid and have to hide my name!The Supreme martial artist shook his head as well. He didn't care much about these people who had become famous, but ... He was also heartbroken to see the extreme Ice that he had obtained disappear.At this moment, none of the powerhouses were happy.

Chapter 3398 Preparation (1)
Borrowing the power of the Tribulation lightning, his tribulation Dao stepped into Grade 7.The sword slashed at the sun.There wasn't much trouble. After all, with the help of so many experts, it would be too cowardly if he couldn't kill an Earth Sun.After di yang died, the Samsara Emperor retreated. Even if the other realms wanted to join forces, it was highly unlikely that they would come to an agreement.At this point, the four regions "experts" first surprise attack had been a perfect success.He had killed four at the eighth step and ten at the seventh step ... If he counted Xiao Chen, who had been killed before, he had killed eleven at the seventh step.One surprise attack and the battle results were impressive.However, he was not really happy. Li Hao's goal was not to kill. It was just that the atmosphere had already been set. If he did not kill Earth Sun, he would be letting everyone down.The human King beside him was also looking around, seemingly a little bored.Boring. Why is no one participating?Li Hao didn't think too much about it. With a wave of his hand, a world spiraled toward the human King. The human King caught it subconsciously. Seeing that it was thrown by Li Hao, he smiled."Pay up?" Li Hao nodded.The human King laughed."Senior human King, can you return the IOU to me?" Li Hao also smiled.An IOU?The human King was taken aback for a moment before he nodded. In the next moment, thousands upon thousands of loan slips appeared before him. He scanned them one by one and soon found one in a corner. He chuckled and said,"Actually, you don't have to pay me back in a hurry."Li Hao smiled and glanced at the space he had put away.Countless loan slips ... How many people owed money?Li Hao quickly got his loan receipt. After glancing at it, he sighed with emotion and waved his hand, turning the loan receipt into ashes.He had finally exchanged all his debts.Oh, I still owe one. This time ... I'm almost done."The Twin universes were originally the target of neo martial ... This time ..." Li Hao said with a smile.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ The human King knew what he meant and waved his hand,""What you captured naturally belongs to you, and whoever kills it will get it. I've always been like this! I killed Fu Sheng and the other four tier 7 experts, so these are mine and the rest are yours. Wu Shan and Kong Ji helped me block Fu Sheng for a while, and I also helped you block him for a while ... We're even. "Simply put, you take what's yours and I'll take what's mine.They were unrelated to each other!"Then ... I'll go and collect the Twin realms to avoid any trouble!" Li Hao smiled and nodded."Of course."The human King looked around."We've done something big this time. For the time being, these guys won't dare to provoke us. However ... You should be careful. Next, all parties will definitely think of ways to deal with us." "This is interesting!" He laughed.Then, he looked behind him as if he was looking at the Thunder region or the four-way region. He raised his eyebrows and sneered,"That old dragon isn't a good person either. I didn't expect him to come out in secret. You should be careful of him. He might not be in a hurry to deal with me. But you ... After killing so many beasts of primordial chaos, he won't let you go."Actually, the human King felt that it was pretty good for the Dragon Lord to make a move.It was just that ... The Dragon Master and new martial actually didn't have a deep hatred.However, with Li Hao, they would fight to the death.Li Hao had killed his wife and a bunch of his subordinates. On his territory, Li Hao had massacred and annihilated the world ... Even if the Dragon Lord didn't care, in order to give an explanation to his race and chaos beasts ... In any case, Li Hao would definitely not be at peace with the Dragon Lord.Li Hao nodded slightly. This guy was quite difficult to deal with.However, he was not that afraid.He also glanced behind him. The Dragon Lord was very strong, but the Dragon Lord also had many things to consider. At this moment, he might not be willing to have any conflict with his side.Even though they knew that this might breed trouble, the other party held back and did not make a move.The Dragon Lord had his own plans and arrangements, and he wasn't willing to be led around by Li Hao's group.It was a problem, but it was not too scary."I'll be leaving then ..."Li Hao cupped his hands slightly and led everyone to step into the river of time, heading straight for the Twin worlds in the distance.As for the human King, he cleaned up the battlefield and chuckled. He looked at the two iron-eating beasts and said,""I'm leaving ..."At this moment, the iron eater Thearch was somewhat at a loss and also somewhat shocked.After killing Fu Sheng, they were shocked that the Dragon Master was so strong that he could actually beat a top powerhouse like the Samsara Emperor back to his lair.At this moment, he was a little moved. He was actually able to survive after going against the Dragon Lord?The other point was that they were shocked by the boldness and madness of these people.He had thought that the iron-eating race was crazy enough, but compared to these guys, they were still far from it.Even though they sensed the arrival of the reincarnation realm's venerable Emperor, none of them retreated. Even Li Hao took the initiative to attack and a battle broke out. If not for the Dragon Lord's intervention, wouldn't these people have to face the reincarnation realm's venerable Emperor?Countless thoughts ran through his mind, and just as he was about to say something, the human King laughed,""There's no need to follow me. Samsara has retreated. They're no longer hunting me down for you. If you want to act alone, then find a place to wander. It's very dangerous to be with me. If you don't want to ... Go find the Thunderbolt master or someone else from new martial arts. It's fine.""Human Emperor...Is going to leave alone?"The iron-eating Emperor was a little surprised, but he also felt that it was natural.The human King nodded.It was rare for him to come out, so was he going to go back now?

Chapter 3399 Preparation (2)
As for now, it was only the Eastern Region. He would continue to walk around and see.The iron eater Thearch did not say anything else. The human King waved his hand, and the corpses of the four stage seven experts and the power of great DAOs appeared."This is your reward. Fu Sheng's level eight is mine. It's just the power of a great Dao, not a world or universe ... Just make do with it!""I can't ..."Before the iron eater Thearch could reject, the human King had already left. He disappeared in an instant, not giving the other party a chance to reject. He had always been so overbearing.……Outside the Gemini world.At this moment, almost all the venerable sovereigns who could escape had escaped. They had come with Li Hao and the others, killed two level Seven experts, and destroyed the world origin. None of the venerable sovereigns who could escape were left behind."Senior Dao Qi ... The Twin universes are yours!"Dao Qi was a little surprised and shocked."You guys ...""I owe you!"Li Hao smiled and said,"I took away your level-eight universe earlier. I'll return it to you today." As for the others ..."He looked at everyone."We killed six Level 7s and one level 8s, but they all came from twin universes. This time, we will shatter them and merge them into the Twin universes to form a complete twin universe. This way, senior Dao Qi will probably be able to truly recover his level 8s."Dao chess was a ninth-level Emperor weapon with an eighth-level universe as its base. It might not be ninth-level, but it definitely had the power of an eighth-level.Now, after giving him the complete twin universes and the seventh-tier universe from before, it wouldn't be a problem for him to recover his peak power.As for the others ... None of them showed any signs of advancing.At the moment, absorbing the power of a level Seven or eight venerable sovereign's great Dao was not very useful to them.It didn't make much sense.Li Hao continued."The Thunderbolt master's side has also been exposed. Senior Dao Qi quickly absorbed and refined it, and the Queen took away the personnel. Black Panther, go and absorb some of the remaining world power and refine the entire world ... Then we'll leave."The few people who were called out quickly took action.Dao Qi was a little embarrassed. He had given all the battle results to himself, but ... After some consideration, he didn't say anything. If he absorbed all of them into the Twin universes, he did have a chance of recovering to his peak level.Eighth-ranked power! Since Li Hao had said so, he didn't hold back.Er Mao, Kong Ji and Wu Shan didn't have any objections. They had all just advanced and fighting a battle in such a short time was a good thing. Fighting with a strong Class 7 or Class 8 was far more important than devouring some energy.Li Hao then looked at the extremely timid Kang Han and smiled. He casually extracted a large amount of world power and great Dao power, fused them together, and compressed them into a giant ball. He then threw it to the confused Kang Han."Daoist Kang Han, you're leading the way this time. Be careful. No one should be paying attention to you. You can leave now."Imperial venerable Kang Han was shocked and in disbelief. Let me go?"Senior, this ...""Let's go back. While we're still here, ordinary people won't dare to come and investigate. Otherwise, once we leave, there will definitely be experts coming to investigate!" Kang Han's gaze was a little complicated.The cultivators of the four regions were too terrifying. They had started a massacre as soon as they came out, but ... Why did he feel that they weren't that terrifying?He was still very reasonable.His thoughts were complicated, but he also knew that it would be dangerous if he continued to stay. He didn't dare to say anything and bowed slightly."Then this junior will take his leave!"He wanted to say something, but in the end, he didn't and quickly disappeared.As for Li Hao, he also silently comprehended the various great DAOs in the Twin universes. The universe trembled, the world was in turmoil, and people were in a state of panic. Countless people threw themselves into the divine Kingdom, and countless people entered the hell beneath the divine Kingdom.There were countless people in the Queen's divine Kingdom, so many that it was impossible to count.Li Hao just watched in silence.Too many worlds had been destroyed, many large worlds and even more small and medium-sized worlds. Large numbers of people had been thrown into the divine Kingdom ...How many are there?A trillion?Or a few trillion?The believers in the divine Kingdom were now living off the power of Chaos, while the non-believers in hell were even worse off. They were only able to survive by relying on some power of chaos.In fact, it was not a world. It was just a warehouse to accumulate manpower.This actually wouldn't work.Too many worlds had been destroyed.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  There were humans, demons, and other creatures living in the divine Kingdom, but Li Hao could not take them away.Should he continue to leave it in the God Kingdom?Would he become a numbed tool of faith?Li Hao watched as the Queen recruited people. At this moment, he was silent.In the previous battle, Li Hao had fought with the human King, Dragon Lord, and the others. He discovered that his strength was clearly inferior to theirs, and there was no doubt about it.Secondly, there was another difference.These people actually had something more, something less, and something more than him. It could be called a responsibility. The human King bore the heavy responsibility of the rise of new martial, while the Dragon Master had to delay the chaos race.These people actually had their limits.The Dragon Master had been restricted in the four-sided region, and the human King had been pinned down in new martial until recently.Perhaps, he wouldn't be able to be free for a few days.He, on the other hand, did not have any of that. Although he had always brought Silver Moon along, Li Hao had only brought Silver Moon along and had not caused him much trouble.
