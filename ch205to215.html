        Chapter 205: Blizzard Silver City branch (3)
        Translator: 549690339
        Patrol was divided into three ranks, two ranks, and one rank. Patrol was divided into low-level and high-level. The same was true for City Patrol, which was divided into two ranks: low-level City Patrol and high-level City Patrol.
        
        Of course, the word “low rank” would not be said in general. It was only said in private. In fact, everyone thought that it was the same for low rank City Patrol and low rank City Patrol.
        
        As for advanced, the word “advanced” would be added to make it seem more advanced.
        
        Liu Long also revealed a smile and pressed his hand, “I’m just forcing the duck onto the rack, there’s no other way! The establishment of Blizzard Silver city’s Nightwalker division isn’t as simple as a promotion. Everyone understands the significance of this. ”
        
        “This time, I’ve called everyone here to share my joy. Another reason is mainly to find a candidate for the Deputy Minister. If it’s one person, then I can recommend one. If it’s two people, maybe one of them will come from Whitemoon city to take on the Deputy position, and I’ll recommend the other one.”
        
        This was also the usual practice.
        
        As soon as she said this, Liu Yan glanced at Yun Yao and immediately knew why her boss was hesitating. She snorted,””If she wants it, then just give it to her. I don’t care! After all, he’s a superhuman, and I’m just a warrior!”
        
        Liu Long was a little speechless, who was he implying?
        
        Who wasn’t a warrior?
        
        Me too!
        
        On the other hand, Yun Yao’s expression was calm, as if she was not angry at all. When she saw Liu Long looking at her, she said calmly,””I don’t need it. If she likes it, then just recommend her. She’s the vice-captain and also the patrol. She’s just enough.”
        
        The two of them expressed that they didn’t mind.
        
        On the side, Li Hao, who hadn’t said much, suddenly said carefully,””Um ... Can I say something?”
        
        Everyone looked at him in confusion.
        
        Why are you interrupting?
        
        You also want it?
        
        Don’t mess around!
        
        Li Hao looked embarrassed and said carefully,””That ... I ... I have a small suggestion, really, a small suggestion! The Vice Minister is usually a patrol envoy, and sister Liu is already one. ”
        
        “In the team, there’s me, brother Wu, brother Chen and sister Yun. We’re all level one patrol inspectors.”
        
        He had just been promoted two days ago, but unfortunately, he did not manage to become a patrol.
        
        Li Hao continued,”why don’t we discuss this? boss recommends one of us to be the Deputy Minister ... Ahem, the officials only say so. In private, sister Liu will still be the Deputy Minister.” “This way, we can have one more patrol. The salary will be higher and the benefits will be better. As for the other benefits of the Deputy Minister, we can give them to sister Liu ...”
        
        “Maximize the benefits!”
        
        Li Hao added,”otherwise, even if sister Liu goes up, she’ll still be an investigator. It’ll be difficult to even get promoted to an advanced investigator. It’ll be too much of a waste!”
        
        Liu Long and the others were dumbfounded!
        
        This debt could be calculated in this way?
        
        They had never considered this, because to them, the rank was not that important.
        
        Li Hao, however, didn’t think so. He continued,””I heard from Wang Ming that even among night watchers, different ranks have different treatment, but strength is one thing, and ranks are another! Some of the old patrol inspectors and night patrols may not be very strong, but they are very experienced. Now that they have been converted to civil servants, they have a high position and a considerable amount of power!”
        
        “If that’s the case, then let’s not take this matter lightly. It doesn’t matter in Silver City ... But ...”
        
        Li Hao said excitedly,”but we’re all improving. One day, we’ll all become supers. We’ll have more than a hundred thousand ... If we’re still part of the night patrollers, our ranks will be very important!”
        
        “For example, boss, after being promoted to City Patrol, if he is arranged to white moon City, he will also have a good position. But if boss is still a patrol, and goes to white moon City, there are a lot of patrol envoys in white moon City, at that time, how would boss be arranged?”
        
        “Our position is high, and we have a lot of power. When the Silver City is really unable to hold on any longer, we will be able to speak up, and we will be able to smoothly relocate the residents of the Silver City. I don’t believe that all the higher-ups in Silver Moon province are supers, at the level of the sun and three suns!”
        
        Liu Long fell into deep thought. After a moment, he took a deep breath, looked at Li Hao, and said in a deep voice,””You’re right. From the perspective of Silver City, it doesn’t really matter. But if we really can’t defend Silver City and join Whitemoon city ... That rank is indeed very important!”
        
        “Now, the government is run by ordinary people and supers, and it’s not entirely based on strength. Some of the stronger supers don’t have the time to manage the city, so most of the work is done by ordinary people.”
        
        After saying that, he looked at the others.”Li Hao’s reminder is right. Even if Liu Yan becomes the Deputy Minister, she can’t be promoted. She hasn’t been an inspector for long, and she still needs some time to become a Senior Inspector. As for you guys, you can use this opportunity to become inspectors!”
        
        “I’m not interested,” Yun Yao refused again.”I’m not interested in this.”
        
        Wu Chao smiled faintly and said,”boss, stop looking at me. I can’t do it. Not even in name! Let fatty Chen go ...”
        
        “I can’t either!” Chen Jian said naively. Boss, you know that I’m scared when I see those high ranking officials. If I become the Deputy Minister, I’ll have to receive some big shots ... My legs will go soft, right?”
        
        Liu Long was slightly stunned. None of them were willing?
        
        He looked at Li Hao again, who was elated.””Boss, I’m willing!”
        
        “……”
        
        Everyone was silent.
        
        Even Liu Yan couldn’t help but laugh,”did you know that they weren’t willing, so you said that on purpose to get promoted?” I say, little Haohao, you’re still so young and you’ve already been promoted to a patrol officer. Aren’t you satisfied?”

        
Chapter 206: Blizzard Silver City branch
Translator: 549690339
Li Hao smiled radiantly.”Sister, you can’t say that. If I graduate from the Silver City ancient Academy, I’ll become a level one patrol inspector very soon!” Therefore, the promotion a few days ago ... Was not really a promotion. The inspector is the one who has really been promoted!”

“If brother Chen and the others are willing, of course I don’t have any thoughts. After all, I’m young. But brother Chen and the others aren’t willing ... Then of course I have to serve everyone well and contribute to the team!”

Although his words were pleasant to hear, in reality, he wanted to be promoted!

He was so happy!

The patrol!

First, the salary was higher.

Secondly, if he went to Whitemoon city, he could indeed arrange for a better position ... No one wanted to start from the bottom, not to mention that Li Hao had already been cleaning the secrets room for a year.

Third, a higher level, higher status, and higher level of contact would be useful in the future. For example ... It would be easier to obtain some information about the red moon.

Liu Long looked at Li Hao, speechless.

He had thought that Li Hao had suggested this because he wanted someone else to be promoted. Good Lord, in the end, everyone had rejected him, but this fellow had chosen him without hesitation!

It’s really good!

At such a young age, he was a fan of being an official.

“Li Hao, can you do it?”

Liu Long furrowed his brows.”Even if the higher-ups agree, they’ll still have to examine you. How old are you? and you ... Slashing Ten Realms ... I’m afraid it’ll be a little difficult.”

Li Hao quickly said,”boss, this is simple!” Just tell the higher-ups that you’re pulling me in to stabilize my teacher. If I were an ordinary patrol officer, I could run away at any time. But if I’m a patrol envoy, I’m already considered a middle-rank officer. In order to win over my teacher, what is a mere patrol envoy worth?”

Good fellow, he even found a reason for himself.

However, it had to be said that if he were to report this, the higher-ups would probably not care about Li Hao’s strength. He would just be a decoration, a hub that connected the night patrolman and Yuan Shuo.

“I’m afraid some people will say that you got in through the back door ...”

“It doesn’t matter, I don’t care!”

Li Hao was very determined!

I’m not afraid of this. Getting the patrol envoy is the real benefit.

Liu Long was speechless this time. He looked at Yun Yao and the others,””Are you sure you don’t want to fight?”

Yunyao shook her head indifferently. Wu Chao smiled faintly. Chen Jian was extremely simple and honest. He said honestly,”Let Li Hao come. He has more prospects than us!”

The main reason was that Li Hao was too sinister!

Chen Jian still chose to support him, in case the kid became stronger and set him up.

That was too evil!

Wu Chao and Yun Yao didn’t have any objections. Although Li Hao was weak, everyone knew what kind of person he was. They all knew how Yue Ming and a person with a fitness level above 100 had died.

He was a ruthless person!

He wanted to be promoted, and everyone was willing to help him. The others were more concerned about whether they could become supers.

“Then let’s do this!”

Liu Long didn’t expect this to be the final result. At this moment, Li Hao was grinning from ear to ear.

The patrol was in his hands!

Liu Yan didn’t mind and said,””Boss, we need at least 10 people. We only have 6 people. Even if we have a Deputy Minister, we won’t be given more than that.”

Liu Long pondered for a moment before shaking his head, “It’s hard to say! They might be equipped with it, but they might not. If no one from the higher-ups came, then they would have to wait for a period of time for the newcomer to advance! The White moon City will soon be recruiting new people from various cities to carry out energy absorption, and they might give us a few new people, Starlight Masters. ”

Hearing this, the few of them pouted as if they didn’t think much of it.

What’s the use of being a Starlight master!

It would only be useful if a few dark moons came.

Li Hao also recovered from his excitement. After thinking for a while, he said,””Why don’t we recruit them ourselves?”

“There are only a few supers. If we could recruit them, they would have been recruited long ago.”

“I’m talking about the Martial Master!”

Li Hao explained,”recruiting martial masters!” There aren’t many powerful martial masters in our Silver City? If it didn’t work in the local area, what about other places? Although martial masters are not as powerful as supers, if we give them a chance to become supers ... Martial masters are willing to contribute! Furthermore, once a Martial Master advances, they can also become a Dark Moon after cutting Ten Realms. They also have enough experience, which is stronger than newcomers. ”

“We’re at the edge of Silvermoon province, and we could be in danger at any time. It’s really not appropriate to bring new people ...”

Liu Long wanted to curse, you’re just a newcomer, yet you’re still disdaining others!

However, on second thought, which newcomer had killed the hundred-year-old and Yue Ming as soon as they joined?

Li Hao also had the right to despise it!

“I’ll try!”

Liu Long didn’t refuse his suggestion, although there might not be any martial masters willing to join. Martial masters were more willing to work for some large organizations.

Of course, that was in the past.

With the establishment of the night patrolman division, he was no longer the captain of the Demon Hunter team, but the official head of the night patrolman division. This was more authoritative than the captain of the Demon Hunter team, and was an officially certified superpower organization.

At that time, the higher-ups would distribute some mysterious energy, which was much better than having to kill people before.

At the side, Liu Yan touched Li Hao’s head with a smile. Li Hao felt a little uncomfortable. What’s wrong? why are you touching me?

This person always liked to take advantage of him!

Liu Yan smiled.”Little Haohao, you’re quite smart. If it wasn’t for your lack of strength, you could even be the branch head!”

Liu Long glanced at her. What did she mean?

“I don’t mean anything else. Don’t misunderstand, boss!” Liu Yan laughed. I’m just a little curious. Little Haohao’s absorption speed of mysterious energy was very fast before. This time, he obtained 32 cubic meters of mysterious energy. How much did he absorb? What level had he reached in the tenth realm? Yunyao has also become a moon Hades master, and Wu Chao and Chen Jian have only been absorbing the mysterious energy for the past two days due to their injuries ... You’re not injured at all, how are you now?”


Chapter 207: Blizzard Silver City branch
Translator: 549690339
Hearing this, Liu Long became curious.

Everyone could tell that Li Hao had not become a super.

Has he made any progress in the path of Martial Master?

The mysterious energy was still of great help to his strength.

Li Hao was a little embarrassed.”It’s so-so. I didn’t improve much. It’s a bit of a waste of mysterious energy.”

As for how much I’ve improved ... If I say that I’ve broken through 100, you might not believe me. Even if you believe me, you’ll be sad. After all, I’ve only entered the tenth severing realm a few days ago.

Liu Long saw that he was unwilling to say so he didn’t ask.

As for improvement, perhaps he had advanced a bit in the tenth level, but the middle stage of the tenth level? Late stage?

Late stage at most!

As for breaking through 100, he had never even considered it. It was almost impossible.

“Alright, then everyone should rest well for the next few days. In two days, the official documents will be issued. The higher-ups should have a decision on how to make arrangements. Also, I will submit Li Hao’s promotion to Deputy Minister.”

At this point, he couldn’t help but sigh again.”Li Hao, it’s a pity that you don’t work as a civilian.”

This guy was so determined to be promoted. He might as well work in Civil Affairs, which gave him a feeling that he had a better future.

Li Hao hurriedly said,”boss, isn’t this all thanks to you?” “Otherwise, I wouldn’t have had a chance. Besides, it’s all thanks to you guys. You know I’m young and poor, so give me a chance and increase my payches...I went to my house yesterday. The last time the bomb blew up, it was near my house. The whole building was about to collapse. I’ve been thinking of looking for a new house these few days!”

That’s right, although his house didn’t collapse completely, it was almost done.

On the night of the battle, there was a huge explosion in Silver City. The district where Li Hao’s house was located was one of the targets of the red moon.

At that time, it was only to lure Liu Long away, so no one was hurt. However, the explosion still caused the old building to collapse a little. The uncles and aunties downstairs were so scared that they fell from the bed. It was said that they broke their legs and were taken away by their children.

Now, there was no one making noise there, but it was indeed not suitable to live there.

Li Hao was just thinking that he should find a new place to live. He couldn’t stay at his teacher’s house all the time. One or two days was fine, but as time went on, his teacher would appear and disappear unpredictably. Even when Li Hao sneezed, the old man would appear and say,”young people should pay attention to self-control.”

After so many times, even Li Hao couldn’t handle the old man anymore.

“Come and live with big sister!”

Liu Yan put her hand on his shoulder and smiled charmingly.”Big sister’s bed is huge!”

“Forget it, I’m afraid I’ll wake you up,” Li Hao said, embarrassed.

“How could it be!”

Liu Yan smiled happily and pinched Li Hao’s face.”You’re so cute. How can you disturb me?”

Li Hao looked at the others for help, but they all avoided his eyes and looked at him as if they were watching a show.

Liu Long didn’t care about them and waved his hand,”Alright, you guys can leave! Also, be careful when you’re out, Li Hao. Even if you find a place, try not to go too far away from the Urban area, or you won’t even have a chance to rescue him!”

“I know!”

Everyone left.

When he walked out of the office, he saw mu Sen walking towards him. Everyone greeted him, but did not talk too enthusiastically.

However, mu Sen was very friendly. He greeted everyone and then looked at Liu Yan. He laughed and said,”Congratulations, leader Liu. Next, I’ll call you the Liu tribe!”

Liu Yan smiled radiantly.”Don’t say that. The Secretary is the city Patrol. Moreover ... I’m not the Minister!”

Then, he left with Li Hao.

Mu Sen must have come to discuss this matter. It was unknown how he would react when he heard that Li Hao was to be recommended as Deputy.

After walking for a while, they were a little far from mu Sen. Liu Yan then retracted her smile.”This fatty is not simple. Don’t be fooled by his smile! The time mu Sen entered the 100 + mark might be even earlier than boss! I don’t know what this fatty is planning to do by coming to Silver City to work, but I heard that his family has some background in white moon City. Don’t offend him if you can, but don’t get too close to him!”

“Oh?” Li Hao nodded and asked curiously,”is the director a hundred-year-old?”

“It’s hard to say. It might be the Super who was fighting against the fairy. I heard that he cut someone down with one strike ... Anyway, he’s at least in the later stage of the 100-plus stage!”

Li Hao understood and didn’t ask further.

……

At the same time.

White moon City.

Night patrolman Silvermoon provincial headquarters.

Wang Ming’s face was full of shock, and after a long while, he said painfully,”I ... I’m going to be the Deputy Minister?”

To Silver City again?

I don’t want to go at all!

I was so embarrassed over there. If I go, won’t I be laughed at?

Moreover, that place was too remote. He didn’t understand why the higher-ups wanted him to go there.

I’ve already advanced to full moon, which is equivalent to a late-stage hundred-plus cultivators. I’m considered a young genius in the Nightwalker headquarters. Is it appropriate for you to arrange for me to be there?

“This is the decision of the division ministers. First, you are Yuan Shuo’s disciple in name. It will be easier for you to gain a foothold there!” Second, you and Liu Long have fought together once before, so he will accept you more easily. Third, pay attention to Li Hao’s every move!”

Huang Yun said in a deep voice,”Li Hao, the only successor of the eight great families!” Although no one mentioned it now, it didn’t mean that they ignored it! You know Li Hao. If you go, you’ll be able to get in touch with him and even protect him ... Red Moon won’t give up so easily! Of course, we’re keeping an eye on all of their experts, but the red moon is huge, and we can’t keep an eye on all of them!”

“Wang Ming, you’ve gone over there with an important task! Don’t worry about the resources, I won’t leave you out. Contact me if you need anything. ”

Wang Ming wanted to cry but had no tears!

To put it simply, Silver City was extremely far away from here, and under normal circumstances, it was impossible to contact them.

This is the end!

Was this considered a exile?

“What about Hu Hao and Li Meng?” he couldn’t help but ask.

If he was unlucky, these two ... Wouldn’t be better than him, right?

Huang Yun laughed,”the two of them? The Silver City’s Nightwalker organization isn’t strong enough, and there aren’t enough people. If you three moon nether join it, you’ll be able to build the entire framework! If you become the Deputy Minister, they’ll have to see how they arrange it. At the very least, you’ll be better than them. ”

When Wang Ming heard this, he consoled himself for a while. It seemed to be true.

But ... He really didn’t want to go!

Especially when he went and faced people like Li Hao and Liu Long, it was really hard to bear.

However, since the higher-ups had already made their decision, he couldn’t reject them. He could only plead,””When things settle down there, can I come back at any time?”

“Of course!”

“That’s good. ”

Wang Ming heaved a sigh of relief and hoped to return as soon as possible. Silver City was really too small, and it was also a place where he was sad.

After Huang Yun sent Wang Ming away, he smiled again and muttered, “I’ve finally gotten it over ... Come back ... Come back when the Silver City is about to migrate!”

The higher-ups had already made a decision, and the migration plan continued.

As for Silver City, it was also in this list.

As for when, that would depend on the situation.

Chapter 208: A new official takes on a three-handed approach (1)
Translator: 549690339
Blizzard Silver city’s night patrolmen division was about to be established.

On the 28th of July, the Silver Moon province officially sent out a letter to begin the construction of the Silver City branch.

As soon as the news came out, the other cities were either envious or jealous.

Out of the 32 cities in Silvermoon province, only 9 cities had night watchmen branches.

Silver City was the tenth city to establish a branch of night watchers.

The number of night patrols was limited, and most of them were concentrated in the big cities. Whitemoon city had a population of 30 million, and yaoguang city had a population of more than 10 million. In some other cities, branches would only be set up with a population of five million.

Population was an important assessment indicator.

Those who could not do so would not set up a division of night patrollers in case their superpowers were too scattered and they were destroyed by other organizations.

This was the first time a Silver City branch had been established.

However, considering the existence of Yuan Shuo and the secrets of the Silver City’s eight great families, this branch was eventually established.

Not only that, but this time, the Whitemoon city also took it seriously and sent three supers.

And not a newcomer!

All three of them were at the Dark Moon realm, and it was said that one of them was at the Dark Moon and full moon realm.

……

28th.

Li Hao didn’t pay attention to the documents sent by the higher-ups.

At this moment, he was wandering around a courtyard house. It was a very large house with a building area of more than 400 square meters. Most importantly, it had a courtyard of more than 1000 square meters.

A house with its own courtyard!

Li Hao took a deep breath as he read.

“Sis, aren’t you overestimating me?” he couldn’t help but turn to Liu Yan.

Liu Yan enthusiastically insisted on finding a house for him.

Li Hao really couldn’t change her mind, so he could only ask her for help.

Good fellow!

I’ll let you find a two bedroom apartment, preferably on the first floor. If not, it’s better to find a place with better soundproofing.

In the end ... Liu Yan had brought him here early in the morning.

It was located in the East District of Silver City, which was considered a rich area.

Almost all the rich people in Silver City lived here.

On his way here, Li Hao had already felt that something was amiss. The property prices here were very expensive. The average price in Silver City was more than 3000 Yuan, but here, it had already reached 5000.

When Li Hao was a third-level patrol inspector, his monthly salary was 2000 star coins.

In Silver City, it was actually still okay.

If he scrimped on food and drink, he could save up 20000 to 30000 Yuan a year. This was mainly due to the public’s livelihood. Many things could be reimbursed. There were also some bonuses. With them in hand, it would not be a problem to save 20000 to 30000 Yuan a year.

Even so, if one wanted to buy a 100 square meter house, it would usually cost more than 300000 Yuan. It should not be a problem to work for ten years without getting a promotion.

Of course, now that Li Hao had been promoted, it would be much easier.

However, in a place like this, wouldn’t a large courtyard with its own door cost more than four to five million?

Li Hao didn’t dare to overestimate it!

At least this much!

He did not have any money. As for selling Mystic abilities, it was illegal to sell them to other supers, and to sell them to their own people ... They did not have any money.

Liu Yan was also looking around with a smile on her face. She didn’t seem to mind. “What’s there to overestimate? You’re going to be the deputy head of the Nightwalker division soon. You’re one of the top figures in the Silver City! Do you want to live in a tube-shaped apartment? As for the house ...... You’re already a patrol, are you still afraid of not having a house to live in?”

Hearing this, Li Hao clicked his tongue and said,””Corruption?”

“Tsk!”

“Is that all you know?” Liu Yan asked in disdain. What greed? This was the spoils of war! Do you understand? According to the rules of the night patrolman, the spoils of war would be handed over and distributed according to the rules! This house is our loot from last time!”

Spoils of war?

Li Hao was stunned.

“Have you forgotten about that Zhou He?”

“Oh, oh, oh, I remember!”

Li Hao remembered this person. He was the first Martial Master he had killed ... No, the one who had been killed during the interrogation of the captain and the others.

“He bought this!”

Liu Yan laughed heartily,”Oh right, there’s also a car. You’ve seen it before.” It’s also in the inspection office’s garage now. You can drive it away! This Zhou He was arrested by you. Now that you’ve been promoted, you can keep his house and car for now!”

Only now did Li Hao realize the origin of this house.

He couldn’t help but say,”that Zhou He, a tenth realm, is so rich?.”

“Nonsense, he’s a Martial Master and has been running this business for so many years. Think about it, if you’re willing to sell the mysterious energy from this loot, you’ll be a multi-millionaire immediately!”

To them, earning money was still very easy.

However, what was the use of some money?

The truly good things were hard to buy even if you spent money.

Take this Zhou He for example. If you asked him to take out money, he could take out three to five million, but could he use this money to buy three to five cubic meters of mystery?

It would be very difficult!

And even if he bought it and absorbed it, there wouldn’t be much benefit.

Liu Yan was speechless at Li Hao’s low standards. Although she had no money, Liu Yan would never worry about money. She was not like Li Hao, who only knew how to raise his salary!

If word got out, people would laugh at him.

Previously, he wanted to be promoted in order to raise his salary. This was also a big joke.

Li Hao laughed dryly. He was still inexperienced. Since he was young, the richest he had ever been was when he was getting paid by the inspector. Last month, he had saved up 12000 Yuan!

In the end ... There was no point in saying.

He looked at the big yard again and walked in to take a look. The outside was retro, but the inside was luxuriously decorated and quite modern.

There were two floors in total and an underground parking lot.

This was the front yard, and there was even a swimming pool in the backyard. It was no different from those villa areas, and the garden-like buildings suited Li Hao’s taste more.

Chapter 209: A new official takes on a three-handed approach (2)
Translator: 549690339
“It’s really big!”

Li Hao mumbled. Liu Yan happened to turn around and saw him staring at her. She suddenly smiled. “You’ve opened your aperture?”

After saying that, she puffed out her chest.

You even know how to praise people!

You have good eyes!

Li Hao sobered up and was speechless. He shifted his gaze and looked elsewhere. He was a little tempted.”Sis, this ... Don’t the others need it? You’re just giving it to me like this, is that okay?”

“It doesn’t matter!”

Indeed, Liu Yan didn’t really care about this,”actually, we spend most of our time at the inspection Office!” You’re still young and haven’t been in the team for long, so you still have the habit of going to work and leaving for work. We’re different. We’ve been in the team for a few years. Most of the time, when we’re free, we’ll stay at the inspection Office. ”

They didn’t go home often ... When they went home, there was no one.

What was home?

It was just a house!

His real home was long gone.

Liu Long had said that the members of the demon hunting squad all had their own stories. He had never heard of them having a family, a wife, or children ...

Chao Wu and Chen Jian seemed to have been living in the basement.

Yunyao was the same. Every time Li Hao saw her, she was also there.

The captain would disappear sometimes ... As for whether he went home or somewhere else, it was not clear. Maybe he didn’t even have a home and just went out for a walk.

Liu Yan was the same!

These people had already treated the team as their own.

Li Hao didn’t say anything else. He didn’t really care. However, he needed to absorb mysterious energy and practice martial arts. Some secret techniques couldn’t be taught to outsiders. They were taught by his teacher unless he agreed.

Otherwise, if he were to practice his breathing technique in the basement, it might leak out.

This can’t be!

Li Hao didn’t say anything more. He entered and continued to watch.

On the first floor, there was a living room, guest room, bathroom, and a gym. On the second floor, there was the master bedroom, study room, and children’s room.

Li Hao didn’t need most of the rooms.

The house’s decorations weren’t brand new, so someone must have lived there before. This was even better. Li Hao didn’t need to do anything. He didn’t have the money for decorations.

Li Hao had everything he needed. What he needed to do was simple. He only needed to bring a few sets of clothes.

The more he looked, the happier he was.

He wasn’t at the level of Liu Yan and the others, who still had material needs. In the previous neighborhood, he would be scolded for just one set of boxing moves, which made Li Hao feel terrible.

It was all good now!

The front and back courtyards were frighteningly large. They were over a thousand square meters, and he could do whatever he wanted!

At this moment, Liu Yan was already lying on the sofa on the first floor. Seeing Li Hao come down, she said with a smile,””Little Haohao, the house is very big, and it’s very empty at night. Are you scared to live alone? How about big sister comes to accompany you?”

“……”

Li Hao calmly looked around.””Sis, do you think I should hold a banquet or something and move in?”

“As you wish!”

Liu Yan’s face was filled with dissatisfaction. Little fellow, are you ignoring me?

Li Hao was so happy that he didn’t want to discuss this with her. He continued,””Sister, the higher-ups said that they’ll be sending three night watchers this time, and they’re all at Yue Ming’s level. In this case, our team has six people who have broken through a hundred and Yue Ming!”

Not counting himself.

Including himself, there were a total of 7 people.

To be honest, this kind of strength was really not weak.

Silver Moon province now had 10 branches including Silver City. Apart from the lack of sunlit-level branches, Silver City had a total of seven people who had broken through the 100th level, which was not any weaker than the branches in other cities.

“Hmm, it’s alright!”

Liu Yan didn’t feel any pressure either. She had broken through 100 points. Otherwise, she would’ve felt a little pressured.

“Including us, we have nine people now. If we recruit one more, we can more or less meet the minimum requirements.”

Liu Yan continued,”boss means that I’ll be the leader of the operations team. Out of the three people from the top, other than the Deputy Minister, the other two will join the operations team. Without a strength of over 100, we can’t suppress them!”

“Boss wants to form a five-man team for the operation team. Super Wu, Chen Jian, one Scout, one defender, I’ll be the main attacker. As for the two supers, we’ll distribute them based on their abilities. ”

A team of five people could meet some basic needs.

There were too many people, so a stronger commander was needed. Liu Yan couldn’t make all the arrangements.

“What about me?” Li Hao was puzzled.

“You’re officials!”

Liu Yan laughed,”first officer, second officer, the three of you will be drinking tea, reading newspapers, and listening to reports in the future!” What, I can still count on you officials to go to the front line?”

Li Hao was speechless. Liu Long used to be the team leader.

Seeing his silence, Liu Yan quickly smiled and said, “I’m just joking. You guys don’t need to go on missions with us. If we encounter danger, we’ll naturally attack together! The boss wants you to be in charge of some basic civilian work. Now that there are more people in the team, the formal framework has been set up. We need some documents to process and file ... Including some intelligence gathering work, which will be done by you in the future. ”

“There are also contributions, allocation, resource reserves, warehouses, and so on. You need to calculate and divide them. You’ll be very busy!”

The logistics work was not that easy.

It was just that it would be relatively safer.

In the past, they were all on the same side, and the credit was distributed by Liu Long. However, once they joined the night patrolmen, the same rules were still in place, and outsiders might be dissatisfied. This was something that Li Hao had to do.

When Li Hao heard this, he didn’t say anything. Logistics was logistics, so be it. He actually didn’t care.

In the past few days, Li Hao had also been doing some filing work ... Yuan Shuo’s file was the kind of wordless heavenly book that was kept in his mind. Li Hao felt that his brain had become numb.

Chapter 210: A new official takes on three responsibilities (3)

However, his teacher would make him memorize a lot of things every day. He had no choice but to force himself to do so.

If he really went out to the field, Li Hao wouldn’t be able to handle it.

At this moment, Liu Yan stood up and said,”I’m done, let’s go back!” The efficiency of the Nightwatchers is not bad. Those few guys will probably be here in the afternoon, so we still have to receive them. As for your official appointment, it should be here by this afternoon. ”

Li Hao nodded, and the two of them left together.

Li Hao didn’t have a car. Although Zhou He said that he had given him Zhou He’s car, he was still at the inspection Office.

Liu Yan did have a car ... From the inspection Office.

Li Hao wasn’t sure if she had one.

When she went out, her car was parked at the entrance of the courtyard. She didn’t drive it in, but she could.

The environment in this area was very good. There was more than one small courtyard. There were some other small courtyards nearby, but they were quite far away. The nearest one was two to three hundred meters away, giving each resident the greatest privacy.

Just as Li Hao and Liu Yan were about to get into the car, a small black car stopped in front of them.

The car window rolled down, and a person stuck his head out, revealing a smile.””Captain Liu! What a coincidence, to be able to meet here. ”

It was a man who didn’t look too old, in his thirties. He looked very pleasing to the eye and gentle.

Li Hao didn’t know her, so he glanced at her.

Liu Yan also smiled. Li Hao was stunned. Her smile ... Was really brilliant.

Without waiting for Li Hao to ask, Liu Yan walked over with a bright smile. Li Hao had no choice but to follow her. However, he felt a little awkward. Why was she so enthusiastic?

It’s not that I have any thoughts about Liu Yan, but I’m a man. It’s fine if you treat me well, but if you treat others well ... I’ll be unhappy.

Just as he was deep in thought, Liu Yan took out something from behind her back. The next moment, a pair of handcuffs cuffed the hands of the other party. The smile on her face instantly disappeared.”You followed me!”

“Liu Yan, you ...”

The man was a little annoyed.”I’m living here. I just happened to see you. What are you doing?”

“You followed me!”

However, Liu Yan’s face was frosty,”what a coincidence. We just happened to meet?” “I suspect that you’re in contact with some illegal organization. Come with me to the inspection Office. In addition, with your identity, you may know that the night patrolmen’s branch is about to be established, so I have reason to suspect that you’re investigating the night patrolmen’s movements. You’re dead for sure this time!”

“Liu Yan, you’re framing me!”

The man was furious.”Don’t try that with me, Liu Yan. Enough is enough. I’ve already said that it’s just a coincidence ...”

Liu Yan snorted coldly,”we’ll talk about whether it’s true or not after we’ve entered the night patrol!” If you can come out alive, then you’re telling me this! Li Hao, come here and escort the suspect to the night patrol for trial!”

Li Hao was also a little confused, and his thoughts from just now disappeared.

At this moment, he only had one thought. Was there a need to?

He could scare her, but it felt like Liu Yan wasn’t willing to accept him because he was pursuing her. However, it didn’t seem appropriate to send him to the inspection Office, right?

Even though he thought about it, he still quickly stepped forward, grabbed the handcuffs, and said in a deep voice,””Get out of the car!”

“Don’t you dare!”

The man was furious. He glared at Li Hao, and his calmness disappeared.

If Liu Yan really charged him with spying on the night patrolmen’s movements, he would be skinned even if he didn’t die.

“Liu Yan, don’t go too far ...”

“Try being stubborn again?”

Liu Yan’s expression was cold.”If you continue to be stubborn, I’ll treat it as you’re resisting law enforcement. I’ll kill you on the spot!”

The man instantly shut up. A wise man knew better than to fight when the odds were against him. He suppressed his anger and gritted his teeth.”Alright, I was wrong! Liu Yan, I’m not spying on you. I’m just passing by, and my house is just ahead! Besides, the night patrolman division hasn’t even been established yet. What am I spying on?”

“Look, the official document was just sent and you already know about it. If you’re not spying, what are you?”

The man shut up and did not say a word.

There was no need to continue.

Liu Yan sneered and said,”Li Hao, uncuff him and keep a close eye on this guy. If he does anything out of line in the future, kill him on the spot!”

“Yes!”

Li Hao answered and unlocked the handcuffs. Soon, he followed Liu Yan into the car of the inspection Office. As for the man, he was staring at them with an angry face from the rearview mirror.

……

In the car.

“Sister, who was that?” Li Hao asked curiously.

“Qiao Peng!”

As Liu Yan drove, she calmly said,””He lives in the building in front of you. Keep an eye on him! This guy also has another identity, the Vice President of the Qiao’s mining company, and his father is the boss!”

Qiao’s mining industry!

Li Hao instantly remembered and was a little surprised.””He’s a big entrepreneur in Silver City. He’s rich. I heard that the Qiao’s mining industry has billions of assets ... Is that true?”

Also, how did this guy become enemies with Liu Yan?

“Qiao’s mining is not simple!”

“On the surface, it’s a mining industry, but in reality, it’s a company that’s secretly exploring the archaeological ruins! The Qiao’s mining company had a professional mining team ... Or rather, a team that stole ancient ruins. Of course, it wasn’t that easy to mine the archaeological ruins. I suspect that they are related to a superpower organization ... It might be the Crimson Moon!”

“Why do you say that?” Li Hao frowned.

If it was confirmed, the company should have been uprooted.

“The Qiao’s mining company has been established for many years, and it’s located in Silver City. You know Silver City, there’s nothing there. They say there’s a mine outside the city ... Bullshit, I haven’t seen anything in these years! However, the Qiao’s enterprise has been staying here. I didn’t think too much about it before, but ever since the attack of the Crimson Moon and the existence of the eight great families in Silver City, I’ve suspected that these guys have something to do with the supernatural organization!”


Chapter 211: A new official takes on three responsibilities (4)
Translator: 549690339
“It might not be Hong Yue, it might be Yama!” Liu Yan said after a pause.

Why did it change again?

Li Hao felt strange.

Liu Yan sneered,”anyway, it’s 80 – 90%!” Without evidence, it was just a guess. Your brother-in-law was an engineer at the Qiao’s mining company, and he was in charge of some trivial matters. Once, he came back and told me that something unusual had been dug out of the mine, and it could be an ancient monument ... It was different then and now, and I didn’t pay much attention to it ...”

“Not long after, your brother-in-law died. He was killed!”

“The person who killed him was a security Captain of the Qiao’s mining company. It was said that because the two sides had a conflict at the construction site and had an argument, the guy was so angry that he threw a stone at your brother-in-law to death!”

“When I received the news, I immediately brought people to capture that fellow. During the capture process, that fellow escaped. Not long after, I received news again that that fellow had joined the Yama and absorbed enough mysterious energy to become an existence at the level of a Dark Moon in one fell swoop!”

Li Hao listened and frowned slightly.”Sister, do you mean that the Qiao mining company is in contact with the Yama? they might be the Yama’s base in Silver City, and their purpose here is to excavate the ancient ruins. What’s more, brother-in-law discovered something and then killed them?”

“Eight or nine out of ten!”

“Then ... Why didn’t you tell the night patrolmen?”

Li Hao mentioned that the night patrolmen might seem useless, but ... They were the only superpower organization in the government.

“You just offended Red Moon. Do you think the night patrolman can still offend Yama if you tell him now?”

However, Liu Yan saw it more clearly than him.”The night patrolmen’s strength may not be comparable to any of the three big families. Now that they’ve already fallen out with the red moon, do you think they can withstand it if they fall out with the Yama as well?” If word got out and Yama found out, it would be even more troublesome and you’d be looking for trouble. ”

Li Hao nodded. He thought about it and decided that perhaps he shouldn’t say it.

But he still said,”sister, if you don’t show this guy any mercy today ... Aren’t you afraid that he’ll suspect that you know something ...”

“You don’t understand!”

Liu Yan suddenly smiled.”If I ignore him, he will suspect that I know something. Now that I’m about to join the night patrol, if I suddenly treat him rudely, he will feel more at ease. At least I don’t know any secrets. Otherwise, I would have held back.”

“Li Hao, it’s not always a good thing to be patient. It’s easy to be suspicious.”

“Also, the Silver City’s eight great families ... You’re the only descendant of the eight great families. I’ve checked, and the other seven families are completely gone!” Those who went to the outer city also died in various accidents. ”

“So, the Silver City must still have some secrets. I suspect that the Silver City has the remains of the eight great families. Li Hao, if that’s the case, what they’re excavating right now might be your family’s ancestral grave!”

Li Hao was speechless.

Ancestral graves ... That sounded so weird.

Liu Yan continued,”this time, Hong Yue’s movements were so big that even those who didn’t know about the eight great families before now know.” Including the Yama and the fairy, I suspect that they might have known about it before. There are also some small to medium-sized organizations and night watchers. ”

“Look at how calm it is now, but that’s not the case.”

“Everyone’s eyes might be on you now. The fact that you’re not leaving the Silver City means that you’re in danger as well. You haven’t shown it yet because elder Yuan is here. Once he leaves the Silver City, you’ll see that this place will become the most chaotic place in the entire Silver Moon province!”

Chaos!

This was inevitable. Liu Yan wasn’t a fool. She had already guessed that the reason for the silence was because there was an expert who had severed three suns here. However, once the other party left, there would definitely be chaos.

Li Hao was silent.

After a while, Li Hao said,”sister, if you know it’s going to be chaotic, why don’t you leave?”

“Leave?”

“Where to?” Liu Yan laughed. Besides, why should he leave? Chaos is good! Wealth was found in danger! As a Martial Master, I’ve yet to enter the realm of superpowers. I’m currently craving for a large amount of mystical powers! Once The Night Watcher division was established, there would be rewards for killing supers from the enemy camp. With my salary and the mysterious power to kill supers, this is my chance. ”

“Otherwise, I’ll never be able to become a superpower since I just broke through 100.”

She knew that this place was dangerous, but so what?

She was not afraid!

They were gambling on the danger of this place. Only with danger would there be a chance. Otherwise, how many years and months would it take for them to enter with an identity of over 100?

“I still have to thank you for breaking a hundred,” she suddenly added.

This ‘thank you’ was a little meaningful, and it was hard to tell if it was joy or helplessness.

That’s right, Li Hao played a huge role in her breakthrough.

This guy had given her a large amount of that special energy. When she returned, she realized that her physique had been strengthened and her superpower lock had become more stable. This was the reason why she had advanced to over 100.

She had not mentioned this before.

Li Hao was stunned.me?

Sword energy!

“I ...” Li Hao understood. He was also embarrassed.”I only wanted to heal you.”

“I’m fine. ”

Liu Yan continued to drive and smiled.”Breaking through 100 is good. At least I have some ability to protect myself. If I can’t level up even with my superpowers, I can’t protect myself at all in the current situation.”


Chapter 212: A new official takes on a three-handed approach (5)
Translator: 549690339
Li Hao didn’t say anything.

He was thinking about other things.

The eight great families, had they really attracted attention?

He knew that this would happen, but everyone seemed to be avoiding talking about it. He thought that everyone didn’t care anymore, but it turned out that they did.

Although the eight great families seemed to be a legend from a long time ago, with the revival of superpowers and Li Hao’s possession of the Li family’s sword and the fact that he had handed it over to the night patrolman, Red Moon had lost another three suns expert.

At this moment, it was not only silver Moon province, but perhaps even other provinces ‘experts had noticed this.

As Yuan Shuo was waiting here, there wasn’t much movement. However, once his teacher left, it would be just as Liu Yan had said. This place would soon become the center of a storm.

“Alright!”

Li Hao muttered in his heart.

This was also an opportunity.

He had just broken through 100, but his strength was still improving. His teacher had already taken the mysterious energy from the warehouse. His teacher had said that he would get him some of the five elements energy.

The energy on his side was mainly metal energy. The three suns was metal energy, and the sunlight was lightning energy.

Although these could also help Li Hao, they were not as helpful as the five-element equilibrium.

His teacher also needed time to exchange for different five-element mysterious energy with others.

“In the past few days, I feel like I’m about to succeed in my three-layered force. It can be considered a small improvement.”

From the rearview mirror, he could see Qiao Peng’s figure gradually disappearing into the distance.

Qiao’s mining industry!

They might be Yama’s peripheral organization. He had also noted this down.

……

At the inspection Office.

It was as if nothing had happened between Li Hao and Liu Yan.

In the big conference room.

Mu Sen was also present.

Li Hao was surprised to see a few familiar faces.

Wang Ming also looked at Li Hao, raised his head, and didn’t say anything.

Before he left, he told Li Hao that the Silver City was too small and that he shouldn’t stay here and should go to white moon City.

Well, it didn’t take long for him to run back.

How embarrassing!

When mu Sen saw that Liu Yan and the rest had returned, he laughed, “You’re all here. Just in time. The documents and people from the night patrol have arrived. Everyone, take a seat. I’ll announce the appointment!”

Everyone took their seats.

Wang Ming didn’t talk to Li Hao, let alone greet him, because he felt too embarrassed. At this moment, everyone just pretended he didn’t exist.

“After the higher-ups” discussion, the Silver City’s Nightwalker division has been officially established!”

“The former captain of the Silver City’s law enforcement team, Liu Long, and City Patrol envoy Jin will be appointed as the head of the Silver City branch!”

Liu Long stood up, stepped forward, took the letter of appointment, and saluted.

The crowd applauded.

There weren’t many people, just a few people in the team and a few foreign night patrollers. Night patrollers were still confidential. Although many people knew about them, they would keep it a secret if they could and try not to appear in front of the public.

“The former night patroller of white moon City, Wang Ming, will serve as the Deputy Minister of the Silver City branch.”

Wang Ming stepped forward and took the letter of appointment without a smile.

From white moon City, he ran here and became a Deputy Minister. There were only a few people in front of him, and he was an outsider. What was the point?

He was originally a patrol envoy, and this time he didn’t get promoted, so it was meaningless.

“I propose to appoint Li Hao as the first rank patrol officer of the Silver City law enforcement team, patrol envoy Jin, and the Deputy Minister of the Silver City branch.”

“……”

Wang Ming looked at Li Hao in a daze for a long time, feeling extremely ashamed.

He’s also a Deputy Minister?

He really didn’t know about this.

Damn, I’m so miserable that I’m at the same level as Li Hao?

Below, Li Meng and Hu Hao looked at each other, feeling extremely awkward.

So, Li Hao was still their superior?

My God, if they had known that Li Hao would be the Deputy Minister, they would have never come here.

He thought it was Liu Yan.

No matter what, Liu Yan was older and more experienced than them. Except for the fact that she couldn’t become a super, she could still be accepted as a Deputy Minister. But Li Hao was the one who ended up being the Deputy Minister.

Wang Ming couldn’t help but say in a low voice,”Chief Liu ... This ... Li Hao ... Didn’t he just join the inspection Office not long ago? and he’s not even a super yet ...”

This works too?

Liu Long said calmly,”it’s fine. Li Hao is mainly in charge of the logistics. When the battle really starts, we’ll have to count on Minister Wang. Minister Wang is a full moon level super. He’s the strongest in Silver City ...”

Wang Ming’s face flushed red.

This was an insult!

What do you mean, Liu Long?

Everyone had witnessed the previous battle. Liu Long had fought three of them alone, and he couldn’t even defeat one of them. Not to mention, there was also Yuan Shuo in the city. If you don’t call me the number one expert, What is this?

“Chief Liu!”

“Oh, it’s the number one super!” Liu Long said calmly.

At these words, Wang Ming paused and fell silent.

These words could be considered correct.

Forget it, I won’t argue with this boorish fellow.

“Liu Yan will be appointed as the team leader of the blizzard Silver City branch ...”

The appointment continued.

Of the nine people in the branch, four of them were leaders, including Liu Yan.

On the ground, yunyao, Wu Chao, and Chen Jian didn’t care. Hu Hao and Li Meng looked around and suddenly felt lonely.

Two Moon-level supers had joined the ranks of the Silver City, but in the end ... They were just soldiers with no brains.

He didn’t even get a team leader.

For a moment, the two of them almost cried. If they had known this would happen, they would have been transferred to yaoguang city. Even if they went to yaoguang city, even if they were not the leaders, they would not have to be soldiers. At least there were some Starlight grade supers there who could be their underlings.

But now, in the entire branch, apart from the two of them, Wu Chao and Chen Jian, the two martial masters of the ten decapitation realm, were the weakest. The key was that these two were martial masters and were not in the same League as them. They were also Liu Long’s direct descendants.

This time, they really became little brothers and Little Sisters!

At this moment, mu Sen had finished announcing the appointment and revealed a smile.””Congratulations, everyone! Especially Li Hao, congratulations! I’ve already said that the students of the Silver City’s ancient Academy would be able to make a name for themselves sooner or later. I didn’t think that you’d become a patrol so quickly. ”

He was surprised, but not too surprised.

It was normal for the higher-ups to agree. After all, they had to give Yuan Shuo face.

“The establishment of the night patrolmen is a joyous occasion for both me and the Inspector General!”

Mu Sen laughed and said,”how about this? in the future, any case that involves superpowers and martial masters will be handed over to you. The inspector’s office will only be in charge of ordinary cases.” Of course, if you need help, you can transfer from the inspection Office at any time because you don’t have enough people. ”

There were still too few night patrols.

There would be a lot of cases involving superpowers in Silver City in the future. Mu Sen still said that he could transfer people from the inspection Office to assist at any time.

Liu Long didn’t pay much attention to this. After thinking for a moment, he said,”As far as I know, the inspection Office has the most detailed files on the Silver City’s super martial masters. This includes the files of superpowers and martial masters from major companies, ancient Academies, and institutions. ”

Mu Sen looked at him and did not speak.

“Why? can’t I?” Liu Long calmly asked. Secretary mu, according to rank, you and I are at the same rank! The night patrol has the right to request you to hand in these files. ”

“No!”

“Liu Long, what are you trying to do?” mu Sen frowned.

“A new official has to do things properly. I want to start a fire. Is there a problem?”

Mu Sen wanted to say something but stopped.

In the past, only he had access to these files because they involved all the transcendent-level existences in the entire Silver City, such as a Martial Master who had cut Ten Realms, a Starlight master, a master who had broken through a hundred realms, a moon underworld master ...

Did the Silver City have it?

There were still some, but the number was very small, and they were concentrated in some large companies and powerful organizations. For example, the Silver City ancient Academy actually had martial masters in charge, and not Yuan Shuo. There were others.

Seeing Liu Long’s insistence, he didn’t say anything more and nodded, “I’ll give it to you later. ”

“Don’t delete some files!”

Liu Long’s tone was calm.”Those have nothing to do with you. Don’t worry, I’m not a bad person. We’re the Guardians of the Silver City. We won’t do anything irrational.”

“As you wish!”

Mu Sen did not say anything more and turned to leave.

In the future, when dealing with Liu Long Shao, this guy was not a rational person. Sooner or later, he would be exhausted to death.

After he left, Liu Long suddenly revealed a smile,”I can finally show off my skills!”

For a moment, although no one knew what he meant, they were all extremely excited. Wang Ming was also excited, but he quickly sensed something different. The way Liu Long was looking at him ... Wasn’t quite right.

“This is bad!”

Wang Ming subconsciously thought,”why are you looking at me? I’m an outsider; what do you want me to do?”


Chapter 213: Origin god weapon (1)
Translator: 549690339
“For today’s department’s celebration, let’s all go to Li Hao’s house as guests tonight!”

Once mu Sen left, the people who stayed behind would have to eat in the same pot.

Liu Long wasn’t an enthusiastic person, so Liu Yan took the initiative to take care of him. She said with a smile,”Xiao Wang, Xiao Hu, Xiao Li, are the three of you okay?”

“……”

The three of them looked at her, and soon, Li Meng and Hu Hao turned to Wang Ming.

Here, you’re the boss, you have the final say.

The three of them were outsiders and weren’t familiar with these people. Whether Wang Ming wanted to be a Dragon in the river or admit defeat, they could just watch.

Wang Ming, on the other hand, didn’t have that intention at all.

In his mind, this was just a temporary measure, so he would leave quickly. He didn’t have the time to fight for power with Liu Long!

Moreover, Huang Yun had asked him to get in touch with Li Hao. He thought for a moment and decided that he had to complete this mission. He quickly nodded and said,””Alright, let’s go to Minister Li’s house then!”

Li Hao was speechless.

Go to my house?

I don’t even know where I can find food in my new home. Liu Yan is really troublesome.

Why not just go out and eat!

Liu Yan didn’t care what he was thinking and said with a smile,”Then let’s leave it at that for now. The inspection Office should have arranged a place for you to stay. You must be tired from the long journey, so please settle down first. We will come to pick you up tonight.”

“Thank you for your trouble!”

Wang Ming didn’t say much and strode off. He didn’t want to stay here for a minute longer.

It was too awkward!

Even though Li Hao and Liu Long didn’t care much about it, he couldn ‘t. His self-esteem was too high, and he couldn’t stand it. When he thought about how he was injured in one move when he was dealing with a few supers and had to rely on Liu Long to save him, he felt terrible.

Soon, the three of them left together.

After they left, Liu Long suddenly laughed,”Not bad!”

Liu Yan also smiled and nodded.

Yunyao also nodded slightly in agreement.””It’s these three. They’ve fought together last time, so they’re still brave. Although they’re considered newbies, they’re not pure newbies. Their strength is on par with Dark Moon, not those old foxes ...”

They were actually very satisfied with these three people.

As for the lack of combat experience ... That was not a problem.

What he was afraid of was that the higher-ups would arrange for a few rebellious supers or those who were simply here to fight for power and profit. That would be troublesome.

Not every superhuman did not care about power.

For the sake of fame and fortune, some supers would not mind doing something disgusting.

This was great. These guys were still alright.

Beside him, Chen Jian also laughed awkwardly.”It’s not too bad. Last time, we fought against those supers together. These supers also helped us. We’re all acquaintances now. That Wang Ming isn’t weak either, he’s stronger than us, so that’s good!”

Liu Long nodded. This was also the reason why he was at ease.

He didn’t want to fight for power, but once someone came to fight for power, he wouldn’t let it go. He understood how important this team was. They were all his trusted friends. He didn’t trust anyone to command them. It would be easy for them to die.

Li Hao didn’t care about this. He said with a headache,””Sis, I don’t have anything to cook.”

Liu Yan was speechless,”are you an idiot?” Just order a meal and have the restaurant send it to you. It’s just a meal at your place, who knows how to cook?”

“……”

Li Hao was dumbfounded. Treating ... Is this how it should be?

I’ve learned something new!

So, he just wanted to borrow the place?

And I was having a headache over how to deal with it!

Liu Long also laughed.”Let’s do as Liu Yan says. We can just eat whatever we want. It doesn’t matter what we eat. Treating them to a meal is also a way to express our goodwill.”

He then added,”Li Hao, you can try to get closer to Wang Ming during dinner. We can talk more, especially about superpowers.”

“It’s about the eight great families!”

Li Hao’s expression turned serious.

He had to pay attention to this!

In fact, he also wanted to know more about the eight great families, but unfortunately, his teacher didn’t know much, and neither did the others. He also didn’t know if the night patrolman knew more.

Li Hao felt that the best way to understand her was to capture Ying Hongyue and interrogate her directly. Unfortunately, this couldn’t be done.

Since that was the case, he could ask Wang Ming about it.

Li Hao nodded. Just as he was about to go out and order, Liu Long waved his hand and said,””Don’t be in such a hurry to leave! Now that the team had officially become a part of the night patrollers, it would not be appropriate for them to stay in the basement! Go and find an office building, and we’ll move in. There’s nothing we need to bring ...”

Li Hao nodded.”Alright, then let my law-enforcement team leave the law-enforcement building. We’ll occupy it directly. It’s too troublesome to move things!”

The few of them looked at him silently.

Good fellow!

Your heart is really black.

The law enforcement team was moving!

How many of us are there?

Li Hao looked at them, somewhat baffled and embarrassed. He scratched his head and said,””What’s wrong? Our headquarters is underground, and the warehouse is also there. It’s not convenient to move it away, so let the law enforcement team do it. The law enforcement team’s things are easy to move. If not, I’ll hire a moving company for them. ”

“……”

Liu Yan laughed. Liu Long was also extremely helpless as he waved his hand,”You do it! However, if you attract any infamy, you’ll have to deal with it yourself!”

You’re not a thing!

He had just set up a branch, and now he was going to take over the place. Li Hao had finally revealed his true colors.

Just wait to be scolded!

The few of them ignored him and started to talk about themselves.

After a while, the few of them went downstairs.

……

When they arrived downstairs, they were all stunned.

Downstairs, the law enforcement team was busy moving things one by one. They were very cooperative.

Liu Long was a little surprised. These people were so easy to talk to?

All of them were smiling. What good news was this?

Moving? after staying here for so many years, you can move just like that. Don’t you feel uncomfortable?

“Captain!”

Everyone still addressed him as Captain out of habit, and the people who passed by quickly greeted him.

Liu Long stopped a burly man who was moving.”Old Zhou, you’re taking the initiative. Did Li Hao threaten you?”

“How could I!”

The old patrol inspector who was called old Zhou said happily,”Patrol li would do such a thing? Didn’t we say that as long as we move out and get it done before today, everyone can go to Captain Liu and your office to choose a good gun. You can choose it yourself. If you choose a cannon, you can move it!”

“The two of you ... Should know, right?” he asked, somewhat strangely.

Liu Long and Liu Yan looked at each other in helplessness.

Know my ass!

This kid really knew how to talk nonsense.

However, on second thought, it didn’t matter. If he really needed these firearms, he could get them at any time. They were only placed in the office for convenience.

Moreover, now that they had set up a branch, it was reasonable to say that the firearms of the inspector should be handed over.

Very few night patrols were equipped with firearms.

“I know!”

Liu Long replied unhappily, then said,”Just like that, you guys ran away?”

“That’s definitely more than that!”

Old Zhou laughed and said,”Captain, inspector li is indeed a top student. He’s someone who does great things!” He had said that moving away now was to make it easier for him to come in in the future! I heard...That ... They’re recruiting new people?”

After saying that, he looked at Liu Long with some anticipation.

The night patrolman was not a secret in the law enforcement team.

Previously, when supers appeared, the law enforcement team had personally participated in the battle, and everyone knew about the existence of supers.

According to Li Hao, this place had been commandeered, and the Silver City had an organization. Everyone had the opportunity to join the law enforcement team, but they had to be selected.

Now that he had moved away, he could still come back when he was selected.

He would also get a raise in his salary, benefits, and even become a superhuman.

Everyone was looking forward to it!

“Old Zhou, it’s very dangerous. You’re the patrol officer, you know a lot.” Liu Long frowned.

Why was he acting like a young man? he was even getting excited.

Old Zhou laughed,”Captain, I’m not hoping to become that kind of person!” Patrol Li said that he could recruit a few people to do logistics work. They would be promoted by one rank and their salary doubled. After all, the salary was paid by the higher-ups and you didn’t have to pay for it. Patrol li also said that it would be a waste not to take them. He’s asked around, and under normal circumstances, Nightwatchers ... Ahem, they can set up an ordinary service agency in the local area. They need a lot of manpower, and they’ll have to pay more for the promotion. It’s a waste not to take them, don’t you think so?”

Liu Long was a little embarrassed.

I don’t know.

No, I didn’t think about that.

So that was how it was!

Do the night patrollers have a logistics department?

He had originally thought that Li Hao would do it, but who knew that Li Hao would outsource this task?

This kid is really something!

At the side, Liu Yan and the others laughed, and Chen Jian could not help but laugh,”Li Hao’s thinking isn’t bad. He even knows how to benefit us brothers. Right, we don’t care about the promotion, but old Zhou and the others do. They’ll be promoted as long as they can. The higher-ups are paying for it anyway.”

Old Zhou, who was moving things, also said excitedly,””That’s right! Captain, I thought you were taking care of your old brother, am I wrong?”

He was a little disappointed.

Didn’t Captain think of us brothers?

As expected of investigator li!

Liu Long was a little embarrassed, but he quickly regained his cold arrogance.”Get lost! I’ve already thought about it, but I’m just worried that you’re afraid of danger ...”

“Captain, what are you saying? forget it, I’ll go ask patrol li if there’s a place for me ... I won’t talk to you anymore, Captain.”

With that, old Zhou ran off.

Liu Long’s face was filled with helplessness. “The tea is cold when the person leaves, but I’m still here. These guys are really realistic.”

Soon, Li Hao returned.

Seeing that everyone was busy, he quickly shouted,””Everyone, work harder and try to move it well tonight! The new place isn’t bad either. Also, I just went to find director mu and he couldn’t bear to let everyone go. I tried my best to persuade him and he gave us 10 spots! It’s too difficult to get promoted to patrol envoy ... So I suggest that it’s best to get a level two patrol inspector to maximize the benefits!”

“Of course, if a level 3 patrol inspector also wants to fight for this opportunity, then wait! When our Department expands and has more manpower, I’ll recruit some big brothers and sisters from the law enforcement team to help!”

“Nice of you, patrol li!”

“As expected of a top student from the Silver City’s ancient Academy!”

“The patrol is really awesome!”

“……”

Everyone started to flatter him. To them, it was something worth being excited about. It was tiring work to death, unlike Liu Long and the others who were single. They could eat their fill without having to worry about their family.

They still had to support their families.

To them, getting a promotion and a raise was still a very good thing.

……

Liu Long watched silently from the side. After a long time, he looked at Liu Yan and said softly,”These few years, we’ve been focused on pursuing superpowers and have forgotten about the ordinary life. No wonder the law enforcement team was in a mess.”

Because they had already forgotten what these brothers needed.

As long as they didn’t go beyond the system, a promotion and a raise was something everyone wanted.


Chapter 215: Origin god weapon (3)

As for Liu Long, he hadn’t given it to them in the past few years.

As for Li Hao, this guy still considered himself an ordinary person. He knew what these people wanted, so he could satisfy their requests. Thus, even though he had just been promoted, everyone was happy to call him “patrol.”

As long as he could enter the logistics department, he would be rich.

Liu Yan nodded slightly and smiled.”It has nothing to do with me. I’m just a Deputy. Boss, that’s your fault. Don’t push the blame to me.”

While they were talking, Li Hao Ran over and said in high spirits,””Everyone is willing to move out. I’ve talked to Secretary mu, and he said that the building next to it can be used by the law enforcement team. It was originally empty, so they just need to clean it a little! Boss, you see, we have our own base now!”

“You really know how to do things!” Liu Long laughed.

This fellow, he thought that he would cause a lot of complaints.

“Why did you suddenly think of recruiting a group of people to be logistics personnel?”

“Wang Ming said so.”

Li Hao still remembered this matter.”At that time, he asked me to go to Whitemoon city. He said that although I was an ordinary person, it didn’t matter. Whitemoon city also needed ordinary people to do logistics work, so I asked. As expected, the night patrolman branch also has the authority to recruit ordinary people. They just don’t want to go to the front line. In fact, the number of spots is not fixed. However, under normal circumstances, as long as there aren’t more people than the night patrolmen, it shouldn’t be a big problem.”

“You have a good memory!”

Liu Long praised and suddenly said,”But don’t forget what we’re here for! “Don’t keep thinking about being an official. It’s not good to be too obsessed with being an official. You should think about improving your own strength. You’re already a Deputy Minister. Your current strength ... Is not enough!”

Li Hao laughed dryly.”Don’t worry, boss. I’ve been working hard. I’m going to become a super as soon as possible!”

Strength?

It’s okay if it’s over 100.

Sharpening a knife wouldn’t delay the work of cutting wood. Li Hao didn’t really want to be busy with logistics all the time, so he found some people to share the burden so that he would have enough time to practice martial arts.

……

After a busy day.

At night.

There were nine people on the night patrol, and they drove two cars. One was driven by Liu Yan and the others, and the other was the silver 7219, which was assigned to Li Hao.

Liu Long and the others were all in that car.

Li Hao, on the other hand, led Wang Ming and the other two.

Wang Ming actually didn’t want to sit in the front passenger seat, but Li Meng and Hu Hao had already occupied the back seat. He couldn’t be bothered to squeeze with them, so he reluctantly sat in the front.

However, after sitting for a while, he lost his calm.

“Li Hao, do you know how to drive?”

He couldn’t help but shout. Before he got into the car, he had decided not to talk to Li Hao in private, but how did this guy drive?

Li Hao was a little excited,”yes!” I’ve driven a car before, but it’s not as high-end as this one. It’s too easy to drive. I just need to know how to change directions, refuel, and brake. Old Wang, don’t you know how to drive?”

Now that he was of the same rank as Wang Ming, he didn’t call him “Sir” anymore. Wang Ming wasn’t old, and Li Hao was 20. Wang Ming seemed to be the same age as him, or a little younger, because he had called him brother Hao before.

It wasn’t very polite to call him little brother, so Li Hao chose to call him old Wang.

Wang Ming was speechless.

I don’t know how?

I think you really don’t know how!

Good Lord, all he had to do was refuel, brake, and change directions?

It didn’t sound wrong ... But this guy’s driving was too F * cking scary!

Wang Ming decided to calm down and divert his attention. He was afraid that this guy would make him vomit.

“Li Hao, why did the silver Blizzard city recommend you to be their Deputy Minister?”

“Oh, boss said that I’m more suitable and the others aren ‘t, so he chose me.”

Bullshit!

Wang Ming wanted to curse, but behind him, Li Meng was also a little wobbly and stumbling from the car. At this moment, he could only interject and change the topic.”Li Hao, you haven’t reached the tenth realm yet, have you? This time, we got some mysterious energy. Did you get a suitable one?”

“No!”

Li Hao said dejectedly,”my teacher said that maybe my body is special and it’s hard to match my mysterious energy. Let’s wait.” Let’s start with the Martial Master path, it’s no worse than superpowers. ”

“Then have you entered the tenth slash realm?”

“Almost!”

Li Hao laughed.”I should be almost at the tenth realm. I think I can use my muscles and bones at the same time. It’s just that ... I haven’t had any actual combat. My teacher said that martial masters and supers who don’t know how to fight are all trash!”

As soon as he said this, the three of them looked unhappy.

Fortunately, Li Hao had included them in the list. Otherwise, they would have thought that Li Hao didn’t care about them.

Wang Ming was about to die from anger, but he suppressed his awkwardness and continued,”Have you been looking for elder Yuan these past few days?”

“I’m going. ”

“What did he say to you?”

“A lot, why?”

“I’m fine. ”

Seeing this, Wang Ming didn’t say anything more. It seemed that Yuan Shuo really hadn’t mentioned taking in a disciple, which he thought wasn’t bad. But on second thought, Yuan Shuo hadn’t even said anything ... As expected, in-name disciples weren’t valued at all!

Those that couldn’t be obtained were in a commotion!

If Yuan Shuo really wanted to publicize it openly, they would not be happy.

However, Yuan Shuo didn’t even tell them about his own disciple. The difference between a closed-door disciple and an in-name disciple was too great. Yuan Shuo didn’t even ask them about their arrival in the Silver City. It was really sad.

Li Hao didn’t care about this. While driving, he asked,””By the way, sister li, brother Hu, the teacher said that the last time you came, you were here to protect him to go to an ancient remain. Where is it? Why did you cancel it now?”

Li Meng said casually, not hiding anything.””It wasn’t canceled, it was postponed! Many people were keeping an eye on the ruins. Before elder Yuan advanced, we arranged for Hao bu and three suns to lead the team. It’s the same for the other families. Everyone has their limits. ”
