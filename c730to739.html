        you afraid of?"
        Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, had thought things through. What was he afraid of?
        Come and kill!
        If he couldn't kill, he would run. If he couldn't run, he would resign to his fate. It was that simple.
        He laughed and said,"good boy, you're amazing!" However ... His master is not bad either. Tonight, I killed a three suns. Counting it, I have killed almost 10 three suns along the way ... Well, keep it up, I can't be surpassed by this kid! Jiguang, quickly recuperate. Once your injuries are healed, continue to kill ... We've been running here and there, killing until my disciple has almost caught up with three suns. Isn't it embarrassing?"
        Wu Hongjun didn't say a word.
        His heart, however, was unable to calm down for a long time.
        Yuan Shuo's student, the youngest disciple, had actually killed six three suns tonight. This made her feel a little uncomfortable. Not long ago, she had fought a three suns initial stage for half a day and only managed to kill him with Yuan Shuo's help.
        At this moment, compared to Li Hao, she felt that she had lost all her face!
        ……
         All sides were shaken.
        The various large organizations were also rapidly discussing.
        In the southern suburbs of Silvermoon.
        In a big villa, Nan Quan also sighed,""He's so F * cking powerful. This kid wanted to spar with me last time. Fortunately, he didn't agree. Otherwise, he would have lost half of his life!"
        Next to him was the same woman from last time, the heart-jabbing tender guest, and the current Madam Bai.
        In the middle of the night, a man and a woman were alone, and the other party was a married man ... If Li Hao were here, he would probably criticize them in his heart.
        At this moment, the heart-jabbing beauty was also a little shocked. However, she quickly regained her senses and said softly,""This Li Hao is indeed unexpected! However, Speaking of which, he has some connections with the Bai family, and Hu dingfang is his senior brother-in-law ... Brother he, do you think we can rope in this Li Hao?"
        Nan Quan grinned and glanced at her. His eyes suddenly turned cold as he said,""Don't even think about it. This fellow is even more brutal and heartless than Yuan Shuo! If you can't win him over, be careful not to be eaten by him! The first time I saw him, I knew that he wasn't someone to be trifled with. That day, when hou Xiaochen killed someone, I saw with my own eyes that he didn't even bat an eye. When the red-haired man was killed, he didn't even bat an eye, he didn't feel the slightest bit of fear ... If you can't afford to offend someone like that, then don 't!"
        He had seen it clearly that day.
        Moreover, he had been following Li Hao for the next few days. The guy was smiling, but his heart was even colder than Yuan Shuo 's.
        He knew Li Hao's situation.
        He had no parents, only a master who had escaped from the world, and a friend who had been killed by Hong Yue last year. Liu Long and the others had not known him for a long time, so this person...Did not have much warmth in his bones.
        All their affection was probably gathered on Yuan Shuo.
        It was not a good idea to provoke such a guy.
        Madam Bai nodded slightly and did not mention it again.
        However, Nan Quan warned again,"also, don't let Hu dingfang and his wife provoke them. Playing the emotional card might not work!" "That guy went to Wang Henggang from the inspection Office and Hong Yitang, whom he's not too familiar with. He's already found them all, but he didn't find his Senior Sister and senior brother-in-law. He might even have the intention to clean up his master's house. Be careful. Yuan Shuo may remember the friendship, but he won 't. Moreover, there's no friendship between them. It's very common for closed-door disciples to help their Master Clean up his house. You're a Martial Master too, so you should understand this!"
        Madam Bai's eyes froze for a moment before she nodded. This time, she completely dispelled the thought.
        That's right, the status of the last disciple was sometimes even higher than that of the first disciple. If he really came to clean up the sect, even Yuan Shuo might not say anything if he knew.  "Brother he, do you think he ... Can escape?" she asked.
        Would Li Hao be able to escape from the encirclement of the three great organizations, rising light?
        "It's hard to say!"
        "The only ones who are determined to deal with him are Red Moon, Yama, and Fei Tian," Nan Quan said in a deep voice. "They might not let Xu Guang chase after him all the time! After all, heaven battling city's remains are about to open, and the three major organizations will not let go of this remains ... However, Red Moon probably won't give up. Now, there are probably members of the elder Council who have gone over. As for the three northern provinces, elder tsunami from before has probably gone over. "
        The three northern provinces had an elder in charge of them. He was a Water-type expert who was close to the North Sea. Now that Silver Moon was here, LAN Yue probably wouldn't leave so easily, so he had to be on guard against hou Xiaochen.
        However, that elder might chase after them.
        If he flew, he might be halfway up the mountain.
        As for the Yama, he didn't know if there were any other experts coming.
        Otherwise, the king of equality might not have gone. If Wang Sanyang, who was at the peak, encountered Li Hao, he might have lost his life, but he would not have gone over so easily.
        He Yong made a few guesses, let out a breath, and smiled.""Let's take a look. Also ... I'll go and join in the fun. I'll come back when the ruins open ..."
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "You're going too?"
        Madam Bai was stunned. Why are you going there?
        Nan Quan immediately walked out of the room and chuckled,""I'm just here to watch the show. They won't dare to provoke me easily. I'm representing the royal family ..."
        After he finished speaking, he disappeared.
        Madam Bai's eyes flickered. This Nan Quan had been staying here for the past few days, and now he was in the mood ... Would there be any changes if he went?
        ……
        On this day, the wind started from the end.
         Li Hao's name spread throughout the Silver Moon and the star dynasty overnight.
        The Silver Moon Martial Master once again became the focus of attention.
        The eight great families had also become the focus of many people's attention.
        At this moment, in a huge mountain Palace in the central region, corpses were lying all over the ground. A man was sitting in the middle of the hall and reading some information. When he saw the information that had just been sent over, he was stunned for a moment and then cursed in a low voice,"“艹! My daughter is still there ... F * ck, I thought you would at least stay quiet for a while. You're so F * cking fast!"
        The man was a little flustered and exasperated as he cursed!
        Bastard!
        I thought you would at least train the Army for a while, but it's only been a few days and you've already done this?
        After he was done scolding, he calmed down and spat again. He looked at the corpses on the ground and frowned."Has Xuguang died? I've killed everyone in such a big stronghold and guarded it for two days, but no one came to see the situation?"
        He sighed. Forget it, let's retreat first.
        After Li Hao's ruckus, Ying Hongyue was currently very upset and might not have the time to pay attention to him.
       
        In the northern region of Silvermoon.
        Li Hao, who had become famous after this battle, was currently leading his demon hunt squad to flee further north.
        Running 800 li in one night was not an exaggeration. He had really run 800 li. He was moving at a high speed of 100 li per hour.
        Walking!
        Some of the martial masters in the group had already collapsed from exhaustion. Martial masters were very strong, and they could endure running for an hour or two. However, after running for an entire night and running 800 li, even if they had broken through the late-hundredth stage, some of them still found it difficult to bear.
        However, no one said no.
        On the first night, they traveled through the mountains and forests for a hundred miles. Some people complained that Li Hao was not good.
        But this time, everyone gritted their teeth and continued to run, even if their internal injuries were acting up.
        In just a few days, they had been conquered by the young man in front of them.
        This was a true Martial Master!
         With him, demon hunt squads could run amuck in all directions, kill superhumans, and display the might of martial masters.
        These people were supporting each other, and some of them were even carrying their injured comrades on their backs. Now, they were their fellow soldiers!
        These people were not soldiers.
        However, after the successive battles, they somewhat understood what it meant to be fellow brothers.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The heavy black armor was so heavy that some of them couldn't bear it anymore. However, no one took off their black armor. It was the foundation of their survival. Otherwise, they would have died in the battle last night.
        With hei Teng, Liu Long, and the formation, none of them died. Only some were injured.
        It was dawn.
        The surroundings were deserted.
        In front, Li Hao coughed and raised his hand. The people behind him quickly stopped and looked at Li Hao with burning eyes.
        Li Hao looked forward and laughed."Do you see that huge mountain in front?"
        A horse would run to its death when it looked at the mountain.
        Even though the mountain was already in front of their eyes, they still felt that it was far away from them.
        "That mountain is called the grey Mountain!"
        "There's a small city near the Cang mountains called Silver City!"Li Hao said as he looked into the distance.
        "Silver City, the border of the Silver Moon, is also the border of the star dynasty. The book says that after crossing the Cang mountains, there is another country called Dali!"
        Li Hao said with some emotion,"that is my hometown! When I was young, the furthest place I went was the Cang mountains. Today, I'll bring everyone to the boundary of the Cang mountains. The Cang mountains are steep and dangerous. Since ancient times, there has been a saying that climbing the mountain is as difficult as climbing the heavens ..."
        "Go east from the Cang mountains, cross the mountains, walk through the mountain range, and keep going forward. Don't go north. There's the Li Dynasty in the North. Although they haven't crossed the border for a hundred years, no one knows what's the situation in the Li Dynasty ... If we go east, we can go all the way through the North of the Silver Moon until the end and connect with the Hengduan Canyon ... Then we can go back to the Hengduan Canyon!"
        Li Hao said with a cold smile,""Let them think that we've escaped to the Li Dynasty ... But we're not leaving. Silver Moon, that's our territory, why should we leave? If we return from the transverse Canyon ... No matter how strong the three major organizations are, they will be nothing after we kill all their supers!"
         "Let's kill our way back and hunt more demons!"  "Demon hunting!"
        "Demon hunting!"
        Everyone shouted in unison, their blood boiling.
        We're not leaving!
        Then, they would kill their way back, pass through the Cang mountains, enter the Hengduan Canyon, kill their way back, and fight the entire Silver Moon land!
        The Silver Moon land was huge, but they were willing to follow Li Hao and fight in the thorny Silver Moon. Martial masters loved the excitement.
        Li Hao laughed and coughed again.
        At this moment, Liu Long frowned.
        He didn't pay much attention to Li Hao's coughing at first, but now he was worried. He coughed from time to time on the way. Had his internal organs been injured?
        "Let's go into the grey Mountains! It's raining heavily in the Cang mountains, so it'll be able to erase all our tracks very quickly!"
        Li Hao waved his hand, and the group of people continued to run. When they saw Cang Mountain, even if they didn't know the situation inside, they didn't have to worry with Li Hao leading the way. It was as if Cang Mountain was the bright road for them to kill their way out again!
        ……
        After sprinting for more than an hour, Li Hao's group entered the Cang Mountain range through the steep natural mountain path.
        The tall trees, the animals 'cries, and the fresh air seemed to have given them a new life.
        The thick leaves could effectively hide their footsteps.
        At this moment, Liu Long, Li Heng, and the others whispered something to each other, then quickly went forward and caught up with Li Hao, who was looking at the road.
        "Leader, the harvest statistics are out!"
         "Speak," he said.
        "The mysterious energy is the most, a total of 12000 cubic meters! It's mainly provided by the three suns. In addition to their own mysterious energy, they also have some storage rings on them. "
        The six three suns alone provided Li Hao with at least 8000 cubic meters of superpower.
        In addition to the storage rings they carried, each of them carried a few hundred cubic meters. The three suns had provided more than ten thousand cubic meters of mysterious energy.
        Sunlight was indeed unable to provide much. It would be considered good if a person could provide 200 to 300 cubic meters of mysterious energy. When Liu Long and the others killed sunlight, a large amount of mysterious energy was dissipated. In the end, they only obtained 12000 cubic meters of mysterious energy in this battle.
        " 27 divine power stones! "The expert in the fairy realm carried the most, a total of nine. The Crimson Moon carried fewer ..."
        Li Hao frowned slightly.
        It wasn't considered a lot!
        There were only 27 divine power stones. In order to replenish his sword energy, he had broken eight of them. Later on, he replenished them again and used up 12 divine power stones. In the end, he did not obtain many divine power stones.
        " 22 storage rings, 6 storage rings, and some other treasures ..."
       
        Liu Long hesitated."We don't know what some of the treasures are either. But from the fluctuations, there are superpowers ... They might be some extraordinary items."
        There were quite a few storage rings.
        Only the three suns had storage rings.
        Li Hao calculated for a moment. He wasn't very satisfied with the spoils. They didn't meet his expectations. He had expected that these three suns could provide him with at least forty to fifty divine power stones.
        They were all poor!
        He wasn't even as rich as the two three suns from the Nightwalker headquarters.
        Fei Tian was still alright, he was at the peak of three yang and seemed to be highly valued.
        However, this was only for today. A few days ago, they had killed many supers and obtained close to 5000 cubic meters of mysterious energy. After all, they had killed more than a hundred supers and it was a considerable amount of income.
        Among the superpowers, they were provided with three divine power stones ...
        That's right, they were so poor that out of the hundreds of supers, only a few of them had one. It was probably a reward from above.
         In total, he had obtained 30 divine power stones this time.
        Li Hao, on the other hand, had already spent nearly 20 yuan. In total, he had only made a profit of 10 yuan.
        He had borrowed 30 stones from the Golden spear. Now, Li Hao had 40 divine power stones.
        The mysterious energy had reached 17000 cubic meters.
        Li Hao turned around and glanced at the exhausted crowd. He smiled and said,""Harvest? did everyone hear that? Let's go and find a safe place to absorb the mysterious energy. I'll use the breathing technique of five birds to convert it into mysterious energy that's more suitable for everyone to cultivate. 17000 cubic meters ... Are we going to leave it for the enemy to kill us as spoils of war? How many of us are there? including me, there are only 51 of us, with an average of more than 300 cubic meters per person ... That's enough for us to be extravagant!"
        Everyone was overjoyed!
        The average person was over 300 cubic meters. In the past, it would be considered good if they could get 20 cubic meters from killing a Yue Ming. How many Yue Ming did they have to kill to get that? to them, breaking 100 cubic meters was equivalent to getting a reward from dozens of life-and-death battles.
        Moreover, he had to win every time!
        Whether it was the inspector, swords gate, or Hong Yitang and Wang Henggang, they might be strong, but they wouldn't give their disciples too many things. After all, they might not be rich.
        Even the night patrolmen were not that rich, let alone them.
        While walking, Li Hao said,""In addition, I have an ancient weapon of enlightenment and a Broken Sword left behind by a swordsman from the ancient civilization. You can comprehend them 10 times. Later, the captains and the few people in the late stage of the 100th level who have killed the most can all comprehend them once!"
        "If I can break through 100 levels ... I won't be far away from the Qian dynasty!"
        Everyone was even more delighted when they heard this.
        Li Hao didn't say anything else. He was quickly healing his injuries. Not only that, but he also took out some storage rings from his storage ring.
        This time, he wanted to cultivate and strengthen himself.
        He had all five elements.  Not only that, but he also had wind, lightning, and darkness elements.
        He had killed too many supers, so he did not lack any of these.
        Li Hao didn't stand on ceremony with the others. According to what they had said, he would take 30% of the spoils, which meant that he could take more than 5000 cubic meters of the mysterious energy. Moreover, he had killed the three suns alone this time, so he could take more.
        Li Hao didn't necessarily have to follow the distribution plan.
        He picked and picked out five elements, 500 cubic meters each, including wind and thunder.
        After hesitating for a while, he picked a dark-type power that was worth 500 cubic meters.
        4000 cubic meters of mysterious energy.
        However, if he wanted to absorb this 4000 cubic meters of mysterious energy, he would need to prepare at least 20 divine power stones. One divine power Stone could probably convert 200 cubic meters of mysterious energy. Moreover, Li Hao was still injured, so 20 divine power stones were probably enough for his own use.
        As for the remaining 20, Li Hao had to keep at least 10 for backup. He would convert 10 into sword energy to provide mysterious energy for the entire team and allow them to strengthen themselves quickly.
        He had to use up the things he had obtained.
        Only by using it would one be considered powerful.
        If they stayed, who knew who would benefit from it?
        With the remaining 13000 cubic meters, 10 divine power stones would not be able to convert too much. However, the group could not absorb too much either. After breaking through level 100, they would be stuffed at most if they absorbed a few dozen cubic meters at once.
        If they converted it into 2000 cubic meters, they would be able to absorb 40 cubic meters per person. This was more than enough for everyone.
        Li Hao continued to walk along the mountain path. After a while, they walked out of the natural mountain path, passing through some particularly difficult paths and even climbing some cliffs. Just like that, the group walked for more than an hour and entered the depths of the Cang mountains. After a long time, they finally found a natural cave.
         After entering the cave, Li Hao quickly sealed the entrance and said,""Let's start cultivating now. It's the best time for us to cultivate when everyone is at their most exhausted ... Don't rest. Rest will make you slack off!"
        "Yes!"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Everyone responded in unison, each and every one of them filled with anticipation.  Hei Teng also did not leave his side.
        As for Li Hao, he directly shattered some divine power stones and rapidly converted them into a large amount of mysterious energy. There were all five elements, and some attribute-less mysterious energy was extracted and quickly spread in all directions.
        The martial masters also began to absorb it.
        This was not the first time.
        Although they were amazed by Li Hao's methods, they got used to it after a few times. They also felt the benefits of the converted energy. It was easier to absorb and could strengthen the body and five internal organs. It was extremely balanced.
        Right now, they had yet to experience such benefits.
        When they reached the battle stage, these people would understand what it meant for their five internal organs to be strengthened. It meant that the path of accumulating spirit was being opened to them.
       
        Liu Long could be considered as the one who understood the situation the most.
        He had also gained a lot in the past few days. He was a warrior of the thousand-Force Combat, so his absorption speed was fast. He also specifically picked the five elements to absorb. After a few days, he could clearly feel that his five internal organs had become much stronger.
        He was only envious of the others.
        These guys didn't know how lucky they were.
        Now, none of them understood. When they entered the warrior dimension and started to accumulate spirit, these people would understand how great the benefits of strengthening their five internal organs when they broke through 100.
        Every time you absorb it, it will save you at least a few years of cultivation.
        The ten thousand cubic meters of mysterious energy was just a number.
        The true benefits were actually far greater than these 10000 cubes of mysterious energy. If people like hou Xiaochen knew about this, they would probably be willing to pay ten times or even a hundred times the price for this special energy.
        ……
        Li Hao didn't pay them any more attention. He began to heal and cultivate.
         His lungs were bleeding continuously.
        It was also healing.
        The golden sword force was too strong, and its explosive power was too strong. It kept struggling, and every time it struggled, it would bring a burst of coughing.
        His five internal organs were still not strong enough!
        If his five internal organs were not strong enough, his body and bones would be weak. Therefore, Li Hao strengthened his body and bones first. Wind and thunder were his first choice. Soon, sword energy surged out of his body, and a rumbling sound echoed inside.
        Li Hao only needed this pure energy. Attributeless energy was directly dispersed by him and absorbed by the martial masters. Attributeless energy could also strengthen the body, but it wasn't very effective for Li Hao.
        However, to break through a hundred, the effect was much better than the average mystic energy.
        The 51 people in the cave were frighteningly quiet. Only Li Hao's coughing and the rumbling of Thunder from the bone armor could be heard from time to time, bringing a hint of liveliness to the quiet cave.
        Demon hunt squad members were constantly advancing.
        The middle stage entered the late stage, and the early stage entered the middle stage.
        Those who had not advanced to the tenth severing stage before had all advanced. Now, they were all advancing to the middle and late stages. A few of them had broken through the late stage of one hundred. Some of them were even vaguely comprehending force. They did not comprehend it through the ancient weapon, but by themselves.
        Hong Yitang's daughters, Hong Qing, Hong Hao, and Wang Chao ... All of them had their own thoughts. Liu Yan was the same. Martial masters like Li Heng, who had their own unique inheritances, also had their own thoughts.
        At this moment, Wu Chao, Li Heng, and Chen Jian had all advanced to the late-stage of the breakthrough 100.
        After a few days, these people had improved greatly.
        A few days of battle and cultivation was comparable to years or even ten years of hard work!
        The number of late-hundred-stage demon hunt squads had clearly increased.
        As for Liu Long, he had also made great progress.
        At this moment, he even began to try to lock the force. His kidney would lock the water force, but his five internal organs were still weak. During the process of locking the force, it would cause pain to his five internal organs. However, this was already a great improvement.
        This meant that he was on his way to the peak of the Dou Qian class.  Compared to before, he was much stronger now. At least, it was not too difficult for him to deal with someone at the late stage of the glorious sun realm. He could even fight someone at the peak stage of the glorious sun realm. It was not easy to determine the winner, so it would depend on the actual situation.
        Liu Long silently looked at Li Hao. All of this was brought about by this guy.
        This guy was the truly terrifying one!
        Soon, everyone was immersed in the pleasure of cultivation. There was no pain of absorbing the mysterious energy, only comfort.
        ……
        Just as Li Hao and his group were rushing to the Cang mountains overnight ...
        Someone stepped into the North of the Silver Moon.
        Last night, at the place of the battle.
        At this moment, several powerhouses were standing in the air, silently observing the traces left behind by the battle.
        A middle-aged woman with blue hair raised her hand, and a broken rock fell into her hand. She carefully observed it and sighed."What a demonic sword!"
        The sword Qi was extremely sharp!
        Even after a night, the sword Qi was still powerful. This man's swordsmanship was already divine. Who could defeat the Silvermoon swordsman?
        Heavenly Sword?
        Now, perhaps only Tian Jian could match this person.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Silver Moon had produced experts since ancient times. As expected, there were still people who had emerged from this declining place in this era. Li Hao, this unknown fellow, had become famous throughout the dynasty after last night's battle.
        Not far away, a cloaked man also squatted down and carefully looked at a broken corpse. He shook his head slightly."It was directly shattered underground. This Li Hao is good at terrain!"
        "Sword force, terrain, and maybe he has comprehended Fire Force ..."
        "No, metal force!"
         “……”
        The experts exchanged words, and soon, they were all silent.
        This Li Hao is really too monstrous!
        "According to the secret technique of the five birds sect, although Li Hao doesn't walk the momentum of the five birds, he can still be regarded as one of the five birds. So far, it seems that he has at least comprehended the third or even fourth force ... It's very similar to Yuan Shuo's five birds technique!"
        "It's impossible for him to comprehend so many forces in a short month!"
        The blue-haired woman said coldly,""I'd believe it if he could break through to the late stage of breaking through 100 in a day after cutting Ten Realms! However, it's impossible for him to comprehend so many forces in one month. Thus ... Li Hao must have comprehended many forces long ago!"
        Everyone could understand the rapid strengthening of one's physical body and vitality. As long as one had more treasures, there would be hope.
        However, power wasn't about the treasures.
        Even if they showed him an ancient weapon of enlightenment every day, he might not be able to comprehend force every day. Therefore, at this moment, the powerhouses concluded that Li Hao must have comprehended force a long time ago, perhaps more than a year ago.
        Therefore, everything on his resume was nonsense.
       
        Three years ago, Yuan Shuo had accepted Li Hao as his disciple. Li Hao might not have been an ordinary Martial Master, but a Martial Master a long time ago. Otherwise, Yuan Shuo would have received the true inheritance three years ago, and not two or three months ago, as the outside world said.
        If it was three years, a top-notch genius might be able to comprehend one force in a year.
        Banshan looked at the woman and faintly said,""Tsunami, what do you think he is now?"
        "Peak of the three yang realm, the early stage."
        Tsunami directly asserted,"of course, he is a Martial Master. His divine intent is strong and he has a lot of momentum. So, he is stronger than the average peak of the three suns. However, there is a limit to his strength." Looking at the traces of the battle, he must've experienced a fierce battle when he killed my group. He must've been injured quite badly. "
        "If I can really match up to Xuguang, killing the three of them won't be that difficult!"
        "Yes." Banshan also nodded slightly."Yue tan was killed by his sneak attack. Although he killed her very quickly, it doesn't mean that his strength is much stronger than Yue Tan's ... His strength is indeed at the peak of the three suns realm."
        They were all experts, so they could still make a general judgment based on some traces.
        Even so, it was still extremely terrifying.
        How old was Li Hao?
         He was only 20 years old.
        Now, he was able to kill a peak three-sun god master and was even more powerful than some of the top God Masters in the central region.
        Furthermore, this guy was a Martial Master, not a superhuman.
        If he could become a super now ... Wouldn't he be able to shine in an instant?
        This was what was even more terrifying!
        Of course, at Li Hao's level, it was difficult to become a super. Even if it was possible, he might not do it.
        If the other party was a superhuman, then it would be the rising light ... This kind of achievement was probably comparable to some of the top geniuses in the central region. The three major organizations and the night watchers had a few of them, but there were very few.
        And these people were all active in the central region.
        Silver moon's men had yet to arrive.
        On the Yama's side, a person had also arrived. It was not King Pingdeng, but the king of Samsara.
        The wind-elemental Samsara King kept a low profile in front of the two sunrises. However, he wasn't too afraid. At this moment, he said coldly,""I've seen Li Hao in the relic before. At that time, he disguised himself as a cultivator with a cultivation base of over 100, so I didn't notice him. No wonder the three major organizations suffered such heavy losses last time ... Needless to say, it must be this person who did it in secret!"
        Last time, everyone thought that the night patrolman was lucky.
        But now, they didn't think so. Li Hao must have been the one who killed him last time.
        Tsunami didn't care about this. He just frowned and said,""He ran away with his men ... The red moon isn't good at tracking, but Fei Tian is the best at it. Banshan, can you catch up?"
        As an assassin organization, if they were not good at tracking, how could they lock onto their target?  The members of the fairy clan were all very good at tracking.
        Banshan, on the other hand, frowned slightly under his cloak. His tone was calm,""Elder tsunami, just use your shadow God tracking!"
        "No!"
        Tsunami shook his head,"I suspect that Li Hao has a heavenly eye!" Otherwise ... How could he be so coincidental every time and quickly discover our people? so, shadow God might have been seen by him. "
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Heavenly eye?"
        Banshan was startled at first, then he thought of something and slightly frowned,"The heavenly eye ... Is that the special group of people who can see spiritual beings?"
        "Yes, it's them!"
        Tsunami said in a deep voice,"this Li Hao's divine intent is powerful, but he's somewhat similar. These people may not be very strong in martial arts and superpowers, but they can see some special materials. Once someone passes the barrier of the rising light ... It's extremely terrifying. Their mind can control everything. Such a terrifying existence has already appeared in the central continent!"
        "The shadow God is a similar material. Ordinary people can't see it, but Li Hao ... Might be able to see it."
        Otherwise, why would he be able to find Red moon's people so quickly every time? moreover, the red shadow didn't seem to have hurt Li Hao. Judging from the traces at the scene, the shadow God had been taken away by the other party. She even heard the shadow God's last wail before his death.
        This kind of people could be found everywhere.
        However, not many of them survived.
        Moreover, after cultivating it, it was very easy for one's body to explode and die. However, if one didn't die and could even cross some barriers, one would quickly become a top-notch expert. It was truly terrifying.
        All parties were secretly searching for these people.
         However, up until now, there were actually very, very few who had truly made any achievements. Most of them were dead, and the remaining ones were in the headquarters in various places, cooperating with some research.
        There were even some who were waiting in some ruins. These people could see the dangers and opportunities that others couldn 't.
        The tsunami's judgment made Banshan and the others a little serious.
        If that was the case ... It seemed that the red moon would be affected the most, but they ... Would not be affected much.
        Li Hao could see the superpowers in his body, but the people with the heavenly eyes couldn't see them. Li Hao didn't know this, and they naturally didn't know the difference.
        However, such a person would be difficult to deal with when he had reached Li Hao's level.
        Some special methods were ineffective against him.
        Any illusion, hypnosis, or smokescreen techniques would not be able to fool these heavenly eye cultivators.
        Tsunami said again,"Banshan, this Li Hao doesn't just hate me, Red Moon. He also hates flying heavens and Yama. Who has he shown mercy to?" Even Yuan Shuo is stronger than him. At least Yuan Shuo only targets me, Red Moon, but this Li Hao...Targets everyone!"
        Yuan Shuo did not only Target Red Moon, but under normal circumstances, he would not deliberately cause trouble for the two major organizations unless he happened to run into them, because the two organizations did not have red shadow.
       
        But Li Hao didn't care about anything.
        If there was no red shadow, he wouldn't mind killing them and taking the mysterious energy.
        This was the truly terrifying part. In his eyes, there were only those he could kill and those he couldn 't. There were very few people he couldn't kill, and most of them he could kill.
        He didn't care if he offended one of the three major organizations or three.
        Banshan thought for a while and nodded."Sure. But I can't stay here forever. If I can't find Li Hao in five days ... I'll have to leave."
        As for where to go ... Of course, it was to go to the crosscut Canyon.
        On the 28th of this month, heaven battling city, which was located in the transverse Canyon, might open again.
        If he didn't return, it would be easy for problems to arise with elder Xu Guang alone.
        Of course, Red Moon didn't care about losing one Xuguang. They still had 20 to 30 three suns. On this point, even Yama and Fei Tian couldn't compare to Red Moon. They were crazy to mobilize the power of 19 provinces. Fei Tian and Yama wouldn't do such a thing.
        More came, more died.
         They didn't even look at how many experts had died in Hong Yue these days.
        In Silver Moon alone, the number of three suns that had died was already close to 10.
        It was September 19th.
        There were only nine days left until the opening of heaven battling city in the transverse Canyon. He had already given Hong Yue face by agreeing to search for Li Hao here for five days. Of course, Banshan also wanted to capture or kill Li Hao.
        This person was a little scary!
        Tsunami nodded and looked at the reincarnation King,""Linghuan, what about you? I don't believe that there's only one king Pingdeng and the Ten Kings of Hell here. Aren't the others free? Aren't you afraid of being killed by Li Hao?"
        With the wind element at the peak of the three yang realm and the origin divine weapon, he was not weak. However, if he was not careful, he could still be killed by Li Hao.
        Now, only those at the rising light realm could deal with Li Hao.
        On the surface, there was only one Yama, Xu Guang, in Silver Moon, and that was King Pingdeng. But Yama and the eight Palace Masters, did not even one of them come?
        The battles in the central region had stopped a lot recently.
        Red Moon had sent four months to kill Li Hao and Yuan Shuo, King Pingdeng had come, and Fei Tian had probably sent an elder-level existence, but Banshan had at least entered the rising light.
        The reincarnation King frowned and said,""Elder tsunami, you don't have to consider me. I'll wait a little longer. The king of equality's subordinates and the 16 Lords of Hell will arrive soon ..."
        As soon as these words came out, tsunami and Banshan no longer said anything. They were both somewhat solemn.
        It seemed like the Yama was also interested.
        The king of equality was an expert of the rising light. His subordinates were different from the Samsara King. He was in charge of 16 hell branches and had 16 experts under his command. These people were almost all at the level of the three suns.
         Once these people arrived ... They were no weaker than sunguang.  In addition to the Samsara King, who was at the peak of the three suns and had an origin divine weapon, even tsunami might not be a match for him. As for Banshan, he probably had an origin divine weapon as well, but tsunami did not.
        Although tsunami was an elder, he did not have many origin divine weapons. Not every elder had one.
        People like purple Moon and linghuan were all in charge of overseeing a region. Moreover, these people had a high status in name. Tsunami was only one of the elders. There were many elders in Red Moon.
        Of course, he had heard that Fei Tian had lost an origin god weapon in heaven battling city last time. Perhaps it was the one from halfway up the mountain, but he might not have one now.
        Tsunami thought in his heart and looked into the distance,""That Li Hao is from the Silver City. The Silver City is only a small city ..."
        Just as she said that, someone laughed in the distance.""You want to use the silver Blizzard city to threaten Li Hao? Don't think about it, and don't mess around! Li Hao's parents were killed by you, his childhood friend was killed by you, and his teacher was forced to run away ... He's all alone, so how can the silver Blizzard city threaten him? Don't mess around. If you cause big trouble, no one can save you!"
        Tsunami's face was cold as he looked into the distance. A figure appeared. It was Nan Quan.
        "He Yong?"
        The few of them were a little stunned. This person ... Actually dared to come here?
        He Yong laughed and said,"what? I can't come?" It's not the royal family that's going to start a war with you! What, do you want to drag the royal family into this? "I'm not interested in you guys. I also want to find Li Hao. This guy is so powerful, I want to spar with him. His teacher has run away, but he's not bad either ..."
        Tsunami looked at him coldly,"royal family?" You're just a Martial Master Instructor, how can you represent the royal family? If I really kill you, I'd like to see if the royal family will make a move on me after 80 years of retirement!"
        He Yong, this fellow, was using the Tiger's skin to pull off a big flag.
        What royal family!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He Yong was not afraid of her and laughed,""You can try! Also, you don't really think that I can just run away from the royal family and never return, do you? My imperial family is also interested in the eight great families. Tsunami, why don't you share the news with us? I'm happy, so I can wave my hand and summon a few Dukes and even kings to help you kill hou Xiaochen!"
         “……”
        Silence.
        High Duke, Prince ...
        This somewhat ancient title was rarely mentioned by people nowadays, but everyone knew that these people had strength and power!
        He Yong's words seemed to be saying that he came here with a special mission.
        The three great organizations were well aware of the dispute between the imperial family and the nine divisions.
        80 years ago, the imperial family was forced to abdicate. It could be said that the enmity between the imperial family and the nine divisions was because they had taken over the country!
        It was just that the balance was maintained on the surface.
        Tsunami thought for a while and no longer paid attention to this person.
        There was no need to offend the royal family, but there was also no need to get too involved with them. Within the red moon, some intelligence showed that the royal family was not willing to remain silent. At least, their black armor Army was still guarding the palace that no one dared to enter and leave.
       
        Although the heavenly astral King had abdicated, and the heavenly astral king who had lost his country eighty years ago was dead, the current heavenly astral King was said to be an expert as well. He had always been unwilling to be a mere decoration and had the intention to restore his country.
        These members of the royal family all had some means and strength ...
        Thinking of this, tsunami no longer communicated with He Yong.
        He Yong didn't care. At least, the name of the royal family was still useful. At least under normal circumstances, the three major organizations and the nine divisions were not willing to have any disputes with the royal family at this stage.
        It was very troublesome!
        For example, now, tsunami and the others ignored him, but they did not attack him. If it were the people of Jiusi, these guys would definitely attack.
        The powerhouses investigated for a while and soon left.
        Banshan and tsunami left together. As for using the silver Blizzard city to threaten Li Hao ... Just like what Southern Fist said, would it work?
        His family and friends were all dead, and his teacher had run away. Was he supposed to threaten Li Hao with a passerby?
        Did he really think Li Hao was a living Buddha?
         Moreover, if he were to make a move on Silver City, it would be easy for him to be hunted down by Silver moon's officials. It would be even more serious than now. Tsunami thought about it and quickly chose to give up.
        The Samsara King also quickly escaped and began to wait for the arrival of the 16 Lords of Hell. Yama's side clearly wanted to try and see if they could capture Li Hao.
        After everyone had left, Nan Quan jumped to the previous battle.
        He searched and checked for a while, and he had an idea.
        Li Hao, what a man!
        He was walking on the path of five internal organs merging with the spirit. Just like his teacher, his five internal organs merging with Five Forces!
        Metal, fire, and earth seemed to have been gathered together.
        So, the water and wood hadn't formed yet?
        The fusion of the three forces had killed a peak three yang cultivator ... Yuan Shuo, who had fused the two forces together with the blood saber art, had killed the eyebrow-reaching rod and was also considered a peak three yang cultivator ...
        "This master and disciple, are they going to compete? This means that Li Hao's strength is comparable to Yuan Shuo 's. "
        "But I heard that Yuan Shuo has also displayed his three forces. He's slightly stronger than Li Hao ..."
        He thought to himself that the strength of this master and disciple was probably about to be equal.
        However, if Yuan Shuo followed the prescribed order, he would be able to fuse the five Forces sooner or later. Li Hao, on the other hand, would be in trouble. It wouldn't be easy for him to comprehend two more forces.
        "Water force ... That Liu Long seems to be water force. In that case, we're still short of wood momentum. Does that kid have any clues?"
        Nanquan analyzed the situation, but he wasn't sure if Li Hao had any ideas.
        However, at the scene, he could feel the traces left behind by the ninth-refinement force.
        Moreover, there was also the momentum of waves.
        Perhaps Li Hao already had a plan for the water.
        "Wood force ..."
        Nan Quan thought for a while and suddenly laughed.  He did know that the Silver Moon martial forest had a wood Force Sword technique. It was said that it was also excavated from an ancient ruin, and its master was known as the wooden swordsman.
        However, this swordsmanship wasn't very famous.
        "Catkin swordsman...Wooden swordsman ..."
        He thought for a moment. Did the Willow catkin sword have a successor?
        Liu Xu Jian is dead. It seems that his only successor has also been dead for many years. In that case, his inheritance has been broken?
        The catkin sword was not one of the Seven Swords of Silvermoon. Back then, it was said that it could be ranked in the top ten swordsmen of Silvermoon, but it was not on the hero list. Who would care about it?
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "If this kid could obtain the legacy of the Willow catkin sword, he might have a chance of comprehending wood force. Unfortunately ... The legacy was lost. As for the others, I don't know if there are any wood Force Sword techniques."
        Shaking his head slightly, Nan Quan stopped thinking about it.
        If Li Hao was lucky, he might be able to obtain it. After all, it was an ancient book. There might be some in other ruins. If he was unlucky, he could rely on himself. There might be other secret techniques or insights. He could also learn wood force.
        However, the Willow silk sword could directly comprehend wood force step by step, which would save Li Hao a lot of time.
        He observed the scene for a while, and soon, he also left silently.
        As Nan Quan retreated, more people quickly arrived. They quickly observed the situation and left.
        In the land of Silvermoon, it was not only the three major organizations and the night patrollers, but also the imperial family. The nine divisions, including some big shots, also had eyes on this place.
        Soon, detailed information about Li Hao was displayed everywhere.
        Three types of force!
        Perhaps like Yuan Shuo, Li Hao's path as a Martial Master hadn't reached its limits.
        ……
        At the same time.
        In the cave, Li Hao ended his training and let out a long breath. He felt that his body had become much stronger, and the injuries of his internal organs had mostly healed, but his lungs were still not used to it.
         As for the dark energy, he had completely absorbed it.
        He didn't feel much change. The only change was that his aura was more restrained. Li Hao felt that it was of little value, as he wasn't someone who would launch sneak attacks.
        A Martial master's aura was reserved to begin with. What was the use of this dog shit dark energy if it made him even more reserved?
        "My cough is finally getting better ..."
        Previously, Li Hao had to cough every few minutes. Now, he might cough lightly in about an hour or so. His lungs felt uncomfortable, and his internal organs were now at 1500 cubic meters. At 2000 cubic meters, he would definitely not have any more problems.
        However, he had consumed too many divine power stones. Li Hao did not have enough to waste.
        "My body, bones, and internal organs have all become stronger!"
        "My overall strength has increased a little, but ... Not by much. It's mainly still my force. I haven't comprehended water force, but I have some ideas. It should be soon."
        "The wood force ... Is the real trouble!"
        Li Hao sighed. With the fusion of the four forces, he should be even more powerful. At the peak of the three-sun realm, he might be able to match an early stage rising light realm cultivator. With the bloody blade technique, he could definitely match an early stage rising light realm cultivator.
       
        However, he really had no clue about the fifth force!
        Wood force ... Where did he comprehend it from?
        Among the five birds technique, the deer expansion technique corresponded to wood force. However, Li Hao's path was different from his teacher 's. In addition, the five birds technique was not a sword technique, so there were not many similarities. Even if Li Hao had comprehended deer force, it was very likely that he did not have the wood attribute.
        Although Shi did not have any attribute and could only be distributed after one had comprehended it, if one's direction was wrong from the start, then the Shi that one had comprehended would not be able to change to any attribute one wanted.
        While he was thinking, li Hengxing rushed to the ground from a distance and thrust his sword forward. He lowered his voice and said to Wu Chao, who was next to him,"I feel like I'm comprehending force. I'm really a genius. I've only entered the late stage for less than two days, but I already feel like I'm going to comprehend force. Once the Willow catkin sword is used, the Willow leaves will flutter and the branches will coil around me. It can trap and kill. I have a feeling that once my force is formed, I'll definitely be able to attack and defend as one. Wu Ran ran, what will you have to compete with me then?"
        "Willow catkin sword ..."
        Li Hao was slightly startled and looked at Li Heng.
        Li Heng was the successor of the Willow catkin sword. He knew that the successor of the Willow catkin sword had stayed in the Silver City for a while but was quickly killed. Li Heng, that half-baked guy, had never been able to use the Willow catkin sword well and had never been able to show its power.
        Hearing that he was going to comprehend Shi, Li Hao was startled. So fast?
         This meant that the sword technique itself had the ability to go straight through force.
        Not all secret skills could be used to comprehend force after a certain level of cultivation. The nine-refinements force could, and the five birds secret technique could. However, these were all top secret skills that the 36 heroes had possessed back then.
        Willow catkin sword works too?
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The Willow leaves fluttered, and the tree branches twined ...
        It can attack and defend?
        At this moment, Li Hao's gaze turned to Li Heng. Why did it sound like ... Mushi?
        Li Hao's heart felt strange.
        I'm sleepy, but has the pillow come to my door?
        But ... Li Heng's words were a little exaggerated. Was he just saying it casually, or did he really feel the pleasure of comprehending force?
        Li Heng, who had been bragging, suddenly felt a gaze on him. He instantly turned his head, and when he saw Li Hao's strange look, he swallowed his saliva and instantly shut up.
        At this moment, he no longer had any dissatisfaction with this person, only respect.  Not to mention him, even if his cheap Grandmaster was resurrected, Liu Xu Jian wouldn't be ranked among the 36 heroes back then. As for Li Hao, there was a high probability that he would be pushed down by one person and become one of the characters on the hero list.
        Li Hao, on the other hand, only looked at him without saying anything.
        It was all just his own thoughts. Besides, Li Heng was full of empty talk ... Let's wait and see!
        If he had truly comprehended force, it might have appeared very quickly.
        At that time ... Perhaps he could ask.
        p Secret techniques were precious and usually wouldn't be passed on to outsiders. However, this guy's sect was destroyed and he had only become a monk halfway through his life. If he was given more benefits, he might be able to exchange for the secret technique of the Willow catkin sword.  If the Liu Xu sword was still alive, Li Hao naturally wouldn't get it through Li Heng. If he wanted to find it, he had to find the Liu Xu sword. This was the rule.
        However, since he was the only child of his sect ... It was not a big problem.
        Li Hao stopped thinking about it. The most important thing now was to comprehend water force.
        Once the water force was formed, Li Hao would have the capital to resist Xuguang!
         "As long as my strength grows day by day ... The information you have is all in the past!"
        Li Hao looked into the distance. Even though the rocks blocked his vision, he could feel that the sun was chasing him.
        Just wait and see!
        "I'll be able to comprehend the last step of the ninth refinement force very soon. Once the water force is formed, even if you don't look for me, I'll look for you. I'm lacking in divine energy stones, but sunguang probably has a lot, right?
        Looking at the martial masters in the team, Li Hao smiled.
        There were a lot of people in the middle stage of the 100-point realm, but there were only a few in the early stage and a lot in the late stage. Li Hao even had a vague feeling that some of them might be able to sense Shi on their own.
        As expected, a life-and-death battle was the best opportunity for a Martial Master to comprehend.
        No wonder martial masters liked to fight and learn from each other, fighting to the death.
        If there were a few more Qian fighters in the team, Liu Long would be able to step into the first step of the spirit accumulation stage ...... Then, these people would be able to kill three suns. Their progress was so fast that even Li Hao felt that the demon hunt squad's name would be known all around the world!
       
        In the cave, everyone had rested enough during the day and absorbed and digested enough mysterious energy.
        After eating some dry food and drinking some water, everyone recovered their vitality.
        The team's strength had clearly increased by a lot.
        However, it was still not enough for Li Hao.
        He was not in a hurry.
        If all of these people had stepped into the warrior power level, then he would be the core of the array and the 50 warrior power would provide him with inner strength. Then, the situation would not be like this.
        Even if it didn't work, in fact, if 50 of them broke through 100 levels and formed a formation, it would be of great help to him. However, the improvement wouldn't be too great, so Li Hao didn't have such an idea for the time being.
        "Everyone, get ready. We'll set off soon!"
        Li Hao said, and everyone began to pack up. There was nothing much to pack up, so they just cleaned up the traces they had left behind.
        A moment later, the group of people finished packing.
         Li Hao opened the rock at the entrance of the cave and walked out. He looked around and frowned.
        The next moment, Li Hao leaped and disappeared.
        Soon, he landed on a small mountain peak.
        At this moment, a creature that looked like a leopard turned its head to look at Li Hao and instantly fled into the distance.
        Li Hao frowned.
        He had just seen a small light orb. It was very weak and he thought it was a superpower. In the end, it wasn't but a leopard.
        Had it become a spirit?
        He knew that there were some wild beasts in the central continent that had turned into demons, but he had never seen one. Of course, the Black Panther was actually a dog that had turned into a demon.
        It was said that there were powerful demons in the central region that could even devour the light of dawn.
        But Li Hao had never considered these problems before.
        Now, after entering the grey Mountains, he had actually discovered a leopard that was about to become a spirit so quickly. This was only the outer area of the grey Mountains.
        Li Hao looked into the depths of the mountain and frowned.
        Could there also be a great demon in the mountains?
        He had come to the Cang mountains because the terrain was steep and covered with trees, making it easy to hide. He had not come to die.
        It was still okay for the big monsters as he could see them.
        But ... What if it was a great demon of the martial path?
        Did I?
        There was.
        'Black Dog, isn't it just a little martial demon?'
        It would be troublesome if they encountered such a situation.
        The Green Mountains were too big, and who knew if there would be great demons like those in the central region? even though Silver Moon had never heard of any demons appearing, if there were in the central region, it was not impossible for the North to have none.
        p It was just that these guys were probably staying in the mountains and were too lazy to go out.   Li Hao watched the leopard escape and didn't attack.  It would be bad if he attracted the attention of the older ones after hitting the younger ones. The current situation was unclear, so he didn't plan to deal with these monsters at will for the time being to avoid trouble.
        ……
        A moment later, Li Hao returned to his original spot.
        "Everyone, be careful," he said in a deep voice."It seems that some wild animals in the Cang mountains have turned into demons."
        The moment these words came out, it caused a commotion.
        Soon, Hong Qing walked over and whispered,""Leader, my father once said that when the superpowers rose, there were some strange things. Some domestic animals even became demonized."
        "Demons are actually everywhere. It's just a matter of how many there are."
        "However, I've heard that Silver Moon doesn't have any monsters ..."
        Li Hao was startled. Silver Moon did not have any demons?
        Why?
        Indeed, other than the Black Panther he had seen in the Silver Moon, he had never seen any other Fey. But now, could he be considered to have left the Silver Moon's range?
        Hong Qing didn't know the details, but he had heard Hong Yitang mention it before. He thought about it and said,""My dad said that the Silver Moon is a little special. The monsters naturally avoid the Silver Moon, and it's actually very difficult for the wild animals in the Silver Moon to become monsters, so they can't absorb enough mysterious energy. The Silver Moon is a land with little mysterious energy. There are very few superpowers here, so we have to borrow external superpowers such as divine power stones and origin divine weapons to obtain enough mysterious energy. "
        "And in some areas of the central region, if you cultivate, you can actually absorb the mysterious energy."
        "And after 20 years, Silver Moon seems to be getting more and more barren."
        Li Hao was slightly dazed. No one had ever mentioned this before.
        In other words, Silver Moon was not suitable for the cultivation of superpowers.
        The superpowers that were born here were all converted by large organizations or night watchers. It required a process of drawing the power into the body. Some of them were God's favored priests, and some entered the realm of superpowers after obtaining some mysterious powers by accident.
        However, he had never heard of anyone who cultivated naturally and broke through to become a super.
        "You mean ... There are still people in the central continent who can cultivate and become supers?"
        "That's right. Guild leader, you don't know?"
        Hong Qing looked at Li Hao in confusion. Isn't this common sense?
         Li Hao was silent.
        He did not know.
        No one had mentioned it. Perhaps everyone thought he knew, but he was a country bumpkin from Silver City. Other than hearing some secret news from Yuan Shuo, he had left after going to white moon City for a few days. How could he know too much?
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The people from the southern Fist probably didn't take this seriously.
        Of course, he wouldn't tell Li Hao about it.
        In that case, the central region could naturally give birth to enough supers, and the mysterious energy was everywhere. The Silver Moon actually had it too, but it was very little. Hao lianchuan, who was at the three yang level, could absorb dozens or hundreds of cubic meters of mysterious energy in a few months of cultivation without using any of it.
        However, would it be meaningful for a three yang cultivator to cultivate for a few months without any consumption and accumulate a few hundred cubic meters of mysterious energy in a year?
        "I see!"
        Li Hao understood.
        Silver moon's people found it extremely difficult to become supers.
       
        Not to mention those wild animals, they didn't have any intelligence and could only rely on natural absorption of mysterious energy to transform into demons. There weren't enough mysterious people, let alone wild beasts.
        There were many monsters in other places because of the mysterious air.
        Even though it wasn't to the point of being everywhere, as long as he was lucky, he might be able to absorb some.
        Silver Moon, on the other hand, could not.
        Why?
        Nan Quan had said that the Silver Moon was a very ancient place and was also the center of the world in the past. Every blade of grass and tree here might contain the charm of the great Dao of the ancient civilization, but why were there so few mysteries?
        The silver-tier warrior had said that there was no future in the path of energy.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It was called superpower.
        Did this mean that the Silver Moon rejected all powers?
        Many thoughts appeared in Li Hao's mind.
         That was why becoming a Martial Master was not as difficult as becoming a superhuman on Silver moon's side. That was why it was the Holy Land of the martial arts world back then.
        Li Hao looked up at the sky, but he couldn't see the blizzard Silver city's Eight Trigrams.
        However, Li Hao suddenly thought of the eight trigrams.
        There were very few superpowers in the Silver City.
        Although there were not many Silver Moon superpowers in the first place, there were almost no native superpowers in the huge Silver City with a population of a million. There were pitifully few of them, and no God-favored priests were ever born in the Silver City. Even if there were superpowers, they were converted.
        And ... The more he stayed in the Silver City, the harder it would be for him to advance.
        Liu Long and Liu Yan ...
        This group of people could be considered the leaders of the martial masters in the Silver City, but it was difficult for them to become supers if they stayed in the Silver City. However, yunyao had advanced, and she was the only Martial Master in the team who had advanced to become a super.
        At this moment, Li Hao had some vague ideas in his mind.
        Did the silver Blizzard city have no superpowers because of the eight trigrams?
        Suppress?
        Blockade?
        Or was there some other reason?
        Wang Henggang and the other Martial Master powerhouses had also left the Silver City and entered the supernatural realm through the mysterious energy.
        Liu Long's inability to advance, was it because his mysterious energy was not enough, or ... He just couldn 't!
        Silver City could not be upgraded!
        Thinking this, Li Hao turned around and looked at Liu Long,""Boss, have there ever been a god tier master in the blizzard Silver City?"
        "Ah?"
        Liu Long was stunned for a moment. After thinking for a while, he shook his head,"I don't think so. Our Silver City has too few people. We only have one million people. How can it be that simple?"
        "Are there very few heavenly god tier Masters?"
        Li Hao said,'there's not even one in a million people. Doesn't that mean that there's only one in a few million, or even tens of millions? Could it be that Silver Moon can only send 10 god tier Masters?"
        "There are very few God Masters in the entire Silvermoon!"
         Liu Long shook his head."Hong Qing just said that Silver Moon is a barren land with superpowers. In the beginning, there were a few god tier Masters who were blessed by the heavens, but they were killed by the martial masters of the older generation. In fact, there are not many god tier Masters left in Silver Moon." There are outsiders, but there are more of them. We don't have enough here. "  There were very few of them in the entire Silver Moon!
        At this moment, Li Hao suddenly thought of the stone gate ruins. Back then, the stone gate ruins rejected the power of the red shadow, but he had forgotten to test if it rejected the mysterious energy.
        At that time, Li Hao and Yuan Shuo were both martial masters, and they didn't have the ability to test it out.
        He suppressed the thoughts in his heart.
        At this moment, Li Hao had a deeper understanding of what the southern Fist sect had said that day.
        There seemed to be a lot of disadvantages to becoming a super Martial Master.
        It might not be a bad thing for the Silver Moon to suppress superpowers and mysterious powers. Perhaps this land was indeed only suitable for martial masters to cultivate, and the mysterious powers did not awaken successfully in the Silver Moon.
        This place was already outside of the Silver Moon, and the Cang mountains could be considered the border of the Silver Moon. Perhaps there were many mysterious energies here that could turn these wild animals into demons.
        "There are few Silvermoon demons, but there might not be any here. Everyone, be careful!"
        After reminding them again, Li Hao continued to lead the team.
        The grey Mountain was too big. The star dynasty didn't have many maps of the geography of the grey Mountain. It was the dividing line between the two countries in the early years, but it was gradually forgotten and abandoned.
        It was just a huge mountain range and didn't have any special products, so no one paid much attention to it.
        It was difficult for ordinary people to find the right direction.
        Li Hao knew a little about it, but he didn't know much about it. Liu Long and the other Silver City locals more or less knew the general direction, but they were all like Li Hao. They were blind people who only knew which direction was which. They didn't know much about it.
        At this moment, Li Hao was heading east in the general direction.
        In the East, at the place where the sunrise.
        There was no problem with the direction, and everyone was a Martial Master. Even if there was no way to go, they could still cross the mountains.
        ……
        Just as Li Hao's group set off again ...
        At the foot of the grey Mountain.
        At this moment, two people had arrived.
         Mountain and tsunami.
        Banshan looked at the cloud-shrouded Cangshan Mountain range and frowned slightly. Tsunami also frowned and said,""Is this ... The Cang mountains?"
        "Yes,"
        Banshan said in a low voice,"the Cang mountains ... It's a mountain range that has existed since ancient times. There have been records of it since ancient times." The Cang mountains are outside the Silver Moon border. I'm worried that ... A great demon might appear here!"
        Silvermoon without demons.
        However, it was possible that there would be one in the Cang mountains.
        Banshan and the others had more information than Li Hao.
        Silver Moon was a barren land, but other than Silver Moon, the mysterious energy in any other place was slightly richer than Silver Moon 's. Hence, Silver Moon did not have many superpowers and was not very strong.
        He was stronger than Silver Moon in every other aspect. Silver Moon relied on the fact that he had many martial masters. Some of them had turned into superpowers, while others had cultivated their martial masters to their peak and became powerful.
        In terms of superpowers ... In 99 provinces, Silver Moon was at least one of the weakest.
