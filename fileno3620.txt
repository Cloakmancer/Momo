But were the other grade-9 cultivators ... The same?It was impossible for everyone to be taken away. In this chaos, there must be other ninth rank venerable sovereign worlds that had been hidden and destroyed. Today, they could possibly revive.Huntian's actions might attract these people.Moreover, even if he did not make a move, these people might appear. Therefore, what he needed to do now was to block all the powerhouses who wanted to enter the battlefield.However, they did not have enough manpower!The people in world of five elements might be left behind by the master of five elements. Now that spring and autumn was dealing with them, this was on the surface. What about in the dark?At this moment, huntian looked at Li Hao in the distance ... I don't expect you to be able to deal with the Tribulation.However, it could at least delay him for a while.However, when he felt the aura of the catastrophe, which was so strong that it was unbearable, huntian moved. He couldn't watch any longer, or the eastern side would collapse.Once it collapsed, the three from the East would not be the only ones suffering. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  He, huntian, would also be severely injured.……Natural disaster, earthly calamity.The power of countless great DAOs emerged, and the plague rampaged. In an instant, even the venerable sovereigns felt dizzy when they smelled the aura and were infected by the plague.The weaker cultivators even turned purple and retreated quickly.The Tribulation hadn't even struck yet, but they were already unable to withstand it. It was terrifying to the extreme.The fire in the air suddenly started burning.Some of the Silver Moon martial masters growled as their bodies caught on fire. They stumbled a few steps back as if they had tripped over something. The venerable sovereigns were like children, falling to the ground. In the blink of an eye, they were covered by the chaotic force and were almost crushed.This was a tribulation!The Lord of calamity walked forward step by step and smiled at Li Hao. As he approached, the entire Silver Moon master group was in trouble.Natural and man-made disasters ...Nan Quan accidentally used too much fire and lost control of it, causing the people around him to suffer as well. They all burned themselves and their expressions were extremely ugly.Nan Quan was also very innocent. He was also dizzy from the fire. At this moment, he was also helpless and a little fearful.They weren't afraid of powerful enemies, but ... People like the Lord of calamity seemed to bring countless disasters and accidents to you when they got close. They couldn't help but make people suffer and fear them.Li Hao, on the other hand, saw more.He had been watching the entire time since he had fused with the chaos great Dao. The void was filled with spirituality and the power of the great Dao, but no one else could see it. This so-called disaster was not an accident.Instead, it was the Dao of spirituality that was controlling them.There was no such thing as a disaster for no reason!Only ... Man-made.Of course, to the weak, they could not see or touch it. They were venerable sovereigns, but they almost killed themselves with a few moves. Such a threat was far greater than those strong people who could kill them with one punch.It was too terrifying! The rank eight venerable sovereigns 'auras also exploded. In the eyes of venerable sovereign Wu Shan, it was as if the fate of each other had appeared ... But with a single look, blood instantly spurted out of his eyes. What he saw was a golden light, a great Dao, a powerful and piercing light!If he tried to move the other party's fate, he might not even be able to move it at all and might even suffer a backlash.Lightning rose from the Thunder Emperor's body. However, the surrounding Primal Chaos tribulation lightning suppressed him so much that he couldn't raise his head.Myriad incarnations, Dao Qi, and Kong Ji all wanted to explode. At this moment, they all felt an invisible suppression.All of a sudden, the five eighth level venerable sovereigns were suppressed by the other party.It was too terrifying!"Retreat!"At this moment, Kong Ji had to send a message to Li Hao."Run to the West. Huntian is in the West. We still have a chance ..."He wasn't afraid of battle, but he could only resign himself to his fate when dealing with an expert that he obviously couldn't deal with.At this moment, he was also a little worried about his father.His father was currently fighting at Tian Fang's side. If even the calamity was so powerful, then Tian Fang would be even more terrifying. Could the human King and the others match up to Tian Fang?Li Hao, why aren't you running? what are you waiting for?……Li Hao was waiting for an opportunity.When the spirituality was at its most active!At this moment, he was not.It was only the beginning. The great Dao had a spirit. Spirit. Controlling the great Dao was the Dao spirit. The Dao spirit would make the great Dao naturally orderly. This was the rough rules.The spirits at this time were not active because their spirituality had been weakened over the years. However, as the will of the ninth-grade Dao spirit descended, they could control the spirit, so the Dao spirit gradually became active.They were fusing!The spirits of the cultivators who had died before were now converging. Only in this way could the Lord of calamity descend and become stronger, making his great Dao more spiritual.The reason the Tribulation didn't use its full strength was because it didn't have enough spirituality.If he attacked now, he might be able to win, but he would not be as strong as he had expected. He might have to pay a price. Once the price was too high, he might be unlucky because there was still the master of Tian Fang here.Would Tian Fang allow him to gain a foothold?Not necessarily!Therefore, in order to maintain his strongest state, he had to activate his spirituality to the extreme.Li Hao had been waiting for this moment.He was unfathomable and only stood still. The Lord of calamity, on the other hand, was a little fearful and frowned. This second generation time cultivator ... Why was he not moving?"Li Hao, if you surrender to me, I might let you go this time ... As long as you sign a great Dao agreement with me ... And punish you with the chaos lightning tribulation ... I might be able to spare you!"

Chapter 3621 Breaking The Tribulation (3)
Li Hao wasn't in a hurry, and neither was he.Just as Li Hao had seen and thought, he was still gathering intelligence. He had to admit that the chaos a million years later had too little intelligence, but at least he still had some. This was his only consolation.He needed to wait for his spirituality to gather to its peak before he had enough strength to deal with the following changes.The people in front of him were just small shrimps."A great Dao agreement?"Li Hao laughed,'senior, do you still dare to sign the great Dao agreement with me? I've experienced quite a few Primal Chaos lightning tribulations. Senior, what do you think you can do to me?"The Lord of calamity raised his eyebrows slightly and smiled."The Thunder tribulations you experienced were all in disorder. They were all scattered in the chaos. Perhaps ... You think that's all there is to it. But you don't understand that when I existed in the chaos, the Thunder tribulations were orderly. The true chaos Thunder tribulation was far more powerful than you think!""Do you understand all this?"The Lord of calamity smiled."Do you understand?""The current lightning tribulation is just some scattered lightning tribulation. Do you really think that the chaos lightning tribulation is that simple?"Only when I exist, when I gather my spirituality, when the spirit of the great Dao appears, will this lightning tribulation be truly invincible. Anyone below level nine will be struck to death!Even at grade-9, some of the weaker ones would be seriously injured even if they were not killed.Li Hao had underestimated the chaos lightning tribulation!He then looked at Tian Fang."I'm afraid your friends won't be able to help you. Tian Fang is very strong. He's the strongest among the type 9 powerhouses. He's only in his recovery period. Otherwise, even if it's just a clone, it's enough to kill anyone! He's far more powerful than you can imagine ...""I know,"Li Hao nodded.The others were all depressed. At this time, the two of them were acting strange. Li Hao didn't fight back, but the Lord of calamity was still in the mood to chat with Li Hao.Were these two here to chat or to fight?After chatting for a while, there seemed to be a slight tremor near the Thunder region. The Lord of calamity looked to the side and smiled. He didn't care. He felt that someone had come.But ...It was too late!At this moment, the power of great DAOs around them trembled as if they had come to life, and countless chaotic power surged toward them.Its spirituality appeared.Thunder was born in the void.At this moment, his spirituality had reached its most active state. He smiled."You're waiting for someone to save you? Huntian? Perhaps it has something to do with the order ... It's a pity that he's a little late!"If he had come earlier and I hadn't recovered to my peak, perhaps he would have been able to contend against me.But now, it was too late!In the distance, huntian also frowned. He felt a strong spiritual activity and wanted to curse. Li Hao, you idiot. Even if you interfered with him for a while, he might not have recovered to his peak so quickly.[If you knew I was nearby, you would have stopped me at least. You bastard ...]Huntian wanted to curse at this moment!è‰¹! "This is really bad. Could Li Hao have reached an agreement with a tier 9? if that's the case, I might have been fooled. If Li Hao is still with a tier 9, then we ... Might have all fallen into a trap!"Not good!When he thought of this, his expression changed.At this moment, Li Hao smiled. The time had come. He had been waiting for so long. His opponent was in his strongest state, and this ... Was the most critical moment to defeat him.Spirituality?I have one too, you know?In an instant, the wind and clouds surged.The Lord of calamity was still looking at huntian, thinking about whether to kill huntian first and then slowly deal with this time cultivator, or to take down the time cultivator first and then do something else ...But at this moment, countless divine runes suddenly appeared around Li Hao. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  It was countless!From Qian Wuliang's side, tens of thousands of divine runes suddenly overflowed and gathered into a book.It was so many that it was unbelievable!Silver Moon!The cultivators of Silvermoon had gathered countless divine texts over the past few days. Although they were weak, the Silvermoon had the same origin, so all the divine texts gathered at that moment.A fierce tiger appeared in front of Li Hao.The Tiger roared and swallowed the book!The spirit of the ferocious Tiger!"Spirit?"The Lord of calamity's expression changed slightly. Without saying anything, it reached out to grab Li Hao and the Tiger. It was unbelievable that this guy had gathered a spirit, and ... A very strong spirit!It was a good thing!If he devoured this Dao spirit, his strength might even increase. He might even be no weaker than Tian Fang's clone. With enough spirituality, he would be able to extract enough energy and control more power of the great Dao.It was a good thing. Of course, it was also a little shocking.How did this guy in front of him gather such a powerful spirit?Strange!However, at this moment, Li Hao suddenly laughed. The fierce tiger instantly merged with the void. In the lightning territory, thousands of lightning pillars suddenly trembled. This lightning territory was also the other party's great path universe.The Tiger suddenly swooped down and went straight for the lightning pillar. The lightning pillar and the stars of the great path were actually the same concept.The Tiger seemed to want to occupy the lightning pillar and seize control of the path of tribulation. The Lord of calamity suddenly sneered and reached out to grab Li Hao without a care!You're underestimating me!"Your spirit isn't weak. In fact, it's very strong. However, these pillars of lightning are all part of the great Dao of calamity. He's controlled them for many years, so how could they be taken away so easily? if that's the case, any random rank nine would be able to take away his great Dao of calamity.

In an instant!A ferocious beast suddenly appeared above the ten thousand lightning pillars and converged into a spirit. It seemed to have appeared out of thin air and opened its huge mouth to devour the Tiger!"Thank you!" The Lord of calamity laughed."I've earned a lot this time!"Li Hao, a good man.The huge ferocious beast was also a spirit, the spirit of the catastrophe. However, it was somewhat illusionary. Since it had not descended with its true body, it only had this much spirit. However, it was more than enough to deal with a fierce tiger. Its huge mouth was like a black hole!And the Tiger had taken the initiative to feed itself ... This was a great nourishment for the Tribulation!Huntian had been a little surprised.But in an instant, he couldn't help but growl,"quickly take it back ...."This time, he was really finished!Li Hao, you idiot. Your scheme was not bad, but now, you've helped him. Once his spirit devours your spirit of great Dao, you might even lose your time.He instantly released his aura and charged over without caring about anything else. He crossed the void at an extremely fast speed!The powerful aura made the Lord of calamity frown slightly. This guy was really powerful. If it was back in the day, with enough spirituality, it might have already entered the ninth rank.Li Hao, on the other hand, was like a Mantis trying to stop a chariot.The spirit of the ferocious Tiger charged straight at the other party.In an instant, he entered the beast's mouth. The beast swallowed him in one gulp. At this moment, it was as if it had come to life. It looked at Li Hao as if it was smiling.A great tonic delivered to the door! Li Hao was also smiling. His smile was rather bright.You ... Really ate it.Did he really not hesitate at all?Do you know what this spirit is made of? how dare you eat it?"Calamity? didn't your mother teach you not to eat things given by strangers?"The Lord of calamity was slightly dazed. With an unsightly expression, it struck its palm at Li Hao!Obviously, he felt that Li Hao was humiliating him.Li Hao, on the other hand, laughed. He laughed so radiantly that it was ... Crazy!"Did you not see what I was doing earlier? I want to ... Be resurrected!"Desire!All spirits, whether they were ferocious Tigers, angry, or out of their cages, were all a kind of desire.Just as long Zhan did, Li Hao did it even more thoroughly. He sent all of his spirit of desire into the spirit of the great Dao. In an instant, the Tiger seemed to explode in the body of a ferocious beast!A monstrous power of desire spread out.Humans had desires.All living beings had desires. When a great Dao had a spirit, the spirit of the great Dao also had desires. However, they were always restrained. When their desires exploded out, they were catalyzed, and no living being could stop them.And what was Li Hao's greatest desire?Resurrection!Yes, this was his greatest desire.What did resurrection require? He needed to ... Explore the chaos great Dao, the origin of life, and the origin of chaos.In just an instant ... The beast seemed to be disturbed by something. Suddenly, it emerged from the endless void like a silly cat.To descend to the human world!"Roar!"His roar filled the sky, and the entire world seemed to be filled with catastrophes and desires.It filled everyone's mind."Resurrect!"At this moment, desire seemed to take over the main body. After all, this spirit had just awakened. If it was its main body, Li Hao might not be able to do anything, but it was just a Dao spirit that had just awakened.In an instant, tens of thousands of lightning pillars exploded in the void. They instantly merged and turned into the great Dao of tribulation! Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  The Lord of calamity's expression changed drastically!The great Dao was somewhat out of control!Losing control wasn't scary. What was scary was that the beast suddenly roared,""Resurrect!"The roar resounded in all directions!The next moment, the beast was wrapped in thousands of lightning pillars and rushed into the sky. Suddenly, it rushed toward the chaos great Dao that ordinary people couldn't see. It wanted to enter the chaos great Dao, strip off its life origin, and revive ...As for what he was resurrecting and who he was resurrecting, Dao Ling had no idea.He only knew that only by entering it and stripping away the origin of the great Dao and the origin of life could he fulfill his desires."Dao Ling is just a child ..."Li Hao murmured. Whether it was his own Dao spirit or the one from the catastrophe, their Dao spirits were actually very childish and pure. For example, er Mao was actually very mature. It was rare to see such a mature Dao spirit.And such a pure child, once controlled by desire ... Would not have any self-control.The Lord of calamity's expression changed instantly!Not good!His Dao spirit rushed toward the chaos great Dao with the power of his great Dao. At this moment, it broke through all the obstacles and was about to kill the origin of chaos.At the same time.In the distance.Master of tianfang's clone suddenly frowned. Idiot!Yes, an idiot.Tribulation had been tricked. His Dao spirit had charged into the depths of chaos with the power of the great Dao. Many people could not tolerate this.In that instant ...In the depths of the primal Chaos, in an endless land.All of a sudden, the statues opened their eyes. The next moment, someone attacked directly, not at the catastrophe, but at the dark land in the distance. The power of the great path burst out, and he shouted,""You dare!"The Lord of calamity also opened his eyes instantly, his face ashen!He wanted to speak ...However, several ninth level venerable sovereigns nearby opened their eyes and looked at him. One of them was furious."You disgraceful thing! Tribulation! You dare to let your Dao invade the depths of the primordial chaos? What do you want to do?""It's Li Hao, the second generation ..."The Lord of calamity's expression changed and he shouted.

Before he could finish, the other venerable sovereigns didn't even bother to listen. Someone shouted,""Let's join forces and kill the spirit of calamity!"The Lord of calamity's expression changed!Among these people, some of them were really worried, while some of them did it on purpose. Who asked him to be the first to escape from the calamity?At this moment, his Dao spirit was attacking the depths of chaos ... Everyone naturally found an excuse.It would not be easy to start from other places.Now was a good opportunity!The rank nine venerable sovereigns didn't give him any chance to explain. Suddenly, their auras grew and the power of their great DAOs rushed into the depths of the chaos."Tribulation, suppress your Dao spirit. Once it breaks through the chaos great Dao and interferes with the source of life, we can only kill you!"“……”The Lord of calamity's expression was extremely ugly. He gritted his teeth and growled in a low voice,""It's just a Dao spirit gathered by my clone. I might not be able to break through it. Give me some time and I can control it back ..."But who would give you the time?No one would!In an instant, several venerable sovereigns attacked, and the great Dao roared!Countless Dao laws erupted!Boom! Boom! Boom!In the distance, a ferocious beast seemed to have gone mad as it charged straight into the depths of the origin of chaos. The next moment, shadows appeared in the void and charged at the ferocious beast!BOOM!A loud sound reverberated through the heavens and earth. The Lord of calamity trembled slightly and gritted his teeth. At this moment, he was unable to restrain his anger!Damn it!Bastard!"That Li Hao has the Dao spirit of desire. We have to kill him ..." He couldn't help but roar.Give me some time!"I can control and suppress him. After all, Li Hao is only at the eighth step, not at the ninth step. I can suppress him. It won't be too late for you to make your move after I kill him.However, no one cared about him.Even the master of Tian Fang had his eyes closed, as if he was not awake at all.You insisted on rushing out and offended everyone.Now, they had something on him again ... Besides, Li Hao's Dao spirit was among them, too. Since they were going to exterminate him, they might as well exterminate him together. Who had the time to separate and distinguish?Once and for all!Someone comforted him."You only have a part of the Dao spirit, while Li Hao has fused all of it. This will kill all the Dao spirits he gave birth to and prevent him from advancing any further ... Once his Dao spirit is destroyed, Li Hao will only be an Ordinary Level 8. There's nothing to fear!"These words did make some sense. However, to the Lord of the Tribulation, the loss was too great. He had lost a part of his Dao spirit, his clone might be finished, all those who returned were dead, and the power of his great Dao was damaged ...Such a loss, even if it was him, he would cry.He still wanted to fight for it!But in the next moment, countless great path nomological laws erupted. BOOM!The ferocious beast that was charging over was directly blown up!The Lord of calamity grunted as blood flowed out of his mouth. His face was ashen. One of the countless stable great Dao laws even let out a sorrowful cry as if it had been severely injured! The great Dao had a spirit, and the spirit of the great Dao that had been destroyed was only a part of the spirit of calamity, but ... It had indeed been destroyed!How hateful!The Lord of calamity was furious. 'No, maybe I still have a chance. The spirit of the great Dao has been destroyed, but my clone is still here, and it has the power of a top-tier level eight. That Li Hao ...'He was thinking.At the same time.Li Hao frowned slightly and grunted. The clone of calamity on the other side also trembled. It felt uncomfortable, as if it had lost its previous mysteriousness and pressure.The feeling it gave off was not much different from the other level eights.Both sides were injured!Huntian, who had rushed over from a distance, was overjoyed. Li Hao had annihilated the enemy's spirit just like that?Without its spirituality, the Tribulation was nothing.It was probably around 7000 to 8000 Dao laws.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 The Lord of calamity's face turned ashen as he said coldly,""Both sides suffered heavy losses ... But I'm only a clone, and you're the main body. You used your spirit to exchange for the destruction of part of my spirit. Li Hao ... You're very stupid!"Do you think that this is all my spirituality?You're wrong!You should die!Ignoring everything else, he charged at Li Hao and struck out with his palm. At this moment, the experts around Li Hao all attacked, no longer afraid. They were all very excited!Because the calamity at this moment was strong, but the feeling it gave them ... Was only at long Zhan's level. It was no longer like before, an almost invincible existence.They dared to make a move in such a calamity!Moreover, huntian was also about to arrive. Once he arrived, it was almost certain that he would kill the clone of calamity."You fell from the peak, and even your Dao spirit was killed by the other level nine cultivators ... Is it comfortable?"Li Hao was still smiling.The Lord of calamity shouted coldly and pushed back the Thunder monarch with one palm. He sneered,""You're worse off than me. What's so funny about you, Li Hao? you idiot. You'll only ruin your future and lose all hope of controlling time ..."Do you think that you can escape this time?To destroy his own future!Stupid!Spirit was an existence that was difficult to control. It was a necessity to enter the ninth-rank!You actually chose to destroy your soul in order to deal with me.To many people, even if they died, they had to preserve their spirit ... Otherwise, a powerhouse whose future was ruined would rather die than Live!At this moment, Li Hao didn't care about any of this.Is there still a spirit?No more!But ...This was part of his plan. The spirit of a fierce tiger, no matter how much he nurtured it, it was not impossible to nurture it. However ... He thought of the human King's words. Why did the Dao spirit need to be external?

'All DAOs are mine, am I not ... A spirit?'Isn't it better to nurture the Dao than to nurture the spirit?Since he didn't need it ... Why bother raising his spirit and wasting time?In an instant, Li Hao walked into his own River of DAOs. Suddenly, blood and flesh flew everywhere, and the power of countless DAOs surged into his body, causing Li Hao's aura to skyrocket.Raise my spirit!I cultivate the divine text, the divine text is for me, I am power!"I'll take this opportunity to completely cut off the external spirit. The Tiger is actually me. The current me is still me. As long as the power is there, the spirit will be there!This was the Dao of the human King.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 Li Hao was also learning from others!"If the human King's Dao is useful, I will refer to it. If long Zhan's Dao is useful, I will also refer to it. If everyone's Dao is useful, I will refer to it ... There is no need to be limited to one Dao. There is no need to insist on an unknown Dao. Using me to nurture the spirit!In that instant, Li Hao felt as if he had returned to the time when he was the Silver Moon, when he had become the Silver Moon's will. Wasn't the will of heaven a Dao spirit?It should be considered so, right?'And I ... Maybe ...'He looked at the chaos great Dao and smiled. Chaos seemed to have lost its backbone. The spirit of the chaos great Dao seemed to have disappeared.There was, but it was also very weak.'Then ... Now that I've merged with the chaos great Dao, can I take over The Magpie's Nest and become the spirit of chaos?He did not know.However, he didn't mind trying.In an instant, he felt as if he had stepped into the great Dao of chaos. Countless amounts of chaotic energy surged towards him, instantly replenishing all the energy he had consumed.Momentum!Sword intent was born!Using one's body as a spirit, ten thousand DAOs to nurture the spirit.The chaos great Dao was all-encompassing.At this moment, Li Hao didn't care about the others at all. He was doing his own thing. A few level 8s could still hold them back for a while. Huntian had already arrived.He suddenly stopped!His expression changed slightly, and Li Hao's voice echoed,""Senior, you don't need to worry about me, just go to Tian Fang's side ...""You ..."Huntian's expression changed slightly as if he saw something. His expression changed slightly and suddenly disappeared.Li Hao really didn't seem to need his help.……At this moment, Li Hao, who was standing in the great Dao of chaos, seemed to have seen through something. He smiled.""Level nine ... Are they all in the depths of the great Dao? In the chaos great Dao and the order great Dao, are they all your places? I ... I found you!"The level nine was actually deep in the chaos great Dao. Although he had expected it, Li Hao was both happy and sad when he confirmed it.I'm happy that I know where they are hiding.The sad thing is that I want to resurrect people ... These people are my biggest obstacle. If he didn't defeat them, how could he reverse the past from the source of chaos and deprive his parents and Xiao Yuan of their source of life?Not just one or two, but all of them were tier 9!At this moment, the power of countless great DAOs surged toward Li Hao. Countless worlds were filled up, and the consumed energy was quickly restored. This was the key to maintaining the peak combat strength of a level nine.Before, Li Hao had restrained himself and wouldn't madly absorb the power of the chaos great Dao.At this moment, he had no restraint.The power of the great DAOs surged forward. Regardless of whether they were mixed or not, they were all absorbed by him.The chaos great Dao seemed to be trembling and resisting.Li Hao ... Seemed to be trying ... To merge with him!She had completely integrated into him!It was not to deprive or seize, but to integrate. He seemed to really want to become the spirit of the chaos great Dao. At this moment, the chaos great Dao seemed to tremble. Not only that, but the voice of a venerable sovereign seemed to reverberate from the depths of the great Dao. "You're courting death!"Li Hao actually wanted to seize the chaos great Dao!He had completely gone crazy and overestimated himself.At this moment, Li Hao smiled.""I'm not crazy, I'm very normal. On the contrary ... You will all die! You've blocked my path and my future. Grade-9 ... I'll see how long you can last!"Li Hao turned around and walked out of the chaos Avenue. Behind him, there seemed to be countless angry voices.Crazy!He was threatening a group of level nine venerable sovereigns. If not for the fact that the spirit of chaos was too weak to descend, they would have rushed out and killed Li Hao.He actually threatened a tier 9!And it wasn't just one or two, but ... Many!No one had ever been so arrogant. Not even the former master of order, who wanted to establish order, was so arrogant. The master of order had long been dead. Li Hao, you will follow in his footsteps!……As for Li Hao, his aura returned to its peak in an instant.5,000 Dao laws!In the next moment, countless Silver Moon martial masters were sent flying backward and absorbed into Li Hao's Dao world. Li Hao was already extremely powerful before he fused with them, and he was even more powerful now!In another instant, time suddenly shattered and ten thousand DAOs appeared.Li Hao waved his hand, and suddenly, he seemed to have appeared in a secret realm. In the heavenly Daoist Rite, Li Hao's voice was loud."Monarchs, are you willing to work together to kill a rank nine venerable sovereign?"Some of the cultivators who had participated and heard of it were suddenly excited.Ninth-rank?The last time was reincarnation, this time ... Was it a tribulation?In an instant, the tens of thousands of venerable sovereigns shouted,""We are willing, we hope Dao master can fulfill our wish!"This was a rare opportunity!If they died, they would only lose a spiritual body. If they succeeded, they would personally participate in the process of killing a level nine. It could make them crazy for the rest of their lives. Some people had missed such an opportunity last time.This time, it would not happen again!In an instant, almost none of the ten thousand venerable sovereigns resisted. Some of the venerable sovereigns who had participated before merged into a world without Li Hao's command and roared,""Fuse with the world according to your own attribute! Same attribute, can control a world together ..."

The order was unbelievably good!Such an opportunity made them go crazy. As for the revenge of a tier 9 ... Who would be afraid?Do you know who I am?Can you find me?……In an instant, Li Hao's aura soared, and his smile was bright.He instantly disappeared.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 This time, he was even more powerful and valiant than before. He already had the power of 5000 Dao laws, so he was even more powerful. This time, there were even more venerable sovereigns and experts participating.A portion of rank eight venerable sovereigns 'spiritual forms were also involved.In an instant, Li Hao's strength reached an extreme.If the Lord of calamity still had spirituality, it would be useless to merge with it. At most, it would only have 7000 to 8000 Dao laws. It would be useless against the Lord of calamity's clone. However, now ...The moment Li Hao appeared, the few stage eight experts were in a miserable state. After all, Li Hao's clone was an expert with close to 8000 Dao laws.He was still unrivaled!But now, the moment Li Hao appeared, the Lord of calamity frowned and suddenly turned around to escape.He knew that his clone might not stand a chance this time.However, keeping a clone might still be of use.With the destruction of his spirituality, he was no longer invincible in the chaos.He had had a chance of killing Li Hao and his group, but Li Hao's reappearance made him feel threatened."Escape? You're in a calamity, a ninth level venerable sovereign. Do you still want to escape? Is he such a good-for-nothing?"Li Hao's laughter echoed. The 10000 venerable sovereigns who had merged with the realm were all excited. A level nine venerable sovereign had escaped ... He was afraid!The legendary Lord of calamity had actually escaped!They didn't care whether it was a clone or not. A level 9 was a level 9, and the other party had actually been scared away by Li Hao. This ... Was simply humiliating!"You think you're worthy of blocking my path?""Trash!""Primal Chaos tribulation lightning!" With a fierce roar, the sword appeared and formed a myriad of worlds. This single sword contained boundless tribulation lightning energy, Primal Chaos tribulation lightning!"I will kill you with the Dao of tribulation! You ... Are only in the pseudo-tribulation stage!"The sword was drawn!"What?" the fleeing Lord of calamity's expression changed as he suddenly turned around and saw the primal Chaos tribulation lightning appear. He used the Dao of calamity to kill me?Bastard!"Li Hao!"The Lord of calamity roared and punched out. Countless lightning tribulations appeared and he roared,""I'm only a clone. Even if you have the upper hand ... There's no need to be so arrogant ..." I'm just a clone!And without Dao Ling's clone, what's there to be arrogant about?In the next second, the myriad tribulation descended!Sword Qi soared into the sky, chaotic force emerged, and even the chaos great Dao faintly emerged. Li Hao seemed to have turned into a spirit. With a single sword strike, the power of the great Dao controlled by the Lord of calamity's clone began to flow away!His expression instantly changed!How can this guy have better control than me? we're both beings without spirits. Logically speaking, we should be looking at proficiency now.However, he didn't have time to think about it!The sword fell!Ten thousand lightning bolts struck!Hong long long ...For the first time in his life, the Lord of tribulation experienced the pain of the chaos lightning tribulation. When the lightning tribulation struck him, the power of countless great DAOs dissipated, and his clone began to collapse. He was actually unable to resist it."Li Hao ..."The Lord of calamity still wanted to say something, but Li Hao suddenly appeared and stabbed his sword into his head. He chuckled. "Don't leave any last words. Your original body isn't dead yet. Next time, I'll kill your original body before you tell me!"The Lord of calamity's avatar shattered, and a shadow appeared with some coldness, some anger, and some unwillingness!Damn it!He actually destroyed my clone, and my return plan was destroyed by Li Hao alone. How hateful.The lightning struck again, and the shadow clone was completely destroyed.The Tribulation avatar had died to the chaos lightning tribulation.……"Pfft!"He spat out a mouthful of blood, which was mixed with a large amount of great Dao power.At this moment, the Lord of calamity's eyes were filled with killing intent. The other venerable sovereigns around him closed their eyes as if they had never woken up. He was filled with hatred, but he could do nothing about it.This time, it was not just Li Hao who had killed his clone, but also those bastards.How hateful!He looked at the master of Tian Fang from the corner of his eyes ... At this moment, he was praying that his clone had also been killed so that everyone could return to the same starting point. Otherwise, he would not be willing to accept this.If it wasn't for the fact that he was weaker than the other party, he would have wanted to interfere with the other party's true body."Li Hao ..." Gritting his teeth and growling, the Lord of calamity closed his eyes. He was furious.In your dreams!When you return, I will definitely kill you!

3626 Chapter 587
The avatar of tribulation had fallen.On Li Hao's side, he didn't care about anything else. He quickly devoured the power of calamity and turned to attack Tian Fang.At this moment, huntian was already rushing over.Whether or not they could deal with Tian Fang was the key. If they couldn't deal with Tian Fang, killing a calamity would be useless.……Tian Fang.The battle was in full swing.The strength of the master of Tian Fang was indeed not something that the catastrophe could compare with. The catastrophe could at most hold out 8000 Dao laws. Without the spirit of the great Dao, he was only at the same level as long Zhan ... Alright, he was actually not weak.However, compared to Tian Fang, he was far inferior.Tian Fang was infinitesimally close to 9000 great Dao. In addition, his great Dao spirit was still present. If he were to use a rank-8 Dao law, he might have surpassed 9000 Dao laws. In fact, if he were to use a rank-8 Dao law, he might have even reached the level of 10000 Dao laws!This kind of strength ... Was really not something that everyone could resist.He was invincible at the ninth step, and his clone was also invincible. This was only revealed in Tian Fang's place.The Tribulation ... Was one level lower.At this moment, the master of Tian Fang had single-handedly defeated the human King, Zhi Zun, Emperor Cang, light, long Zhan, Hong Yue ...This large group of grade 8s was toyed with in the palm of his hand.Space was cut, shaken, and obliterated!A large group of powerhouses was actually unable to get close!Long Zhan broke through space a few times, wanting to get close, but before he could reach, he was instantly teleported away. The human King didn't care and was extremely crazy, but it was useless. No matter how strong you were in close combat, if you couldn't get close to the other party, it was useless!Wuxing and the other venerable sovereigns were just there to watch the show.At this moment, there was only admiration.Endless worship!This was because the master of tianfang was indeed unbelievably powerful. Even though it was only a clone, this group of experts who had killed them as if they were chickens were unable to fight back at all in the hands of the tianfang clone.Even if the Tribulation fell, the master of tianfang didn't care too much.It's good that he's dead.Besides, he didn't expect the other party to resurrect, so it didn't matter if he died.He had already seen through Li Hao's methods.Spirit destruction!His methods were not bad. If his opponent had used them first, he might have suffered a small loss, but now ... It was useless.With the previous lesson in mind, even if the other party were to attempt to annihilate his soul a second time ... He wouldn't fall for the same trick as the other party. He felt some aura. A person appeared in the air. It was huntian.Tian Fang wasn't surprised. At this moment, he was still calm and chuckled,""I have no intention of opposing you. The four-sided region is tianfang territory, there is no doubt about this! Although you've killed some of tianfang world's people, I understand that you're used to being overlords and not used to migrating ... But right now, I still hope that you can consider this carefully and migrate. ""Long Zhan."He was ethereal, looking at long Zhan who kept trying to get closer, and said softly,""The chaos race's current situation is not caused by us. This is a necessity of the era and the development of chaos. "Perhaps all of you have already understood the grade nine Dao. It is impossible for chaos cultivators not to vindicate their grade nine Dao, but to make way for the chaos race? What do you think?"Natural selection!In Tian Fang's opinion, this wasn't a decision made by a single person. This was the decision of the entire system. The race of chaos was destined to decline.Long Zhan's resistance was also just ... A dying struggle.Without them, there would still be the next generation, and the generation after that. They would all advance towards the ninth rank, fuse with the Dao of chaos, and absorb the spirit of chaos ... In that case, the number of chaos beasts born in the chaos would only decrease.This was the trend of the entire chaos!Long Zhan's resistance was destined to be meaningless.At that moment, huntian stepped through the air as if he was about to get close to the sky. However, in the next moment, even someone as strong as huntian was teleported away.Huntian Supreme Emperor frowned.His combat strength was extremely powerful. These people's clones were powerful, but they couldn't crush him.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 However, Tian Fang's space Dao seemed to have disappeared without a trace. Before he could even get close, he had already been teleported away.This way, it would be very difficult to cause fatal damage to Tian Fang.He frowned.He knew that Tian Fang was not easy to deal with, but now ... Tian Fang might really be comparable to some true stage nine experts. Even if it was just an avatar, he lived up to his reputation as the number one person in the chaos.The other party didn't seem to have any intention of killing him.Of course, it could also be that his avatar was more skilled in defense than offense. Although the great space slicing technique was powerful, it was still difficult to kill the top overlords.Huntian frowned and said in a deep voice,"senior Tian Fang, why did you return ...?" If it's possible, we can do it for you. There's no need for senior to come personally! Although senior's clone is powerful, it's still just a clone ...."Tian Fang laughed,"tianfang world is our home. We are only returning. We are not invading!" Little friend huntian, and the other little friends ... At our level of cultivation, is it also so difficult for us to go home? Many years later, if you return from a long journey and someone stops you from returning to your homeland ... What will you do?"Everyone was speechless. The human King grinned,""I'll kill whoever stops me!"Logic, this was the logic.Tian Fang was right.He had only returned to his own territory, his own home. He had not done anything yet and he was already surrounded and attacked. It sounded like this group of people was being unreasonable."This is it."Tian Fang laughed again,"so, my little friends, isn't this unreasonable?" Of course, the chaos is not a place where reason is important. In this place, the strong are respected. But even if it's just an avatar, the few of you ... May not be able to do anything to me! I have no intention of competing with you. What we want is actually different ... What you want is hegemony, the path of the ninth step, but I ... I've long passed that stage. "

3627 Chapter 587
Everyone pursued different things.Why are you stopping me?"Then what is senior pursuing?" huntian asked again."It's the stability of chaos, the stability of the great Dao, The Order of Chaos, the prosperity of the world ... Can you believe me when I say this?"Tian Fang sighed."Perfecting the Dao of chaos, perfecting the rules and systems of chaos ... There's no need to treat the tier 9 as an enemy when they return. Everyone here will have this day and have such an opportunity. When that day comes, will everyone seal themselves to death?""Then what is the purpose of cultivation?""Everyone, you are not my enemies. In fact, no one is my enemy!" The chaos may have a master, but not now, not today. You will all walk the path of grade-9. When that day comes, your spirituality will be exhausted and you will be forced to go far away, no, not far away, forced to seal your self and hide in the cracks. Is this ... The result that everyone wants?""Unless you feel that you can't reach the ninth step, what enmity do we have?""I can't say much to mediocre people, but I can say a few more words to you ... Especially my young friend Li Hao."He looked at Li Hao, who was approaching from the distance, and said in a low voice,""Time is what we've been waiting for all this time. You might be worried about something, but there's no need to be like that. We've been waiting for time in hopes that the myriad DAOs will be able to gather together and have a spirit ... To rebuild chaos. We're actually supporting you in reaching the 9th rank.""Maybe some people are unwilling because they have other thoughts, or for the future ... However, it's definitely not now. At this stage, we have no grudges!"This unparalleled expert spoke with great sincerity.At this stage, there was no conflict of interest between them.However, long Zhan gave a cold cry,""Since it's only for this ... Then why did senior's clone come? why don't you continue to remain silent and wait until we reach level nine? it won't be too late then!"He was usually a man of few words, but today, he spoke more.He didn't believe a single word of Tian Fang 's!p With the arrival of huntian and Li Hao, he was more confident and even more determined."Senior, please send your clone back! Dispel the spirit of the great Dao!""AI!"The master of Tian Fang sighed.His entire person became even more illusory."I said I won't listen, I heard I won't believe, I believe I won't be willing ... It's really regretful that you little friends are so aggressive!"His words became even more hollow!In an instant!BOOM!The void shattered, and long Zhan's expression changed. He swung his Dragon Tail, but it hit nothing. In an instant, the master of tianfang appeared, covering the sky with one hand. It was as if the world was compressing. Instantly, a loud boom sounded!The dragon tail was broken!Long Zhan grunted and the human King slashed out. Huntian also appeared, but Tian Fang disappeared in an instant. In this place, he seemed to be able to appear and disappear at any time.Li Hao, who had just arrived, had a slight change in his expression. He raised his hand, waved his sword, and slashed out, but he also missed. An explosion sounded beside his ears.Li Hao roared and traveled through time.He disappeared in an instant!The place where it had been turned into a spatial cave and instantly exploded.The master of Tian Fang appeared there.He smiled."Not bad. The time travel technique is not bad. In the past, I actually met a time cultivator. We had a good chat ... But unfortunately ..."He shook his head slightly."He's very talented. To put it bluntly, he's probably even more talented than you. It's a pity ... Otherwise, he wouldn't have blocked me like you did today."He then looked at human King."New martial ... Silver Moon ... Actually, they are all from the same line. Your line is really strong, very talented, and very promising. I can understand that long Zhan is stopping me. Why do the two of you have to get involved in this muddy water? Chaos is to establish order, while your bloodline is to pursue freedom ... No one will stop you from pursuing freedom. "No one spoke.Even Li Hao didn't say anything. It had been easy for him to kill the clone of calamity, but only when he was facing Tian Fang's clone did he understand the power of a level 9.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 There were so many of them, and they were all top-notch existences.However ... At this moment, the other party's clone was playing with everyone in the palm of his hand. There was no way to get close to him to kill him. If one person got close to him alone, he would be killed. However, it was very difficult for everyone to appear together and surround him.The other party could escape into the void and disappear at any time.Li Hao didn't say anything. He instantly cast the domain of myriad worlds, trying to seal off the surroundings. However, in just a moment, one of the realms shattered, and the ethereal Plane disappeared. A spiritual body in the ethereal Plane also shattered and disappeared.Tian Fang appeared outside the boundary and smiled,""A very good Dao and a very good idea. However, they are too scattered. Can such a realm seal me?"At this moment, the human King instantly charged out from behind. However, with a slash of his saber, Tian Fang disappeared.The human King cursed in his heart!He turned around and slashed, almost hitting the huntian slash that had just arrived."I f * cking hate people like you the most. If you have the guts, stand there and don't move. Fight me one-on-one ..." The human King cursed.In a one-on-one fight, he was not the opponent's match.However, what if the other party really stopped moving after a few words of scolding?In a one-on-one fight, he couldn't win.The other party could disappear and appear in an instant. The sealing technique was useless and could not seal this top-notch existence at all. A fellow who could fight, run, and hide was the most troublesome.

The way of space!As long as there was space, he would be able to travel through it. It was not without reason that the other party was known as the number one expert back then."Stop!" Huntian Supreme Emperor also roared, and the surrounding worlds instantly appeared like barriers, trying to seal off the area and freeze the space.However, in just an instant ... One of the worlds was shattered.Tian Fang appeared once more,"it's useless!."Around them, many rank eight venerable sovereigns appeared. However, at this moment, their numbers seemed to have lost their effect. A large group of rank eight venerable sovereigns besieged them, but it was still useless.Huntian Supreme Emperor seemed to have noticed something and frowned slightly,""It seems ... It's difficult for us to kill you, but your attacking power may not be strong enough to kill us. Otherwise, you would have killed us long ago. This time, it seems that the spirit you gathered is not an attacking spirit, but a space escape spirit!"Tian Fang didn't deny it. He smiled and nodded,""After all, it's just a spirit gathered by a few rank eights. It can't be so comprehensive. The entire chaos can't support rank nine existences at the moment, so I'm only an avatar and not the main body. If it were the main body, I wouldn't be so polite."He did not deny it.In terms of offensive power, he was probably not much different from huntian. However, he had speed and agility. This group of people could not do anything to him.On the other hand, it was fine for them to stay together, but if they were to separate ... They had to be careful.p This kind of expert was also an existence that everyone was incomparably afraid of.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 Long Zhan, whose tail was almost cut off just now, had a cold look in his eyes. He glanced at Li Hao and then at the others.The tianfang clone was a huge threat to everyone.At this moment, it wasn't just for the sake of the primal Chaos race. The entire Primal Chaos did not wish for such a peerless expert to descend now. He would pose a threat to everyone, a fatal threat!This was the key to everyone's unity.However ... Tian Fang was even more difficult to deal with than he had expected. It was only a clone.Previously, he thought that he could deal with the other party, but ... If he couldn't lock onto the other party, how could he deal with the other party?Also, it was even more difficult to arouse the other party's desire on Red moon's side.That was because ... Since Li Hao had done this first, Tian Fang should have made some preparations. This gave long Zhan a bigger headache. That damned Li Hao. He had used both spiritual extermination and lust-inducing methods on the calamity.Tribulation was just a piece of trash. After killing Tian Fang, it would be easy for everyone to join forces to kill tribulation. However, you had to deal with tribulation first. Now that Tian Fang, that old fox, was prepared, it was almost impossible to kill him!And in the next instant, long Zhan suddenly roared out.The Dragon's Roar resounded through the heavens and earth!BOOM!The space exploded, and the master of tianfang smiled. He emerged from the darkness and instantly disappeared into the void. Long Zhan was furious,""Bastard!"I'm not the strongest of all the people here, huntian is.You're not the weakest, a few of you are weaker than me.Why do you keep attacking me? It wasn't the human King, Li Hao, or any other weakling, but he was targeting me?Tian Fang, who had entered the void, was still smiling.Why long Zhan?That was because ... Long Zhan might pose a fatal threat to him. Li Hao might have been able to do so before, but it was difficult now. As for long Zhan ... He suspected that he had some connection with the spirit of chaos. Thus, such an existence was very dangerous.There might even be a situation where one's Dao would be squeezed out of the chaos Dao and lose its spirituality.He was very clear about this!Therefore, the few times, it was all targeted at long Zhan and not at the others. The target was extremely clear.It's you!The others were also deep in thought. Clearly, the other party was targeting long Zhan, and there was a high probability that long Zhan had a sure-kill technique. In fact, Li Hao and the human King both knew this. Otherwise, long Zhan would not have been so confident before.But now ... There was obviously a mistake.Li Hao sensed for a while and saw red Moon Emperor's sullen look not far away ... He had some thoughts, probably ... Because of desire?Perhaps it was!I used it in advance, so Tian Fang was prepared. Long Zhan's plan was actually destroyed by me?However, counting on the Crimson Moon?Li Hao laughed inwardly. It was difficult ... Hong Yue's grasp of the Dao of desire was only superficial. Not to mention Tian Fang, even the Lord of calamity would find it difficult to trigger his desire. It was not that he looked down on Hong Yue, but that was the truth.Long Zhan might as well think about how to kill Tian Fang than count on Hong Yue.The few of them were very vigilant.At this moment, they were also gradually gathering. The human King was a little impatient. He hated this kind of people ... Of course, if he was the same as them, able to escape and kill, he would be very happy. But if his enemies were like this, he hated them!Double standards were the common trait of the strong.He couldn't help but roar,"who can fix him in place?" I'll definitely kill him with three blades!""Aren't you the strongest in the chaos?"he looked at huntian. Couldn't he even stabilize his clone? Are you that weak?"“……”Huntian was speechless.However, she thought of something and smiled. She said softly,""It's not impossible ..."But long Zhan snorted coldly,"don't even think about it!"Huntian sighed."You heard it. I can do it. After all, it's just a clone. As long as you give me the square domain, I'll use my will to set up the order and seal the space so that he can't hide!" Tian Fang Qian bei probably doesn't dare to come to my chaos heaven domain, I can lock him down ... Why don't you all come with me to my chaos heaven domain as guests, he won't dare to go. "In the void, Tian Fang also laughed."I don't mind. If you all want to leave, I won't stop you. It's not bad to go to little friend huntian's place to play. I also have no intention of fighting with you all. After all ... You all are still very young."

p The human King was speechless.Huntian domain?To be someone's underling?Come on!No wonder long Zhan was unhappy when he heard it. Clearly, if he went there, he would probably really be screwed.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 A group of level eight experts and chaos experts, with the exception of a few, were almost all here. However, they could not do anything to an avatar. The human King was a little annoyed and snorted coldly. "It's a pity ...""It's a pity that my inner world isn't at that level yet. Otherwise, once my inner world appears, it will seal off all directions. You won't be able to break through it. You'll only be trapped by me and killed!Not now, Tian Fang was too strong.Even if the inner world appeared, it could still be easily broken by the other party.It was impossible to resist!Not far away, the master of tianfang reappeared, still relaxed.""Little friends ... How about we end this here today?"It was not easy for him to take them down when they worked together.However, as long as they were separated ...The chaos is vast, but I'm everywhere.I'm not a calamity.They were easily killed.You want to compete with me in tribulation?Long Zhan was extremely aggrieved!If he didn't kill him today and he didn't leave, then the first one to die would be him.He had a trump card that could kill Duan Ling Tian, but it was unable to lock onto him completely. This was his biggest problem.At this moment, Li Hao sent a voice transmission to him, Daoist long Zhan, can you kill him? A hundred percent chance of killing it?"Long Zhan's eyes flickered, and not far away, the Lord of tianfang's eyes also moved slightly.He seemed to have sensed something.In an instant, he appeared next to Li Hao. With a palm strike, space instantly exploded, and Li Hao disappeared. He chuckled."Senior is powerful, but your speed of time, space, and escape are almost on par with mine. It'll probably be difficult for you to kill me ...""Li Hao, why do you have to do this?"Tian Fang disappeared again."I've said it before. You and I are not enemies.""No, yes. Not in the past, and still now.""I want to resurrect people," Li Hao replied."Unless ... You guys move aside and enter the origin of chaos!"Tian Fang was speechless!"Resurrecting people doesn't need to be so difficult. As long as the daosource is there, you can resurrect them at any time ...."Do you understand?"I know, but it's a pity that I'm only resurrecting ordinary people with no Dao origin ...""Ordinary people also have daosource, as long as they have cultivated it." "I've never cultivated it before!"“……”The surroundings were completely silent. Not only Tian Fang, but the others were also stunned.艹!You want to revive a few people who have never cultivated before?In their eyes, ordinary people who were not even venerable sovereigns were considered ordinary people. So, you ... Are even more outrageous. You are a complete ordinary person?In some large worlds, such a person did not even exist.Because ... They were born with some Dao attainment.Only small worlds had ordinary people. The point was, if these people died, then so be it. Who would revive them?He still had to explore the primordial chaos origins!This ...At this moment, Tian Fang was speechless.Even if he was extremely powerful, to resurrect such an ordinary person, perhaps he could only use the origin of chaos to filter and strip it bit by bit, then resurrect ...As a top-notch existence, who would put in so much effort for ordinary people?Moreover, he had offended a group of grade-9 experts.This ...Tian Fang had nothing to say. If Li Hao offended everyone for this, he would have nothing to say. Obviously, Li Hao felt that resurrecting a few ordinary people was worth offending a group of level 9s.There was no need to say anything about such a person.Li Hao clearly wanted to conspire something with long Zhan.Tian Fang's eyes flickered and he disappeared once again. At this moment, he disappeared before everyone's eyes. In an instant, a loud explosion suddenly came from behind!Some of the cultivators who were rushing over suddenly vomited blood!The Thunder monarch's body split open, and Tian Fang's voice reverberated,""I originally didn't want to deal with juniors like this ... Li Hao, take your people and leave. I won't do anything to you, but if you insist ... Perhaps ... Today, I'll start a massacre!"He didn't kill the Thunder monarch. He only gave him a warning!I may not be able to kill you all in an instant, but I can kill these people in an instant.Li Hao, since you're willing to become enemies with a ninth-rank magical beast to save ordinary people, what about now?He seemed to have figured out Li Hao's weakness in one sentence, which also applied to human Kings. He smiled and said,""Fang ping, you too! Whether it's neo martial or Silver Moon, they might not be my enemies ... I actually understand you guys a little. You guys value friendship a lot. Since that's the case, why make me your enemy for the four-sided domain? This place is no longer your territory, but long Zhan's ..."However, the human King merely laughed, his face nonchalant.""You can just kill him! If I kill them, I won't be able to resurrect them today, but I'll resurrect them some other day. Unless you destroy the origin of chaos, otherwise...I'll be able to resurrect them sooner or later! Using this to threaten us? Tian Fang, have you gone senile?"Tian Fang laughed,'maybe ... You don't care, but Can Li Hao? Could he really be resurrected? After being resurrected, would he still be the original person? Long Zhan is just an outsider ..."Long Zhan's expression was very ugly at this moment.In order to disperse this Alliance, Tian Fang had gone to all lengths. He was much more difficult to deal with than expected. He had actually used others to threaten Li Hao and the human King.If this continued ... This fragile alliance might really collapse.And all of this ... In the past, it was actually the means they used. For example, Li Hao had once used the square domain to threaten long Zhan, and the human Kings had used this method many times. Now that it was used by the enemy, they all felt very aggrieved.
