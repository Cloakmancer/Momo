        ng's expression changed slightly."This ... There's no need, right?"
         What did Li Hao mean?
         "Then forget it, it's fine."
         Li Hao laughed."I'll go find Huang Long and get him to stamp it. It'll be considered that the night patrolman has agreed to execute them!" "That's it. Have a good rest tonight. Tomorrow, we'll go there together. Those to be executed will walk in front, and those not to be executed will walk behind ..."
         "Governor li, didn't you say that you would let the others go?" someone asked warily.
         There might be a big battle tomorrow. Who would want to go?
         As for the names on the namelist ... They were just unlucky!
         It was hard to say if they could care about it, but someone would definitely be unlucky and be involved in the aftermath.
         The others did not want to go.
         Li Hao chuckled."It's fine. I'll have the Wei Wu Army detain you. If your people are here, so are my people. Even if someone really wants to deal with me ... I won't involve you. I'm a man of my word!"
          When they heard that it was the Wei Wu Army, everyone heaved a sigh of relief. This ... Seemed to be fine.
         And Li Hao indeed had no intention of involving them.
         There was no other reason ... If they were killed by the aftermath, they would be letting them down!
         ……
         He ignored these people.
         Li Hao went straight to Huang Long's office.
         At this moment, the lights were brilliant.
         When Li Hao reached the ground floor of the office building, the expressions of the few night patrols on duty changed one after another. Someone's voice became much sharper."Greetings, Governor li!"
         Upstairs, the window was opened.
         Huang Long's expression was unsightly as he looked down at Li Hao. Li Hao laughed and took out a thick document."Stamp this. The night patrolmen have agreed to execute these people. The evidence is conclusive!"
         "Don't you go too far!"Huang Long said coldly.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He actually wanted me to stamp it?
         Li Hao grinned,"are you going to cover it?" Huang, if you stamp it, it's my business tomorrow. If you don't stamp it, it's our business now!"
         Huang Long's eyes were cold and sharp.
         This was a threat!
         Li Hao's threat was so outrageous that it made one's hair stand on end!
         He had insulted and humiliated him again and again at the Nightwalker headquarters.
         After this incident, even if Li Hao died, he would probably be ridiculed in secret.
         But ... He still agreed, his tone cold.""Hand it over!"
         The documents flew out!
         In the next moment, Huang Long took out his seal and stamped it. A faint divine power fluctuation overflowed. This was a special seal that could not be replicated. It represented authority.
         p The document flew into Li Hao's hand, and a faint fluctuation spread out. Li Hao easily crushed it. He raised his head to look at Huang Long and laughed,""Childish!"  “……”
         Huang Long's expression changed.
         Li Hao walked away without looking back.""Tomorrow, the higher-ups of the night patrolmen will be participating with me. This is an important matter for the night patrolmen to establish their authority. Huang Long, you have to go too. Watch how I cut them down!"
         "I don't need you to say that!"
         "Of course I'll go!" Huang Long sneered.
         Of course I'm going!
         If I don't go, how am I going to watch you die?
         If Li Hao didn't die, would he, Huang Long, still be qualified to be a night patroller?
         Li Hao didn't reply and just left.
         In front of him, three people were blocking the road.
         The saber-wielding man looked at Li Hao with a complicated expression.""Governor li, killing a few people won't change anything ..."
         Li Hao looked at him coldly and said,"if I don't kill him, I can't change anything!" You think this way, he thinks this way, so the world will always be so dark! You Sharkmen will never understand what a Martial Master is!"
         "Because ... You're not! Martial masters cultivated their hearts, while superpowers cultivated their strength! Be it a Martial Master or a superpower, it's not just a difference in strength, it's also a difference in the heart. Superpowers don't have any heart, so don't even think about climbing to the peak!"
         "Go away!" Li Hao shouted.
         The three of them silently gave in.
         After Li Hao left, the three of them fell silent.
         Martial masters cultivated their hearts, while superpowers cultivated their strength.
         Li Hao also said that the difference between supers and martial masters was not the difference in strength, but the difference in heart.
         In fact, they wanted to persuade him that they had no ill intentions. They truly had good intentions. Thinking of what Li Hao had done ... They admired him from the bottom of their hearts, but they also knew that it was a road of no return.
         He knew that he couldn't persuade her, but this was just an attempt.
         However, Li Hao rejected their kindness and even taught them a lesson.
          The three of them were clearly older than Li Hao, but at this moment, they only felt ashamed.
         The man with the gun looked at Li Hao's back. After a long time, he said softly,""When the spear is straight, it's better to take it from a straight path than to seek it from a tune ..."
         "Old gun, you ..."
         The man didn't say anything. He just looked at Li Hao and fell into deep thought.
         Nine out of ten spear cultivators were upright. Most of them were honest and upright. Without a sense of righteousness, it was difficult to master the spear.
         Old gun seemed to be thinking about something. He turned and left.
         The big-eyed man and the saber-wielding man hurriedly followed. At this moment, they had a bad feeling in their hearts. The big-eyed man gritted his teeth and said in a low voice,""No, old spear, this is suicide! At this stage, divine arts are unrivaled existences ... He's crazy, don't be like this, if there's only one divine Art, there's still hope ... If there's two, he'll die without a doubt, if there's three ... He'll die without a burial place!"
         As long as the three of them came, hou Xiaochen would be killed without a doubt.
         On Li Hao's side, Nan Quan, hou Xiaochen, yang Shan, Yu Luosha, Jin Jin, Qin Lian, and hei Bao were all within everyone's calculations. Nan Quan and hou Xiaochen were the strongest, but they were no match for god art.
         A sacred art might be able to deal with these two.
        
         Li Hao, black leopard, and yang Shan were second. One divine power was enough.
         No matter how many people there were, they were no match for a divine-tier.
         Therefore, Li Hao and the others were doomed to die when the three of them showed up.
         Given the methods of the various large organizations and departments, they would definitely not be careless when killing Li Hao tomorrow. At this point, anyone who was careless would be a fool.
         Perhaps even more!
         The big-eyed man was a little nervous and uneasy as he transmitted his voice,""Everyone wants to kill him. Other than the inspector's attitude, the eight divisions want to kill him. Even the royal family wants to kill him. The three major organizations and the seven sacred mountains, besides sky sword Mountain ... SuperPower City will also be involved! We'll also consider if silver Moon Martial Master comes to help, such as Northern fist, BA Dao, Yuan Shuo, and the others who are closer. Silver Moon is too far away, but those who are closer might be able to make it ... And sky sword ..."
         The big-eyed man quickly analyzed the situation for the man with the gun."Considering all these factors, when we deal with Li Hao tomorrow, there might be ... More than three people with magical powers. There might be five, six, or even more!"
         "Old gun, don't go to your death. Don't go crazy with him, okay?" she said nervously.
         The spear-wielding man's previously boiling heart gradually died down.
         After a long time, he sighed and no longer spoke.
          The big-eyed man heaved a sigh of relief.
         She did not even dare to imagine what kind of preparations the various families would make to deal with Silver Moon and his men tomorrow. Would there be any senior secretaries who would personally kill Li Hao?
         If there were, then 99% of these people had consolidated their realms. After all, it was not a lie that the nine divisions were rich.
         In terms of heritage, the three major organizations might not even be comparable to the nine divisions.
         After all, the nine divisions had been established for 80 years, while the ruins had been around for tens of thousands of years.
         Just because there were no superpowers in the past, it did not mean that there were no relics. Many people were confused about all this. The revival of superpowers, the relics ... Were also revived.
         ……
         No one could sleep that night.
         The entire stellarsky city seemed to be in a sleepless night.
         On the other side of the Stardust sea, Huang Yu gasped for breath. He had arrived.
         He had finally arrived!
         Even he, who had run for tens of thousands of miles, was a little overwhelmed and had become a little thin.
         "I'm coming!"
         Huang Yu looked at the sky Star sea and laughed. How could Silver Moon not participate in such a big event?
         I'm here!
         ……
         Less than a hundred miles away from Huang Yu.
         Yuan Shuo carried his aquamarine light sword and looked towards the starry sky Sea, then towards the nightless city. His smile was gone, replaced by killing intent.
         "This disciple of mine ... His ability to cause trouble is number one in the world!"
         "But ... I like it!"
         Yuan Shuo burst into laughter,""If he doesn't leave tomorrow, I'll help him kill all his enemies!"
         Lofty aspirations!
         However, the Jade light sword was extremely solemn.""Don't talk big. Once the divine power is here ... How can you, a half-assed God Realm cultivator, match it?"
         Yuan Shuo gritted his teeth,"don't worry, I'm prepared!" Don't underestimate me, I'll become stronger when I meet stronger opponents!"
         "Bi Guang, how is my disciple?" he laughed.
         Jade light sword was silent for a moment before slowly opening his mouth,"Heroes! Heroes!"
         The people of the martial world admired such a hero. In her eyes, Li Hao was not a night patrolman, but a hero. A hero like him deserved to be called a hero!
         If the list of thirty-six heroes was rearranged, Li Hao would definitely be in the top three!
         "Hahaha!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Yuan Shuo laughed out loud!
         This was the greatest praise for him. My disciple is famous on the hero list. My disciple is the Seven Swords. In this world, who dares to say that my disciple is not on the hero list?
         "Two heroes of a sect! The first of the five birds!"
         Yuan Shuo laughed heartily."I'm coming!"
         Jadesword didn't say anything. "I'm still so weak, but I'm ... Here I am."
         Yuan Shuo told her not to come, but Wu Hongjun was thinking ... Perhaps, this is the first and last time I've seen Li Hao, the demonic sword, and the eighth swordsman of Silver Moon.
         How can I be at ease if I don't come and take a look?
         That was why she had come.
         Swordsman, Silvermoon swordsman, even if he were to die, he should at least have a more impressive appearance than others!
          Walking on the water, the group of heroes arrived.  At this moment, on the surface of the sea, not only them, but also experts from all directions were either soaring into the sky or walking on the sea, heading towards heavenstar!
         The world's martial masters produced the Silver Moon!
         If I, the Silver Moon Martial Master, want to change the heavens, I'll send you on your way and fight you!
         ……
         At this moment, the stellarsky city was in an uproar.
         At this moment, the area outside the north gate was completely silent.
         The sky gradually brightened.
         It seemed like many people were not sleeping and were waiting.
         It was dawn.
         The people who got up early were no longer as noisy as before. They walked around silently and busied themselves, occasionally looking towards the North.
         At this moment, a huge screen suddenly rose up in all parts of the city.
         Someone took a look ... It was the north gate.
         ……
         In the nine Dragons Pavilion.
         The female manager looked to the North and also looked at the huge screen in the nine Dragons Pavilion. At this moment, many members of the nine divisions, the royal family, and the royal family were all watching. The hall was in an uproar.
         "I must kill him. I must kill him quickly and fiercely!"
         Someone gritted his teeth and growled in a low voice.
         Li Hao, you deserve to die!
         It was obvious that someone from his family was on the list, and Li Hao had taken the list of 300 people.
         The female manager looked at those people silently.
         Is it worth it to be so happy that you killed Li Hao?
         Didn't those on the list all deserve to die?
         Which one of those people dared to say they were innocent?
         He laughed at himself and no longer thought about it. However ... His heart was surging with excitement as he silently chanted in his heart,'kill them!'
         Li Hao, kill them!
         Let the people of heavenstar know that it didn't matter who committed a crime!
         ……
         On this day, everyone's attention was focused on the night patrolmen's headquarters, on North City.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, was wearing armor and holding a long sword.
         At this moment, he also began to move.
         More than a thousand Wei Wu Army soldiers escorted more than two thousand aristocrats. Li Hao didn't bring the remaining one thousand or so people. They were just some service staff on the island and the Douluo arena. It was useless to bring them.
         The team of more than 3000 people did not take a car and walked out of the Nightwalker's headquarters.
         He walked onto Jiusi Street.
         "The Heavenly Star governor's office is enforcing the law. Idlers, step back!"
         With a loud roar, Mu Lin held a large shield and led the Army forward. His roar resounded in all directions!
         Thousands of people stepped onto the main road and headed towards the north of the city.
         The nobles covered their faces and looked extremely embarrassed, wishing they could eat Li Hao.
          Li Hao ... Actually paraded them on the streets!
         Damn it!
         ……
         "Damn it!"
         "He should be killed!"
         "Bastard!"
         At this moment, angry roars came from different places. Li Hao had gone crazy. He was parading the streets with thousands of nobles. Bastard! If it weren't for the arrangements, they would have killed him right now!
         ……
         On the long Street, a long line of people quickly headed toward the north of the city.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, was very relaxed. He laughed and rode on the Black Panther. On this day, the entire stellarsky city saw Governor li riding on a big dog. Demonic sword Li Hao was a barbarian from the North.
        
         At the north gate.
         At this moment, there was no one around.
         In the city, a long line of people was moving towards them.
         On the block.
         The residents on both sides of the street didn't dare to show their faces. They just hid behind the windows or the streets and watched in secret.
         They looked down on such a lively scene and did not dare to watch.
         However, everyone was concerned.
         ……
         After an hour or so, some of the nobles had already gone limp, and the north gate was already visible.
         Some of the nobles heaved a sigh of relief.
          They continued walking until they were almost limp, but they finally arrived.
         Everyone looked at the man in front of them.
         Do you know?
         You know it!
         You'll die soon, why are you so stubborn?
         Up ahead, Li Hao was still calm as he looked around. There were so many superpowers and experts today.
         However, the other party seemed to know that he could see something. This time, there were no balls of light near the north gate.
         Judging from Li Hao's previous battles, it was normal for the outside world to think that he was a heavenly eye cultivator.
         Behind Li Hao, a fleet of cars slowly followed.
         It was the team of night patrollers.
         Of course, they weren't interested in walking, so they all drove their cars. However, they didn't overtake Li Hao's group and just followed them.
         In the car.
         Huang Long's eyes were cold as he looked ahead, not saying a word.
         Behind them, Deputy Minister Zhou's expression was also unsightly. He kept staring in Li Hao's direction.
         Of the 11 department heads and Deputy department heads, other than Yao si, all of them had come, including hou Xiaochen. However, hou Xiaochen was at the back, resting with his eyes closed. However, he was also the target of everyone's vigilance.
         ……
         In the Imperial Palace.
         Nan Quan was wearing armor and holding a big hammer as he walked out.
         A young man in a yellow robe said sincerely,""Master he, please stay!"
         Nan Quan looked at the man. On this day, he seemed particularly calm.""I am a Silver Moon Martial Master!"
         That was the only reason.
         Today, I didn't have many thoughts because I'm a Silver Moon Martial Master.
         Therefore, he would go.
         "Master he ..."
         The man sighed."I know it's hard to persuade him. However, it's not wise to do it even though I know it's impossible!" If master he is willing to stay ... After I reorganize the rivers and mountains, I will help master he take revenge for Governor li. "
         "I'm from the pugilistic world!"
         He Yong laughed and stepped into the air. He looked down at Jiusi and sneered,""I'll wait for you to kill me!"
         As soon as he finished speaking, he broke through the air and left!
          From all directions, some people looked up while others sneered.  The southern Fist ... Had really appeared.
         The Silver Moon barbarians were still the same after all these years.
         With the ninth Prince's protection, it would be hard to kill him.
         However, Nan Quan still chose to come out at this time, which was not too unexpected. He just felt that the Silver Moon Martial Master was unreasonable.
         ……
         The Wei Wu Army slowly stopped.
         They had arrived at the north gate.
         At this moment, there was no one near the city gate, but there was a large square outside the city gate. It was a wide expanse of flat land that led directly to the Heavenly Star Coast.
         Li Hao jumped off the black Panther.
         "Take the criminal to the execution ground!" He ordered.
         "Yes, sir!"
         With a low shout, Mu Lin quickly waved his hand. The Wei Wu Army quickly grabbed three hundred people from the front of the crowd. Some of them were three suns experts, and their expressions were ugly. Some sneered, and some were afraid.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com There were also people who shook their bodies, not allowing the Wei Wu Army to get close to them.
         Bang! Bang!
         A short-tempered Wei Wu Army soldier directly punched out, causing the other party to spit out blood. In the end, they were dragged away.
         In the huge square in front of them, nobles were quickly dragged up.
         Li Hao strode forward and stepped on the air. In the blink of an eye, he reached the city wall, which wasn't very high. He turned around and chuckled."The night patrolman's execution. Everyone, if there's anyone who wants to see it, come and gather!"
         As soon as he finished speaking, a sound of air breaking came from the distance. The person who came laughed,""Let's see. Let's see who can do anything to me after I chop off a few hundred dog heads."
         With that, Nanquan landed on the ground.
         He was wearing a copper armor and holding a sledgehammer. His beard was covered in frost and his eyes were filled with ferocity.
         Li Hao smiled, but didn't say anything.
         The southern style has come ... Is this unexpected?
         It wasn't too surprising.
         However, this speculator might not have chosen to come here at this moment to speculate. Sometimes, the human heart was very complicated.
         He did not say anything.
         After a while, the convoy stopped.
         Huang Long's group looked indifferent. Without saying anything, they rose into the air and flew toward the city wall.
          Since Li Hao had invited them to watch the execution, they could do as he wished.
         Of course, they landed some distance away from Li Hao. They did not land directly on Li Hao's side. About a hundred meters away, the higher-ups of the night patrollers landed one after another.
         Other than Yao si, the ten deputy ministers were all present.
         The three military governors were also there, as well as more than ten experts at the sunrise realm, including big eye and the others. There were quite a number of experts at the night patrol. At this moment alone, there were close to 30 sunrise experts gathered here.
         They all had different thoughts. Some were silent, some seemed to be expecting something, and some were looking at Li Hao without saying a word.
         The night patrolman was born from the grass.
         Among them, there were quite a few who rose up from the commoner class, or perhaps they occupied the majority. However, after 20 years, some people had already forgotten about them, while some still remembered them. However, they could only choose to submit to reality like Yao si.
         Li Hao looked around and didn't see Yao si, so he didn't care too much.
         He ignored these people and looked down at the square. The nobles on the list all straightened their necks and looked up. Some were full of resentment, some were full of resentment.
         "Kneel down, criminal!" Li Hao said calmly.
        
         No one cared.
         The next moment, the Wei Wu Army attacked. Cracking sounds could be heard. Some of the Wei Wu Army were extremely ruthless. With a crack, they broke the legs of some aristocrats. With a crack, some people knelt on the ground and screamed.
         "Li Hao!"
         "We are nobles!" Someone roared."Even if we die, we still have dignity!"
         Li Hao said indifferently,"criminals don't care about their status. You're all criminals who have committed capital crimes. You're all unpardonable villains!" Since ancient times, a Prince had committed the same crime as a commoner! There are still laws in the dynasty. Unless heavenstar completely collapses, otherwise ... You will be sentenced to death!"
         Looking at the time, Li Hao took out a file.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com As soon as this was done, some people's expressions changed slightly.
         In the next moment, someone broke through the air and arrived. This person was very powerful and quickly landed on the ground. He had a smile on his face."Governor Li, I'm Qi Zhao, the head of the Criminal Division's judicial office. According to the law, the crimes these people have committed need to be approved by the criminal Division. Is the governor holding their judgment?"
         "If so, please allow me to take a look!"
         He looked at Li Hao with a smile.
          Aren't you going to give a speech?
         Then give it to me!
         If you don't follow the law, everything you do today will be illegal.
         Then you, Li Hao, are nothing more than a person who abuses your power.
         You've denied the correctness of Li Hao's execution. You're wrong.
         Sometimes, the nobles would do things flawlessly, be it on the surface or behind the scenes. They wouldn't directly attack Li Hao, because even if they did, they wouldn't be able to recover their reputation and losses.
         He was the president of the judicial office and the president of the judicial Court.
         These two positions were the most powerful people in the criminal Division below the Deputy Director. This person was also a powerhouse at the rising light transformation stage, and was even stronger than some Deputy Directors.
         He was a person with real power.
         Li Hao looked at him, then at the document in his hand. He smiled and said,""Principal Qi wants to investigate?"
         "Right!"
         Qi Zhao nodded."This is the process and the law. If there's something wrong, we won't let a bad person off, but we can't wrong a good person either. Governor li is biased against nobles. It's not in line with the law to execute someone without even checking carefully ..."
         Li Hao smiled and looked at him. After a long while, he said,""Principal Qi, you're wrong!"
         "What?"
         Qi Zhao looked at him. Was I wrong?
         What was wrong?
         " 20 years ago, the nine divisions announced a new law!"
         Li Hao said calmly,"the new law states that transcendents and mortals are ruled separately. The night patrolmen represent transcendents. Any crime committed by a transcendent will be fully held responsible by the night patrolmen!" Your Criminal Law Division only manages ordinary people. The night patrol is the organization that manages the extraordinary!"
         "So ... Are there any non-transcendents here?"
         "They're not the only ones who are under the jurisdiction of my Nightwalker. Even principal Qi is under my jurisdiction!"Li Hao revealed a smile.  Li Hao's eyes gradually turned cold,"principal Qi, do you understand?" Also, as a higher-up of the criminal law Division, don't you even know the basic laws?"
         Qi Zhao frowned slightly."There were such regulations issued 20 years ago. However, at that time, superpowers had just appeared and the laws were not perfect. The night patrollers were only temporarily in charge of managing the superpowers. Now that 20 years have passed, times are changing, and the laws have been reformed ... A few days ago, the criminal Division has submitted a new proposal. From now on, it will no longer be the night patrolmen's sole jurisdiction over transcendents ..."
         "Have the nine divisions and the royal family passed?"
         Li Hao looked at him."If it's passed," he said."What about the documents stamped with the seals of the nine divisions and the Emperor?"
         "Naturally, there is!"
         The other party took out a document. Li Hao's eyes narrowed and he reached out to grab it. A moment later, he said indifferently,""The Inspector General, the Financial Secretary and the royal family have not stamped their seals."
         "Half of them will agree!"
         Qi Zhao was not flustered. He had come up, naturally prepared.
         The Financial Secretary closed the door and did not care.
         The Inspector General had disappeared. It was said that he had gone into seclusion.
         The royal family had always had this attitude. They didn't want to seal the things that were issued by the royal family. They just wanted to delay it ...
         However, the seal of the 7th Division was enough. More than half of them were here.
         Li Hao nodded slightly and smiled."Alright, I understand. But it's useless to me."
         "Governor li doesn't speak of the law now?"
         Qi Zhao laughed.
         Li Hao shook his head."No, it's just that this document is not in compliance with the regulations! As the person involved, the night patrolman knew nothing ..."
         "I know!"
         "Yes!" Huang Long walked over and said,"I know about this and I agree!"
         "Who Do You Think You Are?"
          Li Hao looked at him and laughed,"you're just a Deputy Minister. Do you really think you're a Big Shot?" Did Minister Yao agree to it?"
         Huang Long looked at him coldly."Minister Yao is not feeling well. I'm in charge of this now. What's wrong with that?"
         "Do you have the official seal of the Minister?"
         "Li Hao, it's useless to pester endlessly!" Huang Long frowned and said indifferently.
         Li Hao laughed,"I'm talking to you, but you're talking nonsense." I'll talk to you about martial arts, and you'll talk to me about law. Don't the people in the world know who's the one who's pestering you? You're not the Minister, and you don't have the Minister's seal. You're just a Deputy Minister. What right do you have to make decisions on behalf of the night patrol?"
         Too lazy to pay any more attention to him, Li Hao looked up into the sky. There seemed to be an extraordinary item recording everything and uploading it to all the screens in the city.
         Li Hao smiled,'changing the law at the last minute won't work! It was not in line with the process and the rules! Or did the seventh Minister think that this world and this dynasty no longer needed laws? If that's the case, please disband the criminal law Division!"
         Silence.
         Qi Zhao frowned slightly and looked at Huang Long.
         This guy seemed to have never been able to get Yao SI's stamped document. Such a small matter, this guy actually couldn't complete it.
        
         As for Huang Long, he cursed in his heart.
         Recently, Yao si didn't care about anything and didn't participate. When they went to find him, he also avoided them, saying that he wouldn't participate in these things. Where would they find Yao si to stamp!
         Li Hao, on the other hand, smiled."Therefore, the law is still the same as before! I'm going to read out their crimes and give everyone an explanation. I'll also give them a reason to die in peace. These people, ask the world, should they be killed?"
         The two of them wanted to say something more, but Li Hao's eyes suddenly turned cold. An overbearing aura gushed out, making the two of them feel uncomfortable and shocked. This Li Hao ... They were both powerhouses in the transformation stage.
         "Wu Yu ..." He said.
         Li Hao began to read.
         ……
         At this moment, everyone in the city was listening.
         At this moment.
         In the distance, on top of a tall building, many powerhouses stood. Some looked around, some listened quietly, and some frowned and said indifferently,""I can't let him Continue reading. If he continues ... The blow will be too great!"
          In the crowd, an old man coughed and said with a smile,""No, give him time, read it to him! As far as I know, some of the Silvermoon barbarians will be on their way here soon ... With Li Hao dead, these people will run away, and you'll be in trouble. As for what was read out, Li Hao's death was all fabricated by Li Hao. It's no big deal!"
         It was rare for them to join hands and attack together. Everyone had their own thoughts and thoughts.
         Wait!
         When the Silver Moon martial masters come, we'll capture them all!
         Otherwise, even if they attacked now, it would not be the right time. For example, bei Quan, BA Dao, and the others were nowhere to be seen. They knew about Yuan Shuo's arrival, and not only Yuan Shuo, but also Huang Yu's arrival.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, it was still not enough.
         Had the Earthcover sword and radiant sword arrived?
         Where's the heavenly Sword?
         Even if the others didn't come, Tian Jian wasn't too far away, so it was still possible for him to come.
         "That will cause quite a stir ..."
         Someone said in a low voice. At this moment, Li Hao was reading the crimes of these people. He was very loud, and the entire city was listening because of the projection equipment.
         Someone else laughed,"so what?" Even if it's true ... In the end, they're not guilty. From now on, these people will no longer dare to resist!"
         In the end, he still wanted to kill Li Hao.
         As long as he killed these people, all the rebels would not appear again.
         Someone else frowned and said,"have these juniors committed so many crimes over the years?" This old man knows a few of them, and they're usually quite well-behaved, so how could they commit such a crime?"
         After all, there were also martial masters of the older generation who had transformed their powers. He had been in seclusion all this while, and he felt a little uncomfortable when he heard this.
         "They did go a little too far ... They should be punished after this. Execute a few in private to intimidate the others."
         Some people nodded, but they still didn't agree with Li Hao's public execution.
         If Li Hao really wanted to kill him in private, they did not want to start a war with Silver Moon.
         Being in public and being in private were two different concepts.
         These people might not agree with the nobles or think that there was nothing wrong with them. However, even if the nobles and commoners committed crimes, they should not be treated the same way and be punished the same way. A public execution would be a challenge to the nine divisions and the Imperial power.
          The experts who were previously dissatisfied didn't say anything.  ……
         And Li Hao read it very quickly.
         In the city, there was a slight commotion. Some people were crying in low voices. They were victims, living victims.
         Some people were filled with righteous indignation, but they were helpless.
         There were also people who silently prayed ... That these people must be killed. Previously, some people only thought that they were killing aristocrats. They only felt happy, but they didn't know why they felt happy.
         However, at this moment, they were all gritting their teeth!
         A bunch of bastards!
         They should all be killed!
         All of you should die!
         There was still someone who wanted to protect these bastards?
         ……
         On the city wall.
         Li Hao read for a long time, but there was no sound. Huang Long, Qi Zhao, and the others also frowned and didn't speak. The fact that the hidden experts hadn't made a move meant that they felt that it wasn't the right time yet.
         However, when the few of them heard this, they didn't feel too good. At this moment, they felt as if thousands of eyes were focused on them, wanting to cut them into a thousand pieces.
         It took Li Hao almost an hour to finish reading the information of the 300 people.
         Li Hao said in a clear voice,'and this is only the tip of the iceberg! The time was too short to find out all the facts, and these are only 300 people randomly selected from the 2642 nobles!"
         "I'm afraid that no less than 90% of the remaining people are guilty!"
         "Today is only the first batch," Li Hao said indifferently."There will be a second, a third ..."
         "These people are tyrants, ignore the law, and kill people like flies. According to the law, all of you shall be beheaded!"
         "The Heavenly Star governor's office's verdict is as follows ... All of them will be beheaded in public!"
          "Men, prepare for the execution!"
         With a single order, the 300 Wei Wu Army soldiers all walked out with their blades.
         "Li Hao!"
         Huang Long shouted in a low voice,"the execution is at Teno' clock, you said it yourself ... It's only nineo' clock now!"
         There were still people who had not arrived!
         He, Qi Zhao, and the others were in charge of the safety of the nobles present.
         Li Hao glanced at him and smiled. He suddenly thought of something and said,""I forgot, there's still a decree that hasn't been announced!"
         Huang Long was startled. There was another portion?
         Li Hao took out another document.
         "Huang Long, First Deputy Minister of the night patrollers, Deputy Secretary of the inspection department, governor of the North ... You killed the innocent, wantonly threw city-destroying bombs, caused millions of civilians to lose their homes, and millions of people to die miserably. You provided shelter for all parties. If you knowingly break the law, your crime will be doubled!"
        
         Li Hao sighed,"Huang Long, I don't even want to Continue reading your crimes. There are too many! "You colluded with the three major Darksider organizations, colluded with the Pirates, killed the innocent, and acted as a protective umbrella for evil ... The key is that you started a war with the three major organizations, and in the end ... You did not annihilate the three major organizations, but simply threw a city-destroying bomb ... You are guilty! An uncountable crime!"
         Huang Long's face turned ashen,"what right do you have to judge me?" I'm your superior. Even if you think the headquarters is guilty, you should hand it over to the nine divisions for judgment, let alone the false charges ..."
         "No, no, no. You've forgotten that you're a transcendent. The night patrolman will be the judge."
         "That doesn't mean it's your turn!"
         The yellow Dragon rebuked!
         Li Hao was crazy!
         He was actually going to sentence a Deputy Secretary to death. This was the true higher-up of the dynasty, not the lower-ranking aristocrats, who were at most at the rank of a thousand-man commander. His status was very high, and he was extremely powerful. He was an expert in the transformation stage.
         Apart from the nine secretaries, he was considered a top expert, so his status was the same.
         Li Hao actually wanted to sentence him!
         What a joke!
          Li Hao smiled and took out a seal.""Of course I'm qualified. Minister Yao feels that he can't do what he wants, so the seal of the court will be temporarily handed over to me. The night patrolmen are currently under my jurisdiction, and you are no exception!"
         "Huang Long is sentenced to death!"
         With a clatter, the seal was stamped.
         Huang Long's expression changed!
         Yao si!
         Damn it, what is Yao si doing?
         He actually gave the seal to Li Hao. Did Li Hao force him, or was Yao si unable to sit still and wanted to kill him?
         He wanted to get angry!
         At this moment, Li Hao's voice resounded in their ears, in the hearts of many people, and in stellarsky city.
         "Law-enforcement officers who knowingly break the law must be executed as a warning to the others!"
         In an instant, Li Hao seemed to have transformed into a fierce tiger and pounced on them before they could react!
         At the side, the southern Fist was silent as his qi and blood erupted. BOOM!
         A punch was thrown!
         The yellow Dragon roared and roared. He also threw a punch. It was like a giant Dragon's Roar, and the color of the world changed!
         Li Hao wanted to sentence him?
         He was crazy!
         Qi Zhao was about to make a move when Li Hao's voice was heard again.""Those who attack law-enforcement officers will be killed without mercy!"
         Qi Zhao's expression changed slightly, but in the next moment, he gritted his teeth and attacked!
         Kill without mercy?
         That also depends on whether you have the ability!
         Huang Long roared,"kill!" Kill this guy ..."
         Behind them, on the night patrolmen's side, a few sunrises were ready to make a move.
         In the distance, figures quickly emerged, frowning. They were slightly surprised that Li Hao had moved ahead of time and, more importantly, wanted to kill Huang Long. If he didn't appear now, it would be a joke if he really killed Huang Long.
         As for those who did not manage to wait for Silver Moon ... They could not wait any longer!  In an instant, more than a dozen figures appeared.
         A few of them had auras that covered the sky and earth, and their voices slowly spread out."Li Hao, you killed innocents and colluded with the three major organizations to kill loyal and honest people. You can't be allowed to live!"
         Someone shouted. They didn't need evidence.
         It was just a greeting.
         In an instant, these people flew toward the north gate.
         Li Hao turned his head and took a quick look. Of the 12 people, only five of them seemed to have magical powers, while the rest were powerhouses in the transformation stage.
         Five divine powers, seven Metamorphoses, it was clear at a glance.
         The auras of divine-tier experts were all very violent.
         It was caused by the instability of his realm.
         A powerful aura swept across the world.
         In an instant, the entire stellarsky city was like a dead land!
         When Huang Long saw this, he was overjoyed. He sneered in his heart. 'If you didn't attack me, you could have lived a little longer. Why do you have to court death? now that you've attacked me, these people are not willing to wait any longer.'
         Just wait for your death!
         Li Hao sighed. He looked into the distance and said softly,""They really think highly of me. Five divine abilities and seven Metamorphoses ... They've really put in their best effort to kill me!"
         Many experts stepped on the air and arrived.
         He wasn't impatient.
         "You've only been in the stellarsky city for a few days," an old man said slowly."You've been killing wantonly, colluding with the three great evil sects, and harming loyal and honest people. It's only natural that you'll be exterminated. Only then will the heretic path of the stellarsky city be afraid!"
         "Who are you?"
         Li Hao looked at them fearlessly. He smiled and said,""Since you want to kill me, you need to have a name. Now that you have a name, Who are you? What right do you have to judge me?"
         "I'm the Vice Governor of heavenstar. If you want to kill me ... You can't just randomly send someone, right? Otherwise, it'll be difficult in the future. I can't even be an official, I could die at any time!"
         12 people, 8 men and 4 women.
         They were not young.
         The old man who had spoken earlier stood at the front and said calmly,""The previous Secretary of the criminal Division, Hu Xiao, is now the Honorary Secretary of the criminal Division. Is he qualified to judge you?"
          Li Hao smiled and nodded.
         There really was an old Secretary.
         He looked at the other four divine-tier elites, and a woman said indifferently,""The first Deputy Secretary of the Internal Affairs Division!"
         Another old man in a brocade robe said calmly,""The Head of the Department of rites 'myriad demon Hall."
         "The Marshal of the Heavenly Star Army of the Department of Military law!"
         "The first Deputy Secretary of the Department of Commerce!"
         The five magical powers were not ordinary people. They were all important figures from their respective divisions.
         An old Secretary and four deputy secretaries. From the looks of it, they might have just broken through to the God art realm. At this time, no one from the three major organizations, the seven sacred mountains, or the Pirates appeared.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com They were all officials!
         Clearly, they still had some sense of shame. Li Hao didn't say anything. He only looked into the distance. In the distance ... Auras rose up. He could even sense the aura of the old Duke from last time.
        
         Clearly, there were also divine powers.
         However, it wasn't to deal with Li Hao, but to deal with the Silver Moon martial masters who had come to help.
         The old Duke was not the only one in the divine power realm. What they had to guard against was a group of Silver Moon elites, and there were many divine power Auras rising.
         The 7 Metamorphoses were also from the various divisions or the royal family.
         "Are there people from the Division of Administration and the division of merits?"
         Li Hao didn't attack Huang Long again. Instead, he looked at these people and asked.
         "Liu Qi from the Meritorious Service division!"
         A middle-aged man smiled and nodded,""Li Hao, nice to meet you!"
         "Xie Yong from the Division of Administration!"
         Another man spoke with some regret,""The division Chief thinks that some things can be discussed. If they can be settled through negotiation, they don't necessarily need to be settled by force. However, it looks like Governor li ... Has already been possessed!"
          "What about the royal family?"
         No one made a sound.
         It didn't seem like anyone from the imperial family had come.
         Li Hao smiled.
         Did he not come ... Or was he hiding?
         Or wait for the right time?
         The seven divisions had five divine powers and seven had transformed ... It could be said that they had already spent a lot of resources on these four newly advanced divine powers.
         Just by looking at his aura, he could tell that it was still a little unstable.
         On the side, Nan Quan took a deep breath, looked at Li Hao, and then at hou Xiaochen.
         This was big trouble!
         The people outside probably wouldn't be able to make it, but the old Duke of the Xu family was here. They could feel the aura of stupa Mountain Master, and he could be considered an old acquaintance. He was probably here to deal with Yuan Shuo or Tian Jian, as he was a veteran expert.
         The southern Fist's intelligence was better than Li Hao 'S. He could vaguely sense the auras of the red moon's three great elders. These three people seemed to ... Seemed to have ... All advanced to divine power!
         He couldn't believe it!
         There were already five divine-tier elites outside, and in fact, there were more than that ...
         Nan Quan revealed a bitter expression.
         艹!
         Was this killing Li Hao?
         More than ten divine-tier elites had transformed into a pile ...
         He would die without a doubt!
         Even if he did, he might not be able to kill a divine ability user. Even if hou Xiaochen was slightly better than him, he wouldn't be much better.
         It's finished!
         Of course, at this point, he was not afraid of anything.
         Not far away, the night patrolmen powerhouses were also pale.
         So many experts!
         There were too many!
         Big eyes and the others were also dumbfounded!
         They looked around and were dumbfounded. They knew that each family would do their best to kill Li Hao, but they didn't expect such a scene!
         "Divine abilities ... I can count them with two hands ..."
         The big eyes were a little bitter as he transmitted a message to the two of them with some difficulty.
         He didn't expect that!
         I really didn't expect this!
         She had thought about three people, five people ... But she didn't expect that there would be five magical powers from the nine divisions.
         The senior Director of the criminal Division looked at Li Hao and said calmly,""Li Hao, you're very talented and very powerful, but you have to understand that sometimes ... Being young is a mistake. Just because you don't care about what you do doesn't mean you're invincible!"
         This time, in order to kill Li Hao, they had really put in a lot of effort.
         They all felt that two or three divine abilities were enough to kill Li Hao.
         But who were they?
         They were a group of old and cunning people who had once overthrown the royal family. Who didn't know that people like Li Hao were extremely difficult to deal with?
         Since he had made a decision, he would naturally go all out to kill him!
         Therefore, he personally led the team this time and brought four divine powers with him. The transformations alone were enough to cause Li Hao trouble.
         "You really think highly of me!"
         Li Hao sighed with emotion.
         He really thought highly of her!
         He didn't expect so many top powerhouses to come at once. He thought that five or six, or even seven or eight, would be enough, right?
         But ... There were still a bunch of them outside.
         They were all Overlord-level powerhouses from large organizations.
         Deputy Secretary, Secretary, Duke, mountain Lord ...
         "It's just me. It has nothing to do with the southern Fist. You won't kill innocent people, right?"
         Li Hao smiled, and Hu Xiao also said indifferently,""Li Hao, do you think that everything is under your control? He Yong, hou Xiaochen, and the others ... Do you think they'll be able to escape?"
         Not too far away, the people around hou Xiaochen had all scattered.
         Hou Xiaochen was revealed.  Hou Xiaochen looked at Li Hao and said,"you ... What are you still thinking?" Did you think that we've mobilized so many people just to kill you?"
         "Whether it's me or skysword," he laughed,"we're all within their calculations and are their targets ... It's not just you. Silver Moon ... He's always been like this. The whole world will attack him!"
         At this moment, stellarsky city was frighteningly quiet.
         Countless people's faces turned pale.
         ……
         There were also screens in the slums.
         At this moment, many people had gathered.
         However ... Everyone's face turned pale. Divine power!
         This newly named realm had also spread. Everyone knew that magical powers were the symbol of invincibility.
         But at this moment ... Five of them had come!
         The smart ones could tell that there were more people trying to stop the Silver Moon Warriors.
         Pa!
         Someone kicked the ground and lowered his head, not saying a word.
         His heart had died.
         When Li Hao read out the crimes of those people, they were very happy, but ... When these experts walked out, everyone knew ... They had failed!
         Li Hao was going to die.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com ……
         In the nine Dragons Pavilion.
         The female manager didn't say a word. Someone beside her laughed."Hahaha, these Silver Moon barbarians! Trial? Who could he judge? He was to be judged today! Judge the Silver Moon!"
         "Chief Jiao, come, get someone to serve the wine. It's my treat, serve the good wine!"
         "Serve wine, serve wine!"
         Everyone was shouting!
         The female manager lowered her head and did not look at them. She walked silently to the back. The sky was still the same sky, but for some reason, it was particularly dark today.
         In order to kill him, you guys ... Are so ruthless!
         ……
         Xiao Ye was in a daze. She turned around and looked at Yao si ... Yao si had disappeared.
         Xiao Ye didn't mind. She just stared blankly at the small screen in the office, feeling a little lost and helpless ... Governor li was going to die!
         Why?
         "Those people have committed heinous crimes. Are you all ... Blind and deaf?
         She had heard of Hu Xiao from the criminal Division, and there were even records of him in the history books.
         80 years ago, he was the founder of the new laws!
         He overthrew the royal family and made new laws. During that period of time, peace was restored in the dynasty, and the number of criminals decreased significantly. Why ... 80 years later, did you lead the way to kill Governor li?
         Why?
         She did not understand!
         Such a figure was respected by countless people. Even today, even though the nine divisions had been in a state of decline, the nine old secretaries were still the object of worship of countless people. However, Hu Xiao's appearance had shattered everyone's fantasies!
         Why?
         Xiao Ye looked on in a daze. Unknowingly, she felt as if her faith had collapsed. It turned out that ... Jiusi was completely rotten!
         All of his fantasies were gone.
         ……
         At this moment, stellarsky city was extremely dark.
         Dark clouds covered the sky.
         There was no longer any trace of light.
         ……
         At this moment, Li Hao sighed.
         Hu Xiao of the criminal Division!
         To be honest, it was out of his expectations that the judge who had created the new law ... Would come to kill him today ... Li Hao didn't know whether he was disappointed or self-deprecating. He shook his head.
         Below, the nobles were very excited. Of course, they were also nervous, afraid that they would be affected by the aftermath.
         12 powerhouses stepped on the air and arrived.
         Huang Long quickly met up with Qi Zhao and Deputy Minister Zhou. Huang Long looked at the Nightwalker behind him. Some of them hesitated for a moment, and some of them quickly gathered together. In the blink of an eye, three other deputy ministers met up with him.
          The remaining people did not join up and only retreated. Huang Long sneered.
         A bunch of idiots!
         At this time, he was still pretending to be aloof.
         Including him, there were five deputy ministers, which was exactly half of the total. Hou Xiaochen and the other four took up the other half.
         Now that hou Xiaochen and the others were dead, he had to deal with these people.
         That's good!
         After this, the night patrolmen no longer had any objections.
         As for Yao si ... He actually dared to give the seal to Li Hao. Even if he didn't find trouble with him, someone else would. Just wait!
         Huang Long felt extremely carefree!
         [PS: it's not going well. Let's leave it at that for now. I'll try my best to finish it today. My thoughts weren't going well in the morning.]
        
         Both inside and outside the city, there were strong enemies.
         In the distance, there was a rumbling sound.
         Before the battle in the city started, an expert's roar resounded from the distant seaside,""Silver Moon and yellow feather, come and fight!"
         With a loud roar, the long spear crossed the sky!
         At this moment, the spear pierced through the sky as Huang Yu brandished his spear.
         "Stupa, you dare to stop me?"
         "Die!" Huang Yu's roar resounded in all directions. His eyes were bloodshot."If the Silver Moon doesn't die today, I'll flatten your stupa and exterminate your entire family!"
         The qi and blood in his body ran through the world.
         Stupa Mountain Master remained silent.
         The ogre, Huang Yu!
          He was one of the three great commanders of the Wei Wu Army, the Marshal of the Silver Moon Garrison, a top-tier expert.
         He had once swept his spear in all directions and killed so many people that they trembled in fear. He had even killed some of the martial masters in Silver Moon martial forest and made them cry out in pain.
         Two of the three great commanders had arrived.
         "BOOM!"
         Another deafening explosion reverberated through the heavens and earth.
         One punch, one blade.
         Northern fist, tyrannical saber!
         The two of them didn't act alone, but came together. In the darkness, a figure was forced out by them. It was a cloaked figure, a flying expert.
         Northern fist smiled brightly,"Silver Moon Northern fist, nice to meet you!" Are you the great elder of the flying Pavilion, an wushen?"
         "That's me. "
         "Yes," the cloaked man replied softly and disappeared in an instant. The next moment, the long blade pierced through the void, and a blade light pierced through the world.
         "Come out!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com As his name suggested, BA Dao was incomparably overbearing. He didn't give his opponent a chance to hide. His saber swept across the sky, and with a loud boom, an wushen reappeared. He had been forced to reveal himself by the long saber.
         "You two ... Why do you have to do this?"
         "We have no intention of fighting Silvermoon," an wushen said softly."Someone asked us to stop her for a while. I'm afraid you won't be able to defeat me unless you completely unseal yourself!"
         Bei Quan laughed."Get out of the way!"
         "You take people's money and help them get rid of disasters!"
         That meant there was no room for discussion.
         In an instant, the sky collapsed and the earth cracked. A punch landed, and the starry sea boiled. Under the joint attack of the knife and the fist, the two experts who had yet to be completely unsealed actually forced one of them to retreat continuously.
         Further away.
         The three great elders of the red moon sect looked solemn. No one appeared. Only a long sword came from the sky."Let Ying Hongyue come!"
         BOOM!
         The sword slashed through the air, and thunder and lightning rose. The sword intent soared into the sky.  The heavenly Sword was here!
         Silver moon's famous martial masters arrived.
         ……
         The city was still as quiet as usual.
         Hu Xiao didn't make a move, and the others were also waiting for something. They all looked out of the city.
         "Sky sword, North fist, blade Overlord, ogres ..."
         "There's also the five bird Kings," Hu Xiao mumbled."Even the Azure light sword is here. There's also the southern Fist, the Golden spear, the Jade Rakshasa, the sickbed ghost ..."
         "If they all die this time, Li Hao, do you think Silver Moon martial forest will still be around?" he revealed a smile.
         The sky sword was very powerful!
         Although the realm of the three super powers was not very stable, Tian Jian alone with a sword had actually intimidated the three super powers. It had to be said that this kind of strength was unexpected, and it was obvious that his realm was very stable.
         BA Dao of the North could only fight one person at a time, which showed how powerful Tian Jian was.
         It was not surprising that the ogres could deal with the stupa Mountain Master. The three great commanders were all slightly better than those people in the past. They were all at the thousand warrior level, while Yuan Shuo and the others were only over a hundred.
         Just as he said that, a person rode on the clouds and mist on the sea surface. The waves were monstrous and swept over the world.
         "Hehe, since Silvermoon's old friends are here, I'm here to join in the fun!"
         The person's speed was extremely fast. With a whip kick, the space seemed to be shattered. However, in the next moment, a loud boom rang out. The person was forced back, blood flowing from his mouth. The wretched laughter from earlier was gone. He shook his head helplessly."Silver Moon Thunderbolt kick! I've embarrassed my brothers!"
         There hadn't been much news about the Thunderbolt kick of the 36 heroes. He had also arrived today, but ... He wasn't too strong. With just one move, he was forced back by one person.
         In the sea, the old state Duke of the Xu family coughed and looked at him. He said softly,""It is said that the Thunderbolt kick and the heaven's crippling feet are one set. You have been entangled with the heaven's crippling feet for many years, and the Xu family helped you kill him. Why don't you give me the secret technique of the Thunderbolt kick?"
         "Your son died a terrible death!"
         Thunderbolt kick. This was the first time Li Hao had seen it. It was a wretched old man, somewhat wretched, like a flea. He jumped up and down, and his laughter was very ear-piercing.
         "Old Duke, no, old Marquis ... Come, lick grandpa's feet. Once you're done, I'll give you the secret technique!"
         Vulgarities kept coming out of his mouth.
         The old Duke wasn't angry. His water and fire divine arts burst forth, and huge waves of the ocean rushed out. Like long Dragons, they swept in all directions. Flames erupted in the water, and at this moment, the starry sea was particularly beautiful.
          Thunderbolt kick kept dodging and retreating, but it still couldn't hide its decline. Its injuries instantly worsened, and blood flowed out of its mouth.
         There were too many experts!
         As of now, the Yama powerhouses of the three great organizations had yet to appear. Even so, the number of divine-tier elites who had appeared in an instant was as high as six.
         As for the Yama experts, they appeared after a short while.
         The moment Yuan Shuo appeared, a person blocked his path.
         The person who appeared had an elegant demeanor. Different from the rest of the Yama, this person had the appearance of a scholar. He chuckled,"Chu Jiang pays his respects to the arrival of the five bird Kings!"
         King Chujiang of the Ten Kings of Hell!
         Yuan Shuo rolled his eyes."I thought the Yama would personally come to stop me. A little brat came. Is he looking down on me?"
         "It should be enough."
         King Chujiang chuckled."The five beast King is not weak. It's a pity ... It's twenty years too late. Otherwise, no one would dare to say that they could take down the five beast King. I wouldn't dare, and neither would the leader of Yama. But ... It's twenty years too late, isn't it?"
        
         The seven Sacred Arts all appeared.
         As for Silver Moon martial forest, it seemed like no one had come.
         In some places, battles had already broken out, while in others, people were still chatting. For example, Yuan Shuo was chatting with King Chujiang, as if he was not in a hurry.
         ……
         Within the city.
         Hu Xiao looked at it for a while, then looked at Li Hao and smiled.""Is there anyone else?"
         "Seven Sacred Arts? is this enough?" he looked at hou Xiaochen.
         "Including us, there are 12 divine-tier elites. That's enough for you to think highly of Silver Moon martial forest, right?"
         "Silver Moon is the only Martial Master in the world," Hu Xiao said softly."No one can refute that, and they can 't. So, we've made ample preparations to send him off. We knew that you would come!"
         Hou Xiaochen laughed as his aura grew stronger and stronger."Secretary Hu, I have to say ... You really think highly of us! That's good, I saw Thunderbolt kick instead of the others. I've been hunting him for more than twenty years, but this guy hid too fast, so I didn't see him. Today, I finally saw him. "
          He laughed. Thunderbolt kick's disappearance was actually related to him, or rather, it was related to the Wei Wu Army.
         He really had been after Thunderbolt kick for more than 20 years.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com More than 20 years ago, he had fought with someone with Thunderbolt kick and killed many bystanders by mistake. From that day on, he had been trying to capture that person, but he had run away without a trace. In the end ... He had seen it today.
         Not all the martial masters of Silver Moon martial forest were good people.
         There were also bad people.
         Most of them had been killed, but a few were still alive, such as Thunderbolt kick. In hou Xiaochen's eyes, they were all bad people.
         In the distance, a man was fighting against the old Duke's Thunderbolt kick alone, and his wretched laughter resounded through the world.
         It was as if he knew that hou Xiaochen would talk about him, and even if he didn't hear it, he still laughed heartily,"Hou Xiaochen, Huang Yu, come and catch me! Hahaha, you can't catch him, right? Do you know where I've been hiding for the past 20 years? Don't you know?"
         "Let me tell you, don't drop your jaws in shock ... I've married nine wives and had 28 children all these years. I've been a landlord in Linjiang all this time. I'm extremely rich and have a great time!"
         "If you catch me, I'll run to Linjiang. Hahaha, you just can't catch me. Fan Chang in Linjiang knows my identity and has been protecting me. Hehehe, this feels great. If I don't die this time, I'll go to the Li Dynasty ... You can keep catching me!"
         He laughed arrogantly.
         However, he was also beaten into a sorry state. The old Duke had only used his divine arts with ease, but he was constantly retreating and vomiting blood. It was obvious that the gap between them was not small. His strength was probably only slightly stronger than that of a metahuman, but there was a limit to it.
         In all the battlefields, except for the heavenly Sword and the three remarkable powers, Huang Yu was the only one who had the upper hand against the stupa Mountain Master.
         And was this really all?
         Li Hao looked back and suddenly said,"the Crimson Moon's three major organizations sent out five divine abilities. I didn't expect this." I thought you would collude with the Pirates, like that North Sea Bandit. I've captured his grandson, but the North Sea King didn't come? Also, the Marquis's old superior, the king of the plains, didn't come?"
         These were the strong enemies he had imagined.
         In the end, Hongyue sent three magical powers at once, which was completely out of his expectations. When so many of them came, Li Hao thought that someone like Ying Hongyue would either not send anyone or come to watch the fun ... But three of them came, which was really a surprise.  "Not all the Silver Moon martial masters are here, right?" Hu Xiao said meaningfully.
         For example, the Earthcover sword, the radiant sword, and the hahaha monster.
         These people had not arrived yet.
         Li Hao understood and nodded.
         "Aren't you afraid?"
         Hu Xiao looked at Li Hao and smiled."Li Hao, your recklessness has led to this. Don't you regret it?"
         It was a heart-killing move.
         He seemed to want Li Hao to collapse.
         Because of you, such a terrible result has been caused.
         The large number of Silver Moon martial masters might not be able to leave stellarsky city this time.
         Beside him, Nan Quan sneered, his qi and blood soaring.""Old man, are you underestimating the Silver Moon Martial Master? Then let's see how many of us can die today!"
         "Northern fist, you piece of trash! You can only fight one of BA Dao?" You think you're worthy of being called the northern fist?"
         In the distance, blood seeped out from the corner of bei Quan's mouth as he sighed,""There's no other way, right? Unless we break the superpower lock, we can't fight against God art! The little kid is causing trouble and forcing us to risk our lives ... I told him last time to be low-key and to be more well-behaved!"
         ……
         They were chatting.
         They scolded each other in the air.
          Li Hao, on the other hand, lowered his head, as if he was thinking about something and regretting it.
         Hu Xiao ignored him and continued to look at the sea. He raised his eyebrows slightly."Are the earth overturning sword and the light sword really not coming?"
         Obviously, he was still waiting.
         He was waiting for the two!
         It wasn't just him. The divine Arts by the Sea didn't seem to be using their full strength and were waiting for the martial masters to arrive.
         They seemed to be afraid that if they killed these people, the two would escape.
         BOOM!
         At this moment, a sword light shot out in all directions. The two swords combined, and the sky and earth turned upside down. The ocean seemed to have been turned around.
         The two of them stepped on the air, and the earth overturning sword sliced through the air. With a bang, a person emerged from the bottom of the sea. He was dressed in yellow robes and appeared extremely majestic. He laughed in spite of himself."Hong Yitang, you have good perception! Last time, when you killed general Qian Feng, I wanted to go to you directly ... But now there's no need!"
         He looked at the earth overturning sword, and then at the light sword. At this moment, the two of them appeared to be in a sorry state. They were panting heavily, as if they had just arrived after a long journey.
        
         Hong Yitang exhaled lightly,'King of the plains, you're always there! You were there during the rebellion of the three northern provinces, during the Battle of the North Sea, and during the Wei Wu Army. You're a very annoying person!"
         "Of the nine Kings of the imperial family, you're probably the most meddlesome."
         The king of the plains revealed a smile on his dignified face.""It's not that I'm meddlesome, but you, Martial Master Silvermoon, have been bringing chaos to the world since ancient times. The chaos in the world is in the North!"
         ……
         Hu Xiao heaved a long sigh of relief.
         It's here!
         He had waited until now because he was afraid of scaring the two away. Now that they were here, he was at ease.
         With the arrival of the earth overturning sword and the Sword of Light, they were eliminated this time. There were still a few famous martial masters in the huge Silver Moon martial forest, but there were very few of them. The hahaha freak might be Zhao Shuguang, and the other relatively strong one was Kong Jie.
         However, it was nothing to worry about!
         As for how the two of them arrived so quickly, the ninth Division had put in a lot of effort. For example, they had arranged for a helicopter to escort them along the way. Yes, the ninth Division had done so brazenly. They had been afraid that they would not come!
          That was naturally the best.
         At this moment, Li Hao sighed in his heart. I didn't want you to come when I decided to set the date three days later. Why did you do that?
         All Silver Moon martial masters ... Were so stupid.
         This wasn't Silver Moon, this was Heavenly Star City.
         But since he was already here ... What else could he do?
         Hou Xiaochen's spear had already appeared, while Yu Luosha's gloves were as thin as cicada's wings.
         At this moment, there were no more words to say.
         In an instant, someone made a move!
         BOOM!
         Metal and wood collided, and a heaven-shaking power erupted. The general from the Heavenly Star Army charged at hou Xiaochen, a spear in his hand. He thrust it forward, and a divine ability exploded forth!
         The combination of the two super powers was extremely powerful. Hou Xiaochen let out a shout and thrust his spear forward. The fire Phoenix spear also burst with light, causing the sky to collapse.
         BOOM!
         A part of the city wall collapsed instantly.
         The surrounding nobles all fled.
         Li Hao's plan to behead him was completely ruined.
         Nan Quan and Yu Luosha attacked one after another. In the air, Qin Lian, who was at the peak of the rising light realm, hesitated for a moment before gritting her teeth. She also brandished her sword and charged towards a metamorphosed rising light!
         However ... The difference between the two sides was too great.
         He had hoped that the Silver Moon Martial Master outside would come to his aid, but who knew that this would be the result?
         Outside, the rumbling sounds instantly became louder.
         Tian Jian had made his move!  At this moment, it was as if there was only one sword in the entire world. The next moment, Tian Jian's cold and arrogant voice rang out,"You three pieces of trash, you think you can stop me?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com BOOM!
         The long sword trembled, and the three divine-tier powerhouses actually took a step back one after another, their faces turning pale with shock.
         The heavenly Sword ... Was that powerful?
         He was too strong!
         Even Hu Xiao couldn't help but turn his head to take a look. What a powerful Heavenly Sword. His divine power realm had been completely stabilized. No wonder he was so ostentatious. In order to stop him, three great divine powers had joined forces. No one else had such treatment.
         In other places, at this moment, the Qi, blood, and spirit of the martial masters surged one after another, and the strength of the earth overturning sword rose by a large margin. The king of the plains was not inferior to them, and his smile remained."Hong Yitang, you're very strong. The nine superpower locks are full, right? But ... I think I'm about the same!"
         He was also a Martial Master!
         Yes, a Martial Master.
         At this moment, his qi and blood surged forth, powerful to the extreme. Even the void seemed to be somewhat shattered. He was still smiling."Light sword, move aside. Let the North Sea Bandit play with you. I'll play with Hong Yitang!"
         The Sword of Light's expression changed slightly. The next moment, the sword pierced through the sea. From the bottom of the sea, someone walked out. It was a bare-chested old man with two axes in his hands. He looked particularly fierce!
         The King of the North Sea!
         He glanced at the king of the plains and did not say anything. He then looked at the light sword, and finally turned his head to look into the distance. He said loudly,""If anything happens to my grandson, Hu, don't blame me for falling out with you!"
         "Of course not!" Hu Xiao's voice came from afar.
         "That's good!"
         After the King of the North Sea finished speaking, he swung his axe at the light sword and coldly said,""Last time, you killed the Archduke under my command. You should have expected this day to come!"
         The Sword of Light frowned slightly and quickly dodged. It glanced at the overbearing sword and turned to escape.
         She might be a burden to Hong Yitang here.
         The North Sea King had actually stepped into the divine power realm.
          At this moment, all the martial masters understood that ... This time, each clan had really put in a lot of effort and made up their minds to completely annihilate them.
         There were five magical powers from the three large organizations, the old Duke, stupa mountain Lord, the king of the plains, the King of the North Sea, and nine martial masters who had come to help from the magical hunting.
         In the city, there were five magical powers and seven metamorphosing powerhouses. No, including Huang Long and Qi Zhao, there were nine metamorphosing powerhouses.
         In this battle, the nine divisions had sent a total of 14 divine-tier powerhouses.
         It was beyond everyone's expectations!
         ……
         At this moment, even the Secretary of the inspection Division was surprised and shocked. He muttered,""They're all F * cking crazy. They haven't even stabilized their realms yet, and they've all run out ..."
         Beside him, his father also stroked his beard.""That's to be expected. The Silver Moon Martial Master is too much of a threat, so it's only natural for us to kill him. I just didn't expect that even though they knew it was a trap, they still came!"
         Shaking his head, he looked at his son."Forget it. I'll just hide like this. I can't offend anyone. It's fine if I lose some power ... I can't afford to offend them!" I was thinking that if there were three or five divine powers, I could add flowers to the already perfect situation ... But old Hu and the others didn't give me this opportunity ..."
         "You're adding flowers to a brocade, but who are you adding flowers to?"
