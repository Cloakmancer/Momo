Tian Fang, the Overlord, had no enmity with him. However, he looked down on Li Hao and felt that everything was under his control. He felt that everything he had was given to him by Tian Fang, and that he had given Li Hao a chance ...Wrong!Li Hao definitely didn't think so.You can't stop me from getting everything. That's because you're useless, but that doesn't mean you don't want to change. If you have the ability, then you can control time yourself.The statue was silent.After a long time, she smiled."Maybe you're right. I'm the one who's mistaken."Li Hao laughed and floated into the air."I advise you not to send your clone here. This time, I'm only targeting the calamity, not you. However, your clone's arrival brought me danger. Perhaps ... I'll join forces with others to deal with you! It's not that there's a grudge between us, it's just that ... You guys have no right to decide my life!"Tian Fang was silent.Li Hao, on the other hand, had already entered the depths of the river and instantly disappeared from the past. This scene also began to slowly dissipate."Li Hao ..."Tian Fang muttered and slowly disappeared as the fragment collapsed.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶BOOM!The river shook.The moment Li Hao appeared, the lightning tribulation erupted again. The future emperor let out a shrill scream as he was struck to the point where he was charred on the outside and tender on the inside!"Bastard!" At this moment, it was as if they were cursing out loud!Damn it!How could this lightning tribulation be so powerful?When he saw Li Hao appear, Su Yu's eyes and nose became extremely angry!The old bastard was such a scammer!Was this lightning tribulation really just grade 8 and could be seen everywhere?Why did he feel that ... He was ridiculously strong?Although it didn't kill him, how strong was he?Invincible in the primal Chaos ...Alright, even if he was invincible in the pseudo-chaos realm, he was still invincible. Was there a need to go this far?Was there a need to be struck by a bolt of tribulation lightning like this?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Li Hao only glanced at it and gave it a thumbs-up!Amazing!Even this lightning tribulation wasn't able to kill him. He was really strong. Last time, he had forced Fu Sheng back with a single sword strike. He thought that he might only be at the seventh or eighth step. Now, it seemed that it was only because he hadn't arrived.This time, he had reversed time and pulled the other party out, allowing him to reveal his true strength.Very strong, not weaker than long Zhan.Was the world I created this powerful?Could it accommodate a powerhouse close to the ninth step? "In that case ... When I created it, it might not have been recently. I don't have such strength now. I only have around 5000 Dao laws. I'm not even as strong as this guy.He only took a glance and didn't care anymore. Whether this person was strong or weak, he could only use it in the river and couldn't walk out!He looked at the Thunder region in the distance. The battle was still going on there.It seemed like he had yet to kill his opponent ... He was a little slow.Looking at the tianfang battlefield ... Huh?The two messengers of yin and yang were gone?Then, he looked at sun god and Supreme ... Li Hao was slightly stunned. Sun god ... The old man who looked out of place and was wearing floral shorts ... Was a little different today. What was going on?Divine text ...Li Hao's expression changed as if he had seen something. The ultimate technique of Star Town City and his way of divine writing were actually developed from the ultimate technique of Star Town City. They were of the same origin, but ... They were fundamentally different.That was, the unique skill of star suppression city had no power or spirit!It could only be called an ultimate technique, not divine text.Why ... Today ... This sun God's divine text was somewhat different?Suddenly, he saw and sensed something. Li Hao let out a soft gasp, as if he had thought of something. He remembered what he had said to the Supreme martial artist that day. Back then, where did the world near neo martial come from?He had some guesses before, and now ... He might be able to verify them!For a moment, Li Hao was in a daze.In that case ... The sun god's Dao of divine text might come from ... The future!"And the future divine text Dao comes from me. My divine text Dao comes from the sun god ...Ëâπ! no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  What was this?Li Hao was dumbfounded. The chicken laid the egg, and the egg laid the chicken ... Which one came first?At this moment, with Li Hao's return, the lightning tribulation seemed to be slightly weaker. It had consumed a lot of energy, and since Li Hao had walked out of the past, it was not as good as before. The lightning tribulation was starting to weaken.But how could this work?Li Hao smiled. Suddenly, he looked around and at the sky with a bright smile."The origin of life, how did it come about?"In an instant, he suddenly used time again. This time, he wasn't targeting anyone, but ... The chaos great Dao. He wanted to reverse the chaos great Dao. He wanted to see how the chaos great Dao was born!In the past, he had once reversed the source of life in a small world and almost killed himself. It was er Mao who had cut off the lightning tribulation and saved his life.Clearly, the exploration of the origin of chaos and the origin of life touched upon the deepest secrets of chaos.But at this moment, Li Hao, with the idea that it would be a waste not to do it, began to delve deep into the chaos great Dao and reverse time. He was really interested in creating the source of life!In an instant, the chaos seemed to be in turmoil!At this moment, the future emperor, who had been silent all this while, suddenly cursed,""Tsk, old bastard, that's enough!"He was going crazy!At this moment, he finally understood where the lightning tribulation came from. He was already able to resist the weakened lightning tribulation, but at this moment, the lightning tribulation suddenly expanded and countless power of the lightning tribulation was drawn from the lightning territory!He wanted to stop Li Hao!Reversing the chaos great Dao, exploring the origin of the universe's chaos ...

Chapter 3611 Descent (3)_5
This ... Was unforgivable!This wasn't even something the Lord of calamity could control. Even if the other party was here right now, he might not be able to control it.Time and Stars seemed to be trembling violently!Reversing a small world was one thing, but reversing the chaos great Dao was the same as reversing the entire chaos. After all, Time and Stars were not complete. At this moment, they trembled violently, and the entire River trembled wildly!Countless bolts of tribulation lightning began to descend upon them, even engulfing the entire primordial chaos!On the other side of the lightning territory, Supreme Thunder and the others 'expressions changed completely as they muttered to themselves,""Crazy, he's completely crazy ... The ninth-rank calamity might be coming soon ..."‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Long Zhan's expression also changed at this moment. The human King's expression also changed."That's enough!""We can kill them now ..." The human King roared.Stop playing!Kid, the Tribulation lightning is covering the entire square domain. At this moment, the Tribulation lightning is no longer just covering Li Hao or the river, but ... The entire square domain!The surrounding sector Lords were fleeing in a frenzy, and all of them were seventh level venerable sovereigns, their faces ashen.‚Äã Ëâπ!Crazy!That's good. He would take advantage of the Thunder region's complete destruction to run away first. He would think about it after he ran out of the square region. As for the world or not, who would care at this time?His life was more important!At this moment, long Zhan was also having a splitting headache. The new martial artists had come to kill, but Li Hao had come not to kill, but to completely annihilate the Thunder region. Even the square region would be turned into ruins! n(0)velbIn[.]nEt The countless bolts of tribulation lightning were becoming more and more powerful!Boom! Boom! Boom!Tribulation lightning began to rain down from all directions. It was no longer targeting one or two people, but rather the power of time energy that was spreading to every corner of the world.Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't care about anything.It has nothing to do with me!In his eyes, an incomparably thick great Dao appeared. It was unbelievably large, as if ... It supported the entire chaos. At this moment, he could clearly see the entire chaos great Dao.The great Dao laws ... Were countless!They were densely packed. Some were silent, some were active, some seemed to be alive, and some seemed to be completely broken ...Looking up, it seemed ... To be a heart.The source of chaos!In other words, the source of all life in the entire chaos, and perhaps, the source of the great Dao.Bang ...When the almost inaudible throbbing sound entered Li Hao's ears, it was as if the world had been reborn and the world had been reopened.He was a little dazed.He seemed to have been immersed in it. At this moment, he suddenly jolted awake, as if he had recalled something. The desire in his eyes could no longer be concealed."This is ... The source of chaos lifeforms ... They must be here!"The source!Li Hao laughed crazily. Suddenly, time was reversed!Suddenly, a drop of blood appeared in his hand ... He reversed the universe and reincarnated! I want to revive them!Father, mother, little Yuan ..."If you were born, old, sick, and dying, I wouldn't have been so impatient, so eager ... But you were all killed by someone. You didn't die a normal death. That shouldn't have happened!"All of you can be resurrected ... I've found the source of chaos!Since I can't find you in Silver Moon, then I'll ... Find you here!Time reversal!Heaven and earth rumbled, and chaos trembled. Someone risked the world's wrath to search for human spirits from the source of chaos. Among the countless living beings, they searched for the spirits of three ordinary people who had died!The source of life had dissipated in the Silver Moon, but it would never dissipate in the chaos, because chaos ... Contained everything.Li Hao was going to reverse time and resurrect the three of them at the source of chaos ...Boom! Boom! Boom!Countless bolts of tribulation lightning struck down crazily, turning the entire world into a Lightning zone. Li Hao had touched the source of chaos.At this moment, the great DAOs seemed to come alive!"He's crazy!""Li Hao, you must die!""Tian Fang, this time, no one can protect him. He has already ... Gone completely crazy. He's stirring the source of chaos ..."It was the source of all people, all powerhouses, including type 9 powerhouses.This person couldn't be left alive!The second generation had to die. No matter who the third generation was, he had to die.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶They weren't the only ones who thought so. At this moment, the crazy human King also felt that Li Hao had gone too far!On the river, the future emperor laughed evilly. His eyes suddenly turned red."Shi Guang, you old bastard. How interesting. I thought that you were a scholar and a cultured man...Turns out that you're a lunatic!"Wasn't he dressed in white?Wasn't it full of immortal Qi?Didn't he leave with a sword that pierced through the heavens and earth?Why ... Was he in such a sorry state with the myriad tribulation on him at this moment, yet he was so crazy and his desire was so strong that he could even sense the future?Wasn't the great Dao emotionless?Didn't he have nothing to pursue?How did this happen?Rumors can't be trusted. Sure enough, all dark history can only be learned from the current generation. Countless years later, who would still remember your dark history ...No, I have to record it!At this moment, the future emperor suddenly ignored the lightning tribulation and let it hit him. With a brilliant smile, he took out a piece of divine text and recorded it at Li Hao!Fun, fun!His entire body was charred black, but he didn't care. He just recorded, watched, laughed, and bared his teeth.But at this moment, the river started to shake violently. He seemed to have sensed something as he frowned slightly. Time wasn't strong enough. By the looks of it, this old man Shi Guang had yet to fully control time, and wasn't strong enough to make time stronger.

I can't hold on any longer!He reluctantly put away the recording talisman. He had decided to put this recorded miserable time into the depths of the river of time ... For the unrivaled warriors to watch and enjoy it for generations to come!However, when he saw that he had somewhat dissipated and the long river and huge waves were surging, it was as if he was going to return to the future ...Su Yu was a little unhappy. I haven't dealt with the Thunder tribulation yet. I'm not done watching the show.You want me to go, and I'll go?"Split open the sky!"With a low shout, the will of civilization appeared. The civilization of the universe appeared, and tens of thousands of divine characters appeared. A long spear appeared in his hand like a ... Pen.He laughed and held the long brush in his hand. Suddenly, he pointed it at the river of time, as if he was drawing something!Draw a world, draw a heaven and earth!An illusionary world suddenly appeared above the river. The illusionary heaven and earth and the fluctuating River actually became stable. Divine characters appeared from the brush and gradually stabilized the turbulent River!As for Su Yu, he panted, and rule force madly overflowed from his body!He didn't care at all and just smiled.The next moment, with a wave of his hand, a door appeared. It stood above the long river with a bright smile. He left a back door."I'll come again later!"This place was the past!Even in the era of time, I will return."I'll help you stabilize it for a while ... Don't break it. If you break it, maybe the future will change ..."Su Yu roared. The next moment, he looked at the Thunder tribulation that was still slashing at him, and a fierce light flashed in his eyes."Do you think I'm easy to bully?""Support my body!"Behind him, the cultivators 'DAOs and divine characters appeared one after another, and they were blessed by heaven and earth!The power of ten thousand worlds!Su Yu's aura suddenly skyrocketed, reaching an extreme in an instant, infinitely close to the ninth-rank. The will of civilization appeared in his hand again and turned into a long spear in an instant!"Shatter!"A monstrous power of tribulation appeared between the heavens and the earth, floating above the river. I am the law!I'll set the rules!Do you really think I can't defeat a mere lightning tribulation?Boom! Boom! Boom!Countless Thunderbolts exploded in an instant. The long spear in his hand also exploded. Su Yu spat out blood. Behind him, illusionary cultivators were retreating, but Su Yu laughed.He seemed to want to do something, but at this moment, he also felt that if he went any further, he might cause this weak river to completely collapse!He looked at Li Hao's demonic and lustful appearance. He frowned slightly, but his smile soon returned."Shi Guang, I...Will wait for you! Don't play around anymore. Next time, I'm going to descend for real!"BOOM!The river began to collapse, and he quickly retreated, his laughter resounding through the world!Hong long long ...The Dao River swept across the world, and he instantly disappeared.His voice was still reverberating.As for Li Hao, he gradually came to his senses. When he saw the countless rules of great DAOs blocking him and even trying to defeat him, he knew that his resurrection ... Was probably over!A Grade 9 was blocking him.He looked at the unimaginably thick path in the void and suddenly chuckled.""You've stopped me ... From resurrecting my family and friends. You ... Are my enemies. I will ... Eliminate you one by one!"The sword was drawn!BOOM!The descending lightning tribulation was instantly shattered by him. At this moment, in the distance, a shrill roar finally came from the lightning territory as countless amounts of the power of the lightning tribulation was drawn away.The Thunder region venerable sovereigns were all extremely weak. Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  At this moment, his death began.Boom ... It was as if the mountains were collapsing, as if the earth was cracking ...Several level eights in the lightning territory began to fall.The people of Mount Wu also roared at this moment. They transformed into shadows that were extremely powerful and covered the sky and earth."Wushan, slay the ancient plague!""Kong Ji, destroy the ancient landslide!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù The venerable sovereigns roared as they killed the strong men! At the same time, the human King slashed out with his blade. This time, he had used up all his strength. With a roar, the long blade suddenly transformed into himself, as if two human Kings had descended."Die!"Everyone was killing people, but he, the one who said those harsh words, had been entangled until now. He was too ashamed to see anyone!BOOM!The dark Demon Messenger was split in half with a helpless and sorrowful expression ... The day of revival, the day of death!Can Dao master ... Resurrect us?Are you willing to resurrect us?The light emissary turned pale with fright. At this moment, he could not think of anything else. He turned around and ran. The dark Demon emissary had been killed, and the light and darkness fusion had been broken. It was obvious that he was no match for the human King. The human King had gone mad from killing. At this moment, he was gritting his teeth in hatred. If he stayed any longer, he would die without a doubt!But how could the human King be willing to let him escape!At this moment, a fierce roar suddenly rang out,""Merge!"In an instant, some people in the crowd suddenly disappeared and reappeared. Some of the new martial Supreme emperors ... Not just a few, only a few actually became a part of his body!The blood Emperor fused with his blood Qi, the iron head Emperor turned into armor, and the God-splitting Emperor turned into a spear ...Not only that, but Emperor Cang also suddenly became a part of the origin ... The aura of the human king rose again. With a thrust of the spear, it pierced through the void, shattered the firmament, and broke the sky and the universe!With anger and shame, why aren't you dead?Do you have to force me to do this?Ever since he had killed the celestial Thearch, he had never used the fusion technique again. The fusion technique ... Was actually a mark left behind by battle. He didn't like it very much, but it had been researched by battle.Using humans as qi and blood, using humans as spirit ... In fact, it was also a kind of combat technique. It was a very unique combat technique, but it was very inhumane!Normally, no matter how difficult it was, he didn't want to use it.But today...He really couldn't afford to lose face like this. He was going to use it. He had said from the beginning that he would kill the light and dark emissary. He couldn't go back on his words and be laughed at!Boom! Boom! Boom!The light envoy's face turned pale as he shouted,""Dao master, save me ..."At this moment, there was no way to escape. They could only hope that the Dao master would come!As for the human King, he sneered and said in an almost inaudible voice,""If you don't die, how will he descend?"He seemed to have guessed and judged something.The death of Yin Yang and the dark Demon envoy was not enough!If you don't die, how can that fellow descend so easily?You're still hoping that he'll save you? you're thinking too much!Long Zhan's expression changed slightly as he looked at the human King ... His thoughts were fluctuating. Did you know that killing light and dark should be enough for Tian Fang's clone to descend?The human King raised his head and laughed in disdain, as if saying ... So what?On the side, Li Hao's face was deathly pale. He looked at the sky in silence. He had already seen a flash of light gradually emerging from the depths of the chaos great Dao!A person was walking towards this place.The heavens were about to descend!Li Hao smiled and lowered his head to look at the human King and the others. Looking at long Zhan, he smiled and said softly,""Senior Tian Fang's clone is probably coming ..."As soon as he finished speaking, he looked at the Thunder region in the distance and suddenly laughed,""That old ghost tribulation actually wants to descend .... Does he think ... That he hasn't died enough?"At this moment, all of the grade 9 cultivators had chosen to descend!As for long Zhan, he was originally still calm, but all of a sudden, he was a little annoyed and scolded in a low voice,"‚ÄúËâπ!‚ÄùCan you two be more reliable?"One descending is within my expectations, but two ... I really don't have such plans. You bunch of lunatics, are you really not afraid of death?I don't want to die so early!If two of them came ... They wouldn't be able to stop them!Don't joke around!The human King chuckled and muttered to himself,""Two ... That's more interesting. Old dragon, don't run. You run and kill all your people!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLong Zhan's expression was cold. He believed the words of this madman. If he dared to run, their group might really exterminate the entire chaos race!It's hard to get off now!As expected, working with these people felt good, but at the critical Junct...They might suffer a huge setback!

Chapter 3613 Face To Face (1)
(Double monthly votes after 12 o' clock. Please support me. Also, you don't have to read this chapter. I haven't thought of how to write it yet. Please slow down.)The messenger of light and dark, the messenger of yin and yang, were killed one after another.Over at the Thunder region, a few Tier 6 martial artists had also fallen. At this moment, the neo martial artists, under the leadership of the Supreme martial artists, were besieging the tier 7 heavenly Emperor ...People were dying continuously!The battle had ended as quickly as it had started.But in fact ... For Li Hao and the others, this was only the beginning. From the beginning, they had never regarded these people as great enemies!Yes, there was none from the beginning.This group of people was meat.They dared to return without understanding the current chaos or anyone. What were they?The true enemy had always been a grade-9!Only by shattering the thoughts of a rank-9 descending at this moment and their fantasies could chaos be peaceful for a period of time. Otherwise ... There was no way it could be peaceful.This group of grade-9 experts had left for too long.However, they were strong enough!The messengers of light and dark were not strong enough. Therefore, this group of people was destined to be at a disadvantage in front of the Chiefs. They could deal with even a few more people, let alone this small group.There were still people who hadn't made a move!Huntian in the West, spring and autumn in the south ...Would these people just watch as a Grade 9 descended?It was impossible!Therefore, the death of the Lightbringer they all was not unjust. Long Zhan these people might not have used all their trump cards. Otherwise, how could long Zhan still be left until now?A bunch of fellows who knew nothing about a million years ago and did not have sufficient strength ... They would only be food if they returned! Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  "Stop fighting, Wu Xing and Coiling Dragon sovereign," Li Hao said."Take your men and retreat. I'll spare your lives. Sovereign Tian Fang is about to return. We'll talk about revenge when he's back!"The remaining level eight venerable sovereigns 'faces changed dramatically.At this moment, he was a little suspicious.Li Hao turned his head and looked at long Zhan. Long Zhan smiled and said softly,""Fellow Daoist Hao Yue, I promised you before, so there's no problem with that ... These minor characters aren't my targets either! Since Tian Fang has returned, they ... Can do whatever they want!"A minor character?The moment he said this, the faces of the Tian Fang experts turned ugly.A minor character!A group of eighth level venerable sovereigns had become nobodies. Even a million years ago, they were not nobodies. They were Tian Fang's venerable sovereigns, eighth level venerable sovereigns, messengers!An existence who could even join hands to hold long Zhan back ...And now, this person was calling them nobodies! However, with the four powerful cultivators killed, the messenger of life and death looked like it was about to fall. On the side of the five elements, Emperor fire Yan sighed and said,""You guys ..."He was about to say something, but Li Hao suddenly disappeared.Everyone was shocked!Long Zhan raised his brows slightly, but he didn't say anything. At this moment, a wave of sword intent overflowed into the world. The expression of the messenger of death, who was currently entangled with Feng Yan and the others, suddenly changed!In an instant, the long sword pierced through his chest!Li Hao's River swept him into it and he disappeared in an instant. When he returned to his original location, his expression changed."You ..."Li Hao turned around and chuckled."I promised you that I would repay you. Just like what I said in the past, I will repay what I promised!" "Therefore, protect your lives. The others are not included. I still have use for the Qi of death, so ... Deathbringer, it's better for you to die!"Ruthless and merciless!At this moment, even long Zhan slightly raised his eyebrows.Li Hao's strength was not considered extremely strong, but his strength was around 5000 Dao laws. In addition, the life-and-death messenger had been constantly exhausted and entangled. In addition, Li Hao had just said that he would let them go ... Long Zhan had also agreed. The life-and-death messenger might have thought that the people Li Hao mentioned, including them, had let down his guard a little.But who would have thought that the next person to attack would be Li Hao!He used time travel and killed Deathbringer with one strike!This ... Long Zhan's scalp turned slightly numb. This guy, this was called returning a favor?What he had said just now was to distract the other party's attention. He was really not a good person!Not far away, the Coiling Dragon sovereign's expression also changed.What a ruthless person!He killed the powerful Deathbringer with a single strike. This guy ... Was too black-hearted!Li Hao said nonchalantly.He launched a surprise attack, diverted his attention, surrounded by Feng Yan and the others, and attacked in an instant ... Killing a cultivator with around 4000 Dao laws was not a big deal. After all, this fellow was not as strong as him.If he was killed, then he was killed.He wanted the death aura because he thought of Lin Hongyu. He needed some death aura to perfect his hell system. Since he had seen it, there was no reason not to kill her!Li Hao glanced at the gold spirit emissary who had refuted him just now. Do you ... Still dare to refute him?At this moment, Wu Xing's expression was extremely unsightly, but he didn't refute Li Hao's so-called return of the favor!This was because ... From what he had seen in his memories, this man had killed people without any warning. This was completely different from what he had known. This Silver Moon King was not a Saint, but the most vicious person in the world!This time, the Thunderbolts covered the square region and almost annihilated it!This was not the first time Li Hao had done this.At this moment, many figures seemed to pass through time and arrive at Li Hao's side. Their auras appeared around Li Hao. The Dao chess players were all filled with killing intent.

Chapter 3614 Face To Face (2)
When they saw Li Hao, they were all overjoyed!This time, they had won!Of course, it was all Li Hao's credit. He had forcefully drained the energy of the powerhouses in the Thunder territory. In the later stages, the power of lightning could not even be seen. Just like that, they were exhausted to death by the much weaker cultivators!In the end, he died a terrible death!At this moment, the aura of the Lord of calamity was spreading from there. They were worried that they could not match him, so they rushed over. As for Li Hao, he looked around the chaos and smiled.""Go, take advantage of the fact that those seventh-grade cultivators have left and devour all their worlds. There are dozens of worlds! Lingyue, go and take all the people. Black Panther, go and devour the entire world. Second cat, go and devour all the life force ..."At this moment, long Zhan's expression changed slightly!Li Hao smiled."Senior long Zhan, I'm worried that tianfang will descend and cover the surrounding world. He'll devour everything and recover himself!" That would be helping the enemy ..."Long Zhan's expression was slightly ugly!There were dozens of rank 7 worlds all around, and the rank 7 Lords had all run away. Even if there were still some left, there would only be a few of them. Could they stop this group of people who were like wolves and tigers?Li Hao ... Was going to devour these worlds!Bastard!This was the territory of the four regions. Long Zhan's eyes were slightly ugly. Very quickly, he said in a low voice,""You guys go too!"At this moment, the battle was almost over. Wu Xing and the others didn't dare to continue fighting. They took the remaining experts and retreated back to Tian Fang. There were only seven rank 8s and more than ten rank 7s left.They had lost almost half of their manpower, and their strength had been reduced by more than half.At this time, long Zhan knew that he was unable to stop it and could only choose to converge.Your people will devour it, and my people will do the same ...They were not done yet. On the other side of neo martial, a group of people did not wait for the human King to speak at all. They fled madly to the great world over there!A free world!He wanted it!Dao Qi and the others seemed to be a little embarrassed at first ... But when they saw the people of neo martial arts running so fast, they instantly became anxious and ran in that direction one by one.It's ours!Li Hao revealed a smile and looked at long Zhan. Long Zhan's face was sullen and he did not speak, because around them ... There were still some worlds of the chaos race. He frowned and said in a deep voice,""You can do whatever you want with the human world. My Primal Chaos race still needs a stable home. Haoyue, don't go too far!""Of course!"Li Hao smiled."Everyone, do not invade the territory of the chaos race!"Li Hao's voice spread out, and he laughed."Without a high-level being in charge, the territory of the chaos race might not be ... Devoured!"Long Zhan narrowed his eyes and looked at Li Hao.Slightly frowning, he said in a low voice,"the Heaven's Will and the calamity will return ... Haoyue, at this moment, what do you want to do?" Li Hao wanted the experts of the chaos race to return to their homeland so that they wouldn't be devoured.Obviously, he didn't want his people to get a share.This was a little too much!Li Hao chuckled,'how much did I pay? Senior long Zhan, do you know that my time is about to be obliterated!"Li Hao's smile was a little gloomy."I've paid such a huge price. I'm only absorbing a little world and recovering some blood. Why do you have to fight with me, senior?" It's senior ... Who made me feel uncomfortable. Since that's the case, senior should also feel a little uncomfortable!"Long Zhan was speechless!Li Hao continued, in addition, senior, you still owe me a clone and ten billion great Dao crystals! The few rank seven venerable sovereigns you killed, venerable sovereign Tian Fang's corpses are all mine! It's time to pay off the debt of the senior ..."Feng Yan and the others were furious!In other words, they did not gain anything from the battle. Everything was taken away by Li Hao and the others. The world around them was gone, and so were the spoils of war. Li Hao had even taken the opportunity to kill the death Emperor!As for the life-and-death messenger, they were the ones who had been pestering him until now, and even wanted to kill him ... Li Hao had come to take advantage of it!"Li Hao, you've gone too far!" Feng Yan said angrily.Li Hao smiled and looked at the human King, senior human King, retreat! We'll leave this place to senior long Zhan. The two tier 9 experts are his spoils of war. We won't snatch them! The world was big, and there was nowhere he couldn't go! "In any case, new martial and I, Silver Moon, only have One World. We can just take those few people and wander the chaos ..."The human King crossed his arms and smiled as he recovered.""I still want to see a ninth-rank one ... But since you said so, we're family, so it's fine ..."Long Zhan's eyes changed slightly.If there was only one rank nine clone, he really wasn't afraid. But two ...These two fellows were taking advantage of the situation!At this moment, he finally realized that they were still enemies!Li Hao!This guy was really ruthless!It was not enough to wipe out all the powerhouses in the Thunder region. After killing the Deathbringer, he wanted to seize the rank Seven Worlds and take away the corpse of the rank seven venerable sovereign killed by the chaos race ...On the human King's side, the daosource corpses of the Yin Yang, light and darkness experts belonged to them. The tier 7 experts they had killed also belonged to them.Now, they were also dividing those Grade 7 worlds.With this ...Both sides had obtained enormous benefits! Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  As for the primal Chaos race ... They had nothing.This was also the first time that Li Hao had divided the spoils on the battlefield. Furthermore, it was the first time that he had taken the initiative to ask for and Rob. He had taken almost all the contributions of the chaos!There was no other reason than the enemy!Long Zhan was an Overlord. He had great ambition, a broad heart, and great aspirations ... But an enemy was an enemy. Cooperating now did not mean that they would cooperate in the future!

Chapter 3615 Face To Face (3)
 How could Li Hao give him the chance to continue strengthening himself?Long Zhan clearly had some confidence to deal with a tier 9. If he did not exploit him now, was he going to wait until after the battle to wrangle?Forced by the situation, long Zhan would also admit it.As expected, long Zhan took a deep breath. Then I'll write off all the debts I owe you!"Li Hao smiled,"sure!" Although it might not be enough ... After all, they're just a few seventh-rank corpses, but it's about enough. I'm not someone who haggles over every little thing. "Long Zhan did not utter a word.His expression was a little ugly.Li Hao ... Was a little difficult to deal with.After this battle, if he could easily deal with the ninth-rank clone, perhaps ... He would have to think of a way to get rid of Li Hao. Of course, there might not be a chance, and ... He might need Li Hao to hold back some other experts.He was raising a Tiger to bring disaster!However, he had no choice.On one side was a group of level 9s, and on the other side was Li Hao, who could not cause him any danger of death yet. Even though he knew that Li Hao had great potential, he could only pinch his nose and accept it!As for the human ruler, he didn't say much. He threw all the light emissaries 'Dao origin to the light Thearch and Yao yang.He gave the dark power to Lizhu.He didn't say anything. He just looked into the void and asked,""How long more?""Very soon!"Li Hao glanced at it, and something seemed to surface in his eyes. He said,""Three minutes at most ... He still needs some energy to gather ... It's already very fast."He then looked towards the Thunder region. It should be about time.This little bit of time was enough for everyone to clean up the battlefield.That works too!The human King nodded slightly, smiled, and looked at Li Hao.""There's still some time. Let me ask you something. What was that thing just now?""A person from the future.""I know, but ... It seems a little special. It seems to be related to our old Yang ..."On the side, sun god was a little awkward!What the hell are you saying?Li Hao nodded. He glanced at sun god and sighed.""I didn't expect this!"The sun god might have received guidance from that future person back then.The world near neo martial was probably a world in the future. That person might have reversed time and entered this era, but it was not now. If it was now, that person should be clear.Obviously, it might be later.As for the sun god, he must have learned the divine text technique from there. However, in this era, there was not enough spirit, so his divine text seemed a little weak and turbid. However, it was indeed true divine text!As for himself, he had learned the divine text technique from Silvermoon's star suppression technique. It was interesting! He didn't ask or say much.There were some things that were meaningless to ask. Sun god might not tell her. Besides, even if he told her, it would not matter.At this moment, the sun god indeed did not say anything.However, his memory was a little hazy ... When he looked at Li Hao again, his expression was a little strange. Emperor Yu had been summoned by Li Hao, and Li Hao's relationship with him was obviously not ordinary!The other party came from the future, but in fact, he was half a master of sun god!Yes, he was half a master.In that era, when new martial arts had just been introduced and the origin had not yet emerged, people like the sun god, the celestial Emperor, and the king of earth were all ignorant existences. The celestial Emperor had been favored by the seed, and the seed ... The world's consciousness, the Heaven's Will, this kind of existence, knew everything!However, the celestial Thearch was in fact inferior to the sun god. Why?That was because ... The sun god had his own opportunities!He always liked to run around, wander, and be carefree ... Therefore, he had some opportunities that outsiders didn't know about. That was how he came to have the Yang God, who was even more powerful than the celestial Thearch at his peak!However, he had always been curious. That person ... Where did he come from and where did he go?The moment new martial walked out of the world, he went to look for him, but he couldn't find anything. Even if he went to the world that accommodated the sword venerable and the others, he didn't see that person!Until today, he finally knew!They were ... People from the future!And today, he found out that the old fellow that the man had mentioned might be the Li Hao in front of him. It was a joke.In his eyes, Li Hao was just a kid.In Emperor Yu's eyes, Li Hao was an old bastard, but in Emperor Yu's eyes, he ... Was perhaps just a little fellow ...It was really ... A mess!Thus, at this moment, he looked at Li Hao with a complicated expression, but he didn't say anything.So, the old undying thing that Emperor Yu was referring to was this ... AI!She didn't know what to say!The river of time had appeared, and his three bodies had combined ... Summoning the past and the future had actually come from Li Hao's river of time. It was ridiculous. It turned out that his path to the peak had begun with Li Hao.At this moment, the human King seemed to have thought of this as well. He didn't ask much, and he didn't care much about this.He looked around and smiled,"what should we do later?" I don't think it's a big problem for old dragon to deal with one ... How about we deal with the other one?"Li Hao shook his head, Tian Fang, even if it's just a clone, he's not to be trifled with! The number one expert in the past was easy to deal with just by having a clone? Senior long Zhan, the reason why you can think of a way to deal with it is because you think that the spirit of chaos might be able to charge the other party to death ..."Long Zhan immediately frowned!However, Li Hao said,"but I think it'll be difficult!" It would be very difficult ... Furthermore, tianfang was still here, and it was still getting stronger! "In fact, it's still very difficult to solve ... So, it's better for neo martial to join forces with them. I'll solve the disaster!""Can you do it?"The human King glanced at him. 5000 great DAOs, and also, time is running out. Are you sure you can do it?

Chapter 3616 Face To Face (3)
On this side, there were only a few grade-8 experts.Even if they devoured the world now, it wouldn't take effect so quickly. They would become stronger in an instant. A group of people might not be able to deal with a ninth-rank clone, right?On their side, there were many experts. Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  Long Zhan, himself, old Zhang, sun god ...Even old Zhang and sun God's great DAOs were close to 5000. They might be weaker than Li Hao, but not by a large margin. You're the strongest!Even if long Zhan was very unhappy with Li Hao right now, he had no choice but to speak up and said in a deep voice,""There's no need for that. I can deal with Tian Fang by myself. You'd better join forces to deal with the Tribulation! Otherwise ... Once you're defeated, it'll be a great danger to us!"There was no need to be a hero at this moment!Everyone knew how strong the other party was.Unless the person from the future descended directly, there was still hope for him to deal with the ninth-rank clone. However, Li Hao's time limit was not enough for the person to appear. It was almost impossible for the person to descend.That person might have strength close to long Zhan 's."No need, I have my ways ... Of course, whoever kills it will get it! Even if it's a ninth-rank clone, it's still very impressive and is an incomparably huge wealth. Senior human King, be careful that senior long Zhan doesn't fall out ..."The human King laughed, and his laughter was filled with hidden meaning. "It's good to fall out with him, but I don't think so. Why would an Overlord like me care about such a small profit?"The three of them seemed to be confident that they could win, that the two grade-9 experts were just going to be sent to their deaths!At this moment, the others were feeling uneasy.Ninth-rank!You guys ... Really don't need to prepare?For example, let everyone gather quickly, then surround and kill them ... At least there should be a strategy or something, right?In the end ... We're just listening to you guys split the loot!He spoke as if the two tier 9 experts were nothing. Wasn't he too confident?Long Zhan was not in the mood to say anything more to them.He was not in the mood to argue with the human King. This guy was invincible with his words. When he fought with the messenger of light and dark, the two of them were almost scolded to tears by him. He cursed them and their ancestors for eighteen generations!It was really a headache to argue with such a person. These overlords had some manners, but they couldn't stand the shamelessness of the human King.At this moment, he was still extremely solemn.As for Li Hao, he didn't say much and directly flew toward the Thunder region.The human King wanted to say something, but when he saw him running away, he shrugged his shoulders. 'Forget it, I don't care anymore. This guy is very arrogant, even more arrogant than me. If he dares to go and doesn't have the confidence, then he'll just die.'At this moment, the Supreme martial artist frowned slightly and looked at the human King.It was still quite dangerous!They had never fought a level nine before, so they didn't know the details. Now that Li Hao's power of time had been exhausted ... Could he fight with the opponent with his 5000 Dao laws?Even if he had some schemes, they might not be of any use! ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶With the river of time, Li Hao moved quickly.On normal days, they would have to fly for a long time, but at this moment, they arrived at the Thunder region almost instantly. At this moment, there were still people cleaning up the battlefield in the Thunder region. They were all very excited to see Li Hao.However, they also felt some of the energy fluctuations in the lightning territory, which made them a little uneasy.Li Hao did not say anything. He threw a compressed star to Lin Hongyu. "Let's see if you can absorb the daosource power of the Deathbringer!"Lin Hongyu did not say anything.That was because ... There was no need to say it. A lot of things had actually been projected just now. She had actually seen Li Hao turn hostile and kill Deathbringer.He also knew why he had turned against him and killed him.At this moment, there was no need to say anything more.She sat down cross-legged and began to absorb the aura of death. Although the power of a rank eight was extremely uncomfortable and almost on the verge of collapse, she didn't make a sound and just silently absorbed the suffocating aura of death.Li Hao, on the other hand, looked around in silence.After a while, the cultivators returned one by one, all of them somewhat excited.Almost all the powerful worlds in the four-sided domain had been wiped out today!Large numbers of rank 7 worlds were either devoured or compressed by them ...There were also some Level 7 corpses from Tian Fang, as well as the level 8 and Level 7 corpses from the lightning territory ... The harvest this time was incomparably huge!However, at this moment, Dao Qi was a little apprehensive. He looked into the distance and felt uneasy."The master of tianfang ... Might be coming soon, and over here ..."The Lord of calamity seemed to be the same!We ... We're not going to be robbed, are we? He really didn't dare to hit Tian Fang.However, the robbery ... Why didn't neo martial come?He was also a little nervous. He had met the Lord of calamity before. At this moment, he quickly said,"The Lord of calamity was very powerful. He wasn't a weakling among the grade-9 cultivators of the past. In that era, he controlled the Dao of calamity and punished cultivators who made mistakes ... Countless people in the chaos feared him!""The lightning tribulation is only one of the reasons ..."Li Hao nodded slightly. He knew.They had fought a million years ago, but that was in the past.He wasn't sure what the current catastrophe was.At this moment, the aura in the surroundings was getting stronger and stronger. The Thunder monarch could not help but say,""Can you interrupt his return journey?"He was also a little afraid of this!Li Hao shook his head."Their spirituality leaked out, and a large number of powerhouses died. Moreover, what leaked out was the power of calamity and the power of heaven. These level 9s were prepared for this. They even had rules!" Thus, he and Tian Fang can descend. You don't even know where their true bodies are, so how can you interrupt their descent?"

Chapter 3617 Face To Face (3)
It can't be interrupted!Unless he counterattacked, he would be courting death. His clone could still fight, but his true body ... Would he be courting death?At this moment, Kong Ji said seriously as he absorbed the power of the great DAOs,""Then we ... Probably can't beat them, right?"Li Hao nodded.Of course!A ninth-rank clone, even if it did not have 9000 great Dao, it had at least 8000 or more. It was definitely no match for him!Everyone was instantly speechless!Then why are you still so calm?Ëâπ!Are you going crazy again? "Using time ... To suppress him?""Shi Guang, I don't think we'll be able to use it anymore. I've overexerted myself too much ..."Everyone was anxious!Then how are you going to fight?Lying down and fighting?Even if we work together, we're no match for them!Li Hao smiled and looked around."That's why I need your help!""Fusion?"At this moment, they recalled Li Hao's previous method of dealing with Samsara. Now that they were stronger, Li Hao included. Last time, they could kill Samsara with the fusion, so this time ... They should be able to kill the avatar of calamity, right?Second cat's face was filled with despair!"Last time, I didn't even merge with a rank eight. Now, do you want me to replicate a rank eight?What a joke!It hasn't reached level eight yet. Just now, Li Hao had it devour the world origin of many worlds, and it showed signs of advancing to level eight. Could it be that ... It had calculated until now to let me reach level eight and quickly replicate the great Dao?And then, fusion?But ... Would he make it in time?It had already sensed a powerful aura. It was very terrifying and was about to descend. Even if it were to enter the eighth-rank immediately, it would be too late!It could not help but ask,'are you going to speed up time for me? If you want it, then ... Hurry up!"It was somewhat indignant!Forget it, let's just leave it at that!He couldn't just watch everyone get killed, right?'I'm not a big cat. Big cats are the cruel ones. I'm a good cat. Forget it, forget it. I'll just ... Suffer a little. '"It's too late!"Li Hao shook his head.Second cat was stunned. What?Wasn't it a fusion?"This time, it's not a fusion ..."Li Hao looked at the void. A flash of light passed by, as if it had crossed thousands of miles. Someone ... Was about to wake up!In the distance.Tian Fang!A heaven-shaking aura rippled through heaven and earth, even illuminating the entire four-sided domain. A boundlessly powerful aura was madly spreading out, extracting the power of countless great DAOs and the power of Chaos.The whole world seemed to be shrouded by something, and the pressure was boundless!A figure was not tall, but at this moment, it seemed to be reflected in everyone's mind and heart. It was a cultivator who looked rather young.He was elegant and graceful.He seemed to be Walking in the Air with a sense of mystery, as if he was taking a leisurely stroll in a courtyard, and he appeared above a statue.All the cultivators and five-element emissaries who were still alive were extremely excited."Daoist master!""Venerable!""My Lord has arrived!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe rest of the cultivators were ecstatic!The master of the sky had arrived. He was an invincible existence who had once swept across the world in the past. He was truly an invincible existence and the strongest expert in history. He was the master of the sky, the master of the space path!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Tianfang world.The statue above the huge Palace seemed to be coming back to life. Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  The master of Tian Fang's face gradually became clear. He looked around with a sigh and sighed."Things remain the same, but people have changed, and the sea has turned into fields ..."A million years!The familiar chaos was no longer familiar.The people he was familiar with would either die or seal their true bodies in that place with him.A million years was too far away.Even he felt that time was merciless and that it was too far away.At this moment, he looked at the crowd and saw that many people were missing. He knew that if these people didn't die, he wouldn't be able to return quickly. He could only wait for tianfang to expand. In fact, he didn't want to return as a dead person.He hoped that he could take it slow.However, the reality was ... At this moment, he could only activate his backup plan.Outside.Be it the human King or long Zhan, both of them were extremely fearful at this moment. That powerful aura and powerful pressure made even them feel a little uncomfortable.Even the savage human King was not as Savage as before.His eyes kept changing.With different thoughts, he transmitted a message to the Supreme martial artist,'if you can win, then fight. If you can't win ... Then run! Let the Dragon War temple back, this guy's skin was so thick that he could take a beating! It's at least close to 9000, and I've even ... Reached that level!"He was a little afraid.He was too strong!He might be extremely powerful now, close to 7000 Dao laws, and his explosive power might even be stronger. However, at this level, he was still short of 1000 to 2000 Dao laws, or even Dao laws with spirituality ... He was definitely no match for them!And this was only his clone. If his true body were to descend, the human King suspected that he would be killed by a single punch.Was he that strong?Such a huge transformation at the ninth rank?He came to a sudden realization. It wasn't that the transformation was great, but ... It was orderly!For example, the person from the future only had around 5000 Dao laws, so why was he so strong?That was because his Dao was orderly!It was extremely orderly and orderly!It was the same for the grade-9 cultivators in front of them. Even if they weren't as orderly as they would be in the future, their 8000 Dao laws could be used as 9000 Dao laws for a grade-8 cultivator. At the same time, their 7000 Dao laws would be more powerful than theirs in the lawless lands!This was the difficulty of a tier 9!And at this moment, long Zhan's gaze changed as well. He transmitted a message to the chaos race,""If the situation doesn't look right, run immediately and follow the human King. Don't get too close, I'll cover the rear ..."

Chapter 3618 Face-To-Face (1)
Yes, he was prepared!Counting on the human King and the others to cover their retreat?Then I'll just die!He could only do it himself.At this moment, he was also worried.This Tian Fang ... Might be even stronger than he had expected. He ... Might not be able to deal with him.He glanced at Hong Yue and sent a voice transmission, Hong Yue ... You're the key to success! The Dao of desire is definitely not weak. Li Hao was able to use it to kill Samsara. Since you major in desire, you can do the same ... Besides, you have my cooperation! If you don't make any contributions this time, do you think you can escape Li Hao's pursuit in this life? Escape from the human King's pursuit?"Red Moon sovereign's expression changed!Can I?It was impossible!In today's battle, neo martial and silver moon's strength had left him in despair. Forget about fighting back, even if he were to hide, these people could easily capture him, or even capture him and kill him!It was too terrifying!It was just ... Tian Fang!'An invincible existence, even if it's just a clone, can I ... Really do it?"You can do it. All living beings have desires, especially him. He's been dormant for millions of years, so his desires are unimaginably strong. As long as you can interfere for a moment ... We have a chance of success!"Red Moon sovereign was extremely nervous. However, when he thought of his enemies, the human King, the Supreme Being, the sun god, and the Silver Moon King ...This large group of people!If he didn't fight this time, even long Zhan might not protect him anymore. He would still die. He gritted his teeth, and a fierce look appeared in his eyes."I ... Am prepared. It's just that the Dragon Lord agreed in advance ...""I'll definitely fulfill my promise. I ... Still want to establish myself in the chaos. Even the shameless human King and the others won't go back on their words to outsiders! You look at light, Dao Qi, and the rest. Could it be that I, long Zhan, am not as good as them in character?"That's right!Red Moon master believed him. Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  It was not that long Zhan's character was better, but that the group of people with bad character like the human King would not go back on their words in front of the experts of the chaos. Moreover, long Zhan was an expert who was determined to overthrow the experts and establish a great unification.He would not go back on his word!Compared to the human King and Li Hao, long Zhan's character, in Red moon's view ... Should be better.At this moment, the master of tianfang world was not in a hurry to walk out. Instead, he looked in the direction of the Thunder region and smiled. His voice was calm and had a hint of regret."Are you going to return to the Tribulation?"Although everyone's true bodies were together, only he and calamity had the right to return to the primordial chaos.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the distance.Thunder region.An aura of tribulation covered the heavens and the earth. The entire lightning territory seemed to come alive.In the surroundings, the sky shattered, the sky collapsed, the earth caved in, flames burned, and the aura of plague ran rampant ...A figure gradually appeared and said with a laughing voice,""Brother Tian Fang, I didn't expect this either. I just didn't expect ... That all the people who returned to our world would be killed ..."He looked a little regretful, but also not so regretful.If he died, he died.If they don't die, I might not be able to return.Although it was only a clone, it was enough. As long as the clone could complete some of the plans, his true body would return. It was only a matter of time.The two of them conversed as if they were ignoring all the experts in the world.They were the only ones in the world!That was because they were at the ninth step.At grade-9, even if there were only 7000 to 8000 Dao laws, it was enough to kill any powerful enemy. Even if the other party had 8999 Dao laws and had not reached grade-9, their 7000 to 8000 Dao laws were comparable to this group of top-notch existences.At this stage, he could jump levels?What a joke! A level 7 could kill a level 8, but a level 8 killing a level 9 had never happened before. A level 9 clone was invincible!They exchanged some pleasantries.The figure that gradually appeared looked at Li Hao in the distance and smiled. He was emotional, angry, and emotional."A million years ago, I once fought with you ... Even though it was only a few memories and I didn't really experience much, I know that time is difficult to deal with!""But today ... How much more time do you have left?"He laughed, and as he laughed, he was slightly annoyed."Li Hao, can't you just be a time cultivator? You just have to cause trouble and kill people. You ... Do you like killing so much?"Don't worry, as a time cultivator, everyone will still support you in reaching the ninth step.But, why didn't you listen?He even wanted to reverse time and return to the past. After offending everyone, he still wanted to split open the heavens and earth and open up the chaos great Dao. This was destroying his future. He also wanted to reverse time and break open the origin of the chaos great Dao ... This could only be said to be completely crazy!If he wasn't crazy, he wouldn't provoke the type 9 realm again and again, completely putting himself on the opposite side of the type 9 realm.In the past, Tian Fang might not have allowed me to kill him.But now ... Tian Fang would not stop him.This was because Li Hao had touched the bottom line of the ninth-rank, which meant that he was cutting off his own path!Three generations?Calamity thought about it and laughed. Three generations ... If it could be someone else, why couldn't it be me? why couldn't it be one of my people?Even if I can't wield it ... It's fine for me to use it as a reference and comprehend it. I'll find a suitable person to become one of my men.Shi Guang was truly detestable!Countless streams of Primal Chaos energy madly surged toward him, and even large amounts of Primal Chaos energy from the primal Chaos great Dao surged toward him. Even the rank nine had been fused into the primal Chaos great Dao.The chaos great Dao was also the source of their power!On the other side, Li Hao didn't move at all, as if he had been scared silly!The Lord of calamity frowned slightly.He wasn't in the boundary at the moment, but Li Hao didn't attack or stop him from completely recovering his strength. Instead, he was watching. What are you watching?Over there, long Zhan, Ren Wang, and the others 'auras had already exploded to the extreme and were currently resisting Tian Fang.But on Li Hao's side, the others were extremely nervous, and their auras exploded. Only Li Hao remained calm.Why ... Was he so calm?The Tribulation was incomprehensible!He wasn't the only one. Everyone was confused.p "Why ... Didn't you stop me?" calamity asked in a low voice.At this moment, Li Hao said with a serious face,""If we stop senior, wouldn't we be unable to let senior recover to his peak? If it's not a peak clone of calamity, then it's only comparable to some level 8 ones. Only a peak clone of calamity ... Can really bring great gains!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThis is crazy!The Lord of calamity was stunned. Are you crazy?You ... Just for this?How confident are you that you can kill me? that's why you let me recover, let me become stronger, and then kill me to obtain the greatest benefits!"Hahaha ... Interesting, interesting, too interesting. Li Hao, you're an interesting person!"The Lord of calamity's laughter resounded through the world.You're ... Really interesting!Can you really kill me?I don't believe it!No one would believe it ... Except you.[PS: this is the end of the update. I'm thinking about how to kill him. Yes, that's right. I haven't thought about it yet. Everyone, you can come up with a plan. I'm already a cripple!] "In addition, after 12 o' clock, everyone will give me double monthly votes. Thank you!

Chapter 3619 Breaking The Tribulation (1)
The Lord of calamity's avatar descended.At this moment, it was still absorbing the energy around it to strengthen itself.He was getting stronger and stronger!Li Hao was just watching, as if he was waiting for something.Wait for him to reach the peak and walk to the strongest!He was so Savage that everyone thought he had gone mad. At this moment, he was unable to fully fuse with everyone. His time energy had been used up, and the primal Chaos tribulation lightning was no longer extracting energy.The Lord of calamity had made such a mistake once, and he would not make the same mistake twice.Under such circumstances ... Thunderlord and the others were all feeling uneasy.As the Lord of calamity grew stronger, they were unable to resist this expert.Tian Fang's side.The confrontation of auras had already reached its peak, and the pressure was overwhelming. Human King and long Zhan had already begun to erupt and were fighting against Tian Fang. As for Li Hao's side, if Li Hao didn't make a move, no one could make a move either ...All of a sudden, they could only watch helplessly as the other party grew stronger and stronger. Some people were already unable to stand.The Lord of calamity didn't say anything.It's better if you sit by and do nothing. No matter what Li Hao's plans are, as long as I'm stronger, all plans will be in vain. No one can scheme against an invincible existence at the ninth step.Li Hao was still watching.Ninth-rank!This was the first time he had seen a living one.Even if it was just a clone.The most crucial part of a level nine Dao was its spirituality. The opponent's spirituality was sufficient, so this also caused the opponent's Dao to develop towards a law. Once a level nine Dao did not have enough spirituality ... Then a level nine Dao would be no different from a level eight Dao.‚Äã 7,000 to 8000 Dao laws were still 7000 to 8000 Dao laws.Dealing with a ninth-rank was different from dealing with a seventh-rank or eighth-rank.The Dao of a level Seven or eight cultivator was disorderly and without a spirit. One was one, not two. Once a level nine cultivator's Dao lost its spirit, everyone present could besiege and kill him.The power of the Tribulation was inferior to Tian Fang 's.Tian Fang might be able to send a clone of 8999 Dao laws, but the Tribulation could send at most 8000 Dao laws. However, because it had spirituality, even huntian might not be able to defeat it.This was the confidence of these tier 9 experts!Tier 9 was a huge change.However, as long as the other party's Dao lost its spirituality, the so-called 'unkillable' would be a joke.This was the foundation!At this moment, Li Hao looked at the void. The countless great DAOs, the great DAOs related to the catastrophe, all seemed to have some spirituality, making them more active and powerful.As long as he could get rid of these spiritual beings ... The Tribulation would be nothing to fear!BOOM!A loud sound rang out.It wasn't from Li Hao's side, but from a distance away, the master of Tian Fang made his move.With a casual strike, it was as if the heavens and earth had collapsed.The art of large space had cut through the world!Not only that, the human King and the others seemed to have been instantly cut apart into countless spaces that couldn't be broken. They allowed the human King's saber Qi to rush into the heavens and earth, allowing the Dragon battle Golden Dragon to collide with them! Even if it was just a clone of the master of tianfang, it was still ridiculously powerful.It was as if he didn't care about the siege of this group of people.No matter how many people there were, so what?At his level, it was actually the same whether there were more people or less.The Dao of space was one of the most powerful DAOs in the primordial chaos. Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  With a wave of his hand, it was as if a world had appeared.The world in his eyes!At this moment, it was as if many worlds had been born in the four-sided region. They enveloped the human King and the others, suppressing them.The great Dao had a spirit!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.At the edge of the square.Outside the Thunder region.At this moment, two figures appeared. Huntian had arrived. Not only huntian, but the black figure that had been following him had also arrived. The two of them looked into the distance at the projection that was still there.At this moment, there was complete silence.Ninth-rank!This was the ninth step.In huntian's eyes, the human King's projection into heaven and earth wasn't just to pretend, but to ... Let everyone see clearly, or perhaps to let them see clearly how strong a level nine was!Perhaps he wanted to tell everyone ... That even if they died in battle, he wanted to let others see something and know the power of a ninth-rank.The human King was very great!Huntian didn't think that he was wrong. How could an Overlord like the human King spend such a huge price to project himself into the heavens just for the sake of acting?So ... That was the only way he could think.He wanted to let those who wanted to resist in the chaos see the characteristics of the ninth-rank and everything about them. From there, they would be prepared to resist and risk their lives. As expected of the neo martial human King!"Daoist master ...""Should we help?" the black shadow asked softly.At this moment, there were only two clones. The human King and the others might be able to hold on for a while, but in the Thunder region, the Lord of calamity only had Silver Moon, and he was afraid that it would be difficult to deal with him.The Lord of calamity was still improving, and Li Hao seemed to be unable to stop it. Once a battle broke out, Li Hao might be killed instantly!At that time, it would be difficult.Li Hao had used time to annihilate the experts from the Thunder region and Tian Fang. The two of them had seen it with their own eyes. In the black Shadow's opinion, only they could turn the situation around.And ... It wasn't too stable.Huntian frowned slightly and looked around.""Is venerable Emperor Hao Yue ... Really looking for death?"This was the first reason.Second, he was worried that if he made a move, he would attract more powerhouses and existences, including the other rank nine forces.Calamity, Tian Fang, and the others had brought their people away, so they needed to be revived and returned.
