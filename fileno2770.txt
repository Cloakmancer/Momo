"Giant pincers!"One of the guards was shocked. What was the giant pincer doing?BOOM!The huge pincers crushed another Heavenly King!The huge eyes of the pincers were cold.Last time, Li Hao asked him to practice more claws and the Dao of chaos so that he wouldn't have to worry about the problem of mixed DAOs in the future. Therefore, he began to practice without restraint. Regardless of whether the DAOs were messy or not, at least for now, his strength was growing rapidly.As for the future, if he couldn't sort out his great Dao and become a venerable sovereign ... Li Hao had promised to help him once.This was enough!It was not a problem for him to surpass these people in terms of strength.In an instant, three of the six guards were killed.The remaining three came back to their senses and were both shocked and afraid."You're crazy!""You betrayed the Dragon Temple?"BOOM!A huge spatial explosion sounded, and the pincers struck again, killing the fourth guard. The remaining two guards were shocked and began to fight back, not caring about the dark clouds.The giant pincers had gone crazy and wanted to kill them!p He had to save himself quickly and report to the venerable sovereign, asking the venerable sovereign to kill this man!Huilong temple didn't lack venerable sovereigns. In fact, there were many venerable sovereigns.Moreover, even if the giant pincers escaped and entered the chaos, they would be very slow. Venerable sovereigns could easily catch up with them, and he would be dead."You're courting death by killing us!"One of the guards roared. Even if you escape into the chaos, how far can you, a non-venerable sovereign, go?"The giant pincers turned a deaf ear.Escape?Why did he escape?The huge pincers once again burst out with the brilliant Dao of chaos. It was extremely chaotic. The guard was shocked. This guy was crazy. Not only was he crazy, he didn't even care about the great Dao. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Although it was powerful, it was extremely messy. This fellow could forget about becoming a divine Emperor for the rest of his life!However, the reality was that he didn't have the chance to think too much.It was enough that he was strong now.BOOM!A loud noise was heard again and blood splattered in all directions. The fifth Heavenly King was quickly killed by the giant pincers. At this moment, the last Guard's expression changed drastically and he quickly escaped into the chaos.It was dangerous for anyone who was not a venerable sovereign to enter the boundless chaos.He might get lost.Some of the weaker ones would even instantly sink into darkness upon entering the primal Chaos, unable to see the path ahead.This was also the reason why many non-venerable sovereigns did not dare to enter the chaos by themselves. The Heavenly King quickly entered the chaos. However, in the next moment, in the eyes of the giant pincers, this person stopped in the chaos and did not move at all. It was as if he had fallen into a deathly silence.The giant pincer's heart froze.They all knew that the chaos was dangerous, but they didn't pay much attention to it when they saw the venerable sovereigns walking easily. However, the venerable sovereigns had repeatedly warned them not to enter the chaos unless they were venerable sovereigns. No one dared to disobey their orders.But today, they had seen with their own eyes a Heavenly King who seemed to have lost his sense of direction and life the moment he entered the chaos. It was still terrifying.The giant pincers did not dare to enter the chaos, so they only attacked from a distance.A powerful strike that struck the chaos appeared to be weak.However, the guard did not move at all. He was still torn into pieces by the attack. In an instant, his flesh and blood were melted by chaos. Chaos seemed to be purifying the environment. These messy things were quickly melted away by the entire chaos.It turned into a wisp of Primal Chaos energy and strengthened the entire Primal Chaos.The giant pincer was once again shocked. It didn't dare to look any longer. It quickly turned around and ran in one direction. It had been guarding this place for many years and knew where the core was. The realm gate could be closed ... Of course, the closing of the realm gate was only to prevent the weak from entering. If the true strong wanted to enter, closing it would be useless.He entered a place and quickly activated some things. Soon, the huge door that was originally like a heavenly gate began to slowly close.Outside the door, a large number of dark clouds began to appear.Dark clouds began to gather.The giant pincer did not dare to stay any longer. Just looking at the dark clouds made its heart palpitate.Every time the Silver Moon King made a move, it seemed to draw out this thing ... It was truly puzzling and frightening. Ordinary people didn't see chaos lightning tribulation at all, but it was a common sight for Li Hao.The giant pincer quickly left. According to Li Hao, it had to return to the Dragon Temple. If Li Hao failed to transcend the Tribulation, it would have to call for the silent void Emperor.As for how to determine if he had successfully transcended the Tribulation, Li Hao had also mentioned that as long as the commotion was so great that even the Huilong temple could sense it, it meant that he was fleeing toward the temple. There was nothing wrong with calling for help at this time.……At the same time.Fire element mountain.Venerable sovereign Chi Yun was overjoyed. At this moment, he seemed to feel something different. Not only him, but the other venerable sovereigns also had strange looks in their eyes. At this moment, a true seventh rank venerable sovereign's pressure seemed to appear in the void!In fact, Li Hao was communicating with time.It was drawing out the fire element emissary's power of the past.However, because the power that was drawn out came from the fire element Messenger, in the eyes of others, this was a sign that the Taoist connotation had been strengthened.It was even more real and clearer than before!That was because everything before was fake. Other than the sound of the great Dao, everything else was fake. However, at this moment, even the power and pressure were real.……The inner core of the fire amplification Phantom.Li Hao summoned his past power.The stars of time appeared again, passing through the past, present, and future. Li Hao gradually began to age. Last time, when he borrowed the power of a stage six, it was already difficult for him to bear. However, last time, he was only at stage one, and today, he was at the perfection of stage three.It wasn't much different from the last time.A vast power, the power of fire, appeared in the river, and a Daoist appeared.

2771 Chapter 458
The Daoist seemed to know Li Hao.Perhaps it was because they had met for the second time, or because a familiar Taoist connotation had appeared around Li Hao, but the Daoist just looked at Li Hao silently. He didn't say anything, but his aura was boundless.It was extremely powerful!This was also Li Hao's first time coming into contact with the power of a rank seven venerable sovereign in the truest sense. It was the true power of an advanced venerable sovereign, even though it was extremely illusionary.This was the power of time!Only by mastering the power of time would he have such an opportunity. Otherwise, it would be impossible for the current Li Hao to have the opportunity to see the power of a level Seven venerable sovereign. Unless it was someone from neo martial arts, it might not be a good thing for others to see it.Li Hao's voice was like a great Dao that resounded in the depths of the river."Junior, Silvermoon Li Hao, I borrowed senior's great Dao previously, and today I wish to borrow senior's past strength!"Last time, it was also this person who warned Li Hao that he might have to pay ten times or even a hundred times the amount he borrowed today.The figure seemed to remember those words.He looked at Li Hao with his illusionary eyes, which seemed to be filled with regret.Borrowing the power of the past and the future time and time again, borrowing power that didn't belong to him, he had exceeded his limits ... At this moment, this illusory figure was even thinking,'will I be able to meet this Dao of time cultivator again in the future?'Was Li Hao really the only one who practiced the Dao of time?Was there not a second time cultivator in the past and present?But why ... Had no one ever seen it before?Perhaps they were all like Li Hao, who had cultivated time and exhausted their strength time and time again. Perhaps the other time cultivators were not as good as Li Hao and had not cultivated life and death. Perhaps they had already borrowed more than they could bear and died on the first try.Li Hao had actually died three times.Three deaths and three lives!If he were to include the time when he was struck to death by the lightning tribulation, he would have died four times. That time, he had used time because the Silver Moon had not yet opened and did not attract the chaos lightning tribulation.For other time Dao cultivators, if they did not comprehend life and death, they would die in one try.He would not have so many opportunities to try and borrow power again and again.This Daoist huoyan should be one of the strongest among the seventh-rank Daoist. At this moment, a voice seemed to come from somewhere,""If my memory serves me right, you might owe me a favor ... You might not be able to repay me once, and a second time ... I don't even have any hope.""The Dao of time is without restraint. It exceeds one's own limits time and time again ... Cultivator of the Dao of time, I do not think that your future will be promising."Li Hao slightly frowned and didn't say anything.p Perhaps it was because of the success in the past that he felt that time cultivators were highly regarded by everyone.But today, Daoist Huo Yan told him that he didn't think so.Li Hao didn't speak. He just kept silent.Perhaps ... He was right.'I've borrowed power that exceeds my limits time and time again, and I've even used the power of a rank three to borrow the power of a rank seven ... Just how great of a price will I have to pay in the future? Could he safely pass the Tribulation this time? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  If I can 't, I'll probably die for the fourth time.Even if he could die nine times out of ten ... In such a cycle of life and death, in the end, life and death would all be crippled.Huo Yan was right.Li Hao didn't think that he was wrong, but he still said,""Senior's power of the past has come. It would be a waste to retreat now. Why don't we take a gamble? Since senior is willing to come and accept the summoning ... Then I'll try my best to stay alive before I see senior!"He's already here!If he didn't want to borrow power, he wouldn't have come. If he came, it meant that at a certain point in time, this expert had transmitted his power over."That's true ... Every cultivator is a gambler!"Daoist huoyan seemed to be laughing as well.Yes, he had already come. He said that he didn't think Li Hao's future would be promising, but ... If he really didn't want to, why did he come?Wasn't it just a gamble?He was betting on the future of this time Dao cultivator.As long as he won the bet, he would earn.If he lost the bet, he would still be alive in the future. At most, he would be injured at that time, but he would not die anyway, right?At this moment, a powerful fire element power entered Li Hao's body.At the last moment, Daoist huoyan's voice echoed in Li Hao's mind."I don't cultivate karma, so I don't know how much karma you've suffered. However, I know that even life and death can't avoid karma ... It seems that cultivating life and death is useless for you! "If this goes on, you will encounter an unprecedented crisis sooner or later, and you will no longer be able to borrow any power. Your karma is too great. True powerhouses might be able to sense it and will no longer be willing to lend you power!"It wasn't that Li Hao couldn't borrow it, but if he borrowed the strength of an expert next time, the expert might not be willing to take the chance again if he discovered that he was bearing too much.There was no need!This was because the strong might think that Li Hao was dead for sure and that there was no future. In that case, why did they lend him strength?Li Hao was shocked!Can't you borrow power?This time, even Daoist firesyan felt a little unwilling. The next time ... Might really be difficult.However, he still wanted to borrow it again to kill Hui long and the others.Perhaps, he could only find the one in the Coiling Dragon Well.Because they had invested!It would be a huge loss if he could not get back what he had invested once. He could only grit his teeth and invest a second time ... The Dragon Daoist at the Coiling Dragon Well might be willing to lend him power a second time.

2772 Chapter 458
This thought flashed through his mind.Li Hao didn't have time to think about it!At this moment, he felt like his body was exploding. His Tier 3 grand completion physical body actually felt like it was being burned to ashes.A vast power beyond Li Hao's imagination was rising in his body.……At the same time.The entire tianfang world seemed to tremble slightly.In the sky, it was as if billions of stars had appeared.At this moment, countless people looked up at the sky. Even venerable sovereign Chi Yun was stunned. His eyes were filled with shock and disbelief.Behind him, the venerable sovereigns couldn't care less about the constantly increasing fire elemental power.All of them looked up at the sky in shock. A universe seemed to have appeared in the sky.Billions of stars flickered, but they were all very far away. Among them, there was a fire-elemental star that seemed to be flashing with an intense flame light. Beside it, there was a smaller water-elemental star that was also flashing.It was the water element that Li Hao had activated last time.……Dark Demon Ridge.The path chess pieces appeared, and a person was comprehending the path in the path chess pieces.At this time, the artifact Spirit was observing. Suddenly, the artifact Spirit raised its head, as if it had seen through something, and muttered,""You're courting death!"He was really courting death!Did that fellow make use of time again?He even borrowed the power of fire!A seventh rank venerable sovereign!A Dao of time cultivator could not be so reckless. If this went on, he would be killed sooner or later.'That kid looks so refined, but he's completely crazy. Next time, he won't come to me to borrow the power of an eighth-rank dark emissary, right?'If that was the case ... He would be dead for sure without even borrowing it.A rank eight Primal Chaos lightning tribulation was not something he could take."Borrowing power from external sources to strengthen yourself and instantly become a top-tier expert. Is that kind of desire difficult to restrain?"The mysterious man thought to himself.Perhaps Li Hao was addicted?This was because the sudden surge in power could make him lose himself and feel that he was omnipotent. This situation was very common. For example, the sudden increase in power of Silver Moon and the other super cultivators could easily make them lose their minds.I'm invincible!The mysterious man sighed and felt a little regretful. If this man couldn't control his desire, he would die sooner or later.What a pity!It was rare to see a time Dao cultivator.Unfortunately, due to the unique abilities of time Dao cultivators, borrowing power was often the beginning of an early death. The chaosverse had never had a true daolord of time.Shi Guang, didn't the other powerful beings know about this?However, even if there were people who were lucky enough to cultivate time, they would end up like Li Hao. They would exceed their own strength time and time again, and in the end, they would die by his hands.Shaking his head, the mysterious man didn't say anything more.He just silently looked at Kong Ji. The person in front of him was actually not bad.He was only a fifth rank venerable sovereign, but in such a short time, he had already crossed 3000 squares and was still moving forward. It was quite easy. The fifth rank venerable sovereign last time had almost killed him by crossing 1000 squares.Compared to this person, he was really trash. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The time Dao's cultivators had pretty good judgment. The person they had introduced was not bad. Previously, the other party had not been able to enter the second stage. Perhaps it was because he was in a deep sleep and did not realize it. Otherwise, this person should have been qualified to enter the second stage and play chess once.The mysterious man didn't care about that side anymore.The mysterious man couldn't care less about Li Hao's choice. It was difficult for such a person to listen to other people's opinions. Whether or not he could wake up was up to his own choice. Who wasn't a peerless talent among those who could cultivate time?In the end, however, the chaosverse still didn't have the Dao Lord of Time!……In the fire element mountain.Li Hao felt that his strength had reached its limit.At this moment, he felt that he was omnipotent and invincible. That surging power made him feel that even if the neo martial King was here, he could kill him ... Perhaps it was just an illusion.Borrowing power ... The power that appeared out of thin air made him a little dazed.He was too strong!At this moment, some violent thoughts even appeared in the depths of his mind. The fire element was violent to begin with.He was even somewhat disturbed by the fire elemental power of the past.In his heart, a sense of brutal violence suddenly rose."I'm very strong, I'm omnipotent, I can kill anyone I want. I can even borrow the power of the Lord of Tian Fang, a rank 9, to kill all my enemies!She seemed to hear something."Lord Marquis!"It was Qian Wuliang's anxious voice. Li Hao had borrowed strength from Qian Wuliang, but he didn't move at all. The fire element in his body was so violent that Qian Wuliang had to take the risk to call for Li Hao.With the power of the great Dao shaking his heart, he was a little uneasy.When Li Hao opened his eyes, Qian Wuliang instantly felt brutal, crazy, and murderous.He was shocked!Li Hao had never been like this. If there was one, it was the one time when he killed Ying Hongyue. He was extremely brutal, but usually, no matter how dangerous it was or how difficult it was, Li Hao never felt so brutal.Of course, there was also one time when he failed to resuscitate someone. At that time, he was also so brutal.This was the third time Qian Wuliang had seen Li Hao being so brutal.He had killed Ying Hongyue once and failed to resurrect someone once. And today, for no reason at all, a third time had appeared!His heart trembled!Li Hao, is there a problem?"Lord Marquis! "Professor Yuan is still wandering in tianfang world, Governor Lin is taking the risk to contact Neo martial, and Silvermoon world is still in senior second cat's body, wandering around tianfang ..."

2773 Chapter 458
Qian Wuliang was so scared that he couldn't even care about the experts outside.Li Hao can't lose control!He understood the human heart. Therefore, he was taking a risk and constantly reminding Li Hao.The brutal look in Li Hao's eyes gradually disappeared.He looked at Qian Wuliang but didn't say anything.At this moment, Li Hao felt danger for the first time. He was in danger of losing control!"I was almost affected by the power of the seventh step to the point of losing control.It wasn't so obvious the last time he used the sixth-tier water element power. The water element wasn't so violent to begin with, but this time, it was extremely obvious."If I borrow the power of a grade 8 ... I don't know if I can handle it, but I'll definitely lose control!"Such a thought emerged in his mind.Moreover, he couldn't rashly lend out a grade seven spirit weapon anymore. Otherwise, he might end up in an unpredictable situation.Flowing time ...At this moment, Li Hao had some thoughts in his mind. Time was not only a huge challenge for his enemies, but also for himself. That kind of omnipotent control was too easy to lose!At this moment, he could feel Daoist Chi Yun's shock and hesitation.Li Hao raised his head and saw it, too.There seemed to be some illusory great Dao universe!Tian Fang's great Dao universe was stimulated once again. According to the Dao chess, the Tian Fang great Dao universe had always existed. It was just that its power had been drained. Without the power of great DAOs from the same source to supplement it, it had been silent.Today, he had borrowed the fire elemental power of the past to stimulate Tian Fang's great path universe again.Li Hao even saw that two of the billions of stars were particularly bright.One was on Mercury, while the other was on Mars.He didn't look at it again. It wasn't that easy to recover tianfang universe. It didn't have enough power and energy.In an instant, a fire long sword appeared in his hand.In the next moment, he stabbed out with his sword, which contained infinite fire element power.Outside the shadow, Chi Yun, who was still looking at the sky, was shocked. He suddenly lowered his head and looked at the shadow. Suddenly, he saw a fire-type sword appear from the shadow. He was extremely shocked.Advanced venerable sovereign?Daoist huoyan?How was that possible?The other party couldn't be in Tian Fang.What was going on?However, if his Taoist connotation had appeared, why would there be a seventh-grade killer move?He didn't have time to think. At this moment, he also burst out a powerful fire elemental power, which was different from Li Hao 's. It was more illusory and had the characteristics of the cloud universe.The two vast fire-type powers instantly collided and exploded!BOOM!The entire fire element mountain exploded in an instant. Countless fire element power spread out, and some of the low-level venerable sovereigns behind were hit by the two forces.Boom! Boom! Boom!Screams were heard. Some low-ranked venerable sovereigns were directly destroyed by the impact. How could they resist the fusion of the seventh and sixth rank? Among the 16 venerable sovereigns, at least a few of them had died in an instant because they were caught off guard.As for venerable sovereign Scarlet cloud, his face turned pale with fright. Flames appeared on his body. He was a fire-element cultivator, yet he was actually burned by fire-element power. The flames spread and his arm turned black."Huo Yan?"He was incomparably shocked and wanted to escape immediately.He couldn't possibly fight against a seventh-rank.It was useless even if he was a venerable sovereign of a major world. Huo Yan's power came from a ninth-rank major world, which was higher than his.At this moment, a Ring of Fire element power appeared.The word "fire" appeared and turned into a domain, covering the entire Fire Mountain. The entire universe covered all the low-stage venerable sovereigns.​ Chi Yun was startled as he raised his head.In the sky, there was a universe of the great path, and there was also one here ...Two great Dao universes?How was that possible?It was impossible for two Dao universes to appear in tianfang. Dao universes were exclusive to great worlds ... In an instant, he thought of the scene he had seen before and was shocked."You are the Silver Moon King?"He was not Huo Yan, but the Silver Moon King!He was actually here!He had actually become a seventh rank venerable sovereign. This was impossible. Why?Borrowing power?How could he borrow the strength of a person from the past, and it was still at the seventh rank ... As a sixth rank venerable sovereign, he seemed to have understood something, and his face paled again.""The past ... The power of time! Primal Chaos lightning tribulation...You're a time cultivator!"At this moment, he finally understood.However, it was too late.The powerful fire element power covered the entire area. The powerful force shook the low-rank venerable sovereigns that were shrouded in the universe and caused them to fall one by one.One of the venerable sovereigns looked at Li Hao before he died and suddenly screamed,""You are ... Hao Yue ... And also white light?"It was Emperor Yu Chen!He was only at stage one, so he broke down instantly with some regret and despair. I actually didn't recognize him.He was venerable Emperor Hao Yue!'It's also the Silver Moon King, and it's even the White light Emperor I've met before. Damn it, this liar, this lunatic, he actually ran back. 'He also wanted to kill the entire Dragon returning temple's Thearch!"You're right!"Li Hao's face was calm, and he concealed the violence in his eyes. The power of a seventh-rank venerable sovereign was too strong, so strong that these low-rank venerable sovereigns seemed to be easy to kill in his eyes. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  In fact, that was indeed the case.He conjured a fire-type sword and slashed at the low-stage venerable sovereigns. In an instant, a few third-stage venerable sovereigns burst forth and were all killed by his sword. The flames burned and turned them into ashes, and their energy integrated into the great path universe.In the next moment, Li Hao charged at the fleeing Chi Yun!BOOM!Two powerful fire-type forces rapidly erupted. In his shock, venerable sovereign Scarlet cloud also shouted angrily,""You madman, you borrowed the power of the past Daoist huoyan, so you're bound to face the rank 7 chaos lightning tribulation! You're wasting too much energy fighting me right now. Your energy is illusory, and a lot of it will be destroyed. You won't be able to overcome the primal Chaos lightning tribulation, and you'll definitely die!"

2774 Chapter 458
He had sharp eyes, and he had seen Li Hao transcend his tribulation before, so he guessed the result in an instant.At this moment, Li Hao was fighting him. Even if he died, Li Hao would have wasted too much energy and would not have any energy left to transcend the Tribulation.Li Hao didn't say anything.I borrowed power to kill you all. Since I've already borrowed power, why would I still consider transcending the Tribulation?The fire-type sword covered the world.The entire world turned into flames.The flames seemed to have turned into real people, full of spirituality. At this moment, Li Hao had a feeling that the power of a seventh-rank demon beast seemed to be alive. Even its energy seemed to be alive.Creation!,m Li Hao came to a realization that a seventh rank venerable sovereign might have the ability to create life.This was terrifying!Chi Yun tried to escape, but he was enveloped by fire-type power. The powerful force suppressed him until he was constantly burned. He roared madly, and the shadow of a universe appeared above his head. Indistinctly, the power of the great path descended.The great Dao of cloud!At this moment, the great path shook, and he roared,""You madman, if you kill me, the realm Lord will know! You can't escape from this place. No matter how many tricks you have, it's useless. You can't escape from the pursuit of a rank eight venerable sovereign. You've already offended two rank eight venerable sovereigns!"Last time, Red Moon master had wanted to kill him.This lunatic dared to provoke two level eight venerable sovereigns.Li Hao still didn't speak.At this time, a fire Dragon appeared in his hand. The fire Dragon seemed to come to life and roared crazily. With a shrill cry, the sky changed color and the power of fire burst out.Heaven and earth shattered!The indestructible type 9 world was slightly shattered. With a boom, Chi Yun was sent flying, his flesh and blood splattering.The red Cloud continued to escape.At this time, Li Hao once again summoned fire dragons, one after another. In the next moment, these fire dragons turned into fierce Tigers, fierce Tigers of the heart, fire-type Tigers. Li Hao's divine runes had long since been integrated into the power Tiger.As if walking out of Li Hao's heart, he suddenly let out a roar mixed with boundless excitement and madness, like a tiger in the forest!The entire sky seemed to have been shaken by this shrill howl."Roar!" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The giant tiger's roar reverberated through the heavens and earth.As the Tiger's Claw struck down, the flames shook. The red Cloud was like a raggle doll, directly shattering the space. In the great path universe, some low-stage venerable sovereigns who were still alive were also slashed by the Tiger at this moment, and their bodies were shattered one by one.The ferocious Tiger was like a demon in Li Hao's heart.The caged tiger!After walking out of Silver Moon, he seemed to have once again fallen into a cage. At this moment, he did not feel happy at all after borrowing the power of the seventh step, and it was as if he had lost himself.The Tiger in the cage ... If the cage in his heart was broken, the Tiger ... Should be gone.However, the Tiger was still there.He seemed to be imprisoned again!This meant that his cage was still there!"But ... I don't want this to happen either!"Li Hao looked at Chi Yun. He seemed to be talking to him, but also seemed to be not. He revealed a smile, somewhat self-deprecating.'If I don't ... What can I do?'I wanted to discuss Dao in peace, but who gave me this opportunity?I'm ... Imprisoned again.I will always be a prisoner!'I can't borrow a backer, I can't borrow a powerful elder, then I ... Can only overdraft my own future. At least, I still have a future to overdraft, right?'I've never walked out of my cage! On the day I killed li daoheng, I thought I had walked out of it, but ... I didn 't."Kill!"The tiger's roar resounded through the forest. The Tiger was extremely mad, and its roar resounded through the sky!I wanted to break out of the cage, but I broke through the Stargate and walked out. The chaos was an even bigger cage.Who would be willing to give me a chance?Li Hao smiled, but his smile was bleak. Do you think I like being struck by lightning?Do you think I like to owe people favors?But I have no choice.BOOM!At this moment, the huge Tiger was extremely brutal and crazy. It tore the sixth rank venerable sovereign apart with one claw, breaking his great Dao. The entire heaven and earth trembled. At this moment, a sixth rank venerable sovereign of the macro world was completely torn apart by him!The sky seemed to be shaking.A major world off in the distance seemed to be trembling as well, and it was as if a rain of blood was falling.It was a sign that a top venerable sovereign had fallen!……At this moment.This world was like a Fairyland.Suddenly, an extremely young cultivator looked at the sky, and the universe of the great path appeared in his eyes. After a while, he said expressionlessly,""Men, tell Thearch Wushan to go to Tian Fang and tell him that Chi Yun has been killed!"The great Dao shook non-stop.In the outside world, some people were trembling with fear.The Tier 6 chi Yun was killed by someone. Who would be so crazy?This was a provocation to a type 8 world!Was the war about to start?Soon, an incredibly powerful being, filled with rage, shot out of the world and toward Tian Fang. It was a rank seven venerable sovereign!The young cultivator looked at the universe of the great path, at the broken great path, and the shattered Stars. He mumbled,""Seventh-rank fire elemental power ..."How could there be a Grade 7 cultivator in Tian Fang who dared to kill Chi Yun!Which seventh level venerable sovereign dared to kill us cultivators from the cloud sky?That madman, the neo martial human King, was not a fire-element cultivator either. Who did it?Was chaos really going to fall into chaos?Cloudsky might really have to start preparing for battle!……BOOM!At this moment, the entire fire element mountain exploded. The Taoist connotation, which had been preserved for countless years, was completely shattered.Li Hao's face was pale.He looked around and didn't rush to face the chaos lightning tribulation. Instead, he sensed the power in his body and looked at the pale-faced Qian Wuliang. He suddenly said,"If I don't kill people, can I avoid the world?"Qian Wuliang's heart trembled. At this moment, Li Hao seemed to have lost control. He quickly said,"Lord Marquis, this is how the world works. The Silver Moon originated from neo martial ... We have to take on neo martial's enemy!"Li Hao nodded slightly.This was right!'It's not my fault, and I didn't want to cause trouble ... The neo martial King and the others have too many enemies. I can only take the blame. There's no other way. 'The new martial human King ... Was really a troublemaker!

2775 Chapter 459
He could deceive himself and others, or cover his ears and steal the bell.After killing all the people in front of him, the chaos lightning tribulation was coming. At this moment, Li Hao asked Qian Wuliang a question that he knew very well but didn't want to admit.Silver Moon could not get rid of neo martial.That actually wasn't the main point. There was one more thing. Silvermoon's Dao, the core Dao, the Dao of time ... Actually had a huge problem. He had to cultivate the Dao of time, and now, the problem was repeating itself, and he couldn't get rid of it.If he wanted to become stronger, he had to use time.If he wanted to fight against the upper realm, he had to use time.By using time to kill stronger people, one would have to bear greater karma and become stronger. To become stronger, one would need time to borrow power. After borrowing power, in order to bear karma, one would have to become stronger.He wanted to participate in the battle of the great worlds, wanted to get rid of his identity as a Lackey, didn't want to be implicated by neo martial, and didn't want Silver Moon to be oppressed ... Li Hao was thinking too much and desired too much.Under normal circumstances, a small world like silver Moon would be suppressed.He could either abandon the Silvermoon world and let the Crimson Moon take it.How about taking Silver Moon Far Away from the direction of the Crimson Moon region and wandering towards the endless unknown? he would not care about neo martial or Crimson Moon. He would take the world and wander. The further the better. There was still hope of getting rid of the war.Even if the future was unknown, there was still a glimmer of hope that he would not have to participate in this war that involved advanced venerable sovereigns.But Li Hao didn't choose to do so.He had chosen ... To participate in the battle!Battle!In the battle between neo martial and Crimson Moon, he did not choose to be a bystander, nor did he choose to look for neo martial or the world of neo martial, return Silver Moon, and then leave on his own.In fact, if he returned Silver Moon to neo martial, they would accept him.And Li Hao could leave freely.He was alone in the chaos. Where could he not go?But ... Could he just leave it like this?"Or should I learn from the other world Lords and just swallow the Silvermoon world? everyone should die to achieve their own goals. I will gather my power and become a Ranger of chaos. With my power, as long as I don't provoke the strong, I can go anywhere.Who cared about neo martial and chaos?In fact, Li Hao didn't need to worry about neo martial arts. There were countless neo martial artists. There were brave and invincible human Kings, and supreme beings with unparalleled wisdom. They could also kill strong enemies, fight against the upper-level, and even force the red moon to keep shrinking its strength.In fact, neo martial didn't need any support.Li Hao had gone through all this ... All for Silver Moon. He did not wish for Silver Moon to become someone else's accessory, nor did he wish for the world he was born in to be an accessory to neo martial arts.So, he wanted to struggle.An ant that could shake the heavens, overestimating his own strength.The entire world had been born less than a thousand chaos years ago and had been sealed off for more than fifty years. How could such a young, small world attempt to break away from the control of power?Who could be born at the peak of chaos?Who didn't need to lie low and bear the humiliation?However, the power of time seemed to have given Li Hao such an opportunity. He didn't need to endure the humiliation. Thus, he went on the path of constantly looking for time, but constantly overdrawing it.Just like that, he fell into the cycle of time.p "Lord Marquis!" Qian Wuliang called out to Li Hao carefully in fear.He was very worried!At this moment, he was extremely worried that Li Hao would lose control.Li Hao, however, smiled and glanced at him."Don't worry!"Qian Wuliang felt relieved after hearing that.As for Li Hao, the hesitation in his eyes quickly disappeared.It didn't matter!It was just another cage.He just had to break the cage!Silver moon's Stargate had opened, but chaos 'Stargate had not. The Stargate in his heart had not opened, so where was true freedom?There was nowhere to be found!'Therefore, I still have to break through the stargates that seal me and the Silver Moon. When I break through all the stargates, so what if I owe more?Today, the Tiger in his heart reappeared.I've realized my true self again. I'm still that Li Hao. Everything I've done is to break the Stargate that's shackling me and the Silver Moon. I'll break them until there's no more door ahead!"One is not born with complete freedom, and I ... I insist on pursuing complete freedom. Until the end, who can be sure that I will fail?In his heart, he understood.Dao was difficult to cultivate.It was as difficult to pursue the Dao as to ascend to the blue sky.The path of cultivation had always been like this, but the path of freedom was even more difficult.I want to be free, I want to travel freely, but the world is not big enough, people's hearts are not broad enough, I can't give up fame and fortune. There seems to be a lot to do in the future, I don't want to be a small figure who groveles and groveles, I don't want to be a snob.Perhaps only supreme beings could have freedom, right?"Lord Marquis!""You're too noisy!"Li Hao tilted his head and shouted,"I heard you. Why are you calling me again?"Wasn't it just a Primal Chaos lightning tribulation?Wasn't he not here yet?Wouldn't the closing of the realm gate delay a little longer?Qian Wuliang felt a bit helpless, but he was relieved to hear Li Hao's scolding. If Li Hao had been calm all the time, he would have been scared.Li Hao cleaned up the battlefield and collected all the corpses and energy of the deceased. He was in no hurry.He raised his head and looked at the sky. That universe of the great path ... Belonged to tianfang. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Tian Fang's universe of the great path did seem to exist, but it could not be revived yet. It did not have enough energy, and it did not have enough energy from the same source.

2776 Chapter 459
He looked at it again, and his eyes flickered slightly.Many people saw it today.Perhaps venerable Emperor Hui long and the others would be back soon. If they killed this venerable sovereign of Yunxiao, perhaps the realm Lord of Yunxiao would know that this man was dead. It was not 'perhaps', it was 'definitely'. That way, he might be able to inform venerable Dragon Emperor and the others that something had happened here, and that a powerhouse who could kill a rank six venerable sovereign had appeared.Even if venerable Dragon Emperor and the others came back, they would be very careful.He would be even harder to kill than Chi Yun today!Li Hao kept looking up at the sky and fell into deep thought. He was not in a hurry to resist the Thunderbolts, which made Qian Wuliang both anxious and helpless.He knew that Li Hao's strength would be lost if he delayed for too long.Now, while the power of the seventh step was still there, he should hurry!"I don't want to run anymore!" Li Hao suddenly said."What?"Li Hao said seriously,"I don't want to keep running away with Silver Moon!" The Silvermoon world has already become a burden. I said, I don't want to keep running!"Qian Wuliang's face changed color.Was he ... Abandoning Silver Moon?"We should settle down somewhere and settle down for a while!"Li Hao looked at the sky again."Tianfang's Dao universe hasn't completely recovered, but it still exists. Today, I borrowed its power and can barely open it. I'm going to stuff the Silvermoon world in!" p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Qian Wuliang was stunned.Where to?Li Hao continued."If I can't do it by myself, I'll borrow the power of the Coiling Dragon Well Emperor. If I can 't, I'll go find a chess piece ... In short, I'm going to completely settle down the Silvermoon world. I'll find a safe place for you to grow!"Li Hao looked at him and said,"you all will enter the tianfang great Dao universe!" "With the tianfang great Dao universe as the package, as long as the tianfang great Dao universe doesn't open, no one can find you. No one can open it ... In this world, only I can open it! If I die, you will forever live in tianfang universe unless the people of tianfang return. ""Unless I really reach Level 7 ... Otherwise, I won't open up the sky universe again!"Qian Wuliang's face changed again. He looked at Li Hao and said,"master ... This ... This ..." "In this case, it's better not to open the Stargate, right?" Li Hao looked at him.Qian Wuliang was silent.Yes, in this way, what was the difference from when the Stargate was closed?Li Hao was silent for a moment."Back then, I didn't know that Silver Moon would be in such danger after the Stargate was opened ... I knew that Crimson Moon was very strong, but I thought that neo martial arts could defeat Crimson Moon. In the entire chaos, Crimson Moon was the only opponent. No one told me that ... In the chaos, there are enemies everywhere. There are venerable sovereigns who want to kill me, Silvermoon ...""Once the red moon's bounty was out, countless people wanted to take down the Silvermoon world and Exchange it for a large amount of resources. If one was killed, there would be two more, as if there was no end to it! I had no choice but to protect Silver Moon. If it weren't for Silver Moon, I would've already come into contact with the new martial artists and not have to fight the Crimson Moon elites under the eyes of the Crimson Moon Lord ...""It's US who have dragged down Lord Marquis. "Qian Wuliang felt a bit helpless. Li Hao seemed to be tired of it.Li Hao, however, shook his head."I'm not saying that he's a burden. I'm saying that ... Silver Moon is too weak. He's as fragile as porcelain. He'll shatter with a single touch!" This Silver Moon can't help me, and I can't wholeheartedly protect him! We seized a lot of resources this time ..."Li Hao's eyes suddenly turned fierce."After killing so many venerable sovereigns and snatching so much energy, I'll destroy the temple of returning Dragons and take all the resources. I'll stuff them into Silver moon's pocket. It'll be enough for him to cultivate for a while!" Everyone should go cultivate and develop. If I can open up the tianfang universe again, you guys might be able to kill your way back!""In addition, I want to close the Stargate again! Cut off the time!""You can seal it again?" Qian Wuliang was surprised.Was that even possible?The time had already returned to normal.Li Hao laughed."Of course you can. Tianfang universe is sealed to begin with. It's just that after being sealed, you can't come into contact with chaos, can't come into contact with the outside, and can't absorb energy ... In other words, from the original self-devouring of energy, you can only rely on the internal energy to maintain your operation.""But how much can I absorb by devouring myself? "The growth of a world easily takes millions of years. I'll take it, I'll take it, I'll kill it! I'll kill all my enemies and throw all my resources into Silver Moon. At that point, I'll seal myself off and it'll be fine. "He looked at tianfang universe again."Hurry up. Otherwise, if I lose my power, I'll have to borrow power again to open tianfang universe ...""Lord Marquis, are we all going to seal ourselves off?"Li Hao glanced at Qian Wuliang, who gritted his teeth and said,"What I mean is ... We have many venerable sovereigns, so why don't we let them come out? Venerable sovereigns sealed themselves off. What else could they do besides eating resources? Enlightenment? So ... The one Lord Marquis wants to seal off should be Silver Moon, not us!""Silvermoon, some people will have to walk out of this.""At that time, whether you want to live in the Outlander domain, go to other worlds, or wander the primordial chaos ... It's all up to your own fate! In new martial arts, weren't there many venerable sovereigns wandering outside? The energy in the new martial arts World Is Not Enough. Otherwise, it would not have restricted the venerable sovereigns. "

2777 Chapter 459
"So, I think we venerable sovereigns should all come out!" Qian Wuliang said quickly.Li Hao pondered for a moment and quickly said,"let's see. There's no hurry. I'll take Silver Moon back first ... While the experts have yet to return and no one is paying attention, I'll try to tear apart the great Dao universe and hide Silver Moon inside!" Hiding under everyone's eyes.It was hidden in a level-nine great Dao universe.Even if you know that the Dao universe is here, it's almost impossible to open it."Of course, if I die, perhaps ... The people of tianfang will really return. Otherwise, this great Dao universe is more like a cage than the chaos. The great Dao universe has no energy. Back then, it was taken away by the people of tianfang and became an empty shell.Such a universe was actually not as good as chaos at the moment.But at least, it was safe!Li Hao was actually thinking about a lot of things at this moment. He did not want to hide Silver Moon inside. When he first opened the Stargate, everyone was so excited. They felt that they had connected with chaos, that they were no longer sealed off, and that the future was bright.But today, I told them that I'm going to close the Stargate and the Silver Moon again. Not only that, but it's even crueler than before ... In the past, the outside world was chaos, and you might still be able to meet outsiders.But now, even if you broke the Stargate, you wouldn't be able to break through the tianfang great Dao universe unless it opened. At that time, you wouldn't be as free as you were in the chaos.Qian Wuliang didn't say anything else.He would discuss it after he brought Silver Moon back.……Li Hao's strength of the seventh step hadn't dissipated yet, and he moved extremely fast.At this moment, the realm gates could no longer withstand the chaos lightning tribulation. After all, the heaven's side was not completely sealed. There were four realm gates. Sealing them would only delay the time of the locking.At this moment, a lightning tribulation vaguely appeared above Li Hao's head.As for Li Hao, he waved his hand and covered the dark clouds. With his power, ordinary venerable sovereigns could not see through it.Li Hao pondered for a while, and finally, he returned to the Dragon Temple.……Back to the Dragon Temple.The drastic change had taken place, but many people were still ignorant. Even though they knew that a battle had broken out in the distance ... With the death of the venerable sovereigns, the weak people in the Dragon returning temple had no idea what had happened.They were all a little hesitant!Of course, they weren't too afraid. There were dozens of venerable sovereigns in Hui long temple, and a top venerable sovereign had come today. They weren't as worried as they thought. They just felt that if venerable sovereigns fought, it might be a threat to them.The outbreak of a battle between venerable sovereigns could easily involve the weak.The giant pincers were still waiting for Li Hao.He was still deciding whether he should go find Kong Ji when the world spun. In an instant, the entire Huilong temple seemed to have changed. Some of the experts in the temple didn't have time to react. In an instant, everyone seemed to be frozen, unable to move.In the temple, a fifth stage venerable sovereign appeared.The power of light emerged.There was some shock in his eyes as he looked at the sky.This was the expert beside Kong Ji.He was the only one who had not moved at all. Kong Ji was in closed-door cultivation, and he could be considered a Dao protector for Kong Ji.Seventh-rank?Who was it? The next moment, he knew who it was.Li Hao's figure appeared. The venerable sovereign's face changed when he saw the man. Bright moon, the Silver Moon King!"Chi Yun and the others ...""He's dead!"I guessed it.The man's expression changed. I guessed it.No wonder there was such a huge commotion earlier. It turns out ... This murderer really killed all of them. This fellow is too ruthless!"I'm looking for Kong Ji!""You can 't!"Despite his fear, the venerable sovereign still said in a deep voice,""His Highness is in seclusion. He has ordered that unless he comes out himself, no one is to disturb him. You ... Can only do so if you kill me!" p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Time is tight,"Li Hao didn't say anything. In the next moment, he slapped his palm down, and a cage and a domain appeared, enveloping him.She didn't say much to him.A moment later, the giant pincers appeared in front of him. Li Hao said,""Go, call Kong Ji up. I can't go down!"He had a lightning tribulation hanging over his head. Once he entered the dark Devil Ridge ... The entire Dark Devil Ridge might no longer exist."Yes!"The giant pincers were scared witless and hurriedly entered the dark Demon Ridge through the door.……In the dark Demon Palace.He was still in the void of enlightenment and did not feel any vibrations. It was as if he was isolated from heaven and earth.At this moment, he was smiling.Good place, good treasure.At this moment, he had almost reached 4000 cells. This speed was very fast. If this continued, Kong Ji had some thoughts."Maybe ... I can reach level six very soon."A Dao chess piece was a good treasure!A moment later, he heard a sound."Venerable Emperor void, I Am Giant pincer. Lord Hao Yue wishes to see senior ..."Kong Ji was startled. He looked around and saw no one.Only the shadow remained.He thought he was hallucinating, but the next moment, he vaguely heard a sound again.He stood up and walked out of the grid. He listened again and there was indeed a sound. Kong Ji didn't say anything and walked in the air. The shadow couldn't help but say,""You're leaving? It's not a good thing to stop comprehending the Dao. If you continue, I think it won't take long, maybe half a month, for you to step into the sixth step ...""But if you leave now, you won't have the opportunity and won't be able to enter Dao chess again. It might take a hundred years, or a thousand years ... Also, after 6000 squares, you'll have the Dao you need. It's not impossible to reach grade seven."The mysterious man said. It would be a waste to leave now.

2778 Chapter 459
Li Hao had fought for Kong Ji's opportunity to enter Dao chess, but he had not passed the first round ... Thus, everything had to have rules. Kong Ji could only go once, and he had only gone 4000 steps. He would not be able to go out again."Many thanks for senior's reminder!"Kong Ji smiled and didn't care. He left and didn't even turn back,""Sixth and seventh step, isn't it just a matter of time? There was no rush! I'm going out for a while. Let's meet again if fate allows!""The void and the way of chess might not be open to you anymore!""Then forget it, I won't see you again!"Kong Ji didn't even turn his head and waved his hand, not too concerned.Daoqi was really a good place.However, what did it matter if he couldn't come?No matter how good Dao chess was, it was man-made.The master of tianfang was powerful, but it didn't mean that the chess he created was really unparalleled. If he didn't want to come, then he didn't have to come.The shadow was speechless.These people had all gained something after entering Dao chess. They could cultivate in peace and enter the realm that others dreamed of. However ... Each and every one of them had to leave after a few days of enlightenment.The shadow didn't understand. After cultivating to this level, what was more important than Dao?A Supreme treasure left behind by a level nine sovereign!Ordinary venerable sovereigns did not have the opportunity to enter at all. Even if they did, they were not as talented as Li Hao and Kong Ji. The two of them were like a hot knife through butter. If they were given more time, they could easily reach the next level in Dao chess.However, they had all given up halfway.The shadow was even a little dejected. Why?Was the Dao of a rank nine venerable sovereign not as fragrant?…… p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Soon, Kong Ji appeared in Huilong temple.He looked up and smiled."That's quite a big commotion!"Li Hao appeared and casually threw the rank five venerable sovereign aside. Kong Ji glanced at him and smiled."Your brain isn't working enough ... You really don't know how to be flexible when I ask you to guard!""You leave first," he said."Go to the other regions and guard them. If any venerable sovereigns Enter the Dragon field, kill them first."The rank five venerable sovereign was stunned for a moment, then he laughed and said,""Hurry!"The man didn't dare to say anything more and quickly left.He just felt a little helpless...It wasn't a good thing for His Highness to be together with this madman!Does His Highness know that Chi Yun has been killed?Cloudsky and the divine light plane hadn't even started a war yet.Of course, it was Li Hao who had killed him, so it had little to do with the divine light plane. What he was afraid of was that His Highness would get involved, which would be troublesome. After sending the person away, Kong Ji looked at Li Hao, as if he had seen through his cover."Difficult tribulation? It's just that this time, you've made such a big scene that I can't resist it. This is already at the seventh step, right? I can still try to fight a sixth step. "How brutal!Li Hao did not stand on ceremony. He quickly said,"I'm going to transcend the Tribulation. I need your help. I don't need your help with the Tribulation. Create a Nirvana domain for me. I want to send Silver Moon into the tianfang great Dao universe."“……”"You ... You really dare to think!" Even Kong Ji gasped.Li Hao laughed,"it's the safest when it's dark!" "By the way, fellow Daoist's comprehension has been interrupted this time. I'll try to open the tianfang great Dao universe, and it can be considered barely recovering. You can go in and take a look ... Of course, it won't last long! You should come out as soon as possible to avoid falling into it. If you do, I won't be able to quickly open it again. ""It looks good!"Kong Ji laughed. The Dao chess was a treasure, but after opening the tianfang universe, although it had not recovered yet ... It seemed not bad to go in and take a look at the silent and destroyed great Dao universe.That's good!"Are you sure you don't need my help to pass the Tribulation?" "You're too weak. "Li Hao shook his head.Kong Ji laughed,"if you didn't borrow my power, would you be stronger than me?."'This guy thinks I'm weak?'"At least I'm stronger than you now."Li Hao also laughed and said,"you just need to use the Nirvana domain to wrap around Silver Moon ... Don't interfere with anything else to avoid involving the light. I killed them all, and the power of Nirvana didn't participate. The strong won't be able to detect it, and they won't deliberately frame you. Cloudsky might not want to start a war with the divine light realm at this moment."Kong Ji nodded."I don't want to drag the divine light realm into this either. I'm me, and light is light. If someone wants to kill me, I can look for my father, but I can't drag light into this. Although I think the chances of neo martial are very high ... I can't drag light into this without permission."Both sides were straightforward. Kong Ji did not say that they were not afraid of the world of light and that they could fight as they pleased.That was his father's right, and it had nothing to do with him.Li Hao nodded, then looked at the sky.""Hurry up. Otherwise, I'll lose too much energy and I won't be able to hold on!"Kong Ji nodded and rose into the air with Li Hao.While flying toward the realm gate, Li Hao asked,"Do you still have any cultivation resources below venerable sovereign?""I have some. Do you want them?""Yes, the more the better!"Li Hao nodded."The tianfang great Dao universe is empty inside. It's just an empty shell. It doesn't even have the power of a great Dao. Even the power of Chaos is empty. It needs sufficient resources. Otherwise, the world will dry up! Give me as much as you have, and I'll return it to you after I've killed enough people. ""There's no hurry. "Kong Ji threw him some storage rings and said,""If it's not enough, I can gather more, but it will take time ...""Forget it, it's enough for now."Li Hao soon arrived near the teleportation array. With a wave of his hand, the Heavenly Kings in charge instantly froze.

2779 Chapter 459
The two of them went through the teleportation formation and disappeared from the Dragon field.……Southern realm gate.The realm gate opened again, and dark clouds covered the sky.The lightning tribulation flashed.Kong Ji also waved his hand. In an instant, the world and chaos became quiet. A huge domain of darkness appeared. It was not dark power, but destructive power. It was as if heaven and earth had been destroyed.Even the lightning tribulation seemed to have slowed down.Li Hao looked at Qian Wuliang, and Qian Wuliang quickly began to communicate with him.Kong Ji looked at him curiously. After a long time, he said,""Daoist master?""Yes, the great Dao of Silvermoon."Kong Ji nodded slightly."Silver Moon still has potential. He was able to create a great Dao universe. Not simple!" Your power of time is also related to this, right?""Yes, it naturally exists in the Dao universe."Kong Ji was a little envious,'that's amazing! "It seems that neo martial is indeed not simple. The Silver Moon created by the loss of power can naturally give birth to time ... In other words, this time may originally belong to neo martial." Li Hao thought for a moment and shook his head."It doesn't belong to neo martial arts. It might belong to the yin-yang world."Neo martial and yin-yang world were still different.Kong Ji was startled. He nodded and didn't say anything.In the void, a cat appeared. Kong Ji looked at it and was even more surprised.Emperor Cang?No, it was not Emperor Cang!This ... Seemed to be a special creature.What was this?He seemed to have seen these strange things for the first time, and he was particularly surprised.Second cat had been following Li Hao, but loneliness had never seen it.Second cat didn't even look at him and asked,"are you done?" Also, this lightning tribulation is too strong. Don't expect me to eat it this time ... I'll be struck to death if I eat one. "Li Hao laughed,"I'm not eating!" I will deal with it! Let's first spit out Silvermoon ... Forget it, it's too big. Let's first enter tianfang world and then spit it out. I want to leave Silvermoon in tianfang. "Second cat was stunned. Stay?Abandoned?"Send it into the tianfang great Dao universe!"Li Hao explained, and then said,""Call some people out ... And ask for their opinion on whether they should stay in the world or come out to find opportunities. It's extremely dangerous to come out, but if they don't ... It's not like they don't have a chance."Second cat didn't say much. This had nothing to do with it.Soon, figures appeared one after another.Hou Xiaochen, sky sword, BA Dao, and the other Silver Moon martial masters all appeared in front of Li Hao. Li Hao didn't say anything, but sent a thought to them.Everyone instantly understood. All of them had complicated expressions on their faces.Was the Silver Moon going to be sealed again?This time, he had entered another great path universe. Furthermore, it was a silent great path universe and not active. This also meant that there was nothing in this great path universe.At this moment, in the crowd, director Zhao was the first to speak,"I'll stay. Silver Moon needs someone to manage him."Li Hao nodded.Indeed, someone had to stay behind. Otherwise, without Li Hao and the others, Silver Moon would be in a mess.He didn't say much and looked at Kong Ji.""I'll create a Nirvana domain and cover everyone first. When I enter tianfang, I'll open the tianfang great Dao universe and send the world in ... Can you cover the entire return Dragon field? Otherwise, I'll have to kill them to silence them. There are too many people in a region, so there's no point in killing too many. "Kong Ji smiled and nodded,"without the venerable sovereigns, it's not a big problem!" Before returning to the Dragon field, there were some wandering venerable sovereigns, but they've all run away recently. It's quite appropriate!"He didn't meddle in other people's business, nor did he ask anything else.It's just a small matter! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  However, he was somewhat interested and curious about the tianfang great Dao universe. Even if it was empty, it was just right. It suited his Dao of Nirvana and he wanted to see if he could comprehend it.Director Zhao and the others were curious.Who ... Was this person?It seemed to be very powerful!"Kong Ji, a cultivator!"Kong Ji could tell and introduced himself. Although there were no venerable sovereigns here and only a group of Dao integration cultivators, he did not care.Li Hao didn't introduce him. There was no need to introduce him to the Son of God of light.Soon, he returned to the Dragon field with a group of people, including er Mao.Li Hao didn't waste any time. He instantly rose into the air.A powerful force covered the entire world.Kong Ji also instantly floated into the air. A destructive power spread out to the entire return Dragon domain as he floated into the air. The powerful destructive power instantly destroyed the world!It was extremely powerful!In the sky, the tianfang great Dao universe reappeared with Li Hao's appearance. Two stars flickered, while the other stars were all destroyed.Kong Ji took a look, but he didn't see it clearly.The next moment, Li Hao's body erupted with an extremely powerful force. The power of fire dragged the great Dao universe. He roared, and the great Dao universe seemed to fall.Li Hao raised one hand to the sky and roared. In the universe of the great path, a crack was suddenly torn open in the area where Mars was.At this moment, a destructive power spread out.The universe of the great path was destroyed!Kong Ji glanced over and was a little dazed ... Was this the destructive great path universe?A ninth-tier great Dao universe!The domain of Nirvana was still there, and in the next moment, a small world appeared.Li Hao didn't say much. His huge palm dragged the small world that had been compressed countless times and soared into the sky, heading straight for the universe of the great path. A moment later, Li Hao also entered a world that had been completely destroyed.
