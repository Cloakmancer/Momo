Dao chess's original body was an eighth-tier great cosmos. It was supposed to be very powerful, but it had declined over the years. The master of tianfang, who had created Dao chess, had not created it for battle but for Dao Comprehension.Therefore, its offensive power was also ordinary.At this moment, he could only growl, and the chess piece itself appeared and enveloped the treasure-opening mouse. It was entangled with the treasure-opening mouse, but it couldn't help Li Hao any more.The treasure-piercing mouse's speed also gave Li Hao a fright.It was too fast!If it wasn't for the Dao chess piece, he might not have been able to fight back instantly. It seemed that these beasts of primordial chaos each had their own characteristics. The dragon clan and earthly Dragon beasts had extremely strong bodies, but their other abilities were average.This treasure-piercing mouse's body didn't seem to be very good. It was too fast.What about the other three?Forget it. One look at the giant elephant and he knew that it was another powerful physical body and strength-type powerhouse.As for the two ferocious Tigers ... Li Hao had been practicing the five birds technique all this time and knew some of the Tiger tribe's characteristics. He was slightly moved and sent a message: "Be careful of the sound waves, be careful of the Tiger's might ..."The Tiger race, regardless of whether it was the Chaos Beast or the demon race, were more or less similar.The tiger's roar and the Tiger's might were all trump cards.Li Hao sent a voice transmission again."Solitary and the two Dao Masters, join forces to fight the two tigers ... Be careful. Focus on defense. Let uncle Hong control bed universe. Gan Wuliang, retreat and use the Earthcover sword to block and defend!"The three experts didn't say anything and instantly charged at the two fierce Tigers.The black and white tigers were a little surprised. These people were really bold!Kong Ji roared,"my father! You dare to kill me?! My father will kill you!!"Regardless of whether it was useful or not, he had to scare them first.Perhaps it would work?Once there was some fear, it was easy to make mistakes. This was the best result. At this moment, the giant elephant appeared on Li Hao's side without saying anything. Its huge fangs pierced through the void and headed straight for Li Hao, its eyes cold.The giant elephant sector Lord's body was incomparably strong, and his power was even stronger. He was even stronger than the Earth Dragon beast he had killed before. Furthermore, the other party had the existence of the Dao universe. To the beasts of Primal Chaos, the Dao universe was a form of purification and also a storage for energy.With the great Dao universe, he didn't have to worry about exhausting his energy.This kind of Beast of Chaos had an invincible physical defense and offensive power. It could be said that it was the most difficult kind of venerable sovereign to deal with.Even if a human King wanted to kill a venerable sovereign like this, he would have to merge with Emperor Cang.Li Hao ... In an instant, knew that it was impossible for him to kill his opponent with the thousand-world sword.Hundreds of venerable sovereigns were also approaching.Once the encircle...They would all be dead. However, since he dared to show up and take the risk, Li Hao would naturally consider these venerable sovereigns.  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  In order to complete this ambush, Li Hao had already come up with some ideas.The firmament sword in his hand was almost completely broken.After killing many Grade 7 experts, at this moment, the sword couldn't take it anymore and showed signs of breaking.The power of a thousand worlds could deal with a normal level Seven venerable sovereign, but to deal with these sector Lord level existences ... Difficult, too difficult!Even a ninth-level sovereign weapon forged by an eighth-level great universe like Dao chess could not deal with a treasure-connecting mouse when it was weak. One could imagine the huge gap between seventh-level weapons.The reason why Kong Ji and the other two had to work together to deal with the two level 7 realm Masters was because only one of them was a sector Lord. White Tiger wasn 't, and black Tiger was the mighty tiger sector Lord.The tusks of the giant elephant pierced through the air. Li Hao only tried to use the Qianjie defense. With a crack, the Qianjie trembled violently, as if it had been pierced through. The defense net formed by the Qianjie could not stop the attack!This time, the few powerhouses who had observed the situation changed their expressions, and Dao Qi became anxious.They had hoped that Li Hao would win and help them, but in the end ... He was simply no match for the elephant.The Thunderbolt master, who was killing the flame Phoenix, gritted his teeth and roared. He forced the flame Phoenix back and was about to help Li Hao. However, the flame Phoenix Sector Lord wasn't someone to be trifled with. At this moment, flames also burned the sky. With a roar, the cry of a Phoenix resounded through the world!You still want to leave?In your dreams!"Do you want me to destroy the Thunder World?" the Thunderbolt master roared.The flame Phoenix World Overlord roared out,"at this moment, you can just destroy it!" Thunderlord, today, this King will kill you!"And now, you're threatening me with this?With the death of two venerable sovereigns of the dragon world, even if they took over the Thunder World, they would still be in deep trouble. If they didn't kill Li Hao and the others, how would they explain this to the Dragon Lord?As for the Thunder World ... So what if it was destroyed!She had no more worries!The Thunderbolt master's expression also changed. This was big trouble. The Silver Moon King and his group were very strong. A group of sixth-ranked and seventh-ranked existences was extremely fearsome ... However, they were still a step behind. If this continued, they would quickly collapse once they completed the encirclement!Now, he could only barely resist.What a pity!It was such a pity that there was one more seventh-rank combatant. One more seventh-rank combatant might be able to turn the tables. He was a little helpless. It was already very good and had exceeded his imagination, but there was one less seventh-rank combatant!The origin of the world of the Thunder World seemed to have recovered. He ... Might be able to bring the thunder World away. However, Li Hao and the others had stood up for him. If he retreated and the fire Phoenix joined the battle, Li Hao and the others would collapse even faster.Just as this thought appeared, a loud boom resounded. He was grabbed by the sharp claws of the fire Phoenix realm master, causing his entire body to bleed. Countless lightning energy exploded out ...At this moment, Li Hao still didn't seem to be in a hurry.

Chapter 3291 A Bloody Battle From All Four Sides_ 3
Even if the giant elephant sector Lord's huge hooves were about to crush him!Li Hao didn't care about this. The Qianjie and the Dao domain appeared. The enormous Dao domain spread along the Qianjie as if it was going to cover the world and even the entire chaos. At this moment, the Qianjie seemed to have become a real world!A thousand worlds, how huge was that?As for the giant elephant realm Lord, he sneered. Flashy but useless. It was indeed terrifying and shocking. However, no matter how many little realms there were, they would all be crushed into dust under his feet!But at this moment, Li Hao chuckled and said,""I've transcended chaos lightning tribulations one after another, countless times! The Thunder World is also the same. The Thunder Emperor must have experienced quite a number of tribulations, right?""I've heard that the lightning territory is filled with Primal Chaos lightning tribulations. It's truly terrifying ... Primal Chaos lightning tribulations actually don't disappear. It's truly a mystical place. It's a pity that I didn't enter it to investigate ... What a pity!"Everyone was stunned.At this moment, a star appeared and embellished the center of the entire Qianjie. It was a time star."Second cat!"A cat appeared in the void. Two cats.However, er Mao only had the power of the sixth rank at the moment. It was not even as strong as the two Dao Masters. At this moment, er Mao was a little helpless and confused. Why did you call me ... For?I can't change anything."You came from time. If I force you to come to the human world ... What will happen?"What would happen?Er Mao was dazed for a moment. It had been trying to force its way in, but it was still not enough. It was not a real living being."At that time, illusion will descend into reality, and chaos will not tolerate it!"Li Hao muttered to himself. At this critical moment, he was smiling calmly."Time, open for me!"The heavens and earth shook as the thousand worlds appeared and time flowed!In an instant, the power of countless great DAOs and the power of time appeared on the two cats. The two cats suddenly felt the rapid flow of time. It seemed to feel something different. In that chubby body, the heart that didn't exist before ...At this moment, it was as if his heart had appeared.Bang ...There seemed to be a faint heartbeat.Let me materialize in the human world, become a seventh-rank, and change everything?But ...As er cat was thinking, suddenly, countless dark clouds appeared between heaven and earth. A creature that was not from the chaos suddenly appeared from another time and space. It was completely revived and became a real creature!This was heaven-defying!The controller of time had to be punished, and so did second cat.However, at this moment, a small world suddenly absorbed a large amount of time power. In an instant, the attached world absorbed a large amount of time power. Then, the world suddenly exploded like fireworks!One of the realms within the thousand realms exploded.The attachment Dao, along with the power of time, swept through the world. All the venerable sovereigns and everyone present suddenly had time on their bodies and were contaminated by the attachment Dao. Li Hao smiled and looked into the distance. In the distance ... Was the lightning territory!The lightning domain was filled with countless Primal Chaos lightning tribulations.Under normal circumstances, the chaos lightning tribulation would only last for nine bolts, but what if there were endless chaos lightning tribulations nearby?How many would appear? He didn't know!At this moment, the expressions of all the powerhouses who had been contaminated by the attachment Dao changed slightly, and their hearts jolted. In the next moment, they all looked at the sky with their mouths agape. It was as if a huge Army of lightning had descended in the sky at this moment!Yes, an Army!It wasn't just one or two, but countless Thunder Giants. They instantly formed as if the lightning territory was their lair, as if someone was crazily provoking them at their doorstep!The Army appeared!One, two, three ...In the blink of an eye, more than a hundred Giants appeared, all of them exuding world-destroying power as they walked out of the lightning domain ... Yes, they walked out. That's right, they walked out of the lightning domain. This time, they didn't just appear out of thin air.This was the first time Li Hao had seen such a scene. The next moment, he laughed."Everyone, let's do it based on our own abilities! Let's see who ... Can pass the Tribulation successfully. If not ... Then die!""Bastard!"The elephant's body trembled as it tried to shake off the Dao of attachment. It knew that the lightning tribulation had targeted it for no other reason than the interference it had caused, tainting its body with the power of time.Whoever had this would be the enemy that the lightning tribulation wanted to kill!At this moment, it wasn't just him. Everyone present, including Kong Ji, had it. Kong Ji couldn't help but roar,""Why did you get us infected?"Li Hao did not say anything.Why?  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  "There's no reason why, because ... To be safe, I didn't taint any individual, but the entire area. It's filled with attachment Dao. Otherwise, do you really think it's so easy to make a few 7th rank experts unable to shake them off?You have no choice but to accept it.You've been through a lot of Primal Chaos lightning tribulations, haven't you?We still have some experience!What was there to be afraid of?Not only them, even the Thunderbolt master in the sky was incomparably shocked. At this moment, even he was targeted by the lightning tribulation. The fire Phoenix World Overlord was in the same state as well. They were all dumbstruck as they looked at the lightning Giants that were continuously walking out from the lightning territory!It was as if the world was going to be destroyed!At this moment, the entire lightning domain seemed to be in a state of silence. Perhaps because too much of the primal Chaos lightning tribulation had been extracted, the primal Chaos energy in the lightning domain was surging towards this direction!One giant after another appeared, and every single one of them ... Was at the seventh rank!There were over a hundred of them!Everyone was dumbfounded!

Chapter 3292 The Bloody Battle Of The Four Sides
The primal Chaos lightning tribulation ... It would take human form, form an Army, and send out hundreds of them at once?How could that be possible!"You're crazy!"Even the fire Phoenix Sector Lord couldn't help but scream out: "You're crazy. More than a hundred steps 7th ... Do you want us all to die?"This is crazy!If they did this, they would all die.There were only seven Level 7s present, and on Li Hao's side, there were only ten Level 6s who could take on three level 7s. The lightning tribulation was ten times that number!Was this the end of the world?Li Hao smiled and comforted him."It's alright. They're not just targeting us. They're also targeting the hundreds of venerable sovereigns!" The level Seven lightning tribulation will also kill them. If you kill them ... A lot of energy will be consumed. Everyone ... Let's enjoy the feast together!"BOOM!One giant after another charged down.The venerable sovereigns, who had come to surround him, turned pale and fled frantically. The chaos lightning tribulation!Damn it!Crazy!……At this moment.In a distant place.There were a total of 12 large worlds here, five demon worlds and seven chaotic worlds.Originally, the experts had also sensed the battle that had broken out over there. However, it was not appropriate for the experts of the primal Chaos realm to leave because the demons of the five directions were ready to make a move.The three Grade 7 experts of the iron-eating race walked out of the realm gate.All of them were looking in that direction.Although there were more chaosworlds, they only had one more level-seven demon than the five demon clans.There were a total of 8 level 7 demons in the five directions.And there were only nine at the seventh rank in the seven Worlds. One more might not be enough to completely suppress them.There were many Grade 7s in the Dragon field.Li Hao had already killed four, and there were still many more on the other side. The Dragon Lord still had seven ...In the entire Dragon field, there might be more than 30 seventh rank venerable sovereigns, and some of them might not even be here.In the red moon region, there might not be 20 rank seven venerable sovereigns, but the Dragon region had more than 30.However, at that moment, all the level 7s were stunned!Waves of overwhelming force swept across the entire world. Countless lightning Giants seemed to be projected across the entire Dragon field!All of them seemed to have the aura of a rank seven!Hundreds of them, this ... This was simply ... Unbelievable!Everyone in the square region seemed to be able to see that this moment was even more brilliant than the human King blowing up a great path universe. A great path universe only belonged to a level Seven venerable sovereign.But now ... There seemed to be more than a hundred venerable sovereigns there, seventh level venerable sovereigns! This was the number of seventh level venerable sovereigns in the entire four-square region.……Near the Crimson sun World.At this moment, the Supreme martial artist and the others all looked toward the east. In the sky, hundreds of Giants appeared. The lightning seemed to illuminate the entire square region, making the dark chaos become bright! Best novel online free at nσνEℓnєXт  The Grandmaster's mouth was wide open!艹!What was going on?The destruction of the world?Or did the outer region attack?Venerable the sword also opened his mouth wide. After a long time, he muttered,""This ... Is this the result of the daylight thief technique?"He seemed to have guessed it!The corners of Li Zhu's mouth twitched. After a long time, he said in a low voice,""It probably won't work ... This ... This should be his so-called Dao of attachment. He attached many, many venerable sovereigns to them ... They're near the lightning territory and completely stimulated the lightning territory, causing the chaos lightning tribulation ... He's completely gone crazy!"Yes, the chaos lightning tribulation had gone mad!……At this moment, not only the venerable sovereigns of the four regions, but also the others.Outside the four-sided domain.,m The square domain was very, very large, but there were huge pillars all around it, forming a lightning domain that surrounded the square domain and separated it from the outer domain.Many people knew that the four-square region had a level nine world, so there were many worlds nearby. They had been staying there all this time just to enter the four-square region and see.Today, venerable sovereigns emerged from the chaos in this world. They opened their mouths and looked into the distance at the countless Giants who had emerged. Each of them had an extremely fierce aura!Seventh rank!A hundred!"The chaos lightning tribulation is about to destroy the world!"Someone mumbled,"the four-sided domain seems to be in a war. There are killings everywhere. Many rank Sevens have fallen ... Today, hundreds of chaos rank seven Giants have appeared ... What happened in the four-sided domain?"Some people's eyes flickered. The primal Chaos lightning tribulation was all gathered there. Would they be able to pass through the lightning territory smoothly?Is there no more lightning tribulation?At this moment, it was not that no one wanted to try. Some venerable sovereigns who couldn't cross it before suddenly gritted their teeth and headed towards the Thunder region. They went through the Thunder region and went to the square region!A fifth rank venerable sovereign who had just entered the lightning territory, which looked peaceful ... Suddenly went crazy. It was as if he had gone crazy. The remaining lightning tribulation that hadn't been violent at first suddenly surged wildly. Everyone thought that the giant pillars that had been calm were just some special pillars used to gather lightning tribulation.They had guessed right!However, they were wrong. At this moment, these giant pillars suddenly flickered and formed a net of lightning. It was no longer a lightning tribulation, but a lightning net. They seemed to be completely enraged!He was infuriated by Li Hao. While they were surrounding and killing Li Hao, someone was causing trouble here!BOOM!The lightning net enveloped the rank five venerable sovereign. Normally, the venerable sovereign could still struggle, but this time, he couldn't even put up a fight. He was instantly cut into pieces by the countless lightning nets and turned into ashes in the blink of an eye!

Chapter 3293 The Bloody Battle Of The Four Sides
The other venerable sovereigns stepped back in fear.Had the Thunder region gone crazy?……BOOM!Screams, explosions, sounds of battle, explosions of Thunder, and screams of death ...At this moment, the Thunder Giants were killing each other crazily!He killed the venerable sovereigns who had gathered, Li Hao and the others, ermao, Kong Ji, and all the experts who were covered by the attachment Dao.Someone was using time. Furthermore, it was time. They wanted to bring an existence that did not exist in the chaos into the chaos. This was equivalent to a malignant tumor of the chaos that must be eliminated!And since there was time power within this area, then ... He would kill them all!Li Hao was forced to retreat by the Thunder giant, but he smiled brilliantly. He would not count on anyone to save him, and there was no need to. He was used to taking on lightning!I was able to withstand the seventh-grade lightning tribulation in the past, and now ... It's even more so!These beasts of primordial chaos, had they experienced it before?Primal Chaos lightning tribulations were very interesting.He was used to it, but at this moment, there were still some people who were not used to it. The two Dao Masters were not in the mood to fight with the Tiger, and the Tiger was not in the mood to care about them.The two path Masters had encountered two level Seven lightning tribulations, and not just one. At this moment, Qian Wuliang screamed miserably as he was struck by the lightning and was even struck out from Hong Yitang's body."Lord Marquis ..."He screamed again and again. If even he was like this, it was easy to imagine that all the other venerable sovereigns in the outer ring, those who were below rank 6, were almost all struck at this moment!As for the Thunder World, it was either luck or Li Hao's intention that it was not enveloped.The group of venerable sovereigns also swallowed their saliva as they watched. Who was the lightning cultivator?This Silver Moon King was simply a fantasy for lightning cultivators!That's right, every lightning cultivator had actually fantasized about the primal Chaos lightning tribulation being able to come and go as they wished!But ... But there's no need to play so big, right?They even saw some of the people who had betrayed the Thunder World and were also proficient in the power of the Thunder element. However, at this moment, under the primal Chaos lightning tribulation, they were like floating dust, instantly crushed and shattered!Seventh grade lightning tribulation!Even a peak rank 6 Supreme Emperor Phoenix Flame was struggling to resist the attack. Covered in blood, he turned into a Golden Phoenix and fought back!This place seemed to have completely turned into hell! Best novel online free at nσνEℓnєXт  A large number of venerable sovereigns were dying.Those who weren't wrapped in it were extremely afraid at this moment. Their eyes were full of fear. This could be the demon in their hearts for the rest of their lives!The venerable sovereigns of the three worlds were lucky. Except for a few experts who were fast, such as some level six venerable sovereigns, they were all screaming madly. The rest of the weak venerable sovereigns were lucky that they were too weak and slow to be surrounded in time.They were all retreating continuously, with only fear in their eyes!Only fear! The overbearing middle-stage venerable sovereigns were all turned into dust and shattered by the hundreds of Giants. The power of the great Dao and the power of Chaos turned the entire area into a Thunder Zone!In the sky, the lightning Lord was also groaning. He was fighting with a seventh-grade giant, and his eyes were changing. Seventh-grade lightning tribulations...So many?Could the lightning element really achieve this?If he could achieve this ... What was an eighth level venerable sovereign?Hundreds of Level 7 Giants would surround and kill you in an instant!But ...The Thunderbolt master couldn't help but look at Li Hao and the others. These people have low levels and weak bodies, and the Tribulation lightning strikes cover them indiscriminately. To the Beasts of Chaos, they are very troublesome, but to you, aren't you even more troublesome?As for him ... He had experienced it before and was of the lightning attribute. At this moment, he felt much better. The flame Phoenix realmlord who was suppressing him previously, at this moment ... The Thunderbolt master laughed. He rapidly endured the seventh-tier lightning tribulation and charged towards the flame Phoenix realmlord!I'm going to suppress you this time!……"Lord Marquis ... Save me ..."At this moment, only Qian Wuliang could shout in such a shrill voice. He was the master of the great Dao. The other venerable sovereigns were in the great Dao universe and were only in charge of the branches, so they weren't in great danger.However, he was the target of the lightning tribulation!Hong Yitang was good at defense, and he was only good at the Dao of emotions. At this time, he really couldn't hold on!I'm going to die, I'm going to die!Countless venerable sovereigns had been struck to death nearby. The venerable sovereigns of the fire Phoenix realm and more than a hundred venerable sovereigns of External Affairs had been struck to death recently. That was the most terrifying thing!As for the local venerable sovereigns, a portion of them had escaped into the great Dao universe, while the rest had been completely struck to death.Qian Wuliang is about to collapse, and I will be struck to death!A few Beasts of Chaos were also struggling to resist, but they were in a much better state than him. On this side, only Li Hao and Kong Ji were in a better state. He and Hong Yitang were in a miserable state.If we do this, we'll be the first to die, right?Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't say anything. He was just waiting and watching. Who?Second cat!This was his trump card. He had to conjure up second cat and completely descend into the human world. Even if he couldn't replicate Emperor Cang's strength that was close to the eighth rank, he would at least be at the seventh rank!And second cat ... Could devour everything!As long as second cat succeeded in devouring the power of the lightning tribulation, Li Hao and the others would be able to kill the enemy!In the air, there were also many lightning bolts around er Mao.Countless amounts of time power were still spreading.Ermao's body seemed to have changed. It had eaten a lot of world origin, which represented life, but it had never shown its true life.

Chapter 3294 The Bloody Battle Of The Four Sides
As time went by, it seemed like second cat had digested everything.But...Second cat was also very depressed.He looked at Li Hao, everyone, and the countless lightning bolts ..."Meow!"Second cat's meow was filled with helplessness and anger.Didn't you say that you'll let Kong Ji take the opportunity to reach Grade 7?Good Lord, are you lying to a cat? Kong Ji didn't have a chance at all. The one who has a chance is me!Now, he had been struck by lightning and time. When he really materialized and descended into chaos, perhaps ... He would be struck by everyone!Second cat was even more indignant.We agreed that there would be no next time. Good fellow, there would be no next time. You placed your hopes on me. You actually placed your hopes on a cat to turn the situation around?Li Hao looked at second cat and smiled.The big cat Emperor Cang should be doing something big with the human Emperor ... Since second cat is by my side, how can I let you be worse than big cat?That won't do!A second cat should have its own ambition!I'm counting on you!"As long as you can completely descend and help us stall the lightning tribulation, we'll win this time, a great victory!Moreover, in this case, the other tier 7 cultivators would not be able to come to their rescue even if they wanted to. Who would dare to come in?Since Li Hao was going to do it, he definitely wouldn't give the others a chance. It definitely wouldn't work if it was purely by chance. He had to at least have some confidence!"Meow!"The cat's meow became clearer and clearer. It was no longer awkward. At this moment, the cat seemed to be the only one in the world. Nearby, many lightning Giants appeared and wanted to kill the two cats!However, er Mao ... Had yet to fully materialize. These Giants seemed to be having a hard time dealing with him."Meow!"The cat meowed again, and it seemed to have a faint heartbeat. It was about to become a chaotic creature.From a long time ago, it was born in an illusory world, destroyed in an illusory world, and revived in the Silver Moon. Today ... It seemed that it was going to completely descend into the world from the chaos and become a unique creature!It was no longer big cat's shadow. Big cat's past was second cat!Teacher ... I'm about to descend completely into the chaos! Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  He had walked out of the past.I'm no longer the illusory cat that accompanied you.Er Mao looked at the Time and Stars. At this moment, it was a little lost. Although it had long made a decision, when the day really came, it was about to walk out of the illusion and into reality. Suddenly, it felt a little uneasy.And ... Big cat, I'm no longer your past, no longer your shadow. I'm a real living being, a real member of the chaos."Meow!"A meow shook the entire world. A cat seemed to have crossed through time and space and truly walked out of the world. It swayed its body, its tail shook, and its four short legs seemed to have stepped into the territory of chaos for the first time.Second cat had arrived!A rank 7 power appeared between heaven and earth. It wasn't very obvious in this place where there were countless rank 7 lightning tribulations, but it attracted everyone's attention. Even the fire Phoenix realmlord was slightly shocked at this moment. What was this?Emperor Cang?But ... How could there be two Emperor Cang?Emperor Cang had entered tianfang universe and there was no reason for him to come out. Then ... What was this cat?Seventh rank!Bathed In Lightning and time, the cat seemed to have come to life. Nearby, the three lightning Giants seemed to have been waiting for a long time.The moment ermao appeared, the three Giants charged towards him!Er Mao didn't try to block it. Instead, it opened its mouth wide. The lightning giant wasn't a true grade 7, it was just lightning, Primal Chaos lightning tribulation!In an instant, the three Giants were swallowed!It seemed like ... It had completely disappeared.Second cat, on the other hand, seemed to have hiccuped and muttered,""I'm ... So full!""Second cat!"Li Hao roared. It was time!Hurry up!Second cat ... Was completely stupefied.I don't want to!I know what you want me to do, but I ... Really don't want to.'Big cat is so miserable. He's fighting every day. I don't want to learn from big cat ...'In the next moment, he opened his mouth and swallowed the giant on Qian Wuliang's head. Then, he rushed toward Hong Yitang and swallowed the other giant."Go!" Li Hao roared.He didn't care about the giant above his head. He held the giant sword and slashed at the giant elephant!On the elephant's side, it was also resisting a lightning giant, but it was not so easy to defeat. Seeing that Li Hao was coming, its eyes turned cold, and its long nose broke through the void and charged at Li Hao!At the same time, the two Dao Masters, Silvermoon, were charging over!"Help me!" The giant elephant Emperor's expression changed as he roared,"help me block the lightning tribulation!"Nearby, the three venerable sovereigns were all cursing!How?It was their first time going through the chaos lightning tribulation, so they didn't have any experience and were flustered. Li Hao's team had experienced it many times, including Qian Wuliang's team.They had some experience, but these Primal Chaos emperors had no experience at all. At this moment, they were about to collapse from the lightning tribulation.But ... He had no choice.If one of them was really killed, it would be a huge problem.The black Tiger Imperial venerable roared and pulled the lightning giant from The White Tiger's head with his huge tiger claws.""Go save the giant elephant!"One against two!This venerable sovereign was also going all out. The giant elephant couldn't die.

Chapter 3295 The Bloody Battle Of The Four Sides (3)
If one of them died, they might completely collapse.The number of lightning Giants was also decreasing, but there was not a single one left on their side.Li Hao turned around and was also shocked.So strong!This fellow could even fight against two by himself, and even get The White Tiger to come to his aid ... It had to be said that these beasts of primordial chaos, putting everything else aside, had really strong physical bodies, and ... The Dragon Realm under master Long's command was also United!If it was the other three regions, at this time ... They would run first, would they be able to save you?At this moment, Li Hao couldn't help but think that in the three regions, after he had killed four level Seven venerable sovereigns, the other venerable sovereigns wouldn't dare to get involved. However, none of them had escaped. This was something to be admired!"Second cat!"Li Hao roared again, but at this moment, second cat was really full. It burped, and the power of Thunder gushed out of its mouth. It was almost unable to walk. It looked at the emptiness in front of it, which was looking at it expectantly, as if it was waiting for it to eat the one in front of it.Second cat wanted to cry!I can't eat anymore, I can't eat anymore ...It opened its mouth and swallowed the Thunder giant in front of Kong Ji. Its fur exploded and became fluffy.Burp ... Boom ...He hiccuped and lightning exploded. Kong Ji was overjoyed, it was gone!Without saying a word, he charged straight at The White Tiger. Six divine fists erupted as he shouted madly,"Quickly kill them!"BOOM!He blocked The White Tiger, and The White Tiger also roared madly. Once the giant elephant was killed, the chaos would collapse!The two of them instantly engaged in battle. At this moment, the empty fist of the six paths exploded to the extreme, causing the entire void to explode. 'I'm going to reach tier 7, and I can't let The White Tiger get there!'As for Li Hao, he roared and the two rivers of DAOs merged with him. He didn't let the two venerable sovereigns attack anymore. Instead, he absorbed all their power of DAOs into his body.Li Hao's aura rose again!"Time, freeze!"With a deafening roar, the power of time erupted, threatening to freeze Bai Xiang in place.Bai Xiang was fighting Li Hao while resisting the lightning tribulation. At this moment, he was also affected by the time radiation. He roared and struggled madly, his body bleeding and the great Dao universe shaking violently!"Help me!"It also kept roaring, no longer asking for help from the nearby venerable sovereigns, but kept roaring,""Azurefox, yunshe ..."It was calling out to the chaos monsters of the other Seven Realms in the distance.He couldn't care less about the five demon worlds!If he didn't come to help soon, this place would collapse and a disaster would sweep across the entire Dragon field. This Silver Moon King was extremely crazy, so crazy that in his eyes, he was even crazier than a neo Martial Emperor!Who would dare to control the primal Chaos lightning tribulation like this?Aren't you afraid of being killed?However, the other party ... Dared!At this moment, the Thunderbolt master also roared,"if we don't fight today, there will be no chance for us to turn the tables!"“He couldn't let the other rank 7s participate in the battle ... Otherwise, once the lightning tribulation dissipated and a few more rank 7s came, he would be in trouble again. At this moment, he really saw an opportunity, a huge opportunity!We ... Have a chance of winning!He was ecstatic and shocked.There was hope of winning!This was the greatest opportunity in the past 300000 years. It was also ... An opportunity that he had never dared to think of. ……In the distance.The seven chaosworlds trembled continuously. Soon, chaos beasts flew out of the worlds as if they were going to cross the chaos and space to save people.However, at this moment ... Three incomparably huge pandas appeared.The iron eater venerable sovereign, a seventh level peak venerable sovereign, was holding a huge iron staff in his hand. It wasn't bamboo, but a real iron staff. The iron staff made a loud bang, as if it was rooted in the chaos!The giant panda had a fierce look in his eyes and sharp teeth."Who dares to leave?"It was also shocked and extremely shocked.However, at this moment ... It saw an opportunity, an opportunity to break the Dragon Lord's rule!It did not expect that the four worlds, including the Earth Dragon and longxuan, had a total of nine seventh level venerable sovereigns, and even the same number of venerable sovereigns as the seven Worlds here. In the end ... They were in danger of being completely annihilated!It was too unbelievable!However ... He couldn't care about that. At this moment, he only had one thought. The opportunity had come. He couldn't let the venerable sovereigns come to help. Otherwise, the situation might be reversed!  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ In an instant, the auras of more than ten seventh level venerable sovereigns appeared and shook the entire universe!The 17 seventh level venerable sovereigns, without exception, all appeared in the chaos. An extremely seductive green Fox demon murmured softly,""The demon worlds of the five directions want to fight to the death with us?"The Alliance was unbreakable to the chaos beasts. At this moment, these chaos beasts all revealed a murderous intent.If the demons of the five directions didn't retreat, then they would fight!The chaotic race had led a miserable life in the chaos. They were the Masters in the Dragon field. Whoever wanted to break this situation could only fight to the death!The iron-eating beast roared, baring its teeth and roaring,""Then let's fight! You're the Outlanders of the Hundun and the Dragon field. We're the local demons. You don't have the right to enslave us!""Kill!" BOOM!A great battle broke out. The 17 seventh rank venerable sovereigns were engaged in a fierce battle, causing the sky to fall and the earth to crack!The iron eater venerable Emperor was fighting one against two.A metal rod waved and forcefully stopped the two rank 7 sector Lords. Within his black and white eyes, there was only killing intent and madness!If they didn't fight this battle, the local demons would have no chance.Boom! Boom! Boom!On this day, the entire square region was in a frenzied battle.On the side of the chiyang region, at this moment, even a battle between the eighth-rank and the seventh-rank had erupted. The number of seventh-rank participants was as high as ten. The neo martial artists had made their move!In the entire four-sided zone, if not counting the tianfang great Dao universe, there were more than a hundred Level Seven auras in the outside world.At the same time, a fierce battle was taking place in the tianfang great Dao!The entire square region was in chaos. Countless high-leveled venerable sovereigns were killed in the chaos.Who was wrong?No one was wrong. This was chaos.The powerful pressure that soared to the sky even spread to the outside of the lightning territory. At this moment, even if there were rank eight venerable sovereigns outside the lightning territory, their hearts would still palpitate. Had the square territory ... Gone crazy?They were all fighting to the death. Was the type 9 world recovering or something else?Why did it seem like there was more than one battlefield?It seemed to be exploding in all directions.

Chapter 3296 The Heavens Changed In All Directions (1)
The four-sided region was in an intense battle.The Thunder World, the five demonic clans, the tianfang universe, the Crimson sun World ... Fierce battles were taking place everywhere!The aura of a tier 7 being permeated the entire Primal Chaos!Countless small and medium-sized worlds trembled at that moment. Some of the middle and low-level venerable sovereigns trembled. They had never felt so many powerful auras before. The pressure covered the entire square domain, and there was no way to escape.It was as if there was a battle going on everywhere!Four-sided domain, what about it?……Within tianfang universe.The Dragon Lord had actually sensed that another Dragon had fallen. However, the current him was calm and composed, as if he was completely ignorant.At that moment, the Overlord of the chaos race acted as if nothing had happened.He only glanced at venerable sovereign Chi Yang in the distance!At this moment, venerable red sun was extremely anxious. He had sensed that someone was attacking the red sun region and even shaking the great path universe. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to sense it.One had to know that the chiyang region had four level 7s and one level 8s!Such power was a complete level-eight universe.But now, it was still being attacked. A large number of venerable sovereigns had fallen. Although no seventh-level venerable sovereigns had fallen yet, this was a sign of extreme danger for him. It also meant that the Crimson sun realm might have been breached, and the middle and low-level venerable sovereigns were being slaughtered!New martial!Only neo martial!Venerable sovereign Chi Yang was anxious. He, along with another level 8 and two level 7 experts from the outer region, surrounded the killer king and the others. He roared,"Hurry up and open the sky!"At this moment, Dragon Master, Yun Xiao, and Hong Yue had gathered close to 20 seventh level venerable sovereigns. They were surrounding the area and splitting the universe, trying to open the great Dao universe by force.It was just that ... He failed several times.Venerable sovereign Chi Yang was extremely anxious!As for Yun Xiao and Hong Yue, they seemed to be in a daze, as if ... They were waiting for something.What was he waiting for? Of course, they had to wait for the red sun City to be broken through!They had become independent cultivators and couldn't bear to see others better off. In fact, with so many powerhouses gathered, it was still possible to open it by force, but ... At this time, Yun Xiao and Hong Yue took the initiative to erupt and resist the light Thearch who was unwilling to participate!We are defending the light!There's no choice, you Chi Yang, just wait a little longer.As for whether or not neo martial would enter rank-8 after taking down chiyang ... The probability was very high, but perhaps only at that time, everyone could really join forces. At the current stage, those who controlled the great world were not willing to make too much effort. That was because he still had confidence.When everyone lost their big world, they would all be stray dogs. Perhaps that would be the time when neo martial arts would really be extinct.Both Hong Yue and Yun Xiao seemed to have seen through this.At this moment, they were extremely cold and not anxious.As for the Dragon Lord, he seemed to be constantly contributing. However, he also had this thought in mind. The three powerful Dragons beside him were also contributing.As for the Dragon Lord, he had already set his eyes on Chi Yang and the others at this moment.On Chi Yang's side, there were two tier 7 and two tier 8 experts ... However, Emperor Cang and human King were not weak either. With the two of them joining forces, even though they were being suppressed by Chi Yang and the others, it was still a two-on-four battle. It was still difficult to determine the winner.Furthermore, Emperor Cang's speed was faster than expected. The moment the others surrounded them, the two of them would escape. Their goal was clear. As long as the others did not join forces to open the realm, they would not care.Not far away, the light Thearch also often caused trouble. The others also had different thoughts ...Such a scene was actually very familiar to human King.In the past, it was the same inside new martial arts. A large number of experts were besieged in one place, and they could also break through the fake heavenly tomb by joining forces. In the end ... They all had their own ideas and could not work together.He had only replicated that one time. Although the person had changed, his thoughts were the same.At this moment, no one knew the exact situation outside, but they also knew that ... The situation was not too optimistic. Cloudsky was already gone, and now Chi Yang should be under siege. Whether or not they could block it was also unknown.The former level eight world was now only bright and unharmed. The dragon world was still among them. Of the other three worlds, two had been destroyed, and one was in a precarious state."Yin and yang!" p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The yin and yang of heaven and earth reversed, and the human King, who had just expended a huge amount of energy, seemed to have recovered in an instant.Under the combined attacks of the four powerhouses, the peak seventh level human King was unbelievably powerful. In the past, it was already difficult for him to kill a seventh level human King, but now, he seemed to be going all out!In fact ... It seemed to be supported by the world and the universe!One had to know that it was very difficult to support them in this Dao universe.The Dragon Lord was still thinking about something when he suddenly turned his head to look at the human King. His gaze flickered slightly and was somewhat solemn as he looked at the human King. At this moment, a divine light appeared in his eyes. He glanced at the human King with some doubt.Everyone knew that the human King was powerful. He could break into the dark World alone and kill the Master of Darkness with one strike. He even destroyed the great path universe and the world. Everyone knew how powerful he was.But ... Here, two tier 8 powerhouses were attacking the human king and emperor Cang. Even if Emperor Cang and the human King were to join forces, they should have been defeated long ago.Why ... Did he become braver the more he fought?It was as if he would never get tired?The Dragon Master was a little puzzled but did not say anything. Neo martial might be a major disaster in the future, but at the moment ... He could not care about this. The human race was too strong and there were too many monsters. He could only eliminate them one by one.At present, new martial could still help him eradicate many great enemies!

Chapter 3297 The Heavens Changed In All Directions (3)
As for what had happened in the Dragon field, or whether there had been an accident during the expedition to the Thunder World, he could not care less. If some rank Sevens died, so be it ... Compared to what he was going to do next, the death of a few rank Sevens was acceptable.He was still waiting for an opportunity, an opportunity that everyone was waiting for. Scarlet Sun City ... Had been broken through!Could neo martial do it?With a rank eight venerable sovereign in charge, would he be able to break through his defenses and break through his great path universe, turning him into an itinerant cultivator and causing his strength to drop instantly?The Dragon Lord was a little agitated and a little uneasy ... For many years, such emotions rarely appeared again.In the distance, the human King was already bleeding all over, but he still laughed coldly."Rank 8, that's all you've got!"He struck out with his saber, but his main target was not Chi Yang, but the level eight expert from the outer region. He said coldly,""The matters of the four regions will be settled by the four regions. When did it become your turn to participate? Be careful not to get caught. I don't think there's much hope for your brother to survive!"The eighth level venerable sovereign from the outer domain also looked extremely cold!At this moment, he was a little angry and said in a low voice,""Human King, you can only be so arrogant in the four-sided domain! You're nothing outside the four-sided domain! If you, new martial, dared to come to my bombshell in Sifang region, you would have been annihilated long ago. How could you be so arrogant?" p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  He was a little angry and annoyed!Twin realms was considered a top realm in the outer realms.With two rank eights in charge, there were eight rank eights under their command. This time, the brothers had come to the four-direction zone, bringing with them two rank seven venerable sovereigns. Their original target was Tian Fang.However, tianfang's recovery was fake, but a trap set up by a Grade 7 Lord.It trapped a bunch of level 8 martial artists!That was not all ... At that moment, the level eight from the outer region was even angrier. What made him even angrier was that the level eight here ... Had too many schemes. They were all scheming. There were so many Level Seven and level eight venerable sovereigns there, but they had yet to break through the silent level nine great Dao universe!It was not just level eight venerable sovereigns who were not doing anything. The level Seven venerable sovereigns ... Seemed to be waiting, as if they were waiting, waiting for the opportunity for level eight venerable sovereigns to fall and for Level Seven venerable sovereigns to rise!p Of course, if his brother wasn't still in the chiyang zone, he would be happy to watch the show.However, his brother was in charge of Chi Yang's side!The human King laughed. It was a brilliant but sinister smile."Old man, if I don't die this time, when I leave the outer region ... I'll be the first to destroy your twin world!"The outer region's grade eight expert no longer spoke any nonsense. The power of his great Dao burst forth, causing the heavens to collapse and the earth to crack. However, he was still destroyed by the other party's saber!This guy could really be regarded as a grade 8.How detestable!…… Chiyang region.The battle had already erupted in the Crimson sun World.In the Crimson sun World, four seventh-level and one eighth-level venerable sovereign were working together to resist. After devouring the cloud heaven great path universe, Supreme sovereign Wushan had barely entered the eighth-level, and at this moment, he was fighting fiercely with the foreign eighth-level venerable sovereign!On the other hand, the four rank-7s of chiyang were in charge of the world and had nearly a hundred venerable sovereigns under their command to resist the invasion of the neo martial venerable sovereigns.Although the neo martial Supreme emperors were strong, the other party was in charge of their own territory. Because of the destruction of Yunxiao, they had long been prepared. Neo martial was not able to catch them off guard. At this moment, they could not take down the four Supreme emperors in an instant!The Supreme martial artist had yet to participate in the battle.At this moment, only Li Zhu, venerable sword, the catacombs King, the earth King, and the blood Emperor, who had advanced to tier 7 by devouring the power of the cloud world, were fighting. Three of them were fighting four of the other tier 7 neo martial artists, while the remaining two were slaughtering the ordinary venerable sovereigns.On the whole, neo martial artists still had the upper hand. However, Wu Shan had just advanced to rank-8 not long ago. It was still a little difficult for him to deal with that rank-8.Around them, there were a few rank seven venerable sovereigns who hadn't entered Tian Fang yet. At this moment, it seemed like someone wanted to help but was worried about the danger and was hesitating.All parties seemed to be maintaining a stalemate.The Grandmaster looked at the battle. There were still a few people behind him who hadn't joined the battle. They were the rank 6 heavenly suppression King, the rank 6 divine inheritor, and the rank 6 nether King Li Zhen, his old friend.There was also the Tier 6 Qin Fengqing and the Tier 6 heavenly Hound ...The number of level six neo martial artists was beyond imagination.Moreover, most of them were not far from Level Seven, but with insufficient Yang Qi, neo martial artists could not enter the eighth-tier universe. It was as difficult as ascending to the sky to enter Level Seven.At this moment, The Golden Dog's fur was as hard as steel, and its eyes were full of arrogance."Martial King, why don't you let me join the battle?"On the other side, Qin Fengqing, who had a shaved head, was also laughing."The warrior king probably doesn't want us to join the battle. He probably thinks that we won't be able to fight once we join. These guys are going to die. He thinks that we're stronger than the few tier 7s who are participating in the battle ..."The heavenly Hound glanced at him. Crazy!If you can defeat a seventh-rank, why are you still talking nonsense?"No hurry!"The Grandmaster chuckled and looked around. He then looked at the Crimson sun World and said,"The realm of the Crimson sun is full of Yang Qi, but no matter how much Yang Qi there is, how can it not be stimulated? Venerable sovereign Chi Yang is a Dao master. If all the rank 7s die, he'll definitely extract a huge amount of Supreme yang power and leave, becoming a rogue cultivator. That'll be a great loss ..."He smiled meaningfully."Wait a minute. Let them see a chance and release more daosource Yang Qi for these seventh rank venerable sovereigns. Otherwise ... If they all get taken away, what's the point of us attacking an eighth rank world?"

Chapter 3298 The Heavens Changed In All Directions_3
Hong Yue, Yun Xiao, and the others quickly knew that they could not continue because a level Seven venerable sovereign had died. They quickly extracted a large amount of great Dao power and left the great Dao universe.If the four level Seven cultivators of the Scarlet sun region were to die soon ... As long as venerable sovereign Scarlet sun was not crazy, he would definitely draw away a large amount of great Dao power and become an itinerant cultivator. He would not cut off his flesh bit by bit and hold on to hope!The heavenly Hound was too lazy to think about this. It only felt that this fellow had too many ideas and was really a bad person!Obviously, the other party was still waiting for the four seventh level venerable sovereigns to see hope and draw more Yang Qi to fight the neo martial artists!After all, there was still hope with one rank eight and four rank seven experts.The only Level Seven neo martial artists who did not participate in the battle were the Supreme martial artists.At this moment, the Supreme-being looked at the Dragon field in the East. There were still countless flashes of lightning there, but there were fewer than before. There were many seventh level venerable sovereigns fighting in the two places, but it seemed that there was no winner.The Silver Moon King?If he was really the mastermind, he was really amazing!"I, a new martial artist, can't lose face. They're already slaughtering a seventh-rank, and we're still at the seventh-rank. That's too embarrassing. Although new martial artists only have an extra thousand years, in the chaos, a thousand years is nothing.However, neo martial ... Was unique!Silver Moon was just a small world that the neo martial artist had left behind. How could he be caught up by the other party?Today, his neo martial art would definitely enter the eighth grade!He watched silently. Not only did he have to take down Chi Yang, but Fang ping had better take down venerable sovereign Chi Yang as well. Otherwise, his yang energy might still be insufficient. A rank-8 had drawn away a large amount of yang energy, and it might still not be enough."Fang ping, under such circumstances, can you take down Chi Yang? If he couldn't take it down ... It might be a little difficult for him to directly enter grade 8 today.The wait continued for a while.The four seventh-rank experts were as dazzling as four suns. Their combat strength seemed to be stronger than before. The experts of the Scarlet Sun World were confident. On the other side, the eighth-rank expert from the outer domain had directly shattered venerable Wushan's five-finger Mountain. Even his heaven's secrets path had been slightly broken.Blood of Wushan!At this moment, Wu Shan was also shocked and somewhat helpless. Why didn't the Supreme of neo martial arts participate in the battle?If he had joined the battle earlier, he might have been able to turn the situation around. But now ... Even if the other party joined the battle, it might be troublesome.He did not understand!He didn't understand why the Supreme martial artists of new martial arts kept watching. Were they guarding the nearby seventh-rank venerable sovereigns who might come to help?Perhaps it was necessary.But ... Now that the situation had changed, something big might happen. Fortunately, he had reached the eighth rank and came to participate in the battle. Otherwise, there would be no hope for neo martial arts to attack chiyang.At this moment, they might still be able to retreat and leave the Crimson sun World. Without the advantage of being native, the four level Seven venerable sovereigns would not be able to suppress the few Level Seven venerable sovereigns of the neo martial artists!The outer region grade 8 laughed coldly,""New rank 8, not bad, you have some ability! However ... It seems like there's no hope for you to defeat the Scarlet sun sect today!" Wu Shan coughed up blood."You're from another domain. This is an internal Battle of the Square domain. What does it have to do with you? is Chi Yang your father?"The outer region grade 8 laughed coldly and didn't bother.If an outsider didn't find a partner here, wouldn't it be even more difficult to survive?There were many experts in the four-sided domain.Chi Yang was a very good partner, both sides needed each other, this was the best ally. Since they could stop it, why not stop these guys from devouring Chi Yang?BOOM!The great Dao erupted and once again pushed Wu Shan back. Wu Shan kept retreating as his five fingers stirred heaven's secrets. The great Dao seemed to be everywhere, but soon, it was all broken by this outer domain level eight!Wushan, who had just entered grade 8, was still no match for the other.On the other side, the four seventh level red sun cultivators were like the sun, shining brightly and suppressing the sun god, Sword Master, and Li Zhu. These three seventh level cultivators were the top of the seventh level. A sixth level Sword Master could kill a seventh level cultivator!However, at this moment, he was still suppressed by his opponent!Although it was three against four, this didn't fit their image of being a tier 7 powerhouse.At this moment, the Supreme martial artist, who had been watching the battle from the outside, glanced at the four seventh rank venerable sovereigns and smiled. It was almost the limit. The four seventh rank venerable sovereigns had at least half of their Scarlet Yang Qi.Any more, probably nothing more.Any more, and venerable sovereign Chi Yang himself would have to suffer a great loss. This was probably all the Yang Qi He could provide to the four great sovereigns.The remaining portion was with venerable sovereign Chi Yang."I'm almost at my limit ..."The Autarch murmured.At this moment, a book appeared in his hand and he chuckled.""Today, everyone calls me Supreme, Supreme, and Supreme. I'm really flattered! Back then, when neo martial arts was first established, I was called the martial King and established myself with martial arts ... Be it the human King, Emperor Cang, or anyone else present ... Who dared to regard me as a scholar?"I'm a martial King!"No one thinks you're a scholar, only you think so!" Someone muttered.“……”  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  The martial King turned his head to look and smiled. He patted Qin Fengqing's big bald head gently and chuckled softly. "It's been a thousand years, but you're still as naughty as a child. You're right. Don't say it again, understand?"“……”Qin Fengqing did not say a word, but his scalp was numb. 'Alright, I won't say it again next time. Can you put down the hand that's holding my head? you're rubbing my scalp off!'"How can I let this Silvermoon junior see me as a joke? the day Red Moon was destroyed was already a joke ... Today, I can't let this junior see me as a joke!"

Chapter 3299 The Heavens Changed In All Directions (3)
With a chuckle, a book appeared in the air.In the next moment, a great Dao seemed to appear directly. This great Dao seemed to have tens of thousands of people submitting to it, and tens of thousands of emperors prostrating in front of it. It was the Dao of a sovereign, the Dao of a Human Sovereign!The Imperial Dao was illustrious!The book glowed with a golden color, and a pointer appeared in his hand. A crown seemed to have appeared on the head of the Supreme one, and it also seemed like ... A divine spark of faith formed by the faith of the people?The four seventh level venerable sovereigns looked at him warily, but they were not afraid of anything.Even if Supreme Venerables participated in the battle, it would be four against four. As for venerable blood Emperor and the others, they were still entangled with the middle and low-stage venerable sovereigns."It's been so many years, it's my turn!"Grandmaster chuckled.In an instant, the book suddenly scattered into pages.A Supreme-being appeared on one page of the book!In an instant, over a thousand Supreme martial artists appeared.They did not seem to be very powerful, but they were all venerable sovereigns. These countless Supreme sovereigns seemed to be avatars. At this moment, they were even somewhat similar to Li Hao's thousand world path.The 1,000 Supreme martial artists turned into a huge net. The clones, which weren't too strong, instantly connected with the great Dao and turned into a net, enveloping the four great emperors.At that moment, the three level 7 sun gods all erupted!Sword intent, fist intent, and a Book of Darkness appeared instantly. In an instant, they were much stronger than before. The four Emperors trembled, but they couldn't stop the net in time!Buzzzzzz!The net fell and enveloped the four of them, even cutting off their connection with the universe of the great path.The four of them were shocked!However, he didn't have time to think about it. In an instant, a person appeared with a crown on his head and a pointer in his hand. He struck one of the People's heads and said with a calm tone,""You're disobedient!"Bang! Bang!The whip had hit the other party's head ...A seventh level venerable sovereign, who was incomparably powerful, had his head crushed like tofu with a light tap. His head turned into nothingness in an instant, and a huge sun appeared!That was the Scarlet sun Dao mark!A page of the book appeared in an instant and took the red sun away. A seventh level venerable sovereign was killed by his whip so easily!The remaining three people turned pale with fright!What Dao was this?At this moment, it was as though they had been trapped by a huge net, fixed in place, locked in place, and unable to move. A smile appeared in the Paragon's eyes, and as though he were educating a child, he said in a soft voice,"This is the way of the people. Tens of billions of people in neo martial arts all hope that chiyang will belong to me. It's really difficult to refuse the will of the people. Everyone, please grant me my wish!"The pointer appeared again.He knocked on one of them lightly, and that person's expression changed drastically. He struggled madly and let out a violent roar. The great Dao burst forth, and the red sun appeared. He forcibly broke the net of Dao on his body, and just as he heaved a sigh of relief ...The Grandmaster seemed to be angry, and his expression changed. He, who had been calm and collected a moment ago, suddenly became angry. He threw away the pointer and appeared in an instant. He clenched his fist and smashed it down at the other party. The next moment, he raised his fist and crazily punched out more than 10000 times!BOOM!  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  The seventh level venerable sovereign was directly blown up on the spot. The Supreme sovereign was furious."You still dare to disobey the law?"Just be obedient and accept your death!You still dare to resist?Beside him, the three neo martial venerable sovereigns were dumbfounded.Did the human King learn from you, or did you learn from the human King?You two have been together for a thousand years. Have you influenced each other?As for the Supreme martial artist, in his anger, he raised his fist and smashed the other party alive. Then, he quickly shouted,""What are you doing? get to work and kill!"In an instant, the three venerable sovereigns attacked!The remaining two seventh level venerable sovereigns were originally on par with the other party, or even one level higher. However, in the blink of an eye, the situation had been reversed!In the distance, the eighth level venerable sovereign's expression changed.How could this be?The next moment, he roared and sent Wu Shan flying with a punch. He immediately fled. Chi Yang was finished!Out of the four seventh level venerable sovereigns, two had died in an instant. The remaining two would not live for long. Run!Wushan still wanted to stop him, but the Grandmaster shouted, "Don't chase after a desperate enemy!"Wu Shan was startled. They're not chasing anymore? BOOM!The remaining two seventh rank venerable sovereigns were killed in the blink of an eye. The heavenly Hound and the other venerable sovereigns rushed out one after another, slaughtering the middle and low rank venerable sovereigns in the blink of an eye. Covered in blood, venerable sovereign Wu Shan quickly returned. He was somewhat confused, shocked, and unwilling."If I stop him, there's a chance I can kill him ..."There were so many experts. Just now, these few people could have sent people to stop them.As for the Grandmaster, he merely glanced in the direction of the other party's escape and laughed. His laugh was filled with deep meaning. "Don't worry. If he doesn't run, how do we know where his lair is?"Eh?The Grandmaster muttered again,"Yang Qi is almost enough, but my new martial arts ... Have too many sixth-grade ones!" Was he really going to massacre the entire square domain? That's not good ... An eighth-tier twin universe, double-tier. It's such a big world, and it's even stronger than an ordinary eighth-tier universe. It can at least give birth to five, six, seven, or eight seventh-tier universe, right?"“……”Wu Shan felt like he had encountered a group of lunatics!At this moment, the Grandmaster suddenly laughed,""Yang God, longevity sword, Lizhu, follow venerable sovereign Wushan and chase after them! Expel the other party from the four-sided domain!"Wu Shan was startled. Why was he chasing again?The next moment, he came to a realization. Was this ... Deliberately giving the other party a chance to escape and not letting him stay in the four-sided domain? was he trying to expel him and return him to his native world?
