        explained,"some of the swords gate disciples were not willing to try and comprehend it. They insisted that Hong Hao and the others had contributed more and should try to comprehend it first. Even if they could comprehend 'force' on their own, it would be good for them to have more knowledge. Hong Hao had no choice but to agree ...."
         Li Hao didn't say anything. The disciples of swords gate were quite United.
         Hong Hao had yet to enter the 100-man cultivation circle, and those people probably didn't want to snatch his opportunity.
         "What's the situation now?"
         "Liu Yan, Hong Qing, and the others have all comprehended force on their own. Li Heng and Hong Chou have also ..."
         Hong Chou, the Martial Master whose family had been killed by the Pirates.
         Li Hao wasn't too surprised. When Li Hao said that he would hang the Pirates up, this guy seemed to be excited. It was unknown whether it was because he was in a good mood or because he felt that killing Pirates would make his thoughts easier.
         He caught up from behind and surpassed many people.
         "There are a total of 16 people who have comprehended force;; Liu Long continued;
         "So many?"
          Li Hao was slightly surprised. He had estimated that 10 people would be good enough.
         "Yeah, quite a lot."
         Liu Long also laughed."You said before that you would let everyone indulge for a day. Perhaps everyone will feel better. Who knows? anyway, this is a good thing!"
         Out of the 49 martial masters who hadn't entered the great circle, 16 of them had entered the great circle.
         If Hong Hao, who was still comprehending, was included, there were 17 people.
         More than a third!
         This ratio was not low.
         Li Hao was a little surprised, but he soon felt relieved. The martial masters sent by swords gate and the inspection Office were all talented in martial arts. Otherwise, they wouldn't have been able to continue practicing martial arts in this poor place where superpowers were rising.
         Those who were not suitable for martial arts would have converted to superpowers long ago.
         "That's good!"
         Li Hao looked at the sky. It was already dark. It was the night of the 8th, and the 9th was coming soon. According to their speed, hou Xiaochen and the others, who had left on the 4th, should be arriving in stellarsky city soon.
         ? Since Hong Hao was still comprehending force, Li Hao wasn't in a hurry. He chatted with the others for a while.
         Hong Qing and Hong Hao had returned in the afternoon the day before yesterday, and they didn't have time to report to Li Hao. At this moment, Hong Qing walked over and said,""Guild leader, my father said that we shouldn't send anyone to his place next time ..."
         "Why?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao found it strange. Why was Hong Yitang so petty?
         Only a few people!
         He's so pitiful and you're not going to save him?
         Hong Qing was also embarrassed."My father said ... If there's a first time, there'll be a second time. You don't know how hard it is to clean up the mess. You dared to bring more than a hundred people back today. Next time ... You can bring him an entire city's people. He'll believe it." So, next time, if you ... If you do the same thing again, I'll let you manage the company for a month, and then he'll be willing to take over. "
          Li Hao was a little embarrassed.  He understood!
         Mr. Hong thought that Li Hao only knew how to send people here and had no idea how difficult it was to manage and rescue these people. He wanted Li Hao to experience it, but Li Hao ... Was not stupid.
         I know!
         Don't think that I don't know. I know. I won't do such a thing. Do you think I'm stupid?
         "Cough cough!"
         Li Hao coughed and didn't continue the topic.""Let's not talk about this. Let's talk about the ruins first!"
         As soon as he said that, everyone perked up.
         "The ruins are within the Silver Moon territory, and not too far from Whitemoon city. The gold spear chiliarch has tried to explore it a few times before, but he failed halfway ..."
         "There's still danger," Li Hao said in a serious tone."Just because Captain gold spear is fine doesn't mean that we're fine. This ruin doesn't look too big from the outside. Golden spear senior conjectured that it might be a Castle built by a family during the ancient civilization, or a small sect or something. Of course, it could also be something else ... It's more or less like this. "
         "As for these ruins, the difficulty lies in the small path that leads to the main gate. There will be sudden attacks ... I've been to heaven battling city, and I have some speculations. Perhaps the tree demon has become a demon!"
         "I don't know if it's a tree demon left behind from back then or if it was born later ... It's hard to say."
         Hong Qing was puzzled,'it was left behind? After so many years, it's time for him to die. "
         "It's possible. It could also be an old tree sprouting. I've never been there before, so I'm not too sure. However, from the clues left behind by golden spear senior, I guess that's the case!"
         "If this is the case ..."
         Li Hao's eyes flickered."Then we might have a lot of gains. There might not be as many treasures in this place as in heaven battling city. But if there really is a tree demon, we might be able to obtain the legendary spring of life ..."
         He had a drop of this.
         However, he had never taken it out. Last time, hou Xiaochen had wanted to trade it with him, but Li Hao had rejected him.
          Living the dead, flesh growing on bones.
         This thing had some effects that were more powerful than sword energy. If your arm or leg was broken, it could regrow it. It had a terrifying effect, but sword energy couldn 't. In fact, Li Hao had a vague idea of what sword energy was.
         It was an extremely pure energy!
         Whether it was the mysterious energy, the divine energy stones, or the soldier souls, they were all devoured by the small sword and then purified, giving birth to sword energy.
         Therefore, sword energy was still a power for cultivation.
         As for the water of life, it was the true special energy.
         As soon as he said that, everyone was a little excited. However, Liu Long still frowned and said,""Then if we go, will we be a burden?"
         Li Hao said indifferently,"it's fine. If there's any danger, we'll retreat. It's not like we have to get some benefits. Besides, Black Panther and I are going ..."
         "I'll go too!"
         Hao lianchuan, who had been ignored, quickly spoke up.
        
         When he heard this, he was excited.
         Li Hao was speechless."Hao bu, are you very free? No one cares about the night watchmen now. You're already at the advanced stage of the three yang realm and the superpower lock has appeared. Why don't you go back and slowly cultivate so that you can enter the rising light as soon as possible?"
         "There's no rush for those few days!"
         On the side, Wang Ming was getting anxious. This fatty Hao, he's stealing my words.
         I didn't even say it, but you said it first.
         Yet, this guy was stronger than him, and he couldn't even win against him.
         Li Hao didn't know whether to laugh or cry."Alright, it's just a small ancient ruin, so there might not be anything good inside. It's different from heaven battling city, which is a city, while this place can only be considered a small village."
         If it weren't for the possibility of tree demons, Li Hao wouldn't have been interested in exploring them.
         Otherwise, he would not be too interested even if he got some divine power stones.
         ……
          As Hong Hao finished his cultivation, he had indeed comprehended Shi, and at this point, the demon hunt squad's three days of cultivation came to a complete end.
         Li Hao wanted to try his luck again, so he didn't delay.
         After resting for three days, he was used to moving at night. Without saying anything, he took out the giant chariot divine boat. This original divine weapon was to Li Hao's liking. Not only could it swim in the water, but it could also fly in the sky.
         At this moment, Li Hao just wanted to experience what it was like to fly in the sky.
         This time, there were even more people.
         Last time, there were 55 people. Now, including Hao lianchuan, there was one more person, 56 people.
         Since Li Hao's group had traveled on the ground the last time, Li Hao decided to have the giant chariot soar into the sky this time. He did not want to be monitored, and he knew that Silver moon's side and the other parties were likely to be watching him.
         Even though these people might not have any ill intentions, Li Hao still hoped that he could hide his tracks.
         On the flying boat, Li Hao paid attention to the superpowers around him. Li Meng was also assigned a task by Li Hao to check if there were other martial masters in the air or monitoring them.
         Li Hao could only see things related to energy systems, but Li Meng's third eye could see much more.
         A third eye appeared on Li Meng's forehead.
         He didn't observe anything as Li Hao had said.
         Then, Li Hao felt something strange. He seemed to have sensed something and looked at Li Meng. At this moment, Li Meng seemed to be in a difficult position, but he was still very excited.
         Rays of light flowed around everyone and then enveloped the entire Swift Boat.
         Li Meng's panting could be heard,"isn't it just to prevent others from checking?" Leader, watch me, illusory space! As long as we cover the entire ship, all the surveillance is just for show ... As long as there isn't a strong Esper, they won't be able to see us!"
         Li Hao raised his eyebrows. In other words, they were now invisible to some people.
         "Similar to an invisibility spell?"
         "Something like that ... But the invisibility spell is different from mine. I distorted some things to create visual errors. I'm not sure how I did it."
         A visual error!
         Li Hao nodded slightly. This ability was not bad.
         However, it seemed that the consumption was not small. Li Meng's strength was too weak. After maintaining it for a while, he felt like he was on the verge of collapsing.
          Li Hao had no choice but to channel some sword energy into her body.  The Dark Moon realm ... Was so weak.
         It had only been a short while, and he couldn't hold on anymore.
         He scanned the sky and avoided some of the patrolling supers. There were also supers patrolling the night patrols but the city was mainly composed of people from the inspection Office. There were also supers and martial masters on the inspection office's side.
         Avoiding them all the way, Li Hao soon drove the spaceship and disappeared from white moon City.
         In the city, the people from the inspection Office, who had just upgraded their inspection system, did not notice anything at all.
         ……
         Inspection Office headquarters.
         Kong Jie frowned slightly and glanced at the sky. After thinking for a while, she walked to the window and stepped out. She looked around and found something strange.
         After pondering for a moment, he suddenly took out a black banner and sent out a mental wave."Li Hao, where are you?"
         "Base, what's the matter, director Kong?"
         "Base?"
         "It's fine." Kong Jie's spirit fluctuated again."It seems that martial masters have invaded the White moon City ... I'll call Huang Yu to kill them!"
         “……”
         Li Hao, who had just passed through white moon City, was speechless.
         Was he saying this on purpose or for real?
         "There's no need!"
         "Oh!"
         Kong Jie didn't say anything more, but she said angrily,""Don't sneak around in the middle of the night anymore. It's easy to get hurt by mistake. I thought it was a mistake. Alright, you have to report the next time you go out!"
         He really thought that an enemy had invaded, but after some consideration, he realized that it was more likely to be Li Hao.
         As expected, it was that kid.
          This guy didn't become a Night Watcher for nothing.
         As expected, he didn't go out until night time.
         Where were they going?
         Of course, it was not appropriate for him to ask too much. He could only curse a few times. It would be fine as long as this fellow did not look for trouble.
         It wasn't safe for Li Hao at this stage.
         ……
         Li Hao exhaled helplessly. It seemed that white moon city's defense was more powerful than he had expected. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been discovered as soon as he left.
         However, this was also good. It was safer.
         The few from white moon City had some skills and could not be underestimated.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Meng couldn't hold on any longer after they left white moon City, but Li Hao didn't let her continue. As the spaceship rose higher, Li Hao used his inner strength to sustain the spaceship's energy consumption. If they were flying, the consumption would be even greater.
        
         Soon, Li Hao steered the spaceship in the direction of yaoguang city.
         The ruins were over there, not too far away.
         ……
         At the same time.
         The night was dark.
         In the East.
         In the distance, the palace-like building was brightly lit, and it was a magnificent sight in the night.
         It was the world famous Duke dingguo's mansion.
         At this moment, on a Street less than three thousand meters away from the Duke dingguo's mansion, the old man looked at the Duke dingguo's mansion in the distance and coughed lightly. His eyes swept around and he sighed. "I'm back. I've failed you. Young master Feng ... Is dead."
         It took her eight days to rush back.
          From the North to the East, it was actually closer than the central region.
         However, she had not been on the road for the past eight days. She had even recuperated for three days along the way. She had been injured by the southern Fist earlier.
         The surroundings were silent.
         The old man coughed again."Although I'm old, I still have my senses. Don't underestimate the senses of a Martial Master."
         A moment later, a person walked out of the darkness.
         The street was still dead silent.
         It was an armored expert. He revealed his face and looked at the old man."Chief Hu, the high Duke asked us to come and pick you up so that you won't be followed. From the looks of it, you still have your strength and are not seriously injured, right?"
         The light sword looked around and sighed again."All of you, come out!"
         The brawny man who had appeared earlier glanced at the old man and said nothing. The light sword was indeed the light sword. Its senses were so sharp. They had thought that they had hidden themselves very well, but they had still been easily discovered.
         "Since the chief has spoken, everyone, come out!"
         A moment later, three more people walked out from the four corners of the street. Including the person from before, there were four experts walking out.
         The light sword looked at the few of them and coughed."Dingdong, Dingnan, Dingxi, and dingbei, the four great generals, have all come. What an honor!"
         The dingguo Army was stationed in the East. There were many soldiers in the Army, a total of 800 thousand people.
         This was only the Army that belonged directly to the Duke dingguo's mansion.
         These 800,000 people were led by the eight generals.  North, South, East, and West, heaven and earth were dark and yellow.
         Above the eight generals were the two second-generation di sons of the Duke dingguo's mansion, Xu Zhen and Xu Xing. Xu Zhen was Xu Feng's father, and above him was the Duke dingguo, who served as the Grand Marshal of the dingguo Army.
         Tonight, however, there were four great generals gathered here.
         These four people had powerful auras.
         Previously, they seemed to have been concealed by something. At this moment, their auras were revealed. All of them were extremely powerful, and there was a bloody smell on their bodies. Clearly, they were not pure cultivators Xiaobai, but the kind that had killed before, the kind that had killed many people.
         The one who appeared before was general ding dong. At this moment, he said slowly,"Chief Hu, we were martial masters back then. The four of us grew up in the high Duke's public house and only transformed into super ... Force when we broke through 100 perfection! We understand that too!"
         "What do you mean, general?" the radiant sword coughed.
         "Nothing much. I just want to tell you that the four of us are all in the late stages of the rising light realm, and we're all martial masters. We're not ordinary supers either. We command an Army and kill ... We've seen too many things."
         "The supervisor is a Martial Master from Silver Moon. He's powerful and has broken through the limit of thousand-man combat. He's a pioneer on the path of martial masters. We respect him and never neglect him ... Now, young master Feng's death is also fate! State Duke is magnanimous and doesn't have the heart to pursue the matter ..."
         The light sword did not speak.
         The general continued,"however, you returned late at night, and there was no news of you on the way back. We all thought that you had chosen to leave because you were worried about the Duke's condemnation ... Since you're back, that's for the best. You've been traveling for a long time and are very tired. The Duke is also resting now. Why don't you pay a visit to the Duke tomorrow? we also want to ask you about some of the problems you have in martial arts ... Why don't you come with us to the military camp for a night?"
         To the military camp!
         The light sword smiled and looked at the few of them. He looked around and finally looked at the high Duke's public house in the distance. He could vaguely feel that someone was looking down at him.
         "It seems like ... A Silver Moon Martial Master has leaked some information to us?" she sighed."What did he say?"
          "I don't know what you mean!" General ding dong said in a deep voice.
         "Don't you guys understand?"
         The light sword thought for a moment, then shook his head and laughed,"It must be that dog Ying Hongyue! It's a pity ... A pity, a pity that I wasn't Born Pretty. Otherwise, I'm afraid that Ying Hongyue would have to take pity on me ... Seeing how ugly I am, does she want me to die early?"
         She looked at the few of them and then at the surroundings.""The high Duke is such a cautious person, yet he only allowed the four of you to come? The four great martial masters are at the late stage of the rising light realm, and it's easy for them to kill a peak stage rising light realm expert ... But I'm a Silver Moon Martial Master, does state Duke look down on me?"
         With the Martial Master and silver Moon added to the equation ... They were no ordinary people.
         The four generals "expressions turned serious. At this moment, a man walked over from the distance. His footsteps were not soft, and he didn't look old. In the dark, he was wearing a red cloak.
         "What if I join the light sword?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The man was very young, and the Sword of Light slightly raised his eyebrows. "It's said that the four great generals, heaven, earth, black, and yellow, are even better than the four of North, South, East, and West ... But I thought it would be general Tian. I didn't expect it to be general Xuan."
         "They have other things to do. I should be enough."
         The young man's aura instantly burst out. If Li Hao were here, he would have sensed that his aura was even stronger than that of the great snake of Cang Mountain, but not as strong as that of the other three demons.
        
         He was only one step away from the peak of the rising light realm and was about to enter the transformation stage.
         Four of them were at the late-stage of the rising light realm, and one was at the peak of the rising light realm.
         The five sunrise powerhouses surrounded the light sword. The new general Xuan said coldly,""As long as you surrender ... You might not die! You shouldn't have had such crooked thoughts! The high Duke pitied you for not having an easy life in martial arts. You didn't protect young master Feng well, and all these years, the high Duke's public house has supported your cultivation. Light sword, do you really want to be the one who betrayed your master?"
         "Betraying the master?"
         The light sword laughed,"what do you mean?" "When I came to the Duke dingguo's mansion that year, I came for the wind chasing boots. Xu Qing, that old man, once promised me that as long as I worked for the Xu family for 20 years, he would give me the wind chasing boots ... Later, he changed his mind and said that I couldn't use it or control it, but his grandson Xu Feng could. He was old and weak, so he asked me ... Asked me to marry his grandson and become a family. Although I know that this is only a combination of interests, for myself and for the care of the Duke dingguo's mansion all these years, I still did my best ..."
         "It's been 20 years since today!"
         He sighed,"why do you think I only returned today?" "Time's Up. According to the agreement that year, today, you should give me the wind chasing boots. Xu Feng is dead. I'm somewhat responsible for it because I didn't protect him well. But that day, I did my best. Unfortunately, I couldn't defeat the strong enemy. There's nothing I can do ... You can't let me die, right?"“
         After saying that, she looked into the distance and said in a loud voice,""Xu Qing, you don't want to?"
         "You want to go back on the promise you made twenty years ago?"
         Her voice was loud, but it was frighteningly quiet in the distance.
          Sword of Light sighed."I understand. I didn't have much hope at first. I just didn't expect that in order to deal with me, even the surrounding people would be evacuated. They've made up their mind not to let me leave alive!"
         She laughed at herself."Compared to others, my personality is considered gentle. Otherwise, I would have fought to the death a long time ago. I really have some expectations ..."
         That's right, among the 36 males, she was one of the gentler ones.
         One of the reasons was that he was no match for the other, and the other was that he wanted to complete the transformation in peace. He never thought that after twenty years ... He would still come to this step.
         "Then ... Let's fight!"
         In an instant, a sword appeared between heaven and earth, illuminating the entire sky!
         The next moment, the light sword let out a roar. In the blink of an eye, her heart, lungs, liver ... Three of the superpower locks were broken. At this point, she did not even consider delaying!
         This was the Duke dingguo's mansion.
         It was not a place to delay.
         If this dragged on, even if she broke all five of the chains, she would not be able to walk out of here alive. She knew how dangerous this place was and she had to end this as soon as possible!
         In an instant, the sky fell and the earth cracked!
         With an eye-piercing light, the five generals roared and instantly attacked with their weapons!
         "Kill!"
         The Sword of Light let out a roar. At this moment, the power it released was even stronger than the southern Fist. The sword shook the void and cut through the sky and earth. BOOM!
         With a loud bang, the valiant general Xuan's expression changed slightly as he thrust his spear forward!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The long spear was instantly broken by the sword of Light. In an instant, the Sword of Light roared again and half of the fourth chain was broken. His combat power increased again!
         "Die!"
         BOOM!
         The longsword exploded in all directions. The ground cracked completely and the surrounding houses collapsed one after another. Under the sword, general Xuan kept roaring in disbelief ... But he still couldn't block the sword!
         Pfft!
         The sword fell, and a line of blood appeared on general Xuan's head.
         The Sword of Light roared and didn't look at him again. A power that seemed to want to burn the world emerged again. It wasn't fire element, but the feeling of being roasted by the sun.
         The sword rippled and streaked in all directions. All the houses disappeared in an instant, as if they had been evaporated!
         The four generals had just surrounded him ...
         In the blink of an eye, the five of them stopped moving. They stopped in their tracks, their eyes filled with disbelief.
         As for the light sword, it was bleeding from all seven apertures. Cracking sounds came from its body, and its internal organs were also being crushed.
         She revealed a smile and seemed a little crazy.""You ... Don't know about the Silver Moon Martial Master?"
         He rose into the air and traveled a thousand meters in an instant. In another flash, he was already close to the Duke dingguo's mansion.
         At this moment, in the distance, the old Duke dingguo's eyes revealed a touch of fierceness as he looked coldly at the light sword.""Think carefully. If you continue like this ... You'll die without a doubt. Even if you take the Windchaser's boots, you won't live past today!"
         He understood!
         Or rather ... He knew very well what kind of situation he was in.
         The Sword of Light did not say anything. In an instant, it struck its chest with its palm. With a boom, it was as if something had exploded. The sound of the chains breaking rang out. The fifth chain!
         Blood flowed out of her seven orifices like an evil ghost."Hand it over. Otherwise ... I'll die. Unless you unseal it, the Duke dingguo's mansion will cease to exist today!"  "I didn't expect you to have come this far ..."
         The next moment, he shouted and kicked the light sword, his powerful aura instantly erupting. "We'll have to see if you have the ability to do so!"
         BOOM!
         A deafening sound reverberated in all directions. The huge courtyard exploded in the blink of an eye, and countless houses collapsed. Some servants exploded.
         No one had thought that the old Duke dingguo would reveal his extremely powerful strength at this moment.
         As for the light sword, it seemed to have known about it long ago.
         With a sweep of the sword, the sky collapsed and the earth cracked. The Sword of Light shone in the world. BOOM!
         The sound exploded again. With a rumble, the Duke of dingguo retreated, blood spilling from his mouth. His eyes changed slightly. After unsealing ... Was he really so much stronger?
         At this moment, he was a little restless.
         However, the next moment, he saw that the light sword's five internal organs seemed to be shattering. Seeing that the light sword was about to go completely crazy, he suddenly sighed and threw out a storage ring."Take it and go. Don't force me ..."
         The light sword took the storage ring. The next moment, it shouted,""Only one?"
         "Do you still want to take them all?"
         "I just don't want to pay too big of a price ... Or do you think that you have the confidence to kill me now?" Duke dingguo said coldly.
         The Sword of Light's eyes were filled with unwillingness, but when it sensed its current state ... It gritted its teeth, rose into the air, and disappeared in an instant.
         In the distance, the moment she flew away, the five generals exploded with a loud boom!
         The two second generations of the high Duke's public houses who had just arrived were shocked by this scene!
         He's dead?
         Five generals were killed in an instant!
         "Father!"
         The two of them hurried over at a fast speed. Nearby, there were also other three suns of the rising sun. The eldest young master Xu Zhen hurriedly said,"Father, you gave her the wind-chasing boots? If you continue to pester her, she ..."
         Duke dingguo glanced at him, his eyes somewhat cold. "Let's continue. If she knows that she's going to die ... Even if she can't kill me, I'll be crippled. What do you know!"
         He could only fight against the light sword with five unsealed superpower locks.
         However, at that time ... It would be troublesome.
         He did not expect that the light sword had been cultivated to such a level. This was not the point. The point was that after cultivating to this level, that old witch actually dared to break all the Super locks ... In this case, even if she took the wind chasing boots, she would not be able to live!
         His five internal organs would collapse!
         "Get someone to track her, she won't be able to escape!"
         Duke dingguo snorted coldly and glanced at the generals in the distance. He frowned slightly, feeling a little heartache and regret. If the five generals joined forces, they could kill even a transformation stage cultivator.
         In the end ... In the end, the light sword unsealed their combat strength and killed them all!
         Even he felt a little heartache at this moment.
         Five experts!
         Also, does my eldest son want me to die early?
         Just now, the powerful light sword actually let me hold it back for a while ... At this moment, because of Xu Feng's death, the Duke dingguo, who was dissatisfied with this son, was even more dissatisfied!
          The light sword was in such a state that it was unrivaled. However, it would soon completely collapse. Where could she run to?
         He couldn't lose his wind-chasing boots.
         Moreover, there was only one, and she couldn't use it, so it wouldn't be of much use even if she took it away.
         A moment later, a large group of powerhouses chased in the direction where the light sword had disappeared. They did not dare to get too close. That person was too powerful, but the group of powerhouses still followed her closely, waiting for her to exhaust herself to death.
         ……
         News of what had happened in the East quickly spread.
         At this moment, Li Hao had already left white moon City. He did not know that the light sword had been activated so quickly, nor did he know that the light sword was currently running toward Silver Moon at an unimaginable speed.
         It was very, very far away ... But there was still hope.
         However, Li Hao was already on his way to the remains.
         He promised that he did not do it on purpose.
        
         The East was in an uproar.
         However, Silver Moon was still quite far away, so Li Hao would not be able to hear him for a while.
         The dynasty was too large. Even if it had some special means of communication, Li Hao did not have his own intelligence system. Silver Moon did, but Li Hao was not the core of this system yet, so he naturally would not share it with him.
         ……
         The giant venomous ship flew for about two hours. After traveling about 500 to 600 miles, Li Hao landed on a Green Mountain.
         The environment was very beautiful.
         This place wasn't completely deserted. There was a small town at the foot of the mountain. It was already late at night, and there were still some flickering lights.
         The divine boat landed without a sound.
         The group of people quickly got off the divine boat.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Hao lianchuan was indeed a Minister who had been working for many years. He looked at the place and said,""Cat head mountain is shaped like a cat's head. It's considered a small scenic spot. Back when the world was not in chaos, people often came here for sightseeing."
          On the side, Wang Ming quickly said,"it's not just cat head. There are also many stray cats here. It's less than a hundred miles from yaoguang city and is under the jurisdiction of yaoguang city."
         Hao lianchuan shot him a glance.
         Wang Ming wasn't to be outdone and also looked back.
         I was the one who introduced him before, but fatty Hao stole the job!
         On the other side, Li Meng opened his eyes. This woman had always been carefree. He opened his third eye and looked towards the mountain."I didn't see anything. There seemed to be some wild beasts in the mountains, but they didn't look like the legendary great demons."
         The few supers all wanted to show off their skills.
         Yunyao was quiet. She looked around and didn't say anything. She was just an ordinary Water-type super. Her main task wasn't to fight, but to heal these martial masters.
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He just took out a map.
         The map was this mountain.
         There was a red dot marked on it, which was where the ruins were.
         "Let's go!"
         Li Hao took the lead, and the others quickly followed.
         The cat head mountain was not very steep. Strictly speaking, the mountain was not very big. The environment was quite beautiful, but it was not very steep.
         There were ruins in this place?
         Of course, since golden spear and the others had discovered it, it would not be fake.
         Li Hao searched for a while and found the marked point on the other side of the mountain.
         Here, halfway up the mountain, there seemed to be a small cave. Outside the cave, there were dense vines. If one did not pay attention, one would not pay too much attention to it.
         Li Hao rose into the air, and the others quickly climbed up.
          A moment later, Li Hao pushed aside the vines, revealing a pitch-black cave. From the way it was opened ... This remains wasn't anything special.  Compared to heaven battling city's Grand structure, it was somewhat ordinary.
         There was no opening that had transformed into a wall, only a pitch-black cave that even smelled a little fishy.
         There were even some bats that caused a commotion when Li Hao's group entered.
         "Pa!"
         With a soft sound, flames rose and lit up the entire dark cave. It was Hao lianchuan.
         The fire elemental Master of the three yang casually snapped his fingers, and a ball of fire appeared in front of him, illuminating the surroundings.
         Wang Ming rolled his eyes."It's so late at night and it's bright here. Be careful not to attract attention."
         "What does it matter if we're in the Silver Moon territory?"
         Hao lianchuan retorted and then shot Wang Ming a glance. "Good boy, don't forget that I'm the Head of the Department. Even if I'm an Acting Director, I'm still the Head of the Department. You're still hanging out with the night patrolman, kid."
         He even dared to challenge his superior!
         Li Hao and the others pretended not to hear him. Liu Long looked around. It ... It didn't feel like a relic. The martial masters who were entering for the first time also looked at each other in surprise.
         At this moment, the cave had already appeared. It was very dirty and messy. There were even some bird droppings and a strong stench.
         This is a relic?
         Everyone was speechless. Li Hao looked around and walked toward the end of the cave without saying anything.
         At the end of the cave, there was no stone or iron door. It was obvious that it was man-made.
         At the end, at a corner, in an unremarkable place, there was a small hole. It seemed to lead straight down, but it also seemed to have been dug out by someone who was digging a grave.
         "According to the information left behind by golden spear senior, we should be able to reach the ruins if we enter this cave and go underground ... However, earth-type superpowers might not be able to find the ruins even if they go underground ..."
          The earth element was actually very suitable for exploring ruins.
         However, some relics might not be found even if you rummaged through the ground. They were clearly underground, but you just couldn't see them.
         For example, in heaven battling city, you passed through the valley and entered the wall through the earth ... Then, you really passed through the wall as if the entrance didn't exist at all. Some ruins didn't seem to exist in this space.
         Everyone was a little curious. Some of them stuck their heads out to look at the hole, but it was dark and they couldn't see anything.
         However, he had a deep feeling about it.
         The hole had a diameter of about one meter. The others were fine, but Hao lianchuan stuck his head in to take a look. He gestured to his body size and nodded. 'It won't get stuck, will it?'
         This action made Hong Qing and the others lower their heads and laugh.
         Wang Ming also took the opportunity to speak."Hao bu is broad and fat. It'll be inconvenient if he gets stuck. Why don't we just wait up there? we just happen to need someone to keep a lookout, and we can't all go in. Otherwise, if we get stuck, no one will be able to ask for help."
         Li Hao felt that it made sense.
         Hao lianchuan didn't wait for Li Hao to speak before he said,""I'm a fire element user. If I go down, I can light up the surroundings for everyone. Moreover, if a tree demon really becomes a spirit in the late stage of three yang realm, the fire element will be more effective against tree demons!"
        
         "The metal element won't be that useful," he added.
         “……”
         Li Hao laughed and said,""You guys wait up there, I'll go down and take a look ... Commander Liu, come with me. Just the two of us will do. If superpowers go down, there might be some reactions."
         Of course, he couldn't lead the team down directly. It was too dangerous if he didn't understand it.
         Li Hao didn't give them a chance to refute. He waved at Liu Long, and the two of them jumped down.
         Above, after everyone had jumped down, Hao lianchuan sent a voice transmission to Wang Ming."Good boy, are you deliberately going against me?"
         "Hao bu, you're the one who's going against me. I'm already in a difficult situation, and you're still getting involved. Just focus on being the department head. Why are you taking my job?"
         “……”
         Hao lianchuan was also depressed. Who stole your job?
         I'm just trying to build a good relationship with Li Hao.
          The fifth SuperLock had appeared. He was now at the late three yang stage, but it was not difficult to reach the peak of the three yang stage. However, there was still a barrier between the peak and the rising light Stage. He was hoping that Li Hao could help him.
         ……
         Let's not talk about the open and secret fights between the two.
         Li Hao jumped into the black hole and felt that it was dark all around him. Even he couldn't see his surroundings clearly. He only felt that the hole was like a tunnel that led to the core of the earth.
         Just like that, he continued to fall.
         After a minute or two, Li Hao finally felt like he was falling.
         It also felt as if he had stepped on cotton, as light as a feather.
         Li Hao felt that he could fall a thousand meters after such a long time. A thousand meters underground?
         Wouldn't that be the rock stratum?
         This thought flashed through Li Hao's mind. A moment later, Li Hao felt a slight movement beside him. Liu Long had also jumped down.
         The surroundings were still pitch black.
         However, he was gradually getting used to the darkness.
         After a while, Li Hao saw some silhouettes. In the distance, there seemed to be a Castle. It wasn't sealed off by soil. Something seemed to be in the sky, blocking everything above.
         It left a space that wasn't too big.
         Ruins were also divided into different levels.
         This kind of remains was considered to be of a decent level. Some remains were not protected and had long been buried by mud. It was already very well preserved that the remains were intact.
         On the side, Liu Long had also adapted to the environment for a while. He could vaguely see the front and transmitted a message,"Is that the castle?"
         The Golden spear didn't seem to have entered.
         Instead, he had encountered some trouble outside and had no choice but to retreat.
         Li Hao looked around. At this moment, his eyes were getting clearer and clearer. The surroundings were foggy, as if some kind of formation or origin divine weapon was protecting the surroundings, leaving only a small space.
         Other than the castle in front ... He didn't see much.
          There were no trees, no flowers, and no sunlight ...  It was a barren land with a Castle in the dark.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The Golden spear, however, was unable to enter the castle.
         "Be careful!"
         Li Hao reminded him. Silver armor appeared on his body to protect him. The starry sky sword also appeared in his hand. He was on guard. The Golden spear was not weak. It had the battle strength of a rising light.
         However, he did not manage to enter the core.
         The place where they had landed looked like a hole, and they should be able to get out. Otherwise, the Golden spear would not have been able to leave.
         He didn't know if he could directly walk out of the other places.
         The two of them carefully walked forward.
         The soil under his feet was soft and did not feel like soil. He felt like he was stepping on cotton.
         Jin Jin didn't leave behind any more information, because even he himself hadn't been able to enter. This ruin had been discovered by the Wei Wu Army by accident, and not by the address provided by hou Xiaochen.
         After walking for about a hundred meters, the castle was getting closer and closer to them.
         At this moment, Li Hao's ears twitched, and he slashed his sword to the left!
         There was a local Shout!
         As if two weapons had collided, the next moment, the sharpness of the starry sky sword was revealed. Crack ... Something seemed to have broken. Before Li Hao could take a closer look, his expression changed slightly, and he hurriedly brandished his sword.
         Clang clang clang!
         A series of sounds rang out, and even a series of sparks were produced.
         Li Hao kept swinging his sword.
         Liu Long also swung his fist, but his hands were in extreme pain from the impact. Upon closer inspection ... A branch-like object had pierced through his fist. Liu Long was shocked.
         He thought that Li Hao's attack power was ordinary, but after hammering for a while, the branch actually pierced through his fist.
         "Be careful!"
          Li Hao shouted in a low voice and waved his long sword, enveloping Liu Long in it. He cut off dozens of branches in a row, and the attack disappeared.
         Li Hao was on his guard for a while. He looked around and didn't feel any threat. He lowered his head to see if it was a branch that had attacked him. But what he saw shocked him!
         No more!
         That's right, he had clearly cut off many branch-like things just now, but now, there was nothing on the ground. It was empty. There was nothing on the cotton-like ground.
         Li Hao's expression changed. This place ... Could it be that it ate people like heaven battling city?
         If that was the case ... His expression changed slightly. He stomped his foot and the sword force exploded. BOOM!
         The ground trembled slightly, but it did not break through!
         Li Hao's heart trembled. What a solid ground.
         With his current strength, it was a little terrifying that he could not penetrate the ground.
         These small ruins felt very weak compared to heaven battling city.
        
         But at this moment, Li Hao was a little shocked. Could there be something stronger here?
         The attack power of these branches was not weak. It was comparable to the three suns.
         Li Hao could deal with dozens of them, but any more ... He couldn't take it. No wonder the Golden spear chose to retreat. If this continued, even Li Hao wouldn't be able to take it.
         Liu Long saw it as well. His expression turned solemn as he transmitted a message,"This ground ... Is not ordinary ground. It is extremely tough. We have to be careful in this place."
         "I know."
         Li Hao didn't say anything and continued walking.
         After walking for a while, clang clang clang sounds rang out again. In the darkness, countless vines and branches attacked him again. Li Hao waved his sword and cut off some. The next moment, he punched out, and his fist turned into a claw.
         He directly grabbed a vine and with a loud shout, the vine was broken.
         The broken branch in his hand seemed to be alive, struggling and twisting rapidly. In the darkness, there seemed to be a powerful mental fluctuation, as if it was threatening and intimidating!
         Li Hao didn't let go. Instead, he held on tightly.
          A moment later, the attack disappeared again.
         Li Hao's hand was also scratched by the broken branches.
         However, he could finally see what the thing in his hand looked like.
         It seemed to be a long crystal.
         It was crystal clear.
         Needless to say, it was extremely strong. Even Li Hao, who was as strong as Xu Guang, could only break one. Moreover, it could easily escape if he was not careful.
         Even though it was broken, it still seemed to possess considerable combat strength.
         Li Hao carefully examined it and frowned.""Is this a branch?"
         It didn't look like it.
         But if it wasn't ... What was this?
         Also, where did these attacks come from?
         It came and went without a trace, as if it had been launched from the darkness around them. However, Li Hao had just approached the edge of the darkness, but he couldn't see anything.
         The attacks came in waves.
         However, there seemed to be an interval in between. If the attacks continued, even Li Hao would have to consider escaping. If the attacks continued, it would be dangerous for him.
         Thinking of this, Li Hao glanced at the castle not far away. These things seemed unwilling to let him enter the castle.
         This place ... What exactly was this place?
         An ancient civilization's family territory?
         Sect?
         The Academy?
         Li Hao didn't know either, but he was even more curious now.
         Just as Li Hao was thinking about this, he and Liu Long continued to move forward. However, at this moment, a special wave swept over. It was no longer the branch from before.
         BOOM!
         As if his head had exploded, Li Hao let out a roar. His divine intent burst forth, and a glint appeared in his eyes. His powerful divine intent burst forth in an instant. Tiger out of the cage!
         Boom! Boom! Boom!  The sound of the collision seemed to only be in his mind. It continued for a while. Then, there was a boom, and a muffled groan. Then, everything disappeared.
         The attack had also disappeared.
         Li Hao quickly looked in one direction. It was also dark there, but at this moment, he could vaguely make out some outlines, as if something was there.
         His eyes flickered, and a moment later, he vaguely saw more things.
         One, two, three ... Small orbs appeared one after another.
         He didn't see it before.
         But now, he saw it. It seemed that the collision just now had broken some seal. Li Hao recognized what it was. It was a divine power Stone. Yes, a divine power Stone with sufficient energy.
         Li Hao could see the energy fluctuations of the divine power stones that had more energy.
         However, he had not seen it before.
         Li Hao could see that there seemed to be a lot of divine power stones there, but they had been covered by the spiritual fluctuation just now, so Li Hao couldn't sense the energy fluctuations.
         "Grandmaster ..."
         A thought came to Li Hao's mind. Was this the Grandmaster recorded in the ancient civilization?
         He had read in ancient books that only grandmasters could use mental power.
         It was the current divine decree.
         However, the two were not quite the same. In the collision just now, Li Hao had realized that his divine intent was not as strong as his opponent's in terms of quantity, but in terms of vitality, his opponent's mental power was more rigid.
         Vitality ... Li Hao could only say this.
         This was because the divine intent of a Martial Master was sometimes as if it was alive. For example, when the five birds technique incarnated into various beasts, it actually substituted one's body into them as if they were living creatures.
         It was naturally easier to deal with them.
         Li Hao looked at Liu Long warily and said,""There's something over there ... Boss, be careful. "
         Liu Long nodded slightly. He had also suffered some spiritual attacks just now, but they were mainly aimed at Li Hao, so he could deal with them.
         The two of them, one in front and one behind, did not head towards the castle. Instead, they walked towards the corner.
         ……
         When Li Hao got close, a powerful spiritual wave came from there again.
          It swept over!
         BOOM!
         Crash!
         This time, Li Hao was so shocked that he wanted to vomit blood. It seemed even stronger than before?
         He even wanted to retreat!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It's so strong, be careful not to be killed by the impact.
         However, in the next moment, his eyes flickered again. At the moment of the explosion, some of the small orbs of light seemed to be about to shatter and disappear, and the remaining ones seemed to dim.
         Li Hao's heart moved. He seemed to understand something.
         Energy!
         This thing in the dark was absorbing energy, erupting, and then expelling him ...
        
         It wasn't that he didn't want to attack all at once, or that he wanted to slowly torture Li Hao to scare him, but that he seemed to be lacking in energy. He could only absorb the energy from the divine power stones and unleash it bit by bit.
         There was a break between the attacks, but after a few attempts, not only did they fail to scare Li Hao away, but Li Hao also saw through some of their tricks. The enemy did not have many divine power stones!
         Just as his opponent was about to explode again, Li Hao's divine will suddenly fluctuated.""Stop! I am the regimental commander of heaven battling city's heaven battling Army!"
         After saying that, the silver armor bloomed with light.
         "I'm a member of the eight protector clans and have come to investigate this place. Do not act rashly!"
         He spoke these words in the ancient language.
         They were both existences from the ancient civilization. If this thing was really passed down from the ancient civilization, he should be able to understand it.
         In heaven battling city, the Golden and silver flames were also fluctuating in this way.
         However, there was no sound in the darkness.
         However, Li Hao could see that the ball of light was still shrinking, which meant that the other party was still absorbing the energy. It didn't seem to give up unconditionally just because he was a member of the heaven battling Army.
          If the Golden spear was here, he would not be able to see through the opponent's strength. With the opponent's continuous attacks, he would have no choice but to retreat.
         However, Li Hao was different. He could see the ball of light, and at this moment, his divine will fluctuated again. "Don't absorb and consume energy stones anymore. There aren't many energy stones here. If you continue to consume them ... You'll be completely exhausted, and you might die completely! You can't scare me. I'm here on orders to explore the remnants of the new martial era. If you can understand, you should understand that the heaven battling Army is not a villain ... Unless, back then, your side was the rebellious side?"
         "Betraying ... Betraying ..."
         At this moment, Li Hao's words seemed to have triggered something, and a weak fluctuation slowly rose.
         A moment later, Li Hao's vision blurred. Suddenly, he felt as if his surroundings were shining.
         His expression changed slightly. At this moment, he saw a tree not far away. It looked like it was dying. The big tree had already collapsed, and it seemed like there was only one branch left. It sprouted and grew again from the root of the dead tree.
         The old tree seemed to have died!
         However, the old tree took root and a new tree was born!
         Tree demon!
         Sure enough, Li Hao was relieved. It really was a tree demon. He had guessed this before, and now it was proven. It was like a dead tree that had been reborn in the remains.
         ? The surroundings seemed to be illuminated by this tree. It was originally extremely dark, but at this moment, this tree was like a crystal. It was clearly not big, but it illuminated all directions.
         "Betraying ... Betraying ..."
         "Zhan ... Heaven ... City ..."
         The small tree was slowly moving. At this moment, Li Hao looked carefully and his eyes flickered. This tree and the dead old tree were intertwined. Their roots seemed to be one, and now, their roots were exposed.
         Li Hao could tell that it was the roots that had attacked him.
         One of the tree roots was broken, probably by Li Hao. The others that he had cut off seemed to have recovered after falling into the ground. It was clear that this tree could recover on its own.
         "Heaven battling city!"  Li Hao repeated, of the eight great protector clans, the Wang family's heaven battling city! In the past, the venerable sovereign had given him a name!"
         The sapling seemed to have recovered a little, and it swayed its slightly withered branches.""Di ... Venerable sovereign ..."
         In the next moment, a fluctuation was transmitted."Venerable sovereigns ... Can ... Can't ... Break into ... The palace ..."
         Li Hao's expression changed.
         Palace?
         What Palace?
         Not even venerable sovereigns ... Venerable sovereigns were Supreme existences. What else could venerable sovereigns not do?
         He looked at the castle in the distance. At this moment, the surroundings were lit up and he could see a thing or two. This Castle ... On closer look, why did it feel like ... It was a cat?
         Li Hao was a little suspicious.
         In addition, from the position of the old tree, this tree should be a tree outside the courtyard wall. It seemed to have been casually planted in the past, not a true defensive force.
         What was this place?
         "What Palace?"
         Li Hao asked. He looked at the dying tree again.""You seem to be lacking energy. After the outburst just now ... You seem to be dying?"
         That's right, he felt that this little tree that grew out of the big tree root might be dying.
         "Death ..."
         His mental energy fluctuated, and the crystal-clear little tree swayed for a while, feeling like it was about to fall.
          "Don't ... Think ... About ... Entering ... The palace ..."
         "Even if ... It's an abandoned ... Temporary residence ... I can't ..."
         Li Hao could see that some of the divine power stones hidden underground had been absorbed again.
         Li Hao frowned. This tree seemed to be the guard of this place.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com A Palace, an abandoned Palace?
         Whose Palace was this?
         Despite the passage of countless years, it was still able to defend itself. From the looks of it, this place wasn't like heaven battling city, which was already equipped with powerful defenses. And yet, the defenses around it ...
         In fact, Li Hao could vaguely see that it seemed to be related to the dead tree. Before the tree died, it seemed that the whole tree had exploded ... Strictly speaking, it might be ... Similar to the tree hole outside heaven battling city.
         Yes, they were probably in a dead tree.
         The small tree, on the other hand, grew from the foot of the big tree. It didn't seem to be a tree from the ancient civilization era, but it seemed to have inherited some memories.
        
         All kinds of thoughts emerged in Li Hao's mind.
         Had a tree always been protecting this place?
         Even after it died, it used its remaining energy to give birth to a small tree to continue guarding this place. However, the small tree seemed to be dying.
         Li Hao was even more curious about the ancient civilization.
         In this era, both humans and demons seemed to have a unique power of faith. For example, the tree in front of him was dying, but it still carried out its faith and orders.
         Li Hao thought to himself, does this tree have the water of the spring of life?
         It was said that the water of the spring of life was born from these tree demons, but it seemed that it needed to absorb a lot of energy to form it.
         The divine power stones that were buried might be the last reserves.
         In such a situation, he still dared to produce the spring of life?
         Do you want to die?
          So ... It was possible that there was no such thing.
         Li Hao immediately felt a little dejected. Of course, if it was a tree demon that could produce the spring of life ... Li Hao would probably be even more dejected, because it meant that the other party still had some combat power, and was very strong.
         Li Hao actually did not have much desire to kill these existences from the ancient civilization.
         These existences from the ancient civilization, each person, and even each demon, had a spirit and belief that was difficult to sense in modern times. Li Hao had killed Black Phoenix before, but Black Phoenix actually no longer had a consciousness, only some lingering obsessions.
         At that time, he didn't know about this.
         Now, the tree could still communicate. Li Hao didn't want to kill it, even though it seemed that it couldn't continue to use its power.
         "It's fine if I don't want to enter the palace, but can you tell me whose Palace it is?"
         "I can't mention it!"
         “……”
         These words were rather smooth.
         Li Hao was speechless.
         "I want some water from the spring of life. Do you have it?"
         “……”
         It was silent, but Li Hao discovered that the other party was absorbing the divine power stones even faster. The remaining divine power stones, which seemed to still have some energy, were much dimmer now.
         It seemed that he was prepared to risk his life.
         Li Hao quickly took a few steps back."I have no ill intentions. As the current heaven battling Legion Commander, I'm also in charge of some missions to save heaven battling city. In heaven battling city, general Huai is seriously injured and dying. He needs some water from the spring of life to save his life. General Huai can't be revived, and heaven battling city can't be activated ..."
         His words seemed to have attracted little tree's attention. Little tree had wanted to kill this person, but at this moment, he seemed to have realized something."You ... Are you really the general of Zhan Tian? One of ... The eight great protector clans ..."
         "Of course!"
         Li Hao understood. The other party clearly didn't believe him before.
          "Otherwise, how can I obtain the silver armor?"  "Also, do you recognize the starry sky sword?"
         Li Hao waved his long sword, and the sapling seemed to be stunned for a moment. After a long time, he stuttered,""This ... Is the starry sky sword? Forgive me for my poor judgment ... In ... In my inherited memories ... Starry swords...Is not ... Not so weak, but ... An existence that can tear ... The heavens apart ..."
         It wasn't a tree from that era and only had some inherited memories. Therefore, it really didn't recognize the starry sky sword.
         The reason was that the starry sky sword in Li Hao's hand was too weak.
         Li Hao was speechless.
         It hurt his self-esteem!
         "What's a memory inheritance?"
         Li Hao asked.
         "You ... Are you that ignorant?"
         The small tree swayed, once again feeling suspicious.
         Li Hao said helplessly,"it's been countless years since the neo martial era. The world has changed, and no inheritances have been left behind. Only a few words have been left behind, so it's normal that I don't know much about it. Today, heaven battling city is also in a state of silence. The system can't operate normally, so I can't access much information for a long time."
         The small tree seemed to be silent, as if it had died.
         There was no sound for a long time.
         Just as Li Hao suspected that it was dead and was about to check it out, waves of energy came from the small tree not far away.""Powerful demons will leave some deep memories in their bloodlines or life imprints ... Generation after generation, when their bloodlines and life imprints are activated ... They will absorb these memories ... This is the inheritance of memories ..."
         "Where's that person?"Li Hao's eyes moved.
         I also have the bloodline of an expert.
         "The ... The human race can't ..."
         "Humans gather great power in one body," the little tree continued."Their descendants ... Only have powerful bloodlines ... While demons are born imperfect ... They ... Will have some loss of power, which is the demon bloodline ..."
          Li Hao thought for a moment and quickly asked, do you need help? I can see that you've used up all your energy. "
         "No... I don't need to!"
         Perhaps they were still on guard against Li Hao.
         However, Li Hao did have a feeling that the other party seemed to be in the midst of death. The divine power Stone had been emptied by the other party, as if it could no longer continue, causing it to step onto the path of death.
         Li Hao pondered for a moment and said,"if you die, there will be no one guarding this place. The palace ... Will be mine." If you're alive, perhaps you'll be able to continue protecting this Palace. You're the first person I've ever seen who seems to be alive from the ancient civilization ..."
         "An ancient civilization?"
         "The neo martial era."
         "I ... Am not a creature of the new martial era ... My father was alone ... Guarding the palace for 30000 years ... He couldn't continue. After his death, I was born ..."
         Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. How ... How many years has it been?
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The big tree had guarded this place for 30000 years. It was a terrifying number of years before the small tree was born. How many years had the small tree lived for?
        
         To these terrifying existences, it would easily be tens of thousands of years?
         Also, what kind of strength did this dead tree have to be able to live for tens of thousands of years?
         As Li Hao thought of this, he quickly said,""No matter what, you're an ancient ... Ancient tree. Do you need help?"
         "I don't deserve it ... I'm not ... Not good ..."
         "No, I just want to cooperate with you."
         Li Hao thought of something and said sincerely,""As far as I know, tree demons ... Cough, cough, if an ancient tree is strong enough, it can produce the water of the spring of life as long as there is enough energy. The water of the spring of life is extremely helpful for healing, cultivation, and extending one's lifespan. I'm thinking that if you're alive, I'll provide you with energy, and when you become strong enough, you only need to provide me with some water of the spring of life to guard this Palace ... Don't you think it's a good deal?"
         "Capital city mode?"
         “……”
         Li Hao was stunned. What mode?
         "My memories ... Tell me that back then, many people ... Did the same. "My ancestors would all choose ... To attach themselves to an expert or work together to build a city. We would absorb energy and provide protection and life essence for the city, while human experts would also provide protection for our ancestors ..."
          Li Hao's eyes flickered. Was it like this in the ancient civilization?
         It seemed ... To be true!
         In heaven battling city, there seemed to be general Huai, and not only that, there seemed to be more than a dozen tree demons, but they all seemed to be dormant or dead.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He glanced at the castle in the distance. He was actually very interested in the castle, but this tree ... Might be more valuable than the castle.
         How could an inanimate object be compared to a living thing?
         No matter how many treasures there were in the castle, he might not be able to digest them all. However, a tree demon that had inherited some memories of the ancient civilization might be of greater help to him.
         They could communicate with each other. This was a very good partner to work with.
         Those people in heaven battling city could also communicate, but in fact, they were all dead with incomplete memories, and they wouldn't tell Li Hao anything easily.
         Li Hao's original intention was to explore the ruins, but now he had his eyes on the tree.
         "Yes, that's the plan. I'll provide you with energy, and you'll help me condense the water of the spring of life. It's a win-win situation, killing two birds with one stone. You can still continue to guard this place. Otherwise, once you die, this Palace will probably be gone. Even if I don't go in, others will come."
         The small tree seemed to be lost in thought.
         This model was actually not impossible.
         This was especially so at this stage. Although the person in front of him felt very weak and was not worthy of being its partner, it was said that he was the successor of one of the eight great protector clans and was also the heaven battling Legion Commander.
         If that was the case ... It would be enough.
         However, this person in front of him was so weak. Could he help him?
         Then, he thought about how the person who came last time was even weaker ...
         Perhaps, the person in front of him was already considered powerful.
         "You ... Only need the life essence?"
         "Right!"
         "You ... Don't know how to enter the palace?"
         "Of course!"
         Little tree fell into deep thought. After a while, he said,""If you're really sincere ... Can you provide me with some energy stones?"
         “……”
         This was a trap!
         Li Hao cursed in his heart. I haven't gained anything yet, and you want me to give you benefits? more importantly, this guy can continue fighting after absorbing the energy. Are you trying to trick me?
         "It's possible ... But the quality is average ..."
         As he spoke, Li Hao took out a divine power Stone that was commonly used in this era.
         Little tree seemed to be stunned and dumbfounded. After a long time, he said with difficulty,""This scrapped energy stone ... In my memory, dogs don't even eat it when fed to them ... It can be used for cooking ... You ... You're using this ... To let me condense my life essence?"
         “……”
         "Really?" Li Hao was stunned.
         The small tree was silent.
         At this moment, it seemed to have given up. Then let me die!
         This thing, if you want me to condense life essence, you might as well just kill me now.
          Trash!  Who could eat garbage and spit out milk? it was not like they were cows.
         Li Hao gritted his teeth and suddenly took out a divine power Stone from the heaven battling Army."How about this?"
         Little tree seemed to have seen it. After a long time, he said,""This ... Is only the most basic cultivation-aiding energy stone ... However, it's much better than the previous ones. I can absorb this ..."
         "This, how many? can you condense one drop of the water of the spring of life?"
         “……”
         How many?
         Little tree was stunned. After a long time, he sent another message,""1000."
         “……”
         Li Hao was dumbfounded. One of these stones was equivalent to ten. In other words, 10000 divine power stones of this era could produce one drop of the spring of life. Stop fooling around.
         "You think I'm ignorant?"
         "You ..." Li Hao was a little angry."I gave general Huai 30 last time, and he only gave me a drop of the water of the spring of life ..."
         After saying that, Li Hao took out a bottle and said,""Did you see that? General Huai charges so little, and you want 1000?"
         "That person ... Is stronger than me ... In fact ... Even stronger than my father. And ... I ... I'm not strong enough, so I'll consume more energy. If I'm stronger, I'll consume less energy ..."
         Was it?
         As Li Hao was thinking, little tree continued."Even that person ... Can't use so few energy stones to condense a drop of life essence. Perhaps ... He's just giving it to you."
         Li Hao was deep in thought. Last time, Hong Yitang said that the other party was fishing. Sure enough, it was possible.
         However, Li Hao felt that 1000 pills for one drop was a bit too much.
         The problem was whether they should continue the cooperation.
         Should he just Rob this Palace?
         The main reason was that he couldn't afford to raise them!
         Little tree didn't seem to be too stupid. At this moment, he suddenly sent out a mental message,""A living Fey plant not only has the ability to gather life essence, but it can also gather energy and absorb the energy that seeps out from the world to create a Holy Land for cultivation ... In the past, the human King created a Holy Land for cultivation. A day of cultivation is equivalent to a year."
         "If you're willing to provide enough energy ... I can also open up a Holy Land for you ... In the new martial era, the Imperial City was opened up by the joint efforts of the monster plant and the strong. It attracted hundreds of millions of people to join and condense the way of the human Sovereign ... Of course, they all failed in the end ..."
         Li Hao's heart moved again, the path of the human Emperor? What's that ..."
         "I don't know, I know ... I'm a top-tier expert."
         Alright!
         Then what did you say?
         Can it aid in cultivation?
         Li Hao fell into deep thought."Let me think. It's mainly because there are too few energy stones in our era. I'm afraid I can't afford to support you. The energy stone I took out before, the one you said was trash, is a treasure outside!"
         The small tree was speechless.
         Treasure?
         At this moment, the word 'treasure' refreshed its knowledge.
         Had the outside world really reached such a state?
          Perhaps!
         After all, although the person in front of him was weak, he was still okay. He was actually using such trash and treating it like a treasure. It could be seen that the people of this era were really poor.
         "I ... Can absorb a small amount of it to recover some of my abilities. Then, I can gather the energy from all directions. In this era, there is energy ... The energy I absorbed before was some of the energy that I started gathering decades ago ..."
         Li Hao was still thinking about something when he suddenly had an idea." 20 years ago, there was an explosion of energy. You absorbed some of it and condensed it into an energy stone. You've been saving it for use?"
         "More or less ... It's just that ... The energy suddenly disappeared, and the amount of energy scattered in the void was too little ... I only extracted those ... Until today, I can't continue."
         Li Hao took a deep breath. So many divine power stones just now were stored?
         You were able to form a divine power Stone after absorbing it for a while?
         Oh my God!
         Was a tree demon that powerful?
         At this moment, Li Hao's thoughts changed. He had to swindle ... No, he had to ask the tree to return and cooperate with him!
