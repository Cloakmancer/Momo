        o watch!"
         "Are you deaf?" the inspector frowned. What you said makes sense, and what old Yao said is not wrong. In a dilemma ... Neither is appropriate! Since that's the case, then just watch from the side and let Li Hao and the others deal with it themselves. Do you have a problem with your ears?"
         Huang Long's heart skipped a beat. He was a little surprised, but he also wanted to curse!
         You're the one who called everyone here for a discussion, aren't I?
         You're actually looking for trouble!
         He didn't say anything else. If he continued, this person would get angry.
         The Inspector General stood up and exhaled. He said with some disdain,""I don't care. I'll say the same thing again. Either Li Hao kills 100 nobles and tells me, or he'll tell me after he dies ..."
         He had said the same thing to Xu Qing the last time.
         This time, it was still the same.
         Everyone was cursing in their hearts, what did the Secretary mean?
          At this time, it would not be good if they did not care.
         Sometimes, being neutral was the scariest thing. No matter who won or lost, there would be no benefits. Was the Secretary a little confused recently?
         Before the others could say anything, Yao si had already stood up. He picked up the tea jar and turned around to leave.
         When Huang Long saw this, he did not care much and followed behind. He frowned and said,"Minister, although the Secretary said so, we still have to take care of Li Hao!"
         Yao si smiled and nodded.
         "Then let's have a meeting after we get back," elder Huang said."What do you think, Minister?"
         "As you wish."
         Yao si continued to walk forward.
         As he walked, he raised his head and saw a man walking over from not far away. Huang Long also looked up.
         On both sides, some officials in patrol uniforms fell silent when they saw the person.
         The entire Inspection Office seemed to have quieted down at this moment.
         It fell into a dead silence.
         The inspector who was leaving also stopped and looked back.
         Outside the hall, a man strode in with a dog.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He was no longer wearing a funny windbreaker and top hat, nor was he wearing a scepter. He was only wearing silver armor and a sword at his waist.
         At the door, Li Hao didn't even look at Huang Long. His voice was as loud as a great Bell."Night watchman Li Hao from the star military governor's office pays his respects to the Secretary! Yesterday, the Heavenly Star military governor's office cleared out the four Seas and the Heavenly Star Douluo arena, the two cancer cells, and seized a lot. They are here to deliver the stolen money, five hundred thousand divine power stones, five drops of spring of life, and ten origin divine weapons!"
         p His voice spread in all directions!  In an instant, everyone in the inspection Office looked over.
         Huang Long frowned and looked at Li Hao. They were very close to each other. He lowered his voice and said coldly,"Li Hao, we have to go through the night patrolmen first ..."
         Li Hao turned his head and shouted angrily,""Get lost!"
         Huang Long was stunned!
         Li Hao angrily rebuked,"who are you to speak?" The Heavenly Star governor's office is only under the jurisdiction of Minister Yao and the inspection Division. Who Do You Think You Are, to have the right to judge the country?"
         “……”
         Huang Long's face was ashen as he looked at Li Hao.  Li Hao also looked at him coldly and said in a low voice,""Don't meddle in other people's business. I don't know if I'll die or not, but I'll kill you before I die! It's just a transformation. I don't care who's behind you, I'm not afraid. Don't get into trouble or you'll die without a complete corpse!"
         Huang Long's expression changed. After a moment, he sneered and no longer spoke.
         Let's see how long you can keep jumping!
         If the heavens want it to die, they must first make it crazy!
         Li Hao was simply lawless today.
         "Trash!"
         A disdainful voice reverberated.
         It was from Li Hao!
         Huang Long's expression was slightly unsightly. He strode away without saying anything else. Li Hao ... Was truly Savage and arrogant.
         As for the spoils of war ... It would depend on whether the inspection Office would accept them.
         At this moment, Li Hao came to deliver the spoils of war. Perhaps he had some ideas.
         Accepting it meant that the inspector had tacitly agreed to some things.
         If he didn't accept them ... It meant that the Inspector General didn't approve.
         As Huang Long walked, he waited for the reply from the inspector. At this moment, many people were kneeling in the courtyard, waiting for something. Some of them were looking at Li Hao with hatred.
         But ... He didn't dare to be rash.
         Li Hao was too crazy!
         Even Huang Long had been berated. If they opened their mouths and caused Li Hao to go berserk and kill them, it would be a great loss.
         And beside Li Hao, Yao si glanced at him, didn't say anything, and left.
         Everyone seemed to be waiting for something.
         Inside the main hall of the inspection Office.
         The Secretary stopped in his tracks, as if he was thinking about something. After waiting for a long time, the entire Inspection Office was frighteningly silent. After a moment, he said,""Send the items to the warehouse for registration!"
         Everyone's faces tensed up!
         In the next moment, the Secretary said,""Li Hao has made great contributions to the inspection Office ... I'll reward him with a million divine energy stones and a heaven-grade original God weapon. I'm not feeling well today, so I can't meet anyone today. Let's have a long talk tomorrow!"
          When he said this, everyone was stunned again, but they vaguely understood what he meant.
         It was almost the same price!
         500,000 divine power stones and 5 drops of the spring of life were worth about a million divine power stones.
         A heaven-grade origin god weapon was better than the ten that Li Hao had given him.
         "I've accepted it, but I'm returning it to you. I've accepted it because you've destroyed two major organizations. I've acknowledged it, but I've given it to you as a reward. It means that I don't agree with you killing the nobles.
         I don't support it, I don't object to it. When you survive, come and find me again.
         One sentence represented many things.
         Li Hao didn't mind. Instead, he smiled."Thank you for your reward, Secretary!"
         With that, he turned around and left.
         He didn't go to the warehouse, and he didn't really pay. Since the value was equal ... He just had to register. There was no need to go through this trouble.
        
         He understood what the inspector meant.
         It was neutral!
         Outside the arena, some of the kneeling nobles heaved a sigh of relief, while others felt indignant. Some felt that it was fine if the inspection Bureau didn't support Li Hao, while others felt that the inspection Bureau shouldn't have done this and should have suppressed Li Hao instead!
         ……
         Inspection Office hall.
         After the director finished speaking, he saw Li Hao leave and fell into deep thought.
         Li Hao ... Was too straightforward.
         He didn't insist on anything, nor did he say any more nonsense. He just came to say hello and left.
         Was it good or bad for him?
         "Li Hao is a little unruly!"
          Someone said. The director glanced at that person and said after a while,""You go capture Li Hao and teach him the rules. Go now, or I'll kill you!"
         The man's expression changed.
         "Director, I didn't mean it that way ..."
         "Then what do you mean? Do you have a big mouth? Can't you just shut up?"
         The inspection Division Secretary was slightly irritated and annoyed."Get lost! And the bunch of dogs outside, get lost! If you dare to bother me again, I'll kill you all! Get lost, you hear me?"
         In an instant, everyone ran away.
         The faces of the nobles outside also changed, and they quickly got up and left.
         This person didn't have a good temper.
         He hadn't said anything before, but now that he had, he might lose his life if he stayed.
         After everyone had left, he snorted.
         After thinking for a while, he walked towards the backyard.
         The backyard of the inspection Office was his home.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Other than his family, no one else dared to come.
         He walked through the halls and alleys all the way until he reached the depths of the forest. In a small room, it was not a secret room, but an open small house. An old man was reading a book.
         The Inspector General said uneasily,""Old man, what do you say? should I decide right or wrong?"
         The old man turned to him and smiled.""What?"
         "Are you deaf?"
         "You heard it better than I did, stop pretending!" The inspector's Secretary was a little angry. You're more than a hundred years old, and you even sneaked out to look for flowers and Willows a few days ago. Do you think I didn't see it?"
         "You think too much, why would I do that?" the old man laughed.
         The inspector ignored him, but he was still confused,""I thought it was a good idea to be neutral. I'm not afraid of anything! Whether it was Silver Moon or anyone else, it did not matter! But today ... Yao si seemed a little off, and this Li Hao ... Seemed to be full of confidence! Old man, where do you think his confidence comes from? Are Silvermoon and the others really willing to go against the world for his sake?"
         The old man flipped through the book and smiled.""I don't know. I haven't cared about these things for many years. However, I've been reading ancient books in recent years and have gained some insight. "
          "What?"  "I'm making a last minute effort!"The old man smiled meaningfully.
         The Inspector General thought he was going to say something big, but he was slightly stunned.
         The old man continued,"I don't know where the Buddha's feet are ... But I'll see them three days later. I don't want to do nothing, but I want to do nothing wrong." Three days later, you can do as you see fit. "
         The chief patrol officer thought for a moment and nodded, "You're right! I'm more experienced, so I roughly understand what you mean. Okay!"
         He didn't say anything more and turned to leave.
         "Do you think hou Xiaochen has reached that stage?" Can it be completely stabilized?"
         "I don't know. You can try it yourself, or you can ask."
         "Bullshit!"
         The chief patrol officer cursed. These old guys are getting old and have started learning metaphysics. They always speak in this tone, which makes me very unhappy.
         As he cursed, he suddenly thought of something and laughed,""It's fine, I know what to do! That's right, don't run around for the next few days. Something might happen in stellarsky city, and I'll need you to come out and hold the fort at this critical moment!"
         "You speak as if your father is just a tool ..."
         The old man laughed.
         The chief patrol officer sneered,"if you don't keep making younger brothers and sisters for me, I'll be more polite to you. How old are you? don't worry. My youngest brother is younger than my grandson!" I can't afford to lose this face!"
         The old man sighed."You don't understand. This is called asking one's heart. Ask one's heart. What is the heart of martial arts?" I've also comprehended some of it over the years, and that is to be free and unfettered. In heaven and earth, I'm free and unrestrained ... This is the path of martial arts!"
         p "Hehe!"  The chief patrol officer didn't say anything more and turned to leave.
         Whatever you say.
         I won't refute you.
         After he left, the old man looked into the distance and chuckled,""It's so quiet. A Dragon crossing the river has appeared in a place like a pool of dead water ... There's going to be a show!"
         He looked outside and frowned.
          Yao si, you're ... Not right today!
         The Yao si from 20 years ago was still fresh in the memories of these elders. At that time, Yao si wasn't an old man who was holding a large tea jar and muddling through his days. The Yao si from 20 years ago was very overbearing and cruel.
         Had his realm stabilized?
         It had been five years. This guy was a little hard to read.
         ……
         Heavenly Star City.
         In the slums.
         At this moment, a group of children were also discussing something. One of them said excitedly,""In three days, the Demon King is going to behead a noble. Does everyone want to go and see?"
         "What are you looking at? are you not afraid of death? I heard that the Demon King is going to be finished in three days. He dared to kill a noble ... You should know that they have many powerful people. The Demon King is a barbarian from the North. There is no one here to help him ..."
         "Didn't he just kill the people from the four Seas group and the Douluo arena?"
        
         "What's the use of that!"
         In the crowd, a child who was obviously thinner and weaker shook his head and said,""You guys don't understand. The books say that this is called touching on fundamental interests and breaking the first step of class struggle. In ancient times, this is the first step of reform! Since ancient times, those who took the lead in changing their ways usually died miserably without a burial place!"
         "Reform? What's that?"
         ,m The group of children asked curiously, and the thin teenager laughed,""I asked you to study, but you were not willing. Reform ... Reform is ... Is ... To let the aristocrats no longer be aristocrats forever. To let the commoners see the future, see hope, see light ... Even our generation and our next generation have the hope of becoming the top and the pillars of society. We ... Can only pick up rubbish, walk through the streets, swindle people, and make a living ..."  "Hahaha, you've become an idiot from all the reading!"
         "That's right, you've read so much that you've become silly! They're rich and powerful, they have countless powerhouses, and they've accumulated the wealth of several generations. They're born nobler than us ... How can we catch up to them?"
         "That's right!"
         "Sister Yuqi, your little brother has become a fool from studying too much. Hurry up and beat him up!"
         “……”
         The group of children laughed and called out to Yuqi, who was in a daze not far away.
          The little girl raised her head and said unhappily,"you're the ones who've studied so much that you've become stupid ... No, you can't even read, what do you know!" I don't understand some of what Yuming said, but I do know that if that powerful person can kill the aristocrats this time ... Then there's hope!"
         "Is that so?"
         "Are we going to watch the show?"
         "I'm afraid it's very dangerous!"
         “……”
         The group of children quickly changed the topic. They didn't have the patience of adults to keep talking about the same topic. Soon, they fantasized about becoming supers, martial masters, and flying in the sky. They had a beautiful dream.
         The thin and weak Yuming walked to Yuqi's side, sat down beside her, and said in a low voice,""Sister, this demonic sword from the North ... Is really vicious!"
         He then sighed."It's a pity ... I went out for a walk today, but no one was optimistic about him. He's also impulsive. These things, the books all say, you have to slowly figure it out. You can't do it overnight!"
         "This demonic sword definitely doesn't like to read. It doesn't know that reading history is wise!"
         Yuqi smacked him on the head and scolded,""You jinx! Besides, I heard that he used to study in the ancient academy, and he's even a university student ..."
         "That must be an ancient Academy in the North. It doesn't have much cultural heritage."
         Yuqi glared at him, but after thinking for a while, she felt that it might be true.
         That person was like a fool. He didn't even know how to take a car. He might not even know how to read ... The ancient courtyard in the North might really not work.
         "That's true ... I heard that he was born into an ordinary family and wasn't a noble, so he didn't have the chance to receive a good education. Now that many schools and ancient courtyards have closed down, he still had a chance in the past, but now, even that little chance has been destroyed ..."
         Yuqi muttered and then said in a low voice,"I really hope he can succeed ... It's been many years, and no one has been like him."
         "I want that too, but ... Sis, let's not get our hopes up," Yuming said softly.
         "I'm too lazy to talk to you!"
         Yuqi ignored him, stood up, and walked out of the room.
         "Sister, where are you going?"  "Earn money! If he didn't earn money, what would he eat tomorrow? 200 star dollars and you spent 180 star dollars on a pile of broken paper. I'm so angry, I won't give you money next time!"
         "Sister, that's knowledge!"
         "Bullshit!"
         Yuqi cursed and left.
         Yuming, on the other hand, was happy. His sister had always been like this. She said that she wouldn't give it to him, but she would give it to him again when she made money next time.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, when he saw the pile of books behind him, he sighed. He couldn't waste them next time. He had been impulsive yesterday and knew the teacher who sold the books. He was almost starving to death. The entire family didn't have anything to eat. He had actually spent 180 star coins to buy these books that were almost useless paper.
         "The demon Sword, does the demon Sword know what reform is?"
         The little boy mumbled to himself. Perhaps the other party didn't even know and just wanted to kill.
         Sister, don't have too much hope.
         ……
         The stellarsky city was in a great uproar.
         The news quickly spread, and the entire central continent was in an uproar. In fact, the news even spread throughout the four continents.
         Over a hundred aristocrats were killed!
         This news could be said to be shocking.
         Everyone's eyes were focused on the central region, on stellarsky city.
         ……
         Silver Moon.
         White moon City.
          Director Zhao's expression changed.
         Huang Yu, on the other hand, was deep in thought.
         Kong Jie frowned and said after a long time,""I thought that he would be fine after a few days of peace, but ... Old Zhao, do you think old hou can protect him? Old hou, why didn't you try to talk him out of it? if you do this ... It's very easy for something to happen. "
         Director Zhao was silent. He held a pen in his hand and started to draw.
         Kong Jie was getting impatient!
         It was very difficult to talk to a scholar.
         "Old Huang, do you have any good ideas?"
         "What?"
         Huang Yu raised his head and looked at him with some doubt.
         "I said, Li Hao is definitely in danger! He was originally the target that everyone wanted to kill, but everyone was apprehensive of some things, some rules, and each other's fear, so they gave him the opportunity. If he stopped now, he could have gained a firm foothold. Why did he have to go all out?"
        
         "In any case, I feel that ... He might really kill himself by doing this," he sighed.
         "Putting aside the distance between us, even at such a close distance, if a divine ability were to strike us ... We won't be able to deal with it unless we unseal ourselves completely!"
         Kong Jie sighed.
         Thinking of this, he felt a little sad."My daughter is still in stellarsky city. I almost forgot about this. Don't get involved with Li Hao. It's not good if he dies ... Sigh!"
         This guy only just remembered that his daughter was there.
         Director Zhao looked at him and was speechless. He said,"I thought you'd already remembered that your daughter was here."
         "I've been brainwashed by Li Hao for the past few days. His name is all I can think of ... I don't have the time to think so much."
         "Forget it. It's fine even if she doesn't die," Kong Jie said."Even if she dies ... She can't run away. I'll kill whoever kills her ... I'll kill them one by one!"
         Director Zhao couldn't be bothered with him.
         After thinking for a while, he said,"we can't persuade him or stop him ... I don't know what Li Hao is thinking, but I know that whether he succeeds or fails ... It will be a new beginning!" The only thing we can do right now ... Is to spread the news so that everyone can watch the show or gossip ... At least let the Silver Moon citizens know that demonic sword Li Hao is doing something that no one else in stellarsky city dares to do or can't do!"
          "And he is a Silvermoon!"
         Director Zhao raised his head and looked at the two of them,"let the world know that we, the people of Silver Moon, are the most courageous!" Let the people of Silvermoon know that the world is big, and without me ... No one will dare to be the first!"
         "As for the rest, leave it to him!" He stood up and smiled.
         "You ... You're not going to care?"
         Kong Jie was speechless. What was the use of publicity alone?
         He had thought that old Zhao had some good ideas.
         "Go and do your work!"
         Kong Jie had no choice but to leave. Old Zhao was useless.
         After he left, Huang Yu shook his head and said,""Old Kong has been a little restless recently. It seems that he wants to go to stellarsky city, but Li Hao and Xiao Chen have attracted his attention. He feels uncomfortable staying here."
         "Sometimes, staying behind is a more difficult choice ... If he doesn't understand, then forget it."
         "How is this even possible? The heavenstar is only the beginning. The real problem is the Silver Moon!"
         "Three days. If you go all out, can you make it to Heavenly Star?"
         Stellarsky city was too far away, and it took hou Xiaochen and the others seven days to get there.
         The car was not slow either.
         If a Martial Master were to travel at full speed, they might be able to arrive in three days. However, once they arrived, they might not have enough time to recover.
         "You can use the helicopter to carry me first ... It'll be faster that way."
         "Are you letting me go over?" Huang Yu asked.
         "We can go and take a look."
         "I thought you'd send old Kong," Huang Yu laughed.
         "He won't be of much use if he goes."
         "Then I'll try my best."
         "Yes."
         The two of them exchanged a few words before Huang Yu left. Time was of the essence, and since Lao Zhao had made up his mind, Huang Yu decided to make his way there as soon as possible.
         ……
         While all parties were discussing.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao, the main character, didn't care about those discussions.
         At this moment, he was in a private room on the ninth floor of the nine Dragon Pavilion.
         He was alone.
         There was also a dog.
         He was eating and drinking tea.
         Beside him, the female manager from last time was serving him, putting food on his plate and pouring him tea and wine.
         Compared to the last time, this time, the female manager did not have any complaints or discomfort.
         As she watched Li Hao gobble down the food, she had the same thought ... An extraordinary person would do extraordinary things!
         She actually had a lot of doubts, a lot of questions, a lot of questions that she didn't understand. She wanted to ask this man who shocked the world in person, but ... She didn't dare to.
         Li Hao ate very quickly. After he finished eating, he let out a comfortable breath."It tastes really good! It's just too expensive. "
         "Governor li, please eat as much as you want. This time, someone is treating."
         The female manager chuckled."This time, our Pavilion master will pay for the meal. Other than the fact that we can't take away valuable items like the spring of life, everything else will be free."
         "The pavilion master?"  "Yes, the master of the nine Dragon Pavilion."
         "Isn't this the royal family 's?"
         "That's right, our Pavilion master is a member of the imperial family. "
         "Thank you!"
         Li Hao laughed heartily."You're too kind. Alright, I'll order ten more servings of the same amount as before. I really wasn't full just now!"
         The female manager didn't mind and quickly left to give some instructions.
         Then, he returned to Li Hao's side.
         Li Hao burped, picked up the teacup, took a sip, and said with a smile,""It's said that there's nothing the nine Dragon Pavilion can't do. Do you want to do a business deal?"
         "Please speak, commander."
         "The projection that Southern Fist made last time, the huge one ... Do you have it? The kind that can be projected to thousands of households without being broken ... I want to behead them on the spot and show it to everyone in Tian Xing city!"
         “……”
         The female manager was mentally exhausted. Every word that this man said was so ... So terrifying!
         "Yes, but it's almost impossible not to be harassed ... We don't want this kind of thing to be spread too widely."
         "Even the nine Dragon Pavilion can't do it?"
         "I can, but I can 't!"
         "I'll pay. "
         "That won't do either."
         The female manager looked at Li Hao with a complicated expression."Governor, this isn't a problem of money. This is ... A problem that no one will allow. It's not just everyone, perhaps ... We're not too willing to do this."
         Li Hao laughed."How about this? let's change the name. Project that I'm killed ... I've failed!" You guys have to learn to be flexible. It's not like I'll definitely win. I'm a newcomer, and I'm new here. Can I win against them? Just say, let the whole world see how Li Hao dies!"
         The female manager's eyes flickered,'this ... Might work! After all ... The military governor is very powerful. Even the nine divisions can't guarantee that they can easily take him down. "
         "So cowardly?"
         Li Hao chuckled."What are you afraid of? if you're so cowardly, it doesn't matter if I project you or not. If you don't have the confidence, how can you say that you're in charge of the world?" Are you kidding me?"
         The female manager spoke again."I'll try my best to help the governor apply for it ... There's no need for the fee. I think if it passes ... Many people would like to see how the governor dies."
         Li Hao tilted his head to look at her and laughed."Yo! Beautiful, you've become more direct with your words!"
         "Someone like the governor might like to be more direct," the female manager chuckled.
         "Not bad at flattering!"
         Li Hao nodded."I like it! As expected, it's easy to get lost when you have power and authority. "
         He laughed.
         The female manager also laughed. After a while, she said,""Then I'll help the governor apply ... Also ... If I may ask ..."
         "Ask!"
         "What is the governor trying to do?"
         Li Hao didn't say anything after she asked.
         She didn't mind and turned to leave.
         What are you planning?
         You'll put yourself in a desperate situation and it'll be more dangerous than before.
         When she was about to leave, Li Hao suddenly laughed and said,""To make your thoughts clear! Martial arts were like this, and the Silver Moon Martial Master was like this! You're not a Martial Master, and you're not even a Silver Moon Martial Master. You're willing to give up your armor, and you even dared to pull the Emperor down from his throne. Didn't the nine divisions do it in the past?"
         The female manager's footsteps were a little stiff and flustered, but she quickly left.
          These words could not be heard.
         Li Hao laughed and touched the Black Panther's head.""I'm not a dog. If I were a dog, I'd eat and sleep, sleep and eat. I don't care, right, dog?"
         Woof! Woof! Woof!
         Black Panther shook his head. Even dogs had troubles!
         For example, it felt uncomfortable when Li Hao pinched its head. It was a little irritated. The great descendant of ancient demons should not be treated like this.
         "As expected, you also agree!"
         Li Hao laughed and patted the dog's head. The Black Panther could only nod.
         Forget it, a dog under the roof has to bow its head.
         "It's fine as long as there's food," it consoled itself. There was no need to think so much. The great ancient demon was gone, so what were its descendants?
         [PS: twoo' clock is still great. Threeo' clock is too miserable. I'm so scared when I think about tomorrow's threeo' clock. I won't be scared if you give me some monthly votes ...]
        
         In the nine Dragons Pavilion.
         The dishes were continuously served. Li Hao ate some more and left the rest to Black Panther. The food of Nine Dragons Pavilion was pretty good. Not only did it look, smell, and contain a lot of energy, it was also very delicious.
         The skills of the chefs here were not bad.
         Li Hao thought to himself.
         After a while, the female manager who had left earlier returned. Her voice was not loud, but there was a hint of a smile in her voice."Governor, the higher-ups have agreed to give it a try, but we might have to communicate with the nine divisions first. They are very interested in the governor ... The nine divisions are not interested in beheading an aristocrat, but beheading the governor ... Many people might want to see it."
         Li Hao smiled.
         He nodded and didn't say anything.
         Seeing his attitude, the female manager hesitated for a moment, but still said,""This time, if someone really wants to attack the governor, the three major organizations might send their experts here. Also, people from the city of superpower might come. Seven great divine mountains, besides sky sword Mountain, it's hard to say about the others. There's also the Wang family, the high Duke's public house ..."
         Li Hao chuckled."Just say it. Everyone in the world, except the Silvermoon citizens, wants to kill me."
         Why did he say so much?
          The female manager was silent.
         Li Hao stood up and called out to his son,"Heibao, let's go!"
         Now that he had achieved his goal, there was no need to stay.
         Seeing the Black Panther taking a deep breath, Li Hao patted its head and said helplessly,""It's someone else's treat this time, and you're still doing this. It's more or less inappropriate!"
         "It's fine, it's fine, as long as master Heibao likes it. "The female manager saw this and smiled.
         Li Hao smiled.
         This person ... Once he was famous, he had to be even more ruthless. Anyone would be afraid of him. Look, compared to last time, the difference was huge.
         "Alright, thank you. I'll take my leave first!"
         Li Hao tightened his trench coat and left.
         The female manager followed Li Hao all the way down without saying anything.
         The female manager watched Li Hao and black Panther disappear into the darkness. After a long time, someone behind her said,""What are you thinking about?"
         The female manager quickly turned around and lowered her head."Pavilion master!"
         Behind him, a woman appeared graceful and Noble, with an extraordinary temperament.
         "Did you get anything from talking to him?" he asked.
         The female manager thought for a moment and said,"he's unscrupulous and completely crazy. He'll die without a burial place sooner or later. If he doesn't die this time, he'll die next time. People like him won't have a good end."
         "Just this?"
         "Yes."
         The female manager nodded and thought for a while before saying,""And extremely stingy. It's comparable to the southern Fist."  The lady smiled."According to what you said, there's no need to worry about anything. Do you think he's too confident about the projection in three days, or does he want to save his life in this way? The entire world is watching. If we kill him, some people might have some apprehensions ... Of course, it's reasonable to kill him to deter the world. "
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "This subordinate does not know!"
         The female manager shook her head and thought for a moment."Pavilion master, I think this person is just young and rash. He's not as difficult to deal with as you think. Does he really understand the consequences of killing a noble?" Maybe ... He didn't even think of this problem. Why didn't you send someone to talk to him?"
         "It's because you're too naive!"
         The woman said indifferently, but she didn't want to say anything more. Her figure flickered and instantly disappeared from the spot.
         The female manager didn't raise her head until they left. She turned around and glanced in the direction that Li Hao had left.
         He ... Should understand!
         But, can you succeed?
         At this moment, he suddenly felt some anticipation and desire. No one wanted to be born as a servant, no one wanted to be born as a lower class, and no one wanted to be born as a puppet of the nobles.
         The nobles controlled everything, including your life, age, sickness, and death. Even at the rising light, wasn't it difficult to escape such a fate?
         Be it the imperial family or the nine divisions ... Who was stronger?
         Jiusi had turned from a Dragon Slayer to an evil Dragon in the end. Jiusi had become the world, and everyone had become slaves.
         Li Hao ... Can you succeed?
         The female manager thought to herself and didn't say anything to the pavilion master. No matter how friendly the pavilion master was, she was still a member of the aristocratic system. She didn't understand the thoughts of people like us.
         Of course, I don't have the courage like you. No one else does. In this stellarsky city, there were true rebels, but they were all dead.
         Those who survived were the ones who had been forced to accept the circumstances.
         Li Hao ... Can you ignite everyone's hope?
          Even if ... Just a tiny bit was good!
         "We can't do it, but we also hope that someone can do it and overthrow the oppression of this hierarchical system that is as heavy as Mount Tai. But ... Is it possible?
         The female manager didn't look at him again. She turned around and went back to the nine Dragons Pavilion.
         Very quickly, a smile blossomed on his face as he welcomed the arrival of the next guest. The nine Dragons Pavilion was still as noisy and lively as before. Although there were a few people missing and the nine secretaries were not present, there was still no shortage of guests.
         There was a ball of fire in the female manager's heart, but it was stuck in her chest. This fire could be extinguished at any time. She didn't know if that person could ignite this fire.
         Perhaps ... Just like him, countless people actually desired, looked forward to, and looked forward to his success. However, such hope could be extinguished at any time, turning into an even thicker darkness.
         There are too many mountains on your head. Can you, Li Hao, flatten them?
         ……
         The huge stellarsky city was like a volcano that was about to erupt.
         On this day, a flame was ignited in the hearts of countless people. Those with knowledge and those who were unwilling to give up were all longing for something.
        
         They had a common identity, the commoner class.
         In this era, although it was difficult, there was still a need for some commoners to do something. The nobles were not omnipotent.
         The deterrence of high-end martial forces caused stellarsky city to be like a pool of dead water.
         However, when someone was willing to step forward and break this dead end, even if they didn't dare to step forward, there were still people who silently prayed and prayed ... Not to let this fire be completely extinguished and usher in an even darker moment.
         ……
         In the darkness.
         Li Hao walked on the street, looked around, and said calmly,""Why don't you come out now and kill me? why don't you ... If you continue to follow me, I'll kill you all! Following a provincial governor, do you all not want to live?"
         In the darkness, there was no sound.
         Li Hao sneered and stomped his foot. The earth trembled, and someone below him was directly turned into a pile of meat.
         The sword Qi soared into the sky, and someone in the air was instantly torn apart.
          Like a hunter in the dark, the Black Panther disappeared, and soon, a few low screams could be heard.
         A moment later, Li Hao left with Black Panther.
         After a while, someone appeared and said in a low voice,""He's completely unscrupulous. Don't follow him anymore ... No matter what he's doing, he'll appear in three days! They might be looking for help or cultivating ... No matter how many people came out, they would all be caught in one fell swoop! Go!"
         In the darkness, someone quickly retreated.
         Just as this person had said, no matter who Li Hao looked for or asked for help, even if it was Tian Jian ... He would be caught in one fell swoop if he dared to participate!
         And they needed some time to reach a consensus.
         Li Hao, unless you run away, but ... If you run away, you'll become the laughingstock of the world.
         ……
         In the darkness, Li Hao quickly flew away.
         Not long after, they walked out of stellarsky city. The atmosphere in the city was too oppressive.
         He continued forward, even crossing the sky Star sea.
         No one was following him.
         Perhaps it would be better for stellarsky city if he left. In that case, he would be able to destroy all of Li Hao's influence without much effort.
         Otherwise, dealing with Li Hao at this moment might not be a good thing for some people.
         After all, the divine power was not stable.
         Li Hao didn't care about this. He flew further and further away until he saw a huge mountain in the distance. Li Hao's eyes flickered as he saw a ball of light on the mountain. It was a great demon at the suguang realm.
         This mountain had an owner.
         "Black Panther!"
         Li Hao looked at the Black Panther."Go and have a friendly chat with it. If it eats people, kill it. If it doesn 't, play with it for a while!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Woof! Woof! Woof!
         With a flash, the Black Panther disappeared in an instant. Its speed was also extremely fast.
         A moment later, the ball of light in the mountain flickered for a while.
          When Li Hao landed on the ground, a rhinoceros-like demon that was dozens of times the size of the Black Panther obediently let the Black Panther lie on its huge head. Its entire body trembled, and it did not dare to move.  Li Hao smiled."I'll borrow your treasured land for a few days. I'll leave in a few days."
         "Sir, please help yourself!"
         The rhinoceros demon's mental energy fluctuated as it trembled."Governor li ... Can ... Can ... Have this Lord ancient demon ... Slightly restrain the power of his ancient demon bloodline? I can't bear it."
         "You know me?"
         "Your Excellency's name has spread throughout the central region. I'll know when I see you ..."
         The rhinoceros demon was extremely cautious as well.
         Of course he knew.
         Dog demon, swordsman, valiant, brutal ... Who else could it be other than Li Hao and black Panther?
         And now, the experts of the central continent, be it the demons or the humans, who didn't know this person?
         However, it didn't know why Li Hao, who was in stellarsky city, would come here. It was almost scared to death.
         "Interesting. As expected, it's hard to make a name for yourself if you don't come to Heavenly Star!"
         Li Hao chuckled. Without saying anything, he walked into the cave behind him.
         As for the Black Panther, it knocked on the rhinoceros 'head with its claws."Quiet down, stop talking nonsense!"
         The rhinoceros didn't dare to resist. It was only an early-stage Dawnlight realm great demon. Normally, it would swagger around, but in front of these two ... It was best to obediently admit defeat. How many dawnlights had these two killed?
         ……
         In the cave.
         Li Hao didn't care so much.
         With a wave of his hand, the smell of cattle was dispersed.
         He didn't look for anyone. He didn't go to sky sword Mountain to look for sky sword, even though sky sword Mountain wasn't far away.
         He didn't look for anyone else, no one.
         The time was set to be three days later, not seven or ten days later. It was because he did not want anyone to make it. For example, Silver moon's group was 20000 li away, and it was almost impossible for them to make it in three days.
          Li Hao did not want to drag them into the quagmire again and again despite knowing the danger.
         Three days was time for himself, the nine divisions, and the imperial family.
         As for hou Xiaochen ... He was already in the trap, and Li Hao had nothing to do with it. As for what hou Xiaochen would think, it was not something Li Hao could decide.
         "Do you all think that I can only rely on others and wait for death? do you all think that I'm only reckless but have no courage?"
         Li Hao chuckled. He could actually wait. He could keep waiting.
         However, he did not like it.
         His heart was not at peace!
         Furthermore, this was a rare opportunity. If he missed it, where would he get such an opportunity? if he did, he would have to use a thunderous method to clean up everything. Otherwise, the accumulation of power would not have such an effect.
         At this stage, courage was the key to breaking through everything!
         Otherwise, I could have gone to find Hong Yue, returned to the Silver City to comprehend the sword intent, perfect the fusion of the five Forces, and enter the spirit fusion stage before considering the follow-up ... But in that case, I would be the next Yao si!
        
         How long would it take?
         After fusing with the spirit, would he have to wait for the next time to become stronger?
         "The five organs heart lock is already full ..."
         As Li Hao thought about this, he recalled the simple conversation he had with Chief Steward Yu.
         However, as long as the five organs lock was not broken and the source of the Martial Master and inner strength was locked, there was a chance of converting the power back.
         Or, if only one of the five chains was broken, there was still hope of being converted back at the Sunglow stage.
         However, once the chains of the five internal organs were broken, it would be very difficult to convert them back. The heavenly Sword could be considered to have completely stepped into the realm of divine power. Under such circumstances ... It would be very difficult to return to the path of a Martial Master!
         Many thoughts flashed through his mind.
         Every time, someone would help him. Silver moon's Martial Master had unsealed his combat strength time and time again for him. If not for his sword energy, he would have died many times over.
         Every time this happened, someone had to pay for it.
          Why?
         And he ... Had he ever thought that once it was completely broken, wouldn't it be a waste of all his previous efforts if he couldn't suppress it in time?
         It was still very dangerous. Every time Hong Yitang and the others made a move, did they really not think about the consequences of breaking the SuperLock if Li Hao couldn't suppress them in time?
         Outsiders only knew that they had profited from misfortune every time, but who would have thought that ... There was so much danger?
         Thoughts flashed through his mind.
         A moment later, Li Hao chuckled. Other people were willing to take risks for him, but he was always overcautious. How could he follow his heart?
         In an instant, there was a crack!
         The chains collapsed!
         The chain on his left hand was completely broken. In an instant, a surge of energy emerged. A large amount of energy gathered on his left arm. Li Hao took out all the high-level divine power stones around him, which released a large amount of energy that he absorbed and swallowed.
         He had made a decision!
         Today, he was going to break the lock and become a super.
         He broke the chains of his four limbs, broke the pillar, and broke the purple Palace!
         He wanted to break through the six chains and step into the divine Art realm. He wanted to use the five viscera lock to lock his five viscera and give himself a chance to convert them back.
         Ordinary people couldn't discover the Zifu and the chains of the spine, but Li Hao could.
         Therefore, ordinary people could only break through the chains and become god art Masters, but Li Hao ... Didn't need to do so.
         That's right, at this moment, Li Hao chose to break the six chains under unimaginable circumstances. He was going to advance to divine power!
         Only the five viscera lock was left, locking the source of the inner strength!
         Crack. In an instant, the second chain was broken. These chains were not saturated, and superpowers did not need to be saturated. Li Hao's chain was already considered extremely powerful, much stronger than ordinary people.
         The two chains broke. In that instant, Li Hao turned into a superpower, and a mysterious energy surged into his body again.
         Yue Ming!
         As for the attribute ... It was considered the non-attribute type, not one of the five elements, because he did not break the chain of the five internal organs.  The Black Panther suddenly appeared at the entrance of the cave. It looked at Li Hao in shock.
         This time, it didn't absorb the mysterious energy. Instead, it stared at Li Hao in bewilderment ... What are you doing?
         "Go out and guard the door ... If the energy leaks out, quickly devour it. Don't let the energy fluctuations spread and attract attention!"
         Woof! Woof! Woof!
         The Black Panther cried out, as if to remind Li Hao not to do this.
         "Get out!"
         The Black Panther, with its tail between its legs, was unwilling to give up. In the end, it was forced to retreat under Li Hao's gaze. It unwillingly left the cave and slapped the rhinoceros to the ground. It was somewhat angry!
         It can't be broken!
         Even if he could be converted back, it would be much more difficult for Li Hao to improve his martial arts. For example, although people like hou Xiaochen had broken through the barrier, it had taken them a long time to connect the superpower lock because they had been converted back then.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't need to do this at all.
         He still had a long way to go, and he didn't encounter any bottlenecks.
         ……
         Heibao couldn't persuade Li Hao, and Li Hao wouldn't listen to him.
         Even if his teacher came, Li Hao believed that his teacher would only support him.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Moreover, it wasn't like he had completely cut off his escape route.
         Three, four ...
         It was easy to break the first four chains. Waves of powerful special energy gushed out and devoured Li Hao's powerful inner strength.
         Four super locks, that was the three yang realm.
         It was too difficult for ordinary people to reach the three-yang realm. For Li Hao, it was as easy as eating and drinking. The special energy that emerged was very violent, but for Li Hao, his strong body didn't care about this energy impact at all.
         The majestic mysterious energy was rolling in his body. His limbs were still devouring the inner strength and transforming it into powerful mysterious energy.
          Li Hao's three suns were completely different from ordinary superpowers.
         Stronger!
         Boom! Boom! Boom!
         His blood seemed to be flowing rapidly, and the sound of surging waves could be heard.
         The fourth was easy, but the fifth and sixth were the most difficult. One was the purple mansion Super Lock, the other was the spine Super Lock, and the last one released physical energy, which might be related to the wind element.
         After absorbing the wind energy, Li Hao's body was strengthened.
         A spine SuperLock, possibly belonging to the lightning element. Li Hao had absorbed the lightning element and strengthened the bone armor.
         Both of them had their own attributes.
         If they were all broken, a wind lightning sacred art might be born.
         However, the collision of two elements was the biggest problem for countless superpowers. For them, their problem was not a big problem for Li Hao.
        
         At this moment, Li Hao's inner strength was rapidly transforming into a superpower.
         The power released by the broken Super Chain was very special. It wasn't just a mysterious power, but Li Hao didn't delve into it. At this moment, he set his eyes on the fifth chain, the spine lock!
         First, he had to break the bone shackle and give birth to the lightning element.
         If he broke this rule, he would be Xuguang.
         Li Hao's divine intent locked onto the spine lock. He told Nan Quan that he couldn't lock onto it, but that was nonsense. He just didn't want to hurt Nan Quan's confidence.
         At this moment, Li Hao was slightly hesitant.
         After entering the rising light, it would be much more difficult to return to the path of a Martial Master.
         However ... In the next moment, he made up his mind and chose to break through. Whether it was external or personal, power was still power. In the path of ancient energy, there were still people who had reached the peak.
         Kachaa!
         BOOM!
          At this moment, there seemed to be lightning flashing between heaven and earth.
         Outside the cave.
         The sound of thunder and chains breaking could be heard in the sky. The Black Panther's paw had caused the rhinoceros demon to howl loudly. The demonic beast's roars had shocked the entire mountain into silence.
         At the foot of the mountain, there were powerful cultivators keeping an eye on the greater demons. There were people on the ground who carefully watched over the greater demons ... It was not to exterminate the greater demons. They just hoped that when the greater demons left the mountain, they would be the first to know.
         At the foot of the mountain.
         There were several people hiding in the small mountain Valley. Someone whispered,""This Jade moon rhinoceros's cry is a little different from usual ... What's going on?"
         "It seems like there's Thunder at the top of the mountain!"
         "Could it be that this great demon is about to advance in rank?"
         "Not necessarily ... Who knows ... He might be doing it with a female demon! Hahaha!"
         The group of people chuckled softly. They didn't dare to go up and take a look. That was great demon sunguang. As for the Thunder on the Mountain peak, it was normal for Thunder to sound at the top of the mountain.
         Besides, that was the territory of the great demon. Who cared?
         As long as they knew where the big demon was going when he left the mountain, it would be fine.
         BOOM!
         The sound of thunder continued. At this moment, it was very loud. However, because a great demon was on the mountain peak, everyone chose to ignore it.
         ……
         In the cave.
          Li Hao's body flickered with lightning. As expected, lightning was a special type of power. They might be born with the ability to break the chains of the spine. Thus ... Li Hao had some ideas.  Wind, lightning, these special series of superpowers might be able to break through the chains of the five internal organs and become a god art.
         These people's internal organs would not be too heavily burdened.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Only God art of the five elements would have a huge burden on the five internal organs. Therefore, if he had a special wind and thunder element to upgrade his god art, the situation might be more stable.
         Of course, the wind and lightning element required a strong body and bone armor. It was not easy for superpowers to use it.
         However, Li Hao knew that it was much easier for these special superpowers to advance to divine power. Therefore, it was possible that such a divine power existed now. Its combat power was not weak, but the burden was much less. Not everyone was like the old Duke of the high Duke's public house, because his condition was not very stable.
         At this moment, Li Hao also felt the power of superpowers.
         The lightning exploded in his body!
         Countless internal forces were rapidly devoured and turned into Thunder-type energy. The other elemental-less mysterious energy in his body also turned into Thunder-type mysterious energy. The powerful impact shook Li Hao!
         If it wasn't for the fact that his body was too strong, he would have directly stepped into the rising light at this moment and might have been turned into charcoal by the powerful lightning attribute.
         Around him, the divine power stones quickly shattered and turned into streams of energy that gushed into his body. The violent Thunder-type mysterious energy attacked Li Hao, while the starry sky sword also released streams of sword energy, soothing, suppressing, and calming him down.
         Li Hao's bones were trembling, and he instantly turned purple. The power of lightning was spreading from his hair.
         "I've entered the rising light!"
         Li Hao chuckled. He had crossed the barrier that ordinary people couldn't cross in just an hour.
         He thought of Hao lianchuan. Breaking the five superpower locks was so easy, but he might not have succeeded until now. As for me ... From nothing to something, from a Martial Master to a rising light, it only took me an hour.
         The fifth one wasn't too difficult, but the real difficulty lay in the sixth one.
          When the wind and thunder met, the two energies would fuse, go berserk, and clash. That would be the most troublesome part. Of course, Li Hao still had a trump card like sword energy, which could neutralize the berserk energy.
         However, Li Hao didn't want to use a sword unless he had no other choice.
         It was true that the sword energy could be neutralized ... However, after being neutralized, the domineering power of the mysterious energy would be gone and turned into a soft force. The powerful part of the superpower was the unparalleled domineering power of the mysterious energy!
         After a battle, any injuries could be repaired with a sword, but it was best not to use it in battle. Otherwise, the domineering mysterious energy would become a little sheep.
         Li Hao was not in a hurry to break the sixth Super Lock. Instead, he devoured energy and a large number of divine power stones to strengthen the mysterious energy in his body.
         Not only that, his five internal organs were also operating.
         He was still building the real bridge of the five internal organs, and the five chains began to merge.
         Yuan Shuo told him not to rush into fusing with the real five viscera bridges, or it would strengthen the five Forces and cause them to go out of control. But Li Hao didn't care at this moment, because the situation would be different after he turned into a superpower. He might not be able to use the five Forces anymore.
         Even if he did use it ... There was a high chance that he would not lose control.
         "Build a real five internal organs bridge to seal the five internal organs and prevent the mysterious energy from invading. Otherwise, the temporary five internal organs bridge, the bridge of inner strength, will be devoured quickly. The mysterious energy will invade the five internal organs and easily turn them into a body of mysterious energy.
        
         Many chains appeared in the sky.
         In front of Li Hao, there were five crystal-clear chains side by side. One had a ferocious Tiger crouching on it, one had a swaying willow tree, one had a stable mountain peak, and one had monstrous waves ...
         What he needed to do now was to combine the five chains into one and lock his five internal organs so that he could recover in the future and become a Martial Master again.
         In an instant, the two chains collided.
         Fusion!
         BOOM!
         Divine will burst out, and the two forces clashed violently. This also gave Li Hao a sense of what a divine power was. When forces of different attributes collided, they were extremely similar to divine powers.
         Water and fire collided, and a powerful energy exploded in the cave. Sword intent enveloped the cave, and the longevity sword intent spread out, suppressing the two forces. At least for now, these forces were unable to break through the force Li Hao had comprehended back then.
         Outside the cave, the Black Panther opened its mouth and swallowed all the energy that leaked out into its stomach. Not a single drop could escape.
         However, the more it devoured, the more anxious it became.
          This meant that the power in Li Hao's body was getting stronger and stronger. This was not a good thing. At the very least, in the few memories it had inherited, the ancient king was a Martial Master. In the end, the ancient energy path was still defeated!
         Perhaps it was too far away from Li Hao.....But, in Black Panther's eyes, they could reach that level!
         He definitely could!
         If Li Hao couldn't be converted back, could he surpass the ancient people?
         In the cave, Li Hao was still perfecting the bridges of his five internal organs and absorbing divine power and powerful Thunder energy at the same time. He wanted to become extremely powerful before he could break the chains of his Zifu and develop a real divine power.
         ……
         Li Hao disappeared.
         The next day.
         No one saw Li Hao, and no one knew where he had gone.
         Perhaps ... He had escaped!
         The news quickly spread that Li Hao had gone missing after his visit to the nine Dragons Pavilion last night.
         The news was instantly spread by people with intentions.
         Sky Star City.
         Someone laughed and said,"I heard that the demonic sword escaped last night ... Interesting, right?" We agreed to kill the aristocrats ... But he ran away!"
         On the streets, people came and went, some of them extremely numb.
         Some people clenched their fists.
         "Hmph!" Someone else snorted."A few days ago, it was said that he ran away, and then the SI Hai Group was gone!"
         I don't believe it!
         Those who still had some hope didn't believe that Li Hao had run away, nor were they willing to believe it. He had just ignited a glimmer of hope in everyone ... Everyone wanted to see the noble be executed, but ... What if Li Hao really ran away?
         Then this world ... Would really have no hope. It was too dark.
         The hope that had just been ignited in everyone's heart would only become a darker abyss.
         "It's up to you to believe it or not, just wait and see! Even if he didn't ... He's probably dead. He offended the three major organizations and might have been assassinated!"
         "Hmph!"
         No one wanted to argue, but they were all worried and looking forward to it.
         Three days later ... No, it was now two days later.
          The demonic sword ... Would that Governor be able to return?  He couldn't have really died, right?
         As for running away ... They were not willing to believe it.
         ……
         At the night patrollers 'headquarters.
         Hou Xiaochen leaned back in his chair, not saying a word. He seemed to be thinking about something.
         In fact, Li Hao didn't tell him that he wanted to kill a noble.
         At first, he cursed, but he soon realized Li Hao's purpose.
         But at this moment, Li Hao had disappeared.
         He fell into deep thought. A moment later, he took out a communication Jade and said,"Tian Jian, did Li Hao go to the sky sword Mountain?"
         Last time, when Tian Jian came out of seclusion, Chief Steward Yu went to invite him. In order to make it easier for them to contact each other, they exchanged communication jades.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Hou Xiaochen asked.
         "Wu!"
         The reply was only one simple word.
         Hou Xiaochen furrowed his brows.
         Then where did Li Hao go?
         After a moment of silence, he sent another message."Will you come?"
         "Let's talk about it again. "
         Then, there was no more news.
         Hou Xiaochen didn't know whether to laugh or cry. This guy was so cold and arrogant!
         "Xiao Yu, where do you think Li Hao went?"
         Majordomo Yu shook her head, but she was thinking that Li Hao had come to her yesterday and asked her about the Martial Master transition from superpowers. She had some vague thoughts in her mind ... But she didn't know how to say them.
         She didn't dare to say.
         Perhaps ... If that was the case, it would be too terrifying.
         This was the Silver Moon Martial Master. He was the hope of this generation, as well as the hope of countless people. He had the hope of breaking through the barriers of the Martial Master path and even surpassing the older generation of martial masters.
          Martial masters were the key and core of Silver Moon.
         Besides ... If he wanted to deal with it, he would have to break six of the Super locks. Four of them were in his limbs, and two of them were in his internal organs. Once two of them were broken ... There was no hope of recovery, such as skysword's current condition.
         Of course, no one knew if sky sword had a special type of power.
         She had actually wanted to tell hou Xiaochen, but then she remembered how Li Hao had looked at her with a bright smile last night. "Don't tell old hou that I'm looking for Yu Luosha, not chief Yu. Yu Luosha is a cold and arrogant person, and he won't gossip."
         Chief Steward Yu wanted to say something several times but stopped himself. In the end, he shut his mouth.
         She was starting to regret it.
         I shouldn't have told Li Hao!
         If it was as he had guessed, it would be troublesome. Perhaps ... Many people would be disappointed.
         "Xiao Yu, are you alright?"
         Hou Xiaochen's words caused Chief Steward Yu to wake up. She looked up and felt a little guilty, but she still forced herself to say, "I'm fine. I'm just a little worried ... The trouble caused by Li Hao seems to be getting bigger and bigger, and he doesn't give us any time to catch our breath. This guy is too domineering. He's completely different from before!"
        
         Hou Xiaochen glanced at her, but didn't say anything. After some thought, he said,"It might not be that dangerous. At the current stage, most of the divine arts have not stabilized their realms."
         "But," Chief Steward Yu said in a low voice,"in order to kill Li Hao, the nine divisions might pay a huge price. They might tell us some magical powers ... As long as we attack, they'll be willing to pay a large amount of the spring of life. Even ... The Crimson Moon might give us a large number of blood deities. They won't sit by and do nothing! In order to kill Li Hao, it's entirely possible that Ying Hongyue would do this. He'll provide high-quality Blood God clones for some magical abilities!"
         "Some Sacred Arts might lack such resources initially. In order to obtain these resources, they might take risks ... It's not just Sacred Arts. During the transformation stage, some Sacred Arts might choose to advance forcefully for a promise or real benefit!"
         "Some of them could have stepped into the divine power realm during the metamorphosis stage, but they didn't choose to do so because it was too dangerous. Now, the major organizations only need to pay the resources to create a batch of divine power realm experts!"
         "Minister, have you ever considered this?" the Jade manager looked at hou Xiaochen.
         She didn't believe that the Minister hadn't thought of it.
         Hou Xiaochen sighed, but didn't say anything.
         Yes!
         There shouldn't be many God Arts at the current stage, but there were many transformation stages. If the large organizations were willing to pay a huge price, such as giving you 50 drops of spring of life, would you be willing to take the risk to advance?
         Now, the opportunity was right in front of him.
          If you advance, you might not die.
         If you miss this chance, you will probably explode when you advance. Even if 50 drops of the spring of life can't completely stabilize your five internal organs, it's more or less enough.
         One should not underestimate the ability and wealth of these large organizations.
         50 drops of spring of life was a lot ... But hou Xiaochen believed that everyone would be able to take it out.
         At that time, perhaps they wouldn't even need to take risks with their own divine arts and would be using outsiders.
         Do you have a long transformation period?
         Many!
         There were some in some provinces, some among the Pirates, and even some of the Deputy heads of some organizations ... These people were only one step away. Just this one step was enough to block many people.
         There were not many people who could refuse a chance to rise to the top in a single step.
         Hou Xiaochen let out a breath. He didn't say this out loud because he didn't want to. If he did, it would be a huge blow to him.
         Therefore, if Li Hao returned in two days, he might think that there were not many people with divine powers, but ... It might be beyond your imagination!
         Of course, he once told Li Hao to leave the transformation to him.
         He had also made his preparations.
         However, the pressure was so great that he had no choice but to ask the heavens sword if he was coming!
         In the past, he would not have asked this.
         Seeing that he did not speak, Chief Steward Yu thought for a while and said,""Minister, if I completely unseal myself, can I fight against divine powers? Just how powerful ... Is this divine ability?"
         Hou Xiaochen looked at her for a moment before saying,"Very, very strong ... Unless you completely break multiple super locks, you won't be able to match him. At this stage, only a Martial Master with nine full super locks can match a god art without breaking them completely! Nine of them are saturated, and they have completed a basic cycle. A Martial Master in this state ... Can fight against a divine ability!"
         Nine!
         Butler Yu was stunned and fell into silence.
         She had just completed the saturation of five superpower locks.
         It was just barely unsealed, which was actually the same as the southern Fist.
         In her current state, it would be a miracle if she could deal with a metamorphosis stage cultivator, but it was impossible for her to deal with a god art.
         Unless he completely broke all five of them ... In that case, with the strength of a Martial Master, he could transform into a superpower and fight against a god art. However, in that case ... She might die, and he might be killed by the impact of his own superpower.
         After all, she didn't have a deep foundation.
         "Don't think too much. Don't worry, everything will be fine!" "I'm here, and there's also that guy from Southern Fist. He's just an opportunist, but he's still a Silver Moon Martial Master. He'll probably make a move ..."
         "Li Hao chose three days," chief Yu said softly."There are only two days left now ... The time is too short. Otherwise, the northern fist, BA Dao, and even silver moon's earth overturning sword and light sword might come to our aid ... He ... Left us with too little time."
         Yes, too little!  In just three days, they had covered a distance of more than twenty thousand li. Traveling seven to eight thousand li in a day, even with the earth overturning sword, it would be difficult for them.
         Li Hao ... What are you thinking?
         Was he not willing to let everyone come?
         Or did he feel that ... Even if he came, it wouldn't be of much use?
         Hou Xiaochen closed his eyes. At this moment, he seemed to be a bit sentimental. "Kid, I just hope that you'll be more reliable. I don't want you to go to your death again and again. This time, even I'm having a headache."
         If I had known this earlier, I wouldn't have let you become the Vice Governor of heavenstar.
         I've underestimated you!
         You came to stellarsky city and said that you wanted to open your eyes to see the world ... This time, perhaps you will be able to see it clearly. However, I'm worried that after you see it, you will only be filled with endless disappointment!
         The nine divisions and the royal family ... Could both deal with you. Do you still have any hope?
         ……
         In the blink of an eye, another day passed.
         This was the second day. There was still one more day to go. Three days later, it would be the day after tomorrow. The time Li Hao had mentioned would be up.
         BOOM!
         Wind energy swept through the cave, causing Li Hao to cough up blood. Even his physical body found it difficult to withstand the collision of wind and lightning. His five internal organs were in turmoil, but a thick chain had locked them all.
         Li Hao broke the sixth superpower lock bit by bit!
         Wind energy was released continuously.
         The wind and lightning fused, collided, and rumbled. Cracks appeared on Li Hao's body, and his blood instantly evaporated.
         "Let me see ... What a true divine ability is!"
         Li Hao smiled, a brilliant smile.
         I, Li Hao, am about to enter the divine-tier!
         Come on!
         Let this storm be more violent. With two divine weapons in hand, after I step into the divine power realm, I want to see how many divine powers in this world can match me?
         From now on, I don't need to rely on anyone to save me. I'm the only one who can save me!
         Kachaa!
         The Zifu lock was completely broken.
         "Hmph!"
          With a muffled groan, his bones, bones, and flesh rumbled as they broke, regrown, broke, regrown ...
         As the spring of life flowed into his body, the large number of swords could repair his body. Although the divine power was good, it was too harmful to the body.
         But I ... Have stepped into the divine power realm!
         The wind and thunder Rose, and the rain fell.
         Boom! Boom! Boom!
         Outside the cave, Thunder rumbled and the wind howled. In an instant, rain fell.
         Near the mountains, a storm came.
         It started to rain.
         At this moment, the sky changed.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao had reached the divine power realm on this day. He was no longer the weakling who needed his master to fight the three suns on a rainy day.
