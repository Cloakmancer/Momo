At this moment, the expression in the human King's eyes seemed to change.The next moment, as if he had remembered something, he suddenly looked into the distance and couldn't help but curse in a low voice!Ëâπ!Did I die so quickly?This grandson, scheming against me?You're not a thing!A beam of spiritual light flashed and disappeared in an instant.Li Hao was also speechless. The powerful human King ... Didn't make it to the end and was eliminated at the beginning. Fine, he was biased toward the blood ancestor, but who asked the human King to cause trouble?You ... You deserve to be kicked out!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.Outside the blood world.Dao laws wrapped around everyone. Suddenly, one of them opened his eyes. The human King opened his eyes instantly and couldn't help but curse,""F * ck, this guy is really useless. He must have plotted against me ... How can a mere blood ancestor kill me?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùAround them, someone sighed and said,""Old Fang, you're not stopping even after you've lost your memories. It's fine if you're trying to trick yourself, but I haven't even gained much insight yet, and I'm being killed with you. Seriously ..."I'm convinced by you!He could cause trouble anywhere!The human King turned his head to look and smiled,"iron head, you're out too?" I forgot to ask you, Who are you? Why don't I have any impression of it? I don't see any powerful iron-headed monsters. "‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe iron sovereign of neo martial arts was helpless and rolled his eyes."What iron-headed monster? I entered ... And ... I actually turned into armor?"He wasn't too sure either, so he said helplessly,""It's a bit like armor. It's mainly for defense. I might've gotten used to your shout, but I actually followed you to kill my way out. It's really ... Frustrating!"Then, he said with a little excitement,""It's quite interesting. I feel like I've spent hundreds of years in there, and my Dao has developed from nothing ... More importantly, my spirituality seems to have strengthened significantly. What a pity ...""You ..." Zhang xuan grumbled."If it weren't for you, my spiritual nature would've been even stronger after I reached grade-8. You've really done me in!"The human King laughed heartily,"the armor has gained a spirit?" Interesting! "Alright, that's enough. Although the Dao in this place is good, it's not perfect. It's enough to try something new and strengthen its spirituality. If we really extract all of it, won't li Hao find trouble with us?"There was only so much spirituality, and they were too powerful. If they were all drawn away, the spirituality within Hundun would dissipate, and Hundun would be finished.Li Hao couldn't help but fly into a rage and rush out one by one!He laughed and sensed for a while. He quickly said,""It's not bad. We've experienced the feeling of chaos being created. Although it might not be exactly the same, it's still a great experience for us!"He was a little emotional, but he soon smiled."Interesting. Li Hao's opening of the sky has given me some inspiration. I have an inner world, so I haven't been able to integrate it too well ... Perhaps I have a way to completely integrate it!"Ironhead sovereign was overjoyed to hear that.Really?If that was the case, the human King might have a chance of advancing further. Of course, it was hard to say if he could reach level nine. At this moment, the human King looked into the distance and raised his brows slightly.""How is chaos still not dead? He's too good at living! Li Hao should still be waiting for him to return to time and create a new world! It's a pity ... This guy died too slowly and missed the right time. Otherwise, it might have been more meaningful to watch Li Hao split the sky from the inside. "He was a little regretful, but not too regretful. He thought of something and scolded with a smile,""This guy has imprinted some of my saber technique comprehensions. When I return to the future world and a saber Dao expert comes out, he better not use my saber technique. If he kills me ... It'll be a big loss!"He laughed, but he didn't care too much. He was just saying it.If he was really killed, it would be because of his incompetence.He just looked to the West ...In the next moment, his eyes moved slightly.In the West.A vast energy instantly appeared between heaven and earth, and a chaotic energy instantly spread through the world.p BOOM!The fluctuations even resounded through the chaos, and the sounds of explosions rang out continuously!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the West.The chaos Emperor was covered in blood, and his white hair was starting to dry up. However, he still laughed and punched an eighth-grade venerable sovereign to death on the spot!At this moment, there were only three to five people left alive on the battlefield in the vast western land.Unparalleled chaos, huntian, who was heavily injured, and Tian Fang, who was fleeing through space.  Best novel online free at ùô£Oùô´ùôöùô°ùôóùôûùô£ Huntian Supreme Emperor was also panting heavily.His face was extremely gloomy!What a huge loss!The ninefold guards had been slaughtered by this guy. If he wasn't strong enough, he would have died at his hands as well. Those Grade 9 clones had all been destroyed by him.Today, only Tian Fang had escaped by relying on his spatial abilities.How detestable!Chaos was actually able to hold on for a while.How hateful!As for the chaos Emperor, he was also at his wit's end. He looked at the escaping tianfang clone, then at huntian bloody and laughed."It looks like I really don't have a chance to kill you ... Huntian, you're tough enough to take three of my peak-level punches and still not kill you!"How powerful was his peak strength?However, three punches weren't enough to kill him!What a pity.He looked at the escaping Tian Fang's clone and laughed,""Tian Fang, you old thing, you've been pretending to be a gentleman all day long. Why are you running away now? It's just a clone, so what if I kill it? What are you running for? weren't you extremely arrogant in front of me in the past? Why are you so useless today?"In the distance, Tian Fang's clone panted and didn't say a word.It didn't matter if his clone died. But at this moment, it was difficult for his true body to descend. It would naturally be for the best if he could leave his clone behind. There was no need to fight head-on with someone who was about to die.

Chapter 3751 Chaos Gu, Return Of Time
He turned his head to the East and frowned slightly.She had a feeling that ... Letting Li Hao continue wasn't a good thing.And now, chaos was about to die.Once time returned ... Would it be more troublesome?Also ... Could time really return?Could it be intercepted midway?He fell into deep thought.As for the chaos Emperor, he looked at huntian and Tian Fang who were fleeing and laughed. He began to age at a visible rate."Li Hao, you son of a B * tch! I'm so unlucky!"Shi Guang was way too terrifying.It was extremely powerful!"Today, dozens of type 8 powerhouses besieged me, and I killed almost all of them. Even at my peak, I might not have been able to do it. But today, using time, in this era, I've become truly invincible in chaos!Tianfang, huntian, or tribulation ...These people have all become my grandsons under my fist!"Li Hao ... You son of a B * tch ... You're right. I was able to have a good time ... But ..."The next moment, he couldn't help but curse,""Grandson, who the hell said that absorbing life force is useful?√®‚Ä∞¬π! You have to walk the path of life and death and reincarnation, you tricked me!"He exploded with anger!He had been tricked.Life force absorption was useful as it could maintain his peak state. However, it was also useless. This was because time consumed the limit of one's lifespan, not just life force. Only now did he understand!From the very beginning ... Li Hao, that grandson, had not allowed him to live."It's not like killing a rank nine and snatching his life force can make me live. My life span is exhausted, so I'm naturally old. What I need is not just this!And ... The cycle of life and death!"Therefore, the moment I activated time, I was destined to die of old age. Unless ... I kill the life and death Dao master and seize his origin. Perhaps I can quickly cultivate the life and death Dao and be resurrected again!Otherwise, there was no chance!"What a bastard, a black-hearted ghost ..."After scolding him for a while, he suddenly laughed again.He looked to the East and gritted his teeth. 'Fine ... You little brat, I know what you want to do. Then let's play something bigger!'"Huntian ..."He looked at huntian who was running away and didn't chase after him.At this moment, chaos heaven's order had collapsed. In fact, it was also in charge of the Dao of chaos and darkness.There was actually some conflict between them.p It might not be a bad thing!"Chaos is not a good Dao. When the world is United, chaos will be exterminated. No matter where you are, cultivating the Dao of chaos ... Will not end well in the end!"He was deep in thought. Huntian would definitely not have a good end.Of course, I'm the same. It was a pity that he had cultivated in chaos back then. Who would be willing to give up after becoming a ninth-rank?"Li Hao isn't easy to deal with ... Even if I die and my spirituality enters his new world, it might not be of any use even if I can be resurrected ..."A thought appeared in his mind. Perhaps ... It would be better to be a pure warrior.He thought.That's right, a pure martial artist might be more suitable. He couldn't win against this group of sinister villains."If it's purer, perhaps ... I can live a more comfortable life!"This thought appeared and he sneered. He poured all the chaos energy into the time star.I'll let you split open the sky!I'll add something to you and let you have a good time!Then, he thought of something and chuckled. Suddenly, he left an imprint in the stars and time. Only then was he satisfied. He chuckled. If Li Hao really wanted to split open the sky, his spirit would not be destroyed ... Perhaps, after he split open the sky, he would still be able to gain some advantage!Of all the DAOs in the world, only Wu Yongchang!Martial arts would never be destroyed. Where there were people, there would be Jianghu. Where there was Jianghu ... There would be chaos in martial arts!Let's ... Just wait and see!"Chaos ... I ... Don't want it anymore!"The chaos Thearch thought to himself. He knew he wasn't a fool, but he had been tricked by someone else. In that case, he might as well ... Stop scheming!One dead person counts!It might be more refreshing.These sinister villains all liked purer martial artists. Martial artists were doing well in their world, but those who were calculative lived a miserable life.After thinking through all this, he looked in the direction that huntian and Tian Fang had fled in and laughed again.Why are you escaping?At this moment, I'm not in the mood to continue hunting you. I'll leave the trouble to Li Hao and the others. I'll also buy myself some time and opportunity so that Li Hao won't interfere and destroy my spirit! Best n0vel online free at n0ŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  Thinking of this, he chuckled again and suddenly shot up into the sky!Suddenly, the sky seemed to be torn apart.The chaos great Dao reappeared!At this moment, the chaos Emperor went straight into the depths of the great Dao. In the depths, the grade 9 experts were all furious."You really dare to come! Today, chaos will die!"Chaos, such courage!As for the chaos Emperor, he chuckled and charged toward the life and death Dao master. Although his chances of success were slim, there was no harm in trying.If I can really kill this person and obtain the Dao of life and death, I might be able to recover completely, and I won't have to be a grandson in Li Hao's fake world.He would be King in the chaos!"Life and death ... Come and fight!"The chaos Emperor roared and rushed into the depths of the chaos. His roar resounded in all directions."Who dares to stop me?"As soon as he finished speaking, the power of time exploded from his body. His entire person had aged to the extreme. The aura of death and decay surrounded his body. With a roar, he punched out!The life and death path master's eyes were cold."Don't forget that this is where our true bodies are!

Chapter 3752 Chaos Gu, Return Of Time
You're really arrogant!"Kill!"The cycle of life and death, the heavens collapsing and the earth cracking!The great Dao shook violently. At that moment, the entire chaos seemed to be shaking.The origin of chaos was throbbing violently.Like a chaotic demon, time froze in all directions. He punched out, and many ninth level venerable sovereigns attacked at the same time. They were all furious."You're courting death!"BOOM!The loud sound reverberated in all directions.Chaos 'main attacker, life and death Emperor, was also sent flying back at this moment. He was covered in blood. Chaos casually grabbed at the air and cursed in his heart.His hand seemed to have cracked half of the great Dao, but ... It was not the life Dao, but the death Dao.'I ... Am so F * cking unlucky.'If he had caught the life Dao, he might have had a chance, but if he had caught half of the death Dao, wouldn't he ... Die without a doubt?He cursed in his heart, knowing that his life was over!At this moment, he couldn't care about anything else. He had to stuff it in first. A large amount of death aura instantly merged into the time and star. The chaos Emperor roared and rushed into the depths of the chaos with the last of his strength!I ... I need to take a bite of the origin of chaos first!Long Zhan definitely wanted to revive as well.I also want to!BOOM!Breaking through the encirclement, the remaining force dissipated, and instantly broke through the obstruction of the others, and bit towards the huge heart ...The heart, which was the origin of chaos, seemed to be rather helpless at the moment.Anyone would bite it.Suddenly, his heart thumped. With a bang, chaos flew out directly. With a roll, he plunged into the chaos great Dao, his butt facing the sky. He was somewhat sorrowful. F * ck, you won't even let me take a bite?Long Zhan that fellow can even bite. I bite you, and you actually still resist?There was really no justice!Even the origin of chaos looked down on the chaos great Dao?How sad!At this moment, he had fallen into the chaos great Dao. Seeing that he had no more chances, he stopped struggling and suddenly sneered,""Everyone ... Wait for your father's return! If you want to descend, you'll have to wait for your next life!"BOOM!A deafening boom reverberated through the heavens and earth. The chaos great Dao seemed to have been broken once again, and all the level nine venerable sovereigns trembled."This bastard ..." The path master of the path of life and death could not help but curse. Bang Bang Bang!After saying that, his body seemed to have exploded a little, and blood flowed out. He couldn't help but look at his own power of Dao law and felt a little heartache. This bastard, even after he died, he still wanted to trick me!The Dao of death was instantly broken in half by this guy, which almost made him lose balance between life and death!Furthermore, it had even blown up a part of the chaos great Dao. It was already in turmoil and difficult to descend, but now ... He didn't know when it would calm down and descend into chaos.Chaos, what an animal!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time."Phew!" Both tianfang's clone and primordial chaos heaven's original body heaved sighs of relief.He was dead!He was finally dead.If this guy didn't die, they would all collapse.,m In the distance, Tian Fang panted."Huntian ... We can't fight anymore. We have to preserve and recover our strength. Li Hao split open the sky and time returns. Human King, Spring Autumn, and the others are still here. If we don't join forces ... I'm afraid you won't have a place in the chaos!"Chaos was dead, but this guy was ruthless enough to kill almost all the experts in the chaos!He even severely injured the chaos great Dao!At this moment, if he and huntian didn't join forces, how could they fight against the enemy King and the others?Huntian's expression was extremely gloomy. Everything had clearly gone smoothly for him, and he was about to become the King of Chaos ... Now, he was all alone! Best n0vel online free at n0ŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  At this moment, his injuries were not light.However, once chaos died, the chaos great Dao went out of control. This was his chance, but unfortunately, order collapsed.Otherwise, he might have had a chance to improve.Thinking of this, he nodded gloomily."Alright, there's no need for us to fight anymore ... You're just a clone, so there's no point in killing you ... Let's work together to deal with Li Hao and the others. Time has returned. If he's ready, perhaps ... He'll succeed very soon!"At this moment, he was a little nervous. Would Li Hao give up on time?This second-generation time cultivator ... They were really a little afraid.He was very afraid!Everything that had happened today had been within the other party's calculations. Even The Death of Chaos seemed to have been part of the other party's plan.Terrifying!Tian Fang wasn't afraid. With his true body here, nothing would be a problem. The key was that he couldn't come. Otherwise, there wouldn't be so much trouble.At this moment, Tian Fang also frowned slightly.Looking at the Restless chaos great Dao, he didn't know when it would calm down. He hoped it wouldn't be too long.Otherwise ... It was very likely that he would have raised a fierce tiger!

Chapter 3753 The Creation Of Heaven And Earth, Past, Future, Present
Within the primal Chaos.Another few hundred years had passed since the blood ancestor opened the sky. Time seemed to be of no value here.After hundreds of years, the chaos godly spirits had been fighting each other.The strong will always be strong, and the weak will be eliminated.The entire chaos became more and more chaotic, and Li Hao sensed the foreboding of order.Such chaos meant that the Dao of chaos in the outside world had already affected the entire Primal Chaos and was even spreading in.And this also meant that the chaos Emperor was probably fighting for his life.p This was a sign of order returning!This also meant that order was about to completely descend, and the chaos was about to come to an end.At this moment, Li Hao was sitting cross-legged in the void, ignoring everything and everyone. Even if an innate God approached, they would not dare to provoke him. All the chaos Gods knew that there was a strange man in the chaos.He was dressed in white ... And now, they knew that it was called clothes.The sword on their waists had never been unsheathed. They didn't know if it was powerful or not, but they didn't care because they didn't dare to get close to that person.They only knew that this person was very strong.As for how strong they were ... No one knew.In the past few hundred years, the blood ancestor had stabilized the world and strengthened his own world. In the chaos, he established his title as the number one expert and killed many chaos godfiends.In addition, the flame had also been resurrected.It called itself demonic flame.In a short period of time, he had made a name for himself and was called the second most powerful master in the chaos. The first was naturally the blood ancestor. As for Li Hao, he had never fought before. Although many people were afraid of him, no one knew exactly how strong he was.Although the blood ancestor and demonic flame knew of Li Hao's existence, they seemed to be a little afraid and didn't dare to approach him.Li Hao was well aware of the master's background.The origin of the demonic flame ... He couldn't make a specific judgment. He knew that it contained some origin of chaos, but Li Hao could sense whether it contained long Zhan's spirit. However, there were some ancient beasts in the chaos that seemed to contain long Zhan's spirit.He didn't know if this guy had been separated or had been completely shattered.Perhaps, he would not just become one person.Of course, Li Hao didn't care about this.It was hard to tell what the future held and whether he would win if he seized the initiative. Besides, Li Hao was prepared to kill all the innate gods on the day the sky was split open!He wanted to establish order in this chaos.As for whether anyone could escape ... That had nothing to do with him. He would kill those who came. Those who couldn't control their desires would come.That would be the time of their death.Some people could return, while others couldn 't. The living and those who entered through the passage from the outside could naturally return, but the dead would be truly dead if their spirituality was destroyed. Li Hao didn't care about that.Of course, as long as he didn't kill his teacher, there wouldn't be any problems. His own teacher ...Li Hao turned his head and looked in a certain direction, hesitating. At this moment, another five elements expert had appeared in the chaos, but judging from his style, he seemed to be different from his teacher. As for whether he was the one, he was not sure.His teacher's spirit was the first to merge into this world, and it was hard to tell if it had been suppressed for too long.Although Li Hao was the master of this world, he was also cutting off his connection with it. He did not take full control of it, but let it develop freely. This was his choice.The long sword in his hand trembled slightly. Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  In the past hundreds of years, Li Hao had mainly been nurturing the sword and repairing the damaged parts.The two divine runes on the divine sword became even more brilliant.There was a spiritual glow.The heavens!In addition to this, another gate appeared in front of Li Hao. It was the Stargate built by the neo martial artists in the past. Now, Li Hao had some ideas and made some improvements. He hoped to build a gate at the end of the river that could allow people to enter and exit this universe.If it was not completely sealed off, it would be difficult to break through this universe unless one surpassed Li Hao."The Stargate ..."Li Hao mumbled. After sealing the Stargate of the Silver Moon, was he going to seal the chaos again?"The long river ... Carries ..."The Stargate could act as one of the vessels.Did a long river need something from another side?A thought appeared in his mind. Create two doors?No need!One door was enough.Li Hao thought for a moment. One end would be fixed, and the other end would extend infinitely.In addition ... After opening the long river and transforming the myriad DAOs into a world, should I ... Set some restrictions?Li Hao fell into deep thought again. He looked at the demonic flame and the blood ancestor in the distance ...These existences were very powerful.Should he give them some restrictions?Long Zhan wanted fairness ... Li Hao was actually not very willing to interfere. However, he still had to place the human race into the myriad world later. If there were no restrictions, these chaos beasts were born to devour humans. With so many humans, it would be very easy for them to devour them."Hmm ... Open the land of ten thousand worlds. Since the chaos beasts live in the chaos ... Then we'll exclude them from the ten thousand worlds. The chaos is huge. If one has the ability, one can also rise in the chaos!"Li Hao muttered to himself. At this moment, he had already made some decisions.He didn't really want to interfere with their future development. However, he couldn't just throw in trillions of humans for these ancient beasts to devour.

Chapter 3754 The Creation Of Heaven And Earth, Past, Future, Present
Unless the ancient beast was willing to give up its identity as a member of the chaos race and enter the myriad world ... That way, it could also become a native demon.Many thoughts appeared in his mind.Li Hao's plan for the future became more and more perfect.To him, this was also a sort of sorting out, a sort of sorting out of the great Dao.This time, when time returned and everything was thrown away ... Perhaps ... Everything would be different.The thought emerged.Li Hao's eyes suddenly flickered. The entire world, the entire chaos, seemed to tremble violently. At this moment, the shattered heavenly policy of order seemed to have gathered between the world! Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  All the experts of the primordial chaos seemed to be looking at a book, The Book of Light!The boundless energy even shocked the blood ancestor and the other top-tier beings!What was that?Heavenly treasure?Or what?In the distance, Li Hao laughed. The heavenly policy of order had been restored. This also meant that ... The Era of Chaos was over. This meant that the chaos had died!My time is coming back!The entire chaos seemed to be suppressed in an instant.The blood ancestor's expression changed dramatically."A connate spirit treasure!"Someone exclaimed,"is this the ultimate treasure of chaos?"At first glance, everything seemed to be in order. This was the first time that order was sensed in the chaotic chaos.At this moment, many figures were flying over there madly.They ... Wanted to snatch the treasure!However, although the book looked close, it was actually very far away!Countless fiendgods flew over in a frenzy.At this moment, Li Hao smiled. He stretched out his hand, and the book flew straight at him.Li Hao himself didn't care too much. At this time, he was silently sensing everything. Time ... Was returning!Chaos was dead.He was definitely going to die. Unless that fellow killed the life and death path master, he would definitely die."It's time!"Li Hao stood up and smiled.I've waited!At that moment, the chaos seemed to freeze. Soon, the chaos returned to normal. However, Li Hao frowned slightly when the heavenly policy of order arrived at his side.He looked into the distance.A surge of blood Qi shot up into the sky!The blood ancestor crossed the void and roared,""Put it down!"Li Hao smiled and looked into the distance.The blood ancestor's speed was extremely fast. At this moment, he had opened the sky for hundreds of years ... Fine, he had opened the realm for hundreds of years, and he had become more and more powerful. He was furious, and his body was bathed in blood. His eyes were filled with coldness."Swordsman, other people might not know your background, but I do! However, today, I want this book!"Heavenly policy of order?Li Hao understood. He looked at the master, who was coming through the void, and then at the innate gods hiding around. He chuckled and said softly,""This book is mine. You have no use for it."Useless? How could the ultimate treasure of chaos be useless?The blood ancestor sneered. This person seemed to have come from beyond the heavens. He didn't know Li Hao's exact identity, but he had a vague feeling that ... He might be related to this person.Of course, this was not important.More importantly, although Li Hao looked intimidating, his aura wasn't strong. He wasn't even as strong as some powerful innate gods.Although the blood ancestor was a little afraid, he felt that he had become more and more powerful over the years.No one was a match for Hundun.That demonic flame might be able to compete with him!But this man ... Why would the blood ancestor be afraid of him?"Hand over the Supreme treasure!""This is the ultimate treasure of chaos!" The blood ancestor shouted coldly."I'm the number one creature in the chaos. This item belongs to me!" Sword-wielding fellow, this Lord doesn't want to kill you, so don't be ungrateful!"Li Hao sighed."As expected, desire is everywhere. You're the number one creature in the chaos. You can't escape desire either!" If you could restrain yourself, you would have a bright future. You and I are fated ... What a pity!"The blood ancestor frowned. Fate?What fated or not!He looked at the heavenly policy of order and felt a little envious. That book ... Book?Anyway, it was.He looked very powerful.With such a powerful ultimate treasure in his hands, coupled with his powerful strength, he would definitely be able to keep his throne as the number one in the chaos. As for the demonic flame ... What could it compare to him with?At this moment, the blood ancestor had already arrived in front of Li Hao.Although he was a little afraid, he still shouted again,""You don't want to hand it over?""He's really ... Seeking his own death!"Li Hao shook his head. At this moment, he was in no mood to pay attention to this guy. Time was different inside and outside, but the heavenly policy of order had emerged, and order had begun to be established. This also meant that ... Time was returning.He still had important things to do, so he didn't have the mood to deal with this guy.Go play somewhere else!"Since you're a spirit formed from the Dao of blood and can be considered the true innate God of this place, I'll give you a chance. Are you leaving ... Or not?"Li Hao rarely gave others a chance.However, it was more inclusive of the living beings born in the chaos that he had created.I'll give you a chance."Let's go, I won't argue with you. This fellow isn't like the human King or the others, nor is he like Silvermoon's group. If you kill him, then so be it. At most, you'll be eliminated. "This was a true chaos lifeform, a Xiantian lifeform.Even though it had fused with a lot of spirituality, it was all messy and not easy.He had also inherited some of his thoughts and bloodline, so he could be considered half a son. Actually, it was not impossible ... Alright, such an ugly son. Forget it, he was too ugly!It was blood red!Li Hao pretended that he had never thought about it."Leave?""Are you afraid?" the blood ancestor snorted.Li Hao was speechless. After a long while, he said,"you're really ... Stubborn!"

I'm scared?How can you tell that I'm afraid?Have I moved?In the distance, some gods were also approaching. Li Hao shook his head slightly and said nothing more. In that case, there was no need to say anything more. The power of desire was quite strong back then, and it could be considered a dark period for him.The power of desire was mixed in his blood, and he was afraid that the blood ancestor was filled with desire.Forget it!The death of a God was nothing.It would not affect the overall situation.In an instant, the sword was drawn!The blood ancestor was very powerful at this moment, but this world belonged to Li Hao. Furthermore, Li Hao had made some progress over the years. At this moment, he could even feel time returning!Li Hao didn't say anything. He simply drew his sword!The sword was drawn!A beam of light shot across the world, illuminating the entire chaos!The blood ancestor felt as if the chaos was being torn apart.He was a little dazed and didn't know how to react. What kind of sword was this?The sword light shot out!He drew his sword!He kept his sword!It was done in one go.Li Hao glanced at the blood ancestor. At this moment, a bloody mark appeared on the blood ancestor's face. In an instant, blood Qi filled the world and gushed out. In the distance, several Xiantian lifeforms nearby were suddenly enveloped by the blood Qi!Li Hao only glanced at it. It seemed to be a human spirit.As for who it was, he had no interest in knowing.Instead of looking at the blood ancestor, he looked up into the sky ... At the star that was slowly emerging, and a heartfelt smile appeared on his face. Time had returned!Li Hao floated up and directly travelled through the sky.The blood ancestor was the only one left, and his blood was draining like crazy. He looked at the sky and Li Hao in a daze and muttered,""One sword strike ... How is this possible?"This was impossible!I'm unrivaled in the world and unrivaled in the chaos. How could this be?The blood ancestor was on the verge of collapsing. He looked around, and suddenly ... He wondered who he was.He ... Who was he?Shaking, he slowly walked into the distance. His body began to collapse as he smiled in frustration,""I ... Can't block a single sword strike from him ... This person ... Is truly invincible ..."It turned out that all thoughts were just an illusion.That swordsman doesn't even care about me.A single sword had destroyed my spirit.I'm going to die!The road to invincibility was cut off here.He looked up at the sky and saw that person floating away. It was as if ... Something even more powerful than the book had appeared in the void. It was like a star, floating in the void without stars.At this moment, Li Hao was also smiling brightly.As for destroying the blood ancestor's spirit with one strike, he didn't care too much. Although the blood ancestor wasn't weak, his control of the great Dao was too poor. In addition, the order hadn't been established before, and the blood ancestor was formed from more than half of his own blood, so he was still affected by the blood characters ... Even though they were as strong as some level eight experts and were no weaker than the drug abstinences in the chaos, they were still powerless in front of Li Hao.There were too many limitations!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, the countless innate gods in the chaos were filled with fear.They were extremely terrified!Even demonic flame, who was hiding in the dark, widened his eyes and mouth at this moment. At this moment, demonic flame had the shape of a beast, with a dragon head and a Tiger body, like a Qilin, and a Black Flame was flickering in his heart.He had originally wanted to seize the Supreme treasure!However, he did not expect that the blood ancestor would be one step ahead of him, and that one step ... Saved his life.Mo Yan's heart shook!Who was this person?This scene shocked him greatly. He had killed the blood ancestor with one sword strike!In his eyes, the blood ancestor was the number one deity in the chaos and was extremely powerful. Even he would find it difficult to deal with the blood ancestor. But now ... He had been killed by a man with a sword!It was too unbelievable!"The blood patriarch ... Is dead?"Some people were shocked and looked in the direction where the blood ancestor disappeared. It was as if the place had completely collapsed.Was the blood ancestor dead?They didn't know. All they knew was that the powerful blood ancestor had been defeated by that man's sword in one strike. His blood Qi had rushed into the sky.At this moment, someone looked at the few people whose blood had splattered all over the place and suddenly said,""The blood ancestor's blood essence has covered the area ... Those guys ..."As he said that, the three of them suddenly roared.His aura suddenly began to grow stronger!The auras of those who weren't too strong among the gods suddenly rose, causing the surrounding heroes to look over.Just as he was about to do something, the powerful being who had just killed the blood ancestor suddenly laughed as if he had obtained some kind of treasure. His laughter resounded in all directions."Good, good ... I'm finally back ..."Li Hao's smile was radiant. Shi Guang was back!No one intercepted it.It couldn't be intercepted.I'm still alive, so how could those people be able to intercept time?But ...Looking at the Time and Stars in front of him, Li Hao frowned slightly, as if he had seen through something. He thought for a moment and smiled. Who cares!Chaos, it seemed like he was still unwilling to give up!But ...  Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  Soon, he laughed again. 'Chaos, you Rascal, do you really have to make some trouble for me to be happy?'‚Äã Alright, I'll fulfill your wish!"You haven't lost your spirituality, but ... You just have to make trouble for me. You're a level nine body, and there's hope for you to rise in this new Sky, but ... Forget it, you'd better be at ease.If the world isn't chaotic, then chaos won't happen. You'd better not recover!Only when the world is in chaos, you ... Can come back to life!'I'll say it's fair, but if you really succeed and you're the one who comes out ... Then I'll be crying. '

Chapter 3756 The Creation Of Heaven And Earth, Past, Future, Present
"If you didn't cause trouble, I wouldn't have cared about you. But you just had to cause trouble ... You think you're smart? then ... I'll suppress your spirit!"Li Hao laughed. Of course, this was not the only reason.The main thing he was worried about was that this guy was at the ninth step.If he was awakened in advance and became a chaotic creature, wouldn't it be troublesome?If he became a tier 9 ... The entire energy of the chaos would be sucked dry by him. Wouldn't that mean that the chaos would collapse?You're too strong!So ... It's better to be honest and rely on luck. If you're lucky, you can still appear when the world is in chaos. If there's no more chaos here, you'd better live in peace under the river until your spirituality is completely destroyed.I'm the one in control of time. How could I not know about your little tricks?At this moment, Li Hao knew what to do.  Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  He sensed the chaotic power mixed in the great Dao ... He smiled but did not expel it. Chaos was also a kind of energy. When things reached an extreme, they would reverse. If there was only order, then it would be the second West.Huntian had built the West well, but it was too fake!He had no desires!Be it humans or demons, how could they not have any desires?In addition, war and chaos were all necessary for the development of the times. Li Hao understood that even more now. He laughed. "That's good, then ... I'll keep the chaotic energy ... I was wondering why that guy scolded me last time ... So that's why ..."In the long river, the power of Chaos was dense, so it was inevitable that ... There would be frequent battles!This world was destined not to be a place for enjoyment.It was inevitable for them to experience the change of times.Of course, it was also a good thing.Li Hao had no intention of driving them away. Otherwise, the future might have changed.At this moment, Li Hao waved his long sword and laughed in a low voice, which resounded in the world."Three days later, I will split open the sky and the river of time ... All gods, retreat if you have nothing to do! If you're swallowed by desire and come to make trouble, you'll be beheaded without mercy!""There are 50 great DAOs, 49 heaven evolutions, and one man escapes ..."Li Hao mumbled,"I'll give you a chance!"If I'm not bewitched by my desire, I won't kill you if you don't come!However, if they did ... He would kill them!Leave a line in life, it'll be easier to meet in the future.After thinking this through, Li Hao was relieved. I've done what I should.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Heaven and earth shook.Split open the sky?Splitting open the sky again?Was it the same as when the blood ancestor opened the sky?This person in front of him was unparalleled in strength, and he was actually going to split open the sky?Was splitting open the sky that good?What was the river of time?Everyone was puzzled!However, at this moment, he was a little excited and a little nervous. Why ... Wouldn't he let them observe?When the blood ancestor opened the sky, he invited everyone to watch. Why didn't you give it to him?That's strange!Although it was strange, everyone was afraid of this person. At this moment, no one knew Li Hao's name, and they heard that he had opened the river of time ... Could this person be the ancestor of time?He didn't understand, and he didn't dare to get close. And at this moment, in the chaos, there were also people who were getting restless ... Was there any benefit to splitting open the sky?If there were no benefits, why were they all splitting open the sky?Three days later ...To experts, it was really just a blink of an eye.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the blink of an eye.Three days had passed.Li Hao stood proudly in the air. This was the center of the chaos.On this day, Li Hao stood at the peak of the void. The power of desire began to fill the world. It's fine if they don't come, but if they do ... Then don't blame me for being merciless."Rise!"There were gods hiding in the dark around them, but Li Hao didn't care. With a light shout, the windless sky suddenly rose and fell like a hurricane or a wave, and the sound of the stormy waves resounded in all directions!‚Äã "Hualala ..."Like flowing water, it crashed into the heavens and earth!Countless streams of Primal Chaos energy surged forward!Energy from all directions rapidly gathered, as if a hole had been opened in the sky, and the river water poured out!Countless streams of water ... All of them were formed from the convergence of Primal Chaos energy.At that moment, countless gods and demons were stunned!Where did the power of the great Dao come from?Countless!It turned into a River. At this moment, only the source of the small river could be seen. However, the river water instantly covered the world and poured out.Some of the river water even turned into crystals, the crystals of the great Dao!It was as bright as the stars!Countless gods and demons were going crazy. Their mouths were wide open. There was so much power of great DAOs, so much ...It spread out and covered the sky!The sound of the river gradually covered the entire world.Li Hao attacked!The sword was unsheathed, and a bright light flashed as if the sky had been torn apart. The river began to spread and expand. Li Hao began to split open the sky, but it was only the beginning!He tore the void apart, and the river started to expand. In an instant, a divine rune seemed to come from the sky, and the power of the great Dao spread in all directions. Among the gods and demons, one of them suddenly exclaimed,""What's that?"It was divine text!It was Li Hao's world divine text.They were all integrated into the four directions of heaven and earth. At this moment, they were only converging towards the river of the great path.He opened a long river and gathered it in a realm. However, to the innate gods, they seemed to sense something at that moment. It was an extremely pure great Dao!Some gods and devils couldn't hold it in any longer!"That's ... The origin of a great Dao!""That's ... A rule that surpasses the great DAOs we control!""The rules?""It must be ..."The godfiends went crazy. They didn't know what it was, but they knew that it was something good."Stop him from splitting open the sky!" A God roared."He's absorbing all the power of Chaos! If this continues, the chaos will become a barren land ..."

Chapter 3757 The Creation Of Heaven And Earth, Past, Future, Present
There was anger, desire, greed, and madness!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In an instant, countless gods and devils appeared.Someone roared,"the sword in his hand is a Supreme treasure!" He still had that book and that star that had just appeared ... They were all Supreme treasures. Kill him! If we don't kill him, he'll take the chaotic force, and we'll be ... In trouble!""He's very strong, but he's only one person!""Let's attack together!""Kill him!"Countless gods and devils roared. They couldn't take it anymore.If they didn't kill Li Hao, their chaotic force would be extracted, and they might never have the chance to improve again. Of course, greed was also the key. That person had too many ultimate treasures."Don't make a mistake, you lot!"Li Hao laughed.He opened up the river, and it began to spread. Countless monstrous forces swept out and rolled over.Boom! Boom! Boom!The chaos seemed to be exploding, and the heavens and earth shook violently.All of a sudden, a God couldn't hold it in any longer and rushed over. He seemed to have seen something and was extremely surprised. He saw a piece of divine text that seemed to match him very well. He suddenly shouted,"These things ... These ... Words? It seems ... To match our great Dao!"Li Hao nodded and chuckled."It's a match. Chaos has 5000 gods and demons, 5000 great DAOs, 5000 divine runes ..."Of course it was a match!Perhaps there were not enough gods and demons, but there were enough divine runes.Therefore, everyone could find their own Dao.‚Äã So ... The temptation to them would be even greater.What Li Hao had to do was kill the corresponding God and nurture the corresponding Dao. This was the spiritual accumulation!In the future, if a realm became stronger, it would be the spirit that nurtured the great Dao that was stronger. Of course, it would also be related to the people who came later.Let's see how they cultivate it!All of this has nothing to do with me.Li Hao smiled.The charging God went straight for a branch of the river as if it had gone crazy. Li Hao laughed, and a long sword appeared and slashed down!BOOM!With a loud bang, a powerful God was instantly killed by him. His spirituality flew away, but his body was shattered and merged into the great Dao. The divine runes of the great Dao were instantly strengthened!Over the years, the energy that the other party had cultivated and some of the spiritual nature that had been purified were all left behind.He wasn't allowed to take her away!Whether it was a new martial artist or Silver Moon, he could enter it to gain insight, but to take away this energy ... Forget it.I don't even have enough for myself, so you guys have to find a way!When one's realm was high enough, there would always be a way.Killing a God with a single strike seemed to have triggered something. Suddenly, dozens of gods roared,""If one person can't beat him, let's attack together! If I don't kill him, chaos will descend ... I can already sense the coming of a future disaster ..."  Read Latest Chapters at‚Äã ÔΩé0ÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé "Kill!""Kill him!"Countless gods and devils, under the lead of some powerful figures, charged towards the river with bloodshot eyes! At this moment, the river was still expanding under Li Hao's control.Suddenly, a God in the dark sensed something and was shocked.""This is bad. The land covered by his River ... Is actually rejecting us. Once he covers the chaos, we ... Will probably have no place to stand!"Li Hao's voice rose again."I'm a human. Wherever the river reaches, the human race can stand!" Among you innate gods, there are humans and non-humans. Humans can enter, but non-humans can 'T. You can merge with the river of DAOs!"As soon as he said that, even some of the powerhouses who were originally afraid were instantly enraged!In the distance, a giant demonic flame beast appeared and roared,""Why so? So unfair?""Although you are strong ... The chaos is where we stand and our home. Why is it unfair?"Li Hao chuckled. Unfair?Long Zhan had also asked this before.He laughed and said,"because ... I'm a human!" Of course, there are 50 great DAOs and 49 heavenly evolutions. There's still a chance of survival. If you don't cause trouble today, I'll leave the 11th land of chaos for you to stand ...""What?"One-tenth?How was that possible?They were used to moving freely in the chaos. At this moment, someone wanted to take 90% of their land, and they could not bear it.Mo Yan was furious,"kill!" Kill him! If we don't kill him, we will all decline ..."BOOM!Many figures quickly appeared in the sky and charged at Li Hao.Li Hao looked at the roaring demonic flames in the distance ...He was slightly startled.Why can't you?This grandson ... Was he really long Zhan?Good fellow!He only knew how to roar and didn't make a move. It seemed like he had really restrained some of his desires and had actually learned how to trick people.Interesting!Li Hao smiled and didn't care. At this moment, he waved his sword and killed the gods on the spot. They merged with the great Dao and the divine runes. Under the river, branches seemed to penetrate the void like tree roots and began to spread, taking root in the chaos.He would absorb the power of Chaos to perfect his own Dao.It did not form a world.It was easy to form a realm. If a god or devil was willing to merge into the realm, the realm would naturally open. If no one was willing, after a long time, someone would cultivate the Dao and form a realm!It was just a matter of who came first.However ... Every great Dao had some chaotic power mixed in!Li Hao shook his head.'Chaos Supreme Emperor, he's really not a good person. Forget it, I'll just let him mix with chaos!'At this moment, he suddenly waved his hand, and the world seemed to be overturned!In an instant, it was as if a divine Kingdom had descended!The auras of countless living beings appeared!In the blink of an eye ... Countless humans suddenly appeared within the river's reach.

Chapter 3758 The Creation Of Heaven And Earth, Past, Future, Present
They were all creatures of the divine Kingdom.The creatures of the divine Kingdom were all dazed.As a result of their belief, their intelligence had been diminished. At this moment, as the humans descended, Li Hao sighed and opened up some realms to accommodate them.The humans were dumbfounded and confused!Li Hao sighed again ... If this went on any longer, these humans would all turn into machines, and it would be impossible for them to recover.Now ... Even if he couldn't return to normal, he could just be an ordinary person and live an ordinary life in this chaos.At this moment, the time star at the end of the horizon suddenly expanded crazily!This was the mortal world he had set!The human world was naturally biased. It was not large enough to accommodate so many humans. Li Hao hesitated for a moment before making a decision. He reached out, and a world seemed to appear!That was ... The world of the king of Dali.In the world of the Dali King, most of the people were humans who were unwilling to believe in him. And these humans had not lost their spirituality yet. They might be able to become the root of the human race and develop here!They were proud and unruly, and had many memories. However, they weren't very strong, and didn't know much. Their intelligence was still there ....This would be the foundation for the rise of the human race in the future!Over the years, the king of Dali had been educating them well. However, he could not continue to educate them and really become the Overlord of the world. If that was the case ... It was better to free the king of Dali!These humans could all rise in the future.At this moment, Li Hao had placed them in the space-time star, which was also the foundation of the human world.Countless humans looked up at the sky in confusion.What was that?They seemed to see something ... A sword, and ... The chaos was being split apart!Among the countless humans, a little boy looked up at the sky in shock. What was that?Had the sky been broken?At this moment, Li Hao suddenly frowned and slashed out with his sword. Slightly frowning, he chuckled and said,""Why is there so much death aura? I didn't sense it in advance ..."It just so happened that he had killed many people, and the aura of death was thick.With a wave of his hand, he suppressed the death aura at the bottom of the river!It wasn't a good thing for the aura of death to be too thick. This world lacked some life, so it was better to suppress it first so that death wouldn't interfere with future development.Just as Li Hao suppressed all the power of death into the bottom of the river ...In the time realm, the boy seemed to have seen something. His eyes and mouth were wide open as he turned back and muttered,""Dad, I think I saw something ... The sky was broken, and something ... Fell into the river?""Yin! Don't talk nonsense ... Run, the sky is collapsing ... Earthquake ..."They had changed worlds, and it seemed as if it had only been an instant. The world did not seem to have changed. At this moment, they felt as if the sky had collapsed and the earth had caved in. A middle-aged man picked up his child and ran away. The little boy, on the other hand, looked up at the sky!Really, father, I saw ... I saw something fall into the river!What was that?The child was not afraid, only curious. He seemed to have seen a big black ball fall into the river. River?Where was the river?Strange!Was there still a Sky River in the sky?This scene was branded into his memory, leaving a seed. He only remembered that on that day, the sky changed color, and countless people fled. However, he also remembered ... That something had fallen into the river. It was in the river in the sky!  Read Latest Chapters at‚Äã ÔΩé0ÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, a large number of gods and demons charged at him, and Li Hao killed them one by one with his sword!The long sword was cracking.Too many godfiends had been killed, causing the blood Qi in the river to soar into the sky!Hatred, anger, greed, madness ... They filled the entire chaos, and even order was dyed blood red.One Spirit after another shot into the sky and disappeared into the chaos. There were also gods who were directly annihilated on the spot and integrated into the chaos great Dao, creating a powerful long river. The long river grew longer and more stable. At this moment, waves appeared above the long river.At this moment, some people seemed to have appeared.It was as if he had come from the future.At that moment, they also saw it. They saw a man killing in all directions and killing countless gods and devils. All of them widened their eyes and opened their mouths!Above the river, Emperor Yu raised his brows slightly. I ... Seem ... To have really traveled back to the day when the sky was split open!This was ... The time King splitting open the heaven and earth?"In that case ... I might be able to leave this place very soon?"He was a little happy, but also a little ... Wanted to curse!At this moment, he saw the old man smiling at him ... And the smile ... Seemed a little evil!Ëâπ!What are you laughing at?I don't like you recently, yet you still smile!But at this moment, Li Hao laughed. Suddenly, he stirred the river, causing it to shake violently. Li Hao's voice resounded through the world."The past and the future, don't overlap ... Kid, don't run around. Don't disrupt the order of time and space. This place is not for you! When the past and the future overlap, there will be problems. Go ... Follow your path!"The long river fluctuated and shook violently!At this moment, in the river, Emperor Yu was furious.""Old bastard, what are you doing?"Boom! Boom! Boom!The entire River started to shake violently. Even he was affected by it as if he was about to enter a fork in the river. His expression changed slightly as he cursed madly!This old fellow!He would be beaten to death sooner or later if he went too far!What the hell was he doing?You can't recognize me after wearing pants?I helped you last time ... Just as he was thinking, the long river was completely overturned. He swayed left and right and did not know where he was swept by the huge waves. At this moment, his surroundings were dark and the long river seemed to have disappeared. Looking around again ... He was a little lost.'Where ... Am I?In the distance, a star seemed to have appeared. It was dim and lightless. At this moment, a figure seemed to have appeared on the star.Looking over, he suddenly smiled in surprise. In his hand ... There was also a time star!The person on the star laughed.He looked at the group of people that appeared in the distance. Some were illusionary, some were real, as if they had come out of thin air."The past, the present, the future ... Everything is in chaos!" He mumbled.It was complete chaos!The second-generation successor had actually ... Given up on time!I'm really surprised.It seems that the future I see is not the only one.Perhaps, he could really change everything.He smiled and looked into the distance before disappearing from the stars. This ... Could he be considered the third generation?It seemed like ... He had not mastered time.Perhaps ... It was time to master time!You've only grasped 49 of the 50 great DAOs. You're only one step away from truly walking out and walking out of the second generation's shadow.Outside the world, Su Yu was Dazed and Confused. Soon, he seemed to sense something and widened his eyes in disbelief. Where am I?This place ... Why ... Why is it so strange!

Chapter 3759 Egoism In Chaos (1)
In the blood world.The long river shook, and the group of people disappeared.Li Hao smiled.This wasn't the time for the future one to appear. If he did, the present and the future would overlap.That was because there were still some people around that person.It was right here!When the present and the future coincided, time and space would be in complete chaos.As for where the other party went ... Who knew?Perhaps ... It was in the past!If he returned to the past, the existence beside the person from the future would not overlap. This would ensure that time and space would not be in disorder and cause the long river to collapse.However ... There weren't many places he could go. Perhaps ... Only the river of the past could possibly lead him away.Battle!Was it?Yes, perhaps only he could use the river of time at a certain moment to take that person away.The past, the present, and the future ... This was a complete time line.At this moment, Li Hao had many thoughts.The long sword continued to split the heavens and earth.The river of time was still spreading. Li Hao murmured softly,""The moment I give up on the river, the moment you die ... In this world, there is only ... Time!"Time, in the end, does not belong to me.Perhaps, in your eyes, I'm the time King. No, it's actually you.I'm not after time.You are ... Su Yu, right?  Read Latest Chapters at‚Äã ÔΩé0ÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé At this moment, the river opened up. Li Hao seemed to hear something or see something. He smiled and continued to open up the river, killing the gods and demons!A large number of godfiends were killed!At this moment, some of the gods and devils finally became afraid and didn't dare to charge forward again.Some of the godfiends in the surroundings began to flee.That demonic flame had already run far away in fear.He was too strong!In their eyes, the time King and Li Hao at this moment were almost invincible and unbelievably strong. Was there anyone who could rival such an existence?Who could kill this demon?No one could do it!The long river surged, and the sound of waves swept across the world. The huge River began to occupy more than half of the chaos, squeezing the living space of the gods and devils.The longsword in Li Hao's hand had already begun to shatter.Countless divine runes merged with the Dao of heaven and earth.Li Hao was starting to feel weak.Too much power had been consumed by him, and he was somewhat overdrawn. Since chaos was dead, there should still be people alive. If Tian Fang and the others were still alive, they might come to find trouble with him.As Li Hao thought of this, he glanced at the river that stood between heaven and earth. A gate appeared in his hand. It was the Stargate of the past, but it was more powerful than it had been in the past.Li Hao took a deep breath and jumped into the river.The Stargate stood at one end of the long river. This was the door to the outside world.But ...After a moment's consideration, the power of a great Dao overflowed from Li Hao's body, and all his emotions burst out and fused with it.The darkness and desire in his heart were all integrated into it.This is your final trial."Only after passing through this gate will you know that the hearts of the outside world are sinister. Perhaps only then will you truly be able to walk out and fight alongside us. There are too many Grade 9 experts in the primordial chaos. Even if you walk out, you won't be invincible.If you can't control your inner desires, then you'd better stay in this false chaos.The river started to shake violently!On the other end, it seemed like someone was trying to get in ...Li Hao looked back and saw that some gods and devils seemed to be trying to enter the river. The power of great DAOs was extremely dense in the river, and simple rules were being established.Li Hao had said that the only way to enter was to merge with the world.Clearly, some godfiends who wanted to enter didn't care about fusing with the Dao and transforming into a world.Li Hao glanced at it but didn't pay much attention.He was only responsible for building a prototype. Today, he had opened the sky and opened the river. He had gained many insights. How the future would develop was up to them. He couldn't always be in charge. Everything would be under his control. He had lost the necessity of the future civilization.At this moment, Li Hao set the Stargate deep in the river.The next moment, he slashed his sword toward the sky!The long sword broke instantly!Li Hao glanced at the broken firmament sword and sensed some intelligence in it. After thinking for a moment, he threw away the sword and floated into the air. "You're on your own. The sword has no soul or body, but it'll always be with me. If I gather its spirituality, perhaps ... I can break away from the sword."A sword was, after all, a dead object.Now, a spirit was born in the sword. This was an opportunity and an opportunity.One day, when you leave the sword body, there is hope for you to succeed in the emperor's career.However ... The firmament sword was too deadly.Whether he could escape or succeed, it was hard to say.This was its own fate.Li Hao didn't care anymore. Letting the sword spirit stay was the best he could do. The future depended on the firmament sword itself.He soared into the sky and headed towards the depths of the endless chaos.Time to go out!He had done everything he could.When he was near the barrier between heaven and earth, he looked back and saw that the river was still spreading, as if it was going to penetrate the entire chaos. Li Hao smiled, but then he could not help but laugh. Was that demonic flame long Zhan?Why did he become so timid?Now that he was gone, that fellow was getting interesting. It was trying to squeeze towards the river, but it was unwilling to merge with the river. It seemed that this fellow still wanted to maintain its independence as a Chaos Beast.
