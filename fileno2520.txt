The other party might feel that he had been reborn, reborn to a time before Li Hao had completely risen to power.Li Hao laughed,'it's not that simple. The general trend is irreversible! "Besides, I'm watching. I'm not at that stage yet. If these people really reverse the situation, I won't be able to hold on! I can only fix it. Even if it's Northern fist and the others, if they dare to destroy the original trajectory, I'll have to hack them to death, drag them out, and give them a beating!""What?" celestial pole was slightly stunned."If you're strong enough to support the change of the general trend ... Does that mean that you can really reverse the past and the future?"Li Hao thought for a long time, then nodded.""There's hope ... But ... If it really comes to that, I can already withstand the reversal of the general trend. What else do I need to change?"The general situation could not be changed!Once it changed, a fork would appear in the river of time, and Li Hao had to fix it.Otherwise, he would not be able to control the development of the situation.Moreover, only a portion of the people here were real. Most of them were fake. If he really wanted to reverse the situation, he had to resurrect everyone and erase their memories, leaving only a few people to know. This was the true rebirth.This included Silver moon's 10 billion people!At that point, Li Hao was no longer the half-emperor he was now. He didn't even have enough venerable sovereigns.Celestial pole didn't care about this. He just sighed."That means ... You're so powerful that you can do it?""Very far away! However, according to senior's words, if I can hold on, I can. " "Amazing!""Amazing!" Heaven's Fate exclaimed."This power of time is extraordinary!" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao also nodded.At this moment, he looked at the river again. As time passed, the river was filled with laughter and laughter. The Silver Moon Martial Master was no longer silent. Some people were teasing the southern Fist sect, while the southern Fist sect was cursing!Li Hao suddenly thought of something and laughed. The next moment, a pair of gloves appeared out of thin air and fell into the river.In the river, Nan Quan was suddenly hit on the head by something.In the next moment, they were in disbelief and overjoyed!"Iron Supreme Emperor gloves? How could this be! And the iron fist inheritance ... Oh my God!艹! I'm rich now, why is there such a thing?"“……”Heaven's Fate was speechless as he watched from the sky. He looked at Li Hao and thought,"is this guy ... Bored?"Li Hao smiled happily. "Martial uncle Nanquan has always wanted to beat up beiquan, but he's still not strong enough. Now that beiquan is about to reach the second or third level of the Dao integration stage ... Nanquan is the sun and moon ... I have to give him a surprise. I want to see him thinking that he has surpassed beiquan and challenging beiquan only to be beaten up again!"“……”You're really nothing!Heaven's Fate laughed. He really laughed.It was very interesting!Li Hao was simply a lunatic. No, he was schizophrenic.The previous Li Hao had been too scary, and the current Li Hao was extremely childish. Which side of this guy was real?Li Hao, on the other hand, was smiling brightly as he watched in silence.It was very interesting! In the long river, it was like a movie. Scenes flashed by one after another. He smiled in his heart as he watched.The southern Fist ... Had been beaten again!Hou Xiaochen and Yu Luosha had broken through that layer of paper window, and their relationship had become even closer ... Old hou had even ... Bah, he was shameless!As for his own teacher ... He was even more shameless to the extreme.Pretending that he didn't know the situation, he had duped the Azure light sword to the point that he was almost thinking of giving Li Hao a Junior Brother ... What the hell. I was letting you guys experience enlightenment, not for you guys to talk about love.Why was there a rancid smell of dog food in this long river?There was a price to pay for the continuous consumption of one's lifespan, alright?Of course ... Li Hao smiled again.It was pretty good!This was the true strength of the Silver Moon master Corps. Otherwise, wouldn't they be as lifeless as before?His smile became even more radiant!At this moment, heaven and earth were still shrouded by the bed. Other than li Haotian and a few others, the true bodies of some experts had not entered. For example, Earthcover sword, gan Wuliang, the Queen, the king of Dali, and others. Their true bodies were outside.Of course, this included Lin Hongyu, who was not weak either.The price he had to pay to bear the weight of a powerhouse was too great.At some point, the group of people had become much more relaxed. They had all gathered above Li Hao's River and looked down at the changes in the river with smiles.In the long river, everyone had reached the stage of exterminating the desolate beasts and killing Zheng Yu's father.Those who had been resurrected had all grown in strength."Can we bring them out ... Since they've improved?" Lin Hongyu was confused.At this moment, the strength of these resurrected people was improving at a rapid pace.His Foundation was too good!Li Hao nodded."Yes, I can. Otherwise, I could've just created an illusion. Why would I create a river of time reversal?""But ... Energy can't be created out of thin air. Where does it come from?"At this point, she paused and looked at Li Hao. Li Hao's appearance didn't change much, but he had a ... Rotten smell. She frowned."Are ... Are you okay?""I'm fine. "Lin Hongyu understood instantly.These people's increase in strength came from Li Hao.The power of a peak half-step Emperor!Although these people weren't too strong, and the increase in strength wasn't important to Li Hao, it was equivalent to taking away Li Hao's power and helping them.Lin Hongyu wanted to say something but did not in the end.

2521 Chapter 419
Li Hao, as long as you're happy.At the very least, Li Hao was happy.This was also the first time she had seen Li Hao smile so happily after the battle at boundless city. She was truly happy, except ... She also knew that there were still regrets, such as Zhang Yuan and Li Hao's parents.However, even Li Hao couldn't reverse this, let alone her, so she didn't mention it again."Can I control the me inside?"She suddenly asked, and Li Hao nodded.""Sure!"As soon as he said that, the situation changed. Lin Hongyu controlled herself in the river and went to find Li Hao. Li Hao turned to look at Lin Hongyu, but she didn't even look at him.Li Hao only looked at it for a while before he waved his hand and covered the river.What a boring woman!You and I are only projections, do you really want to do something?At this moment, Li Hao was in a good mood. He looked around and finally looked at the king of Dali."Come in and take a shower. It'll be good for you!"The king of Dali already had this thought, and at this moment, he was not vague, but he was a little confused.""It won't consume too much of my lifespan, right?""I won 't! Go!"​ The king of Dali no longer delayed and quickly rushed into the river. In an instant, the power of time washed over him, but he did not feel any pain. Fortunately, the qi and blood in his body were growing.It felt great!It was much purer!In the past, he had absorbed them himself. Now, he had cultivated them on his own initiative. What he had cultivated was not the support of Li Hao's energy, but his own lifespan!Before his teacher and the others had even arrived, the Dali King had almost recovered to his peak. Not only that, but he even felt that he had reached a higher level. With the purity of his qi and blood, he felt that he had the hope of entering the true peak of the Heavenly King realm!After an unknown amount of time, the Dali King still wanted to continue bathing in the long river, but Heaven's Fate couldn't help it. ""Come out!"The Dali King was stunned and quickly walked out of the long river.In the next moment, he was a little embarrassed. He shook his head and said in dissatisfaction,""Senior, I'm only at the late Heavenly King stage. I think I'll reach the peak of the Heavenly King stage soon!"This improvement was too awesome!Why did you call me?Heaven's Fate wanted to roll his eyes. He didn't want to meddle in other people's business, but he still felt that this guy was too stupid. He said angrily,"Peak Heavenly King? If you stay here any longer, you'll die of old age!"The Dali King was stunned.Heaven's Fate helplessly sensed that there was nothing wrong. Li Hao, on the other hand, smiled and said,""It's fine. Even if he's at the peak of the Heavenly King realm, he can still live for one or two years ... He can still live for at least a few decades now. I think it's too much ...""A Heavenly King ... At least 100000 years?" the Dali King was stunned.Even Saints could live for so long!Undyings were fine too, of course, undyings lived for 100000 years, almost all of them were in deep sleep.However, it should not be difficult for a Heavenly King to live for 100000 years, right?Li Hao looked at him."You're using up your own lifespan. That's why you improved so quickly. If you've only recovered to the early-stage Heavenly King realm, you wouldn't have used so much."Only then did the king of Dali understand, and he instantly wanted to curse!Li Hao laughed,"alright, you've lived longer than me!" Before you die, I will give you a chance. As long as you and I advance, everything will not be a problem! It's a good deal to exchange your life for power. I won't give anyone else the chance to do so!"The Dali King was speechless and felt that he had been tricked again!This guy was rotten to the core!Of course, it was true that his strength had increased. He had comprehended the half-step sovereign's strength in advance. Now that he had reached the late Heavenly King stage, there wasn't much of a disadvantage. He just felt that ... He had suddenly become old!He had really seen a ghost!……The river continued to flow as they laughed.Suddenly, the waves of the river stopped.The next moment, the entire River rippled. Li Hao laughed and sighed,""I'm back!"In an instant, the world spun!The river was broken!Suddenly, a group of people burst out. As soon as they came out, Nan Quan's loud voice resounded through the world with some excitement."I have advanced to the Dao integration realm. I am unparalleled in the world ..." Bang! Bang!When Fist of the North saw that he had come out, he punched out, sending fist of the South flying backward. He lay on the ground, motionless. Fist of the South had a blank expression on his face. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The next moment, Li Hao smiled, and a wave of power spread out. Something different appeared in the minds of the resurrected people.Gradually, Nan Quan was stunned and muttered,""Eh ... That wasn't an illusion? If we're really dead, how could ... This time ... They're resuscitating us?"He rubbed his head."That's not right. Didn't they say that it's to revive the earth overturning sword?"Yes, the result of his experience was ... The earth overturning sword was killed.This time, it was also a recovery.However, what about reviving the earth overturning sword?Beside him, Hong Yitang laughed and glanced at him."Even if you die, I won't die! I'm the master of truth, how could I die?""What?" Nan Quan was stunned again."Isn't Yuan Shuo the master of truth?"He looked at Yuan Shuo, who laughed. Soon, Yuan Shuo shook his head,""I don't know, so I've been tricked!"“……”Everyone looked at him. Why do you think he knows?At this moment, Li Hao's laughter resounded through the world.""Alright, after experiencing and understanding everything, it's just that the people who were resurrected changed a few times during the process. Everything is developing according to the original situation ... This saves me the trouble of explaining!"After saying that, Li Hao looked around.""I've been resurrected. My master and the others have returned. Thank you, common people, for lending me a hand!"In the next second, endless energy emerged from all over the world.Not only that, at this moment, many longswords hung in the sky, and Li Hao's voice resounded in all directions.""This is the sword of the bright moon. One sword, one Dao. All living beings in the world can comprehend the Dao through the sword! Don't be greedy, one Dao is enough, comprehend the power of the martial Dao, and gather the text of the magical power! Both truth path and Phantom path can be cultivated!""Once I succeed in my Dao, the daomerge will be right in front of me!""This is the Dao that I, Li Hao, have comprehended, and all living beings can learn it! The world is celebrating, and you must congratulate me, Silvermoon!"In an instant, all the living beings in the world were shocked!Bright moon sword Dao!Marchioness Silvermoon's Dao!This ... Could be shared?They were not the only ones. The experts near Li Hao were also dumbfounded. This was Li Hao's sword principle, or rather, it was his special way.She ... Was willing to share this publicly?Li Hao smiled amicably. He looked at the crowd and said in a low voice,""Welcome back, everyone! I ... Missed you guys!"In an instant, even the Restless Southern Fist felt a little complicated.He misses us!Bang! Nan Quan's fist landed on his body, causing him to stagger. He hugged Li Hao, bared his teeth, and laughed loudly.On the side, hou Xiaochen laughed in a reserved manner. He coughed a few times and hugged Yu Luosha tightly.Yu Luosha muttered softly,""He's a real man!"“……”Hou Xiaochen was startled. He looked down, and his eyes lit up.On the other side, Yuan Shuo was also smiling brightly. He looked around the world and mumbled,""My disciple, Wushuang!"This was truly unparalleled!No one can deny that my disciple is number one among the heroes of Silvermoon!Demonic sword Li Hao, the number one hero of Silver Moon!At this moment, the billions of people in the world all had the same thought. Li Hao was the best in the world!The great Dao is right in front of your eyes, and you can reach the heavens with a single step!A venerable sovereign ... Not a venerable sovereign, but a strong man who was more powerful than a venerable sovereign, the great Dao was right in front of him. Whether it was an ordinary person or an ordinary person, it was at his fingertips. Since ancient times, how many people could achieve this?At this moment, hundreds of millions of cultivators looked up at the sky and began to comprehend the Dao!The Silver Moon was flourishing, and martial arts was flourishing!

2522 Chapter 420
The sword of the bright moon streaked across the sky, and martial arts flourished.With Silver moon's promotion and the revival of the fallen heroes, the world was at peace and prosperity. The entire Silver Moon instantly reached its peak.At this moment, it could be said that he was at the peak of the Silver Moon people, as well as Li Hao.Unparalleled sweep, killing all strong enemies!No one in the world could defeat him!Laughter and joy filled the air.If he could immerse himself in the Silver Moon, he would at least be able to enjoy a short period of prosperity and not have to worry about anything.But ... Could it be as he wished?……Amidst the laughter.Only a small number of people could feel the boundless pressure and darkness.Li Hao was about to die of old age.Only by walking out of the Silver Moon, overcoming the primal Chaos lightning tribulation, and advancing into venerable sovereign would there be a chance of recovery. Time could resurrect you, but it could not extend your lifespan. Once your lifespan was exhausted, even time could not save you.As for walking out of the Silver Moon ... The short period of peace would be broken once again.Whether it was li daoheng or bone erosion, they were both considered experts.However, it was only a small silver Moon. Beyond the Silver Moon, there were countless worlds in the great thousand universe, chaotic world, and even venerable sovereigns and world Masters.There were many venerable sovereigns and countless powerhouses in neo martial, but they still allowed Silver Moon to wander around. Was he lost, was he really no match, or was he suffering in the battle?No one knew!Although Emperor Cang had only appeared for a short while, if he could find er Mao, he might have already arrived. He would not have disappeared in an instant.……In the central continent.Heavenly Star City.As the people cultivated, energy flowed freely. Between heaven and earth, auras were everywhere. Some people entered the mountains and seas, some crossed the sun and the moon, and the entire nation began to deploy martial arts. The results were already visible.The governor's mansion.The laughter and cheers made people forget about home.One by one, the resurrected Champions were chatting and bragging with their friends about what they had seen after their deaths ... In fact, they were all bragging. After death, there was only dead silence, and there was nothing to talk about.……In the backyard.Snowflakes fell, and another year of winter arrived. Time was moving towards 1732.The snow was falling.This year's winter wasn't as unbearable as last year 's. Last year, Li Hao had just dealt with the nine divisions and the imperial family, and there were internal and external problems. Last year, countless people had fled from the four continents.And this year, the continent was united.Only the Li Dynasty and the divine Kingdom were left outside. However, the Li Dynasty had the king of the Li Dynasty and the celestial pole. The Queen had also gone to the divine Kingdom. With these cultivators around, this winter was not too difficult.On the stone table, a pot of warm wine was exuding a sweet fragrance.A group of people sat in a circle.Li Hao, Yuan Shuo, Hong Yitang, Nan Quan, hou Xiaochen, Liu Long, Yu Luosha, bi liangjian, Lin Hongyu, Hong Xiu, who had just returned from the West, and Hong Qing and Liu Yan, who insisted on standing guard at the periphery.Five families ... Or six if the southern Fist was included.Of these people, Yuan Shuo was the teacher, Liu Long was the boss, hou Xiaochen was the head of the division, and Nan Quan and Hong Yitang were the martial uncles who had helped him many times.They were all Li Hao's subordinates during Silver moon's time, and they were crucial helpers during his rise.Lin Hongyu stood up and poured wine for them.The cup was full.Li Hao raised his cup and smiled."I'll toast you all. This wine will do you good!"All Silver Moon martial masters loved to drink.He lived in the pugilistic world, lived on the edge of a blade, and didn't drink, so he couldn't be considered a Silver Moon Martial Master.Yuan Shuo smiled and raised his glass. The others followed suit and drank the wine.The wine was intoxicating!After Li Hao finished his glass of wine, he picked up another one and drank it all. "Everyone's return has made my heart burn with passion. Endless battles have eroded my soul day and night!"  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ He didn't hide it and sighed."It's like ten thousand arrows piercing through my heart. Day and night, I close my eyes and I'm surrounded by countless heroes. Blood splatters the sky!" My parents died five years ago, and my brother died three years ago. I was lucky to have my teacher's love and boss Liu's protection at the cost of his life!""Entering Whitemoon city, entering heaven battling city, receiving the protection of the Minister, martial uncle Hong's guidance, and martial uncle Nanquan's righteous help ... Thus, I survived the most difficult time. I was not destroyed, not crushed by hatred. In the end, I killed my enemy and took revenge ..."Everyone listened quietly. The talkative Southern Fist didn't say anything.At this moment, everyone also recalled the past.In the past, Li Hao had almost lost his life when he achieved a breakthrough of 10 to 100 States. When the red moon attacked, a three-sun superpower had almost killed everyone.p And now ... There were tens and hundreds of them everywhere.The few women were just helping to pour wine, no one interrupted. They were all silently listening to the most powerful person in the world talk about the past."I can't do this without your support!"Li Hao sighed."After the death of bone-corroding Emperor and the others, what I wanted to do the most was to resurrect all of you. I've finally succeeded. My wish has been fulfilled!"Yuan Shuo also raised his glass and took a sip. He revealed a smile that was as refreshing as the spring breeze. "It's fine as long as the results are good. The process isn't too important, it's something that must be experienced in growth! You were able to unify the Silver Moon so quickly, kill powerful enemies, and stop the invasion of foreign enemies, completing a great cause that no one else has been able to accomplish in a hundred thousand years ... To be more realistic, so what if we can't be resurrected?""I'm already seventy!""If I don't cultivate, it's normal for me to die of old age!" Yuan Shuo laughed. "Among those present, only Liu Long is from the younger generation. The others are not much younger than me. Life is unpredictable. To be able to cultivate and live a long life is a blessing! But if I die like this ... What's the big deal?"

He looked at Li Hao and said, all good things must come to an end! "When I was young, some of my friends, my master, my sect's friends, and my elders all left me, but I didn't give up. I gave up.""Human, in this life, you should constantly improve and make friends from all walks of life. Don't always be immersed in the past!"He criticized Li Hao."You're still too young. When you're a little older and have more experience, you'll realize ... That we're just a Harbor for you on your journey in life, not the end!"Nan Quan wiped the wine off his beard and laughed,""You can't say that. I don't agree with old Yuan's words. I think ... We are still very important. The next time I die, you can resurrect me. There's no rush. Take it slowly. I believe you can do it ... This time, you are too anxious!"Nan Quan laughed heartily."I haven't slept enough, I haven't had enough fun ... And you've already brought us back!"Li Hao also smiled.This time, it was like a family dinner, and everyone spoke freely. Li Hao didn't say much, but said,""Silver Moon is fine right now. The most important thing is to upgrade the world! I still need some time. ""Secondly ... I'm worried about two things after the upgrade. First, the Crimson Moon universe should still be around. Will their great beings find Silver Moon or even attack?""Second, the outside is surrounded by Primal Chaos lightning. Should we go out or not? If he went out, the lightning would definitely fall! "If we don't go out...Then we'll be a quail, hide, and deceive ourselves. We'll bet that the other party won't be able to come in or find us. We've already hidden for a hundred thousand years, so maybe we can continue to hide for another hundred thousand years!"Li Hao continued,"and then there are some internal trifle matters, which are not a big deal!" Now, I'm a little hesitant. If we go out, should I go out, or should I bring a group of people out, or what?""What's going on in the chaosverse? Was it suitable for exploration? If we stay in a corner, will we attract the coveting of strong enemies?""If it was in the past ... It's just a small world. If it has nothing to do with new martial arts, people might not care about you. But now, we're considered a medium-level world. This is one of the reasons. Second, we have the great Dao universe! According to the celestial pole seniors, the universe of the great path actually only exists in the great world. "  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 Yes, not every world had a Dao universe.Silver Moon did not have one in the past. When he cultivated, he only cultivated some DAOs from other worlds, or he simply did not cultivate the Dao and only cultivated his body.Only with a great path universe could one have the opportunity to advance to a great world, have their own path, and walk in their own direction. Such a world had great potential. Great worlds were not everywhere. It was said that some small worlds were very wild and had a very low level of civilization development. Silver Moon was special because the inheritance of neo martial arts was too heavy.After saying that, Li Hao continued, will the appearance of the great Dao universe attract the attention of some civilizations or worlds? Where are we? Silvermoon is in the primordial chaos. Where is he?""As for the chaotic world, what's the situation now ... We're all ignorant!"Everyone was slightly solemn, but Hong Yitang said unhurriedly,""Go out, we must go out! It's impossible for cultivators to keep themselves closed off. Besides, I don't even have a true venerable sovereign now. Even a small world will have one, let alone a medium-level world ...""If we don't communicate with the strong and don't come into contact with the advanced civilizations of the great world, we will always fall behind.""We've still received some of the neo martial's legacy. Otherwise, Silver Moon wouldn't be where it is today ..."He looked at Li Hao."We all know that you're unwilling to stay in Silver Moon forever. However ... Are you confident that you can overcome the chaos lightning tribulation?" We've seen the lightning tribulation before. Even venerable sovereigns were struck to death, and this is only the inside of the Silver Moon. The outside might be even stronger!""That's not all. It's fine to cross the Tribulation inside, but to cross the Tribulation outside ... What if the venerable sovereigns of the red moon come?"He looked at Li Hao and said, so I suggest that we wait! To forge iron, one needed to be hard! Now that Silvermoon is about to advance, Qian Wuliang and I have also been growing stronger recently. This is a good thing for our DAOs. We will soon reach the seventh level of Dao integration and become half-emperors!""Also ... When the human King and the others go to war, they will bring their Army ..."He looked at Li Hao and asked,'why did you bring an Army to battle? To venerable sovereigns, an Army of ten million was nothing more than a clean sweep. However, the human King and the others were so powerful, so why did they still do this? In my opinion, there are many purposes. First, to train the soldiers! The strong are all born from the weak, and it's impossible for them to be born strong. Training soldiers is beneficial for the birth of more strong people. ""Second, plunder! "The strong conquests, the Army sweeps, invades worlds, and sweeps away the achievements of civilization, wealth, technology, talents ...""Third, broaden your horizons! A person who had been trapped in a small village for his entire life only saw the small village as his palm. Only when he went to the city did he know how big the city was. Only when he went to the mainland did he know how big the mainland was. Only when he went beyond the world did he understand how big the world was! One's vision is often the key to a person's future!""It's true that I'm bringing hundreds of millions of soldiers to train and to broaden the horizons of these people ... I'm going to let them know that there's nothing in the world that can't be found! It can also stimulate everyone's desire to improve. "

Chapter 2524 Discussion (3)
Hong Yitang was saying that he hoped to form an Army and walk out of Silver Moon together.And not just Li Hao!Everyone knew what Li Hao was thinking.No one didn't understand!Now that he was saying this, everyone understood that he might want everyone to stay, or to say goodbye to everyone.Perhaps ... Tomorrow, this guy would disappear quietly.Everything was possible!After Yuan Shuo and the others were resurrected, Li Hao felt much more at ease and was even more carefree. He had left Silver Moon alone, perhaps to Scout the way, or perhaps ... To never return. If silver Moon was not in any danger, he would not have returned.At this moment, the silent Liu Long said in a muffled voice,""A good man has three helpers! "No matter how capable you are, I feel that ... You still need some people to help you out and talk to you. As long as you don't drag us down, it'll be fine! Do you know what chaos is like? Do you know what the outside world is like? There was someone beside him discussing. Even if he was not strong enough, the more people there were, the more at ease he felt. It's not easy to leave your home ...""What are you worried about, boss?" Li Hao laughed."You're not coming back!"Liu Long said bluntly."How could that be? this is Silvermoon, my homeland.""Why wouldn't I?"Liu Long looked at him."Ying Hongyue shouldn't have died ... Once she died, you were like a kite with a broken string. I can't lock you down anymore!"Everyone was touched when they heard this.It seemed to be the case.Li Hao laughed."Am I that untrustworthy of your trust?"The others ignored him. Hou Xiaochen thought for a moment before saying, "Let's not talk about whether you're coming back or not. The key is that you know nothing about chaos! For now, we still have enemies in the chaos. Although we haven't gone out yet, you've killed venerable sovereign Shi Gu. For a major world, they won't let you off easily if you kill a venerable sovereign!""Besides, be it your river of time or our Dao of illusion and reality, there are no venerable sovereigns in a medium-sized world ... Any world that wants to invade will target us."He looked at Li Hao."At present, the ones who know the most about chaos should be the two seniors, Heaven's Fate and Zhang an. They've both been out of chaos. If we can find a new martial artist ... It'll actually be best!" New martial is powerful. If you can rely on new martial to protect Silver Moon ... You'll have more freedom. "Of course, we must always be on guard. Although we and neo martial arts come from the same source, we should still be on guard to avoid any mistakes.""You should communicate more with these two."Li Hao nodded."I'll talk to them before we leave. Teacher, do you have any good suggestions?" Yuan Shuo stroked his beard."Suggestion ... No suggestion. Now that your wings have hardened, you can fly! However, I'm thinking, now that you've devoured the Dao of corporeal and corporeal, can you directly advance to venerable sovereign? I think it's best for you to advance to the venerable sovereign level before you go out!"After saying that, he added,"there's still a gap between us and neo martial arts. You're now at the ninth level of Dao integration. Are there any levels above Dao integration?" If there was, how would one cultivate it? You've already opened 360 Dao meridians, and you've opened both the virtual and the real, but you're still only at level nine of the Dao integration realm. How do you cultivate and judge the venerable sovereigns who compete with the neo martial arts?",m 360 Dao meridians, and he had opened both virtual and real at the same time. This was almost the limit.There were more Dao meridians in the human body. However, at Li Hao's level, it was meaningless to open some insignificant Dao meridians because the improvement was limited.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 Venerable sovereigns were bound to undergo a great transformation.At this level, the great Dao had entered the body of the venerable sovereigns of new martial arts. The origin of the stars had become one. This was the true venerable sovereigns of new martial arts. The new martial world was different. It was easy to distinguish them by breaking the space level as the boundary.Now that his Dao of Silvermoon had reached the ninth level of Dao integration, there seemed to be no more paths for him to take.If Li Hao did not advance to venerable sovereign, they would not be at ease letting him leave or go through the Tribulation.However, it would be very difficult to persuade Li Hao.He wanted to leave not just because he wanted to go out and take a look. In fact, anyone who had seen him resurrect everyone knew that Li Hao actually had some regrets. For example, his companions and his parents had not been resurrected.However, Zhang Yuan's death happened three years ago.There was no way to reverse the fate of those who had died three years ago, let alone his parents who had been dead for five years.The power of time was not omnipotent.Moreover, Li Hao didn't have a deep understanding of it.Thus, he might have gone out this time to find a better way to improve himself and gain a better understanding of the way of time. This might be the reason why Li Hao insisted on leaving."Above the daomerge ...."Li Hao thought for a while, then said,""The ninth level of the Dao integration realm. The 360 star Dao meridians are at the ninth level of the Dao integration realm. However, no matter how many levels of the Dao integration realm one is at, they are divided into truth Dao cultivators, Phantom Dao cultivators, and dual-Dao as one! Only when two DAOs combined into one would one be a true expert. If an ordinary seventh level Dao integration cultivator can't defeat a half-Emperor neo martial, then a dual-Dao seventh level Dao integration cultivator can definitely rival a half-Emperor!""I'm talking about the true half-step origin Emperor!""It's just that ..." Li Hao looked at everyone and said,"to be honest, I have some ideas for the Dao integration, but they aren't perfect enough.""You can tell us about it ..." Yuan Shuo said,"even though our current knowledge is far inferior to yours, we might still be able to gain some insights from listening to it. We might be able to give you some hints, though it might not be useful."

2525 Chapter 420
Now, he had also reached the Dao integration realm, but he was even further away from Li Hao.He didn't say that Li Hao couldn't make it anymore.Li Hao had surpassed him in knowledge, experience, and combat power.Li Hao pondered for a moment before saying,"my idea is that after the ninth level of the Dao integration stage, the Dao stars will enter the body and separate and merge. Although our 360 stars form a cycle, they haven't completely fused with our bodies ... So, I'm thinking that if we fuse them completely, will it be equivalent to absorbing the Dao into our bodies? does it mean that we'll be like the origins Supreme Emperor? will we become the Dao and the Dao be me, thus reaching the level of a Supreme Emperor?"Everyone frowned slightly."Isn't your river of time considered to have fused?"Li Hao nodded, then shook his head."It's not the same ... The river of time is just a simple and general Fusion. It's not a complete fusion!" I'm shi Guang, I'm shi Guang!""But I haven't found such an opportunity yet ..." Li Hao said with a frown."Of course, this is only me!"He looked at Hong Yitang and said,"senior uncle Hong, you don't need to worry about this. You just need to focus on merging the ten thousand DAOs. If you merge the ten thousand DAOs, you will be strong. Sooner or later, you will be able to advance to venerable sovereign. We can do this step by step. There's no rush!""Other than the two Dao Masters, it's very difficult for the others to become venerable sovereigns ..."Li Hao didn't have a clear idea of his path yet.As for the others, he had some thoughts."For example, martial uncle Nan Quan will also gather 360 stars in the end when he practices The Way of the Fist. It's best to complete the fusion of the 360 stars of the real and the virtual. Finally, he will gather the stars of the fist and open a branch above the great Dao and a River above the long river! With the long river of the great Dao as the foundation, it would split into another river, gather the will of the world's fist Dao, and achieve the position of venerable sovereign! However, there's a downside to this. Unless your Dao origin is different, it's difficult for the next fist cultivator to become a second venerable sovereign!"Li Hao was very clear about their path.He continued."At this level, according to the new martial arts, it's fine to call him venerable sovereign. In my opinion, it's not a problem to call him Daoist master!""It's nothing more than the Dao you grasp, whether it's strong or not, the degree of your grasp, and whether the tributary you open is strong or not ... These are the key to determining the strength of a Dao master or venerable sovereign!""As for martial uncle Hong, you can call him the master of the great Dao, or the master of all Dao!"Li Hao, on the other hand, had a lot of ideas about the conventional path.​ Unfortunately, he wasn't taking the conventional path.As Yuan Shuo and the others listened, they were all deep in thought. As expected, this fellow's comprehension of the great Dao was very deep now."Is there any other way other than opening a tributary to become the master of a Dao?" Yuan Shuo asked. Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"I can absorb Dao into my body and create my own world, such as me ... However, this will be very troublesome in the future. It doesn't necessarily mean that I have greater potential. I can only say that I'm slightly free from the restraints. At least, senior uncle Hong can't restrain me!""Then now ... Do you have any thoughts on your Dao of time?"Li Hao had a slight headache."I've opened my own little world. It's very difficult for me to improve now." "Of course, it's not that there's no way. The most basic way is for me to continue opening my Dao meridians. I'll open all my Dao meridians and fuse them into the river. I'll strengthen the river with time as my main force! If I can fully open it and fully comprehend it, I can also be considered a venerable sovereign!"  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 "But ... In this case, even if I really open all the great Dao, I may not be able to reach the level of the neo martial King, because the core of my essence is the power of time. The key is how to strengthen my time Dao!"Li Hao sighed, this is the real problem! In every era, there was not much contact with time. Other people did not even have such power. Strengthening time was the most difficult thing! Therefore, even if I gather 10000 DAOs and become a top-tier venerable sovereign ... There's a high chance that I won't be able to reach the level of a human King. "“……”Everyone was speechless. So, it's not that you can't become a venerable sovereign, but you feel that you can't reach that level.It could not strengthen time!She was really ... Speechless.Lin Hongyu, who had been silent all this while, could not help but say,""Time .... Your past and future self might have some flaws, but if you do things the same way you did before, summoning and fusing ... Is that also a Dao of time?"Li Hao nodded."Of course it counts. But there's a huge drawback!" You said infinite summoning ... Actually, the stronger you are, the harder it is. The key is that you are extremely powerful, so the one you summon may not be stronger than you!"Li Hao knew that this wasn't the root of the problem. It was a shortcut as long as he didn't run into danger again and again.However, this was not a long-term plan.The key was how to strengthen the foundation of time.At this moment, no one could answer his doubts.Even Yuan Shuo, despite Li Hao looking at him expectantly, hesitated for a long time. In fact, Yuan Shuo didn't want to disappoint his disciple, so he finally said,""I can't do anything about it. I don't know much about this, but I know that even if we don't know, the top powerhouses outside might know a little ... If you really go out, you can interact with some top existences!"It was way too high-end and complicated. Who could really tell what was going on with Shi Guang?Li Hao could only nod his head and say nothing more. It was a habit to look forward to his teacher. However, his teacher had just reached the Dao integration stage and did not know much about Shi Guang. Naturally, he could not give her any good advice.

However, Yuan Shuo still had an idea.""It's too dangerous for you to come into contact with a top existence. I have an idea. The past is the only one. If you encounter some top-tier powerhouses ... Without provoking them, you can try to go back to their past and observe them or come into contact with their past. It might be beneficial to you. "Go back to someone's past?Li Hao's heart moved, but he frowned slightly.""It's very difficult for me to look back on other people's pasts. I only look back on my own ...""I think it's possible!""You ... I told you, I had a dream!" Yuan Shuo said seriously. I don't remember if there was one in the past, but after I recovered, I remember having such a dream. This means ... The one you met is actually the real me!"Li Hao's heart moved.In other words, the power of time could also be used on others to go back to their past.But ... It's not easy, right?Or could it be that the people in his memory could be traced back to the past?Many thoughts appeared in his mind."He has some new ideas. If that's the case ... Does it mean that the more powerful people I come into contact with, the more hope I have to obtain some important enlightenment and use them to help me cultivate?He did not say anything else.He continued to drink and chat with the others, but Li Hao knew that he had to make preparations to open the Stargate and leave Silver Moon as soon as possible.Otherwise, he might be able to become a venerable sovereign before Silver Moon could advance ... He was afraid that he would die of old age before he could enter.A medium-level world was enough for venerable sovereigns to be born.,m More importantly, he did not have much time left.……  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 At this moment, the entire Silver Moon began to expand as they chatted.It was very fast!The world barrier of the entire Silvermoon world had expanded by a huge circle. The territory of the entire world had expanded by at least three times. Previously, when ten billion people gathered in the central continent, it was still a little crowded.However, at this moment, the central mainland had expanded a lot. Even the ten billion humans did not feel crowded.The grey Mountain range was not huge at first, but at this moment, it was extremely huge. It was even much larger than the grey Mountain range of neo martial, because the grey Mountain range was not a big mountain range in neo martial. Li Hao and the others were chatting.The temple.There were also a few people who were talking about some things.Zhang an looked at the celestial pole and sighed with emotion.""Senior Empyrean pole, Silvermoon has almost no internal worries, but there are still external threats! There's no trace of neo martial, so Silver Moon might really be within the Crimson Moon world. Previously, there were several chaotic Thunderbolts and venerable sovereigns who died. Li Hao even came into contact with Emperor Cang's apparition ... With such a big commotion, both neo martial and Crimson Moon should know that the Silver Moon world still exists. Moreover ... Now that the world has advanced, even if silver Moon was hidden before, he's no longer hidden now!"Celestial pole kept looking up at the sky as if he didn't hear anything."Senior, you're a neo martial Supreme Emperor after all ..." Zhang an could not help but say."I'm just a clone!"Tian Ji was speechless,'what do you want me to do? I'm just a clone with the power of a half-step Emperor, and this is a half-step Emperor without origin ... In fact, I'm only comparable to the peak Heavenly Kings outside. If I really encounter a Crimson Moon expert, do you think I can kill them?""I didn't mean it that way!"Zhang an said,'it's difficult to cross the chaos. Once the Stargate is opened ... When Li Hao goes out, he'll definitely be met with lightning!' My idea is that in this world, only senior and I have left the world and walked through the chaos ... I want to leave the Stargate with senior, go to the chaos, and find new martial artists!""As long as we can sense the origin, we can follow the direction of the origin. If we can tear the universe of origin and step into it ... Emperor Cang will definitely be able to sense us!""If that's the case, it's fine if I bring Silver Moon back, or if silver Moon becomes a subsidiary world or an independent world ... Silver Moon and new martial are of the same origin, after all, so they won't go as far as to destroy Silver Moon!"“……”Celestial pole's head ached,'you want me to go with you to the chaos realm? Don't be like this...Chaos is too complicated. To put it bluntly, it's fine if your grandfather leaves, but it'll be hard for me to even come here. This is just a clone, and with a weakling like you, it'll be hard for me to survive!""If we stray a little, we might end up in the red moon's lair!"He did not want to leave at all.As for not leaving, they could only wait. Emperor Cang knew that they were here ... Er Mao was here, so perhaps Emperor Cang would come soon.Zhang an also knew his character and was a little helpless.""Senior ... Don't you know Emperor Cang's personality? Forget about her forgetfulness, if she suddenly fell into a deep sleep ... Perhaps the Crimson Moon would come! "Also, if it was easy to find Silver Moon, he would have done so long ago. Human King is also an impatient person. Although Silver Moon is not important, there are still many new martial artists here. If human King could find him, he would have done so long ago ...""It's too dangerous!"Celestial pole still shook his head."It's not that I'm looking down on you. You've entered the chaos. If there's any slight movement, you'll be dead!" Also, if we're unlucky and encounter some wandering experts in the chaos, be it the chaos demonic beasts or the chaos World ... We'll all be dead. Do you think we can survive in the chaos without the power of a venerable sovereign?"Celestial pole saw that he was silent and said,""If it really doesn't work, let Li Hao go out by himself!"

Zhang an frowned slightly,"can he survive the disaster?" "Even if he can ... He's not familiar with neo martial and might not go to neo martial. With his character, he might go to whoever he finds. If he doesn't fight with them, he won't provoke them. It's hard for him to go to neo martial."This was true."Senior is only a clone ..."Zhang an continued,'even if the clone really dies ... It's dead! Now that second cat has been absorbed into the river by Li Hao, senior's mission has been completed. Senior, are you still unwilling to part with a clone?"Heaven's Fate waved his hand."It's not that I can't bear to part with my avatar. My avatar is considered a coordinate. My main body is still in new martial arts. There's only hope of finding it if my avatar is still there. If my avatar leaves, then the hope is really not great!""Silver Moon must have left new martial arts, and he might be very far away. You're not a clone, so it'll be very difficult to count on your grandfather to find you ... There's only hope if my clone is here!"Zhang an pondered for a moment and felt that it made sense.However, the celestial pole wasn't willing to go through the chaos realm, so he ... Had almost no chance.Although he had been out of the world before, there had always been powerhouses leading the teams back then. He was not the leader.At this moment, Tian Ji said,"actually, I don't think walking out of the Silver Moon is the most important thing." The key was that the Silvermoon world was about to upgrade. The upgrade of a world was not a small matter. The great worlds might not notice it, but some experts who wandered the chaos might notice it! Even if the Crimson Moon world didn't discover it, I'm worried that there might be some chaotic experts wandering around nearby. That would be troublesome. An advanced world has a great Dao universe, and the strongest person isn't a venerable sovereign. Everyone wants to take a bite of such a big fat piece of meat. ""As for Li Hao, has he made such preparations? Under normal circumstances, when the number of powerhouses reaches a certain point and is on the verge of advancing, the world will advance along with the powerhouses. This is the only way to prevent the world from being devoured!"However, Silver moon's advancement was actually a little too fast.Not only that, but there was not a single venerable sovereign on Silvermoon's side, and there was even a gap between them. Under such circumstances, those who could travel through the chaos were usually venerable sovereigns. Even the weaker venerable sovereigns found it difficult to move around. Of course, if you didn't mind getting lost, you wouldn't have anything to worry about ... A Heavenly King could also leave the world, but the premise was that he could survive."Will it attract the attention of those things?" Zhang an's expression changed slightly."There's a high chance!""Then I have to remind Li Hao!"Zhang an was a little solemn, but Heaven's Fate didn't care.""The Stargate is here. It was created by several Emperor-level powerhouses. If Li Hao doesn't open it and go out ... Although it's dangerous, the danger is limited. Of course, the guys outside will definitely want to come in!"He wasn't that worried. He was only worried that the commotion here would attract more experts.This was the most troublesome part.Zhang an also had a headache. After a long time, he said,""I'd better discuss this with Li Hao. Also, senior, you should consider going out with me to explore the path first ..."  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 Seeing that the celestial pole was unmoved, he felt even more helpless.This person was just a clone, yet he was actually so ... Cowardly!What did it matter if his clone died?It was really incomprehensible and helpless.[Author's note: Silver moon's plot is almost over. It's so troublesome to start a new plot. I don't know how to write it. I have some ideas, but it's hard to write them. Changing the map is the easiest way to completely collapse. I have to think about it. Today's the first update. I'll sort out my ideas. I might not be able to update tomorrow. Of course, if everything goes well, I'll update as usual and take a rest tonight.]

Chapter 2528 Chaos And The Past_ 1
The chaosverse was a place where distance and time were impossible to measure. It was a place without heaven or earth.Countless worlds were like seeds embedded in the chaos, developing freely.The distance between them was infinitely far.In the dark chaos, there was a world that looked like a Red Moon, shining with red light. It was the famous Red Moon world in the chaos. The red moon world was the world with the strongest desire to attack among the other worlds.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 The Crimson Moon world was so huge that no one could see it. It was a famous and powerful world in the chaos. However, the atmosphere in the Crimson Moon world was a little tense.Fifty years ago, fifty years ago in the Crimson Moon world, the master of the Crimson Moon had attacked a well-known world in the chaos, the yin-yang world, which was also known as the neo martial world.In the end, the red moon Army had yet to reach the yin-yang world.The neo martial's Army of hundreds of millions took the initiative to advance and annihilate the Crimson Moon world. They were both top-tier macro worlds, but between them, there were countless macro worlds that had wisdom. They either escaped or retreated.The battle between the two sides was about to start ...As a result, the neo martial Army disappeared for several years in an instant and lost themselves in the chaos. When they heard the news of neo martial again, it really shocked the universe ... For some unknown reason, neo martial suddenly killed his way to the back of the Crimson Moon world and encountered another extremely famous and equally notorious Elysian world in the chaos World.Before the battle between neo martial and Crimson Moon broke out on a large scale, a fierce war broke out with the Elysian world. Both sides sent more than 100 venerable sovereigns, and the neo martial human King personally led the attack on the Elysian world. More than ten emperors were killed, and the seed world of the Elysian world was forcibly torn apart, almost killing the Lord of Elysian.Fortunately, the news of the battle of Nirvana spread quickly, and the Crimson Moon world quickly sent strong people to help ... The result was also a heavy loss. Fortunately, they temporarily repelled the attack of the neo martial artists.Not only that ... The neo martial human King was extremely arrogant, clamoring to kill one or even a hundred ... The yin-yang world wanted to quash the chaos with one battle. A group of neo martial Supreme emperors who followed the neo martial human King ran around like headless flies and often suddenly appeared in a certain place ... It was simply inexplicable. It was originally a war between two worlds, but more than a dozen great worlds were involved in the chaos for 50 years.As for new martial's spokesperson, the Supreme Being of the Zhang family, he spoke to the public ... Hoping that all parties would not provoke the human King. The human King had only taken the wrong path and did not have the intention to disturb the chaos, nor did he have the heart to destroy the peace of the chaos.World Lords, if you encounter the human King and suddenly appear ... Please tell the human King the exact location of the Crimson Moon world. If it's convenient, please accompany the human King and escort him on the way, so that the human King doesn't get lost.Who would believe this nonsense?None of the world Lords believed it, and they didn't dare to believe it. As for the human Kings, they would still appear in the various major worlds from time to time, leading to more and more Wars and implications.On the side of new martial, he explained again and again that he was just passing by. Chaos had no time, no heaven and earth, and no direction. The human King had indeed gone the wrong way and had never intended to invade the various worlds. The result was ... Still no one believed him!The new martial human King was so powerful that even the Lord of a major world could not match him. He was also famous and notorious for launching surprise attacks on a world at will. Who would dare to let him get close?Overbearing, arrogant, and Savage were the words of the neo martial human King.This was originally a war between two worlds. The two opposing sides had only clashed slightly. Not many venerable sovereigns had died. However, with the frequent loss of human Kings, after 50 years of chaos, there was one less surrounding great world, and as many as seven or eight medium and small worlds had disappeared.This place had become a forbidden area in the primordial chaos.In the chaos, one could encounter a neo martial King at any time ...The reason for the tension in the Crimson Moon world was that a few years ago, it was said that a Primal Chaos Ranger saw the neo martial human King near the Crimson Moon. The latter was alone ... It was said that he might have lost his way again. When he caught someone, he asked for directions, which almost scared the nearby Primal Chaos Rangers to death. They fled in all directions in a panic.After that, the neo martial human King disappeared again.The red moon had searched for several years but found nothing, which led to the red moon master suspecting whether this new martial artist King had infiltrated the red moon world. After several searches, they found nothing. However, this made the red moon even more vigilant.Since the Crimson Moon world dared to attack the yin-yang world, it was no weakling either. There were countless Masters.However, the neo martial human King ... Did not follow the routine. He went alone and appeared at a certain place every now and then ... He caused trouble and even provoked some top-level chaos Rangers.Currently, it was said that there were more than a dozen top existences, lone travelers like the sun god, who were either chasing after this person or looking for an opportunity to take revenge.The result was that if the neo martial human King stayed in one place for a long time, a world-shaking battle would soon break out. These people did not suffer any losses, but because of their world-shaking battle, several worlds had suffered heavy losses over the years.Or they might even be destroyed!This also led to more and more people pursuing the human ruler, and the scope of the war grew larger and larger. However, once a war broke out ... It was often the surrounding worlds that suffered. Countless small worlds were either destroyed or disappeared into the vast universe.At this moment.The Crimson Moon world.In the palace that was as tall as a divine court, existences with auras that penetrated the heavens and the earth stood in the void and said in a loud voice,""My King, is that new martial artist King in my Red Moon realm? And now, the war between the two sides has yet to officially break out ... It has already caused the death of several world Lords ... In the four directions of the chaos, the world Lords of various major worlds have already questioned whether the battle between the Crimson Moon and the yin-yang was a conspiracy. "

Chapter 2529 Chaos, The Past (3)
 Is this a conspiracy?"If it wasn't a conspiracy ... Why would the top existences of both sides not have much contact and not suffer much losses? why would the battle between both sides be fruitless, causing the destruction of many worlds and the death of many world Lords in this vast universe?The red moon was still devouring some small worlds, while new martial was not losing out. When the war broke out, the third party suffered the greatest losses.Who would believe that it was unintentional?Another peerless existence said with a thunderous voice,""Now, there's news from a chaos Ranger that some great worlds have prepared an Alliance to resist Crimson Moon and Yin Yang together. They've formed an alliance to resist Crimson Moon and new martial. The Alliance will be called the double extermination Alliance! We are both their targets ..."She was speechless and had no way to reason with him.The Crimson Moon world's goal was indeed the neo martial artists ... As a result, they advanced towards the neo martial artists, and the neo martial artists took the initiative to attack them. A war was about to break out, but ... The neo martial artist King went crazy and went to fight others. Not only did he defeat one, but he also defeated the second, third, fourth ...Now, neo martial was notorious in the chaos, even worse than Red Moon ... On the contrary, Red Moon was implicated and became the target of criticism from all parties. Everyone said that the two of them were in cahoots and were doing things in the dark!In reality...This was very aggrieving."But even if you tell others, no one will believe you. Why did you involve chaos in your battle?Both worlds were heading towards their own direction. Why did the result be that neo martial suddenly deviated from the route, lost in the chaos, and suddenly appeared everywhere? the Supreme neo martial kept saying that it was a misunderstanding ... Only an idiot would believe it.How could a world Lord easily get lost in the chaos?At the end of the hall, a figure as bright as the sun said in an ethereal voice,""As you wish! The neo martial human King was courting death. What could he do? There are countless people chasing after him, so the most important thing is to kill him in the outer realm. We can't let a war break out in the inner realm!"Otherwise ... The enemy was extremely powerful. Although the pursuers behind him were also extremely powerful, they were convinced that the enemy was colluding with the Crimson Moon to invade the surrounding macro worlds. If things went wrong, those people might get angry and destroy the Crimson Moon world.Red Moon master did not care about two of them.If he couldn't deal with a few top-notch existences, he wouldn't take the initiative to attack neo martial ... The key was that neo martial human King had provoked at least a dozen top-notch existences, so he had to cause trouble for no reason.In the chaos, he was so overbearing that he seemed to be the most powerful person in the world. Even red Moon master sometimes doubted himself ... Did he really want to join forces with him to kill all the powerful people and seize the chaos together?Otherwise ... Where did this madman get the confidence to fight against many neo martial artists alone? Red Moon master didn't say much about this and said,""Yesterday, I felt that Shi Gu had fallen ... Shi Gu had attacked Silver Moon, a subsidiary world of new martial arts, and sent out several venerable sovereigns. All of them had fallen, and only Shi Gu had entered Silver Moon and disappeared with Silver Moon!""Now, Shi Gu has fallen, roughly North of the Crimson Moon ... The Silver Moon came from the new martial world and is now in the yin-yang world. It accompanied the new martial world's Emperor Cang as he wandered in the chaos without a trace. If we find the Silver Moon world again, we might be able to lock onto the yin-yang world and draw the new martial human King back to the yin and yang world. This would also prevent him from wandering in the chaos all day long and being unable to find ..."Red Moon Master's Voice was loud, and there was a hint of helplessness.Back then, due to the intense battle, Silver Moon was sent flying by venerable sword and disappeared into the chaos. Red Moon wanted to look for him again, but before he could find him, the neo martial human King came ... He began to prepare for the battle.In the end, he waited and waited ... After a long time, he went to play Elysian world.When the Elysian world was almost over, he thought,"it's time for a final battle ..." In the end, he disappeared again and went to fight another world.He had been waiting in his lair for a long time!Each time, they would think that a war was about to break out, and they would mobilize the experts of the Crimson Moon sect to prepare for war and wipe them out ... But until now, they still hadn't seen a single person.The more he thought about it, the more speechless he was.Was the neo martial human King really crazy, or ... Was it just as the neo martial Supreme Master said, he was really lost ... But who would believe this?He didn't really believe it anyway, but neo martial arts had provoked so many strong enemies for no reason. Now, the macro worlds from all directions were about to go crazy. They were going to join forces to kill him ... By the way, the red moon was also included in this. The Lord of the red moon felt that he was at a loss.In the Crimson Moon world, there were strong desires that invaded everywhere. However, there were reasons, reasons, and excuses.For example, they could take the initiative to tempt the other party to attack, or if a traitor appeared in the other world, they would take the initiative to accept, provoke ... There were many other factors. They would definitely not invade without a word.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 Preparing for the invasion of new martial arts was also an excuse for the sun god's invasion of the Crimson Moon.After all, the chaos was vast and there were countless worlds.Without a reason, the other major worlds would not just watch, and the neo martial King ... From the beginning to the end, he used one reason ... I'm looking for the way!Below, a peerless expert continued,"our King's intention is to search for Silvermoon's old place again?" "It's just that we've lost contact with Silver Moon for many years, and neo martial hasn't tried to find him. Perhaps he's already cut off his connection with yin and yang. Now that neo martial human King is nearby, is it necessary to find Silver Moon?"
