er admit defeat!"
 He roared, he only wanted to win once!
 Yuan Shuo, why didn't you admit defeat?
 Even though he knew that this was an extravagant hope, he still wanted to hear Yuan Shuo admit defeat.
 BOOM!
 Yuan Shuo smashed into the cliff, creating a huge hole. Sun Yifei swept out his staff, turning countless rocks into dust. The two of them were sent flying into the cliff.
 In an instant, it shot up from the cliff. BOOM! BOOM! The cliff below directly collapsed.
 The battle continued!
 The heart fire ape and the fierce tiger grew even more resplendent, and so did the staff.
 The two of them had exhausted all their resources, and their battle became more and more brutal.
  "Yuan Shuo!"
 Right at this moment, sun Yifei was panting heavily as he roared,"You can't break my eyebrow-raising stick? I know you can do it! Come, cut off my eyebrow-raising stick! Otherwise ... I'll beat you to death!"
 BOOM!
 The rod smashed down again!
 "Pfft!"
 Yuan Shuo vomited blood. He was a little weak and sad,""I wanted to save some energy ... To go to the ruins with the others ... You want me to fight to the death ... Damn it!"
 "Bastard!"
 Sun Yifei was extremely mad and furious!
 He was just saying that, but he didn't expect Yuan Shuo to really have a trump card. He struck out with his staff, and it was filled with anger, unwillingness, and madness.""Come! Even if I die in battle, I want to die at the peak! You don't want me to gradually decline and be beaten to death by you like a street thug!"
 Yes, he had started to slide.
 Yuan Shuo was the same.
 The two of them were unable to maintain it any longer. Their peak was no longer there.
 Sun Yifei could accept dying at the peak, but he didn't want to end up like that. He didn't want to jump off a cliff to commit suicide when he was in a state of decline.
 Yuan Shuo spat out another mouthful of blood.
 He looked at sun Yifei and smiled.
 Did he still have a trump card?
 There was!
 Blood Blade technique!
 However, he was actually waiting for the other party to slide down. He still had a chance to kill the other party while he was sliding down because he was a Martial Master, and martial masters were strong in their bodies!
 As for superpowers, they were strong in power!
 When too much of the mysterious energy dissipated, sun Yifei couldn't maintain his current strength. Yuan Shuo had a high chance of winning. He had a 70 - 30 chance, and sun Yifei had a 30 - 70 chance!
 However, when he heard sun Yifei's roar, he laughed.
 "Sun Yifei...You...Are really persistent!"
 You're so persistent that I'm a little impulsive...To give you the highest courtesy.
 Even though the consequences would be very serious.
 However, Yuan Shuo just had this kind of impulse.
 He looked down and saw Li Hao. He smiled apologetically ... I wonder if I'll be able to absorb the last bit of energy from the sword if I'm still alive ...
 "Regardless of whether it's enough or not, as long as I'm alive, the sword energy will probably be completely exhausted.
 At this moment, Yuan Shuo smiled.
 Who cares!
 "Now that my disciple has lost his sword energy, I'll have to find a way to do it myself ... I just want to ... Go crazy for once. I want to go crazy with this madman!"
 He's too cute, even though he's so cute that I want to kill him and send him off.
 At this moment, he could absorb the energy from the stone saber in his hand and merge it into his body.  He rarely absorbed saber energy like this.
 However, at this point, how could I not let sun Yifei see my strongest state?
 The saber energy was absorbed, the heart fire ape disappeared, and the Tiger disappeared.
 All Five Forces disappeared!
 In an instant, the momentum fused with the stone saber, the saber energy fused with it, and the inner strength fused with it ...
 On the other side, sun Yifei didn't stop him. He was madly improving himself and releasing his fire energy. The long staff in his hand instantly turned red, and he laughed happily.
 I'm very happy!
 Yuan Shuo, you old devil, you really have a hidden hand.
 Do you think I can't handle it?
 No, I can do it!
 You're underestimating me, sun Yifei!
 ……
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The clouds moved in all directions.
 At this moment, everyone below revealed a look of disbelief.
 His aura was still rising.
 "This ... Is this really the three yang?"
 Hao lianchuan could not believe it. The other three suns could not believe it either. At that moment, they thought they were watching a battle that surpassed the three suns.
 At this moment, the two of them could still improve.
 He couldn't see through it, nor could he understand it.
 Did martial masters really have unlimited potential?
 But Li Hao knew the reason for this.
 His teacher used the art of the bloody blade again. It wasn't enough to forcefully accumulate a second soul, so he used the art of the bloody blade ... Was his teacher crazy?
 The sword energy was not enough!
 Unless ...
 He thought of something. At this moment, he quieted down and looked up at the sky.
 ……
 In the sky.
 Sun Yifei was excited, and his body trembled. He wasn't afraid, but he was looking forward to it.
 Yuan Shuo, can you be any stronger?
 "Sun Yifei ... I'll send you off!"
 At this moment, Yuan Shuo was ready. The stone blade in his hand enlarged and turned into a blood-red blade. With a solemn tone, he said,""Have a good journey to the netherworld!"
 "Here, for you!"
  Sun Yifei laughed and struck out with his staff!
 This rod strike was beyond the past, beyond everything. It seemed to break the void. It seemed very slow, but it brought an extremely powerful sense of oppression. The people on the ground even felt that they were about to suffocate.
 "Slash!"
 "Die!" Yuan Shuo roared and slashed out with his saber. The blood-red saber slashed out a blood shadow that was hundreds of meters long!
 A saber slashed out!
 This attack had also exceeded Yuan Shuo's limits.
 The long blade and the long staff collided in the air without making any sound. There was only a flash of light.
 The long stick suddenly broke in an instant.
 It wasn't cut in half at the waist, but directly cut into two.
 With one strike, this eyebrow-raising stick that contained everything sun Yifei had was cut in half, and the sharp blade energy continued to strike down!

 A smile appeared on sun Yifei's face as he looked at the blade.
 It was at this moment that he suddenly went crazy. As if he had teleported, he disappeared the moment the long blade fell and a bloody wound appeared on his head.
 In the blink of an eye, he had appeared beside Yuan Shuo.
 At this moment, Yuan Shuo was also feeling a little helpless.
 However, sun Yifei appeared in front of him with an unbelievable method.
 Sun Yifei laughed, and the blood mark on his head was getting bigger and bigger.
 He reached out and punched Yuan Shuo's throat.
 It was a very weak punch!
 Yuan Shuo did not even feel any pain.
 Yuan Shuo and sun Yifei looked at each other, and after a while, they spat out a few words with difficulty,""I ... Won ... You jump down ..."
  Jump down!
 Back then, I lost. I jumped down!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com I won't kill you. I'll give you a chance. Jump down!
 His body began to split apart. He looked at Yuan Shuo with a pleading look in his eyes. Jump down!
 I've won!
 Even though I'm dead, I'm already dead, but I really won against you.
 He wanted to see old demon Yuan be defeated by him and forced to jump off the cliff!
 Yuan Shuo looked at him and suddenly laughed. The power in his body dissipated and he fell down instantly.
 At this moment, sun Yifei looked down and saw Yuan Shuo jumping down ...
 "I won!"
 He smiled, and his body cracked as pieces of flesh fell off. He had won ... Even though that punch might not have been able to kill Yuan Shuo, he was confident that he could shatter Yuan Shuo's throat in his current state.
 Even if Yuan Shuo didn't die, his injuries would be more severe.
 But ... Why?
 He saw Yuan Shuo fall heavily to the ground. He saw it.
 He saw the second god, the path of the Martial Master, the elegant demeanor of the warrior of thousands, the most powerful strike of Yuan Shuo, and the embarrassing state of Yuan Shuo ...
 It was worth it!
 Even if he lost his life here, it would be worth it.
 After returning to Silver Moon and defeating his inner demons of more than twenty years, he suddenly felt relieved.
 Mo Xian, you and I, master and disciple, have witnessed the rise of martial arts!
 At this moment, sun Yifei let out his last laugh,"Eyebrow raising staff, victory!"
 BOOM!
 The void exploded, and a ball of flame shot into the void.
 The eyebrows-reaching rod King had defeated the five birds beast King!
 His body and bones were crushed!
 ……
 At this moment, it was deathly silent.
 Below, Yuan Shuo crashed heavily onto the ground. He had lost count of how many bones he had broken, but he was still looking up at the sky. He looked at the fellow who had been crushed into pieces and smiled.
 Old friends ... One less.
 You win!
 He won with the eyebrow-raising staff!
 Yuan Shuo laughed, a bright smile.
 The next moment, he disappeared.
 He disappeared.
 No one could see where he went. At this moment, a cry of alarm rang out. In an instant, a saber appeared on a cliff.
 The saber was drawn!  Fast, extremely fast, extremely brutal, and extremely ruthless!
 This blade even surpassed the previous ones.
 "Bastard!"
 A roar mixed with fear resounded through the world. Crimson Moon!
 On the red moon's side, Hao Kong's expression changed drastically. Countless mysterious beings exploded as if they did not care about their lives, but it was too late.
 Puchi!
 The head fell to the ground!
 It was too fast, so fast that he, the third Sun, could not escape.
 In an instant, his head was chopped off!
 In the distance, Li Hao had a calm expression. He had guessed it.
 When his teacher had used the art of the bloody blade, he had felt that his sword was not enough.
 His teacher could kill!
 The person who killed Hong Yue!
 What could he do without a sword?
 The red shadow's energy replenishment was quite effective.
 Hong Yue's people were not leaving. Their teacher still had a chance to fight. If they disappeared before their teacher's Blood Blade art completely dissipated ... They would be sending themselves to their deaths!
 "Yuan Shuo!"
 In the distance, the powerhouses shouted from all directions!
 In an instant, the people from Fei Tian, Yama and swords gate, these supers were not running for their lives but gathered together.
 They were terrified!
 Worry!
 Yuan Shuo had lost his mind. He had actually killed haokong in a single strike at this time. Did he not want to continue staying in Silver Moon?
 He already had a deep grudge against Hong Yue. Now, he had killed haokong without any restraint in this situation ... Hong Yue would definitely take revenge. Definitely!
 But did Yuan Shuo care?
 He didn't care!
 He killed Hao Kong in one strike, and his long blade sliced through the void. Heads fell one after another, and the superpowers were all killed by him in an instant. Yuan Shuo smiled,"Sun Yifei, I'll let him win ... What are you guys?"
 He looked down at the world and laughed,""You guys ... Who Do You Think You Are?"
 What are you?
 Do you think you're worthy of watching my battle?
 So what if he killed Hong Yue's people?
 The blood Blade technique had consumed too much energy. If he didn't kill some, how could he replenish it?
 With a wild laugh, the blood saber emitted a dazzling light. For a moment, the others didn't see anything, but Li Hao's eyes moved. The stone saber actually absorbed countless Red Shadows in an instant.
 Clearly, his teacher had learned how to use the stone blade through hou Xiaochen, and had sucked the red shadow away. Li Hao saw a huge red shadow, which belonged to haokong.
 After killing all of Hong Yue's men, Yuan Shuo laughed and soared into the sky, disappearing from everyone's sight.
  Li Hao heard Yuan Shuo's voice.""I can't hold on any longer. I'm going to run ... Hou Xiaochen ... Will be responsible for the rest of the danger!"
 As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared.
 Li Hao's body stiffened ... He left?
 "Right, make a monument for sun Yifei...Don't forget this ..."
 Yuan Shuo's final words were heard before they quickly disappeared.
 In the surroundings, everyone was trembling in fear. It was only when Yuan Shuo had not appeared that the faint sound of breathing could be heard. Everyone's faces were mixed with complicated emotions and fear.
 The battle today was unimaginable!
 The fall of the eyebrow-raising rod, the death of the five beast Kings, and the destruction of the island of light. All these things would spread quickly and shock the world.
 It would even shake the central continent!
 There was still the accumulation of spirit above the thousand warrior tier!

 The battle was over.
 He thought that Yuan Shuo would be crushed, but the five birds clan was extremely powerful. Li Hao killed sun moxiian, and Yuan Shuo broke through the warrior tide and killed sun Yifei.
 The souls of the experts from the central continent had returned to their homeland.
 The fallen leaves had to return to their roots.
 Sun Yifei's battle was destined to leave a deep mark on Silver Moon martial forest.
 However, the aftermath of this battle had only just begun.
 The scene fell silent for a moment.
 The next moment, someone jumped up and flew straight into the sky.
 That was the place where sun Yifei died. After sun Yifei died, he didn't leave anything behind, only some powerful mysterious energy that hadn't completely dispersed. However, there ... A broken long staff appeared faintly.
 The eyebrows-abrest rod!
  It wasn't the one from before, but the one that was condensed using the mysterious source.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It was unimaginable!
 He had used his strong spiritual will to leave behind a broken eyebrow-raising staff at the last moment.
 A treasure!
 Everyone knew that this was a treasure. A late-stage three yang cultivator had used his powerful will and unparalleled fighting spirit to leave behind a broken eyebrow raising staff.
 Such a treasure, even if it was not a transcendent item, was better than most transcendent items.
 At this moment, someone broke through the air.
 There were the three suns and also the sunlight.
 As for the weaker ones, no one dared to snatch them.
 At this moment, Li Hao felt a bloodthirsty urge.
 That thing ... You guys are not worthy of it!
 Yes, they were not worthy.
 Although sun Yifei had died in battle and was an enemy, Yuan Shuo respected him after his death, and Li Hao also felt that sun Yifei was a famous Martial Master and a Grandmaster. What right did these people have to take away his eyebrows-abrest rod?
 Li Hao stomped on the ground and charged at one of the sunlit cultivators with the starry sky sword in his hand ...
 Before he could catch up to his opponent, a loud shout resounded in all directions,""Get lost!"
 With a loud roar, Hao lianchuan rose into the air and roared,""You dare! You dare to touch anyone's things?"
 At that moment, Hao lianchuan was extremely furious.
 He did not know why he was angry.
 Maybe it was because sun Yifei was a fire element super?
 He threw a punch and a fiery light shot out in all directions. The sunlit supers all retreated, but there were still a few three suns present.
 The Yama, the flying heavens, and the swords gate all had three suns.
 On the Yama's side, a cold-looking middle-aged man said coldly,""Yuan Shuo has already left. Are you going to stop us? Hao lianchuan, you've overestimated yourself and the night patrolman!"
 Hao lianchuan was going crazy. At this moment, he wanted to take out his Fire Phoenix spear and kill everyone!
  'Damn it!'  Who Do You Think You Are?
 Do you think you still have a big advantage after the Crimson Moon is destroyed?
 He suddenly looked at Hong Yitang and said angrily,""Hong Yitang, you also want to Rob?"
 Hong Yitang frowned slightly and moved away.""I'm not trying to steal this item. I just don't want Brother Sun to be disturbed after his death. This half of the eyebrows-abrest stick ... If I take it away, I promise I won't use it for myself. I'll order someone to send it to the central region ... To sun Hongxiu!"
 Hearing this, Hao lianchuan immediately frowned.
 He was somewhat dissatisfied.
 Give it to sun Hongxiu?
 If they really gave it to sun Yifei and the other party got something, or even some bonus from sun Yifei's will, wouldn't they come to kill Li Hao and the others?
 Previously, sun Hongxiu had said some harsh words.
 Now, it was a blood feud.
 Although Hao lianchuan sympathized with sun Yifei, he knew that Yuan Shuo and Li Hao were the night watchers.
 Regardless of whether Hong Yitang was really giving it to him or not ... He definitely couldn't give it to him.
 "Hong Yitang, the rules of the martial arts world! Sun Yifei died in Yuan Shuo's hands, and his eyebrows-abrest stick is Yuan Shuo's trophy. Yuan Shuo has left, but his last disciple, Li Hao, is still here. Do you think it's your turn to steal his treasure?"
 Hong Yitang frowned slightly and nodded.""Then forget it. I don't have any intention of snatching the treasure. It doesn't matter if you believe it or not ... As a fellow martial artist, I won't snatch Brother sun's relic after his death!"
 As soon as he finished speaking, he stepped back and made way for her.
 Whether he was being cautious or not, he chose to give up.
 In an instant, there were only three three suns left in the arena.
 Yama's cold-faced middle-aged man, flying mysterious cloaked man.
 The mysterious cloaked man seemed to have looked around. A moment later, he disappeared without a trace and returned to the flying organization's camp. With a wave of his hand, the experts from the flying organization quickly disappeared.
 The other party had also given up on snatching the treasure.
 The Yama expert immediately frowned.
 He wasn't afraid of Hao lianchuan, but the Feitian disciples had left, and Hong Yitang of swords gate was watching from the side. Even though Yuan Shuo had left ... It didn't mean that he wouldn't come back. Even though everyone guessed that Yuan Shuo had fled because of his injuries, they still had to be on guard.
  "Night watchman ... Yuan Shuo ..."
 He murmured in his heart. The next moment, he flew into the air and left.
 Below, the Yama powerhouses also left one after another.
 Now that their leader had left, they naturally did not dare to stay any longer.
 They needed to go back and digest today's battle. They also needed to spread the news.
 As for the half of the eyebrows-abrest stick that sun Yifei left behind ... The night patrolmen might not be able to keep it.
 Even if they didn 't, someone else might.
 He might be able to discover some secrets through this half of the stick. Yuan Shuo's Secret, yunshen's Secret, and why Sun Yifei left this half of the stick behind after he died.
 There might be many precious aspects to this.
 As the Yama's people also retreated, this time, those small organizations did not have the courage to stay, and they all fled the scene without a care for their lives.

 After today's battle, it was hard to say whether they could continue tomorrow's trip to the remains.
 At this moment, there were also some small organizations that wanted to retreat.
 Should we retreat?
 It was too dangerous!
 At first, they thought it would be a simple trip to the remains. The big organizations would eat the meat in front, and they would just follow behind and drink the soup.
 Good Lord, the island of light had finished the soup before he could even drink it.
 The red moon, one of the three major organizations, had lost two of its three suns in a row.
 In addition to Broken Sky, Red Moon had lost three three suns experts in Silver Moon in just over a month.
 In the past, the three suns could not be seen.
 However, with the appearance of the three suns, they did not appear to be invincible. Instead, they were killed one after another. The key was that the person who killed them was the same person, Yuan Shuo!
  This old Devil's reputation was indeed not just for show.
 Everyone thought about it carefully.
 ? From Duan Tian to sun Yifei to Hao Kong, they still didn't know about Qiao Feilong. If they knew, Yuan Shuo would kill one three suns on average every ten days. How terrifying would that be?
 Of course, everyone had forgotten one person.
 The light Island master!
 He was a well-known master and a god tier master ...
 However, in today's battle, the other party's presence was too weak, even weaker than haokong 's. Haokong had Hong Yue's support. Everyone knew that Hong Yue would not let it go after haokong's death.
 As for the island master of light Island ... Forget it. He was already dead, and light Island was gone. Who would care about him?
 At this moment, everyone had forgotten about his existence.
 The death of a three yang god tier master was not even as eye-catching as sun moxiian 's.
 ……
 In the air.
 When Hao lianchuan took the eyebrow-measuring stick, the other half of the stick seemed to struggle a little.
 Hao lianchuan landed on the ground.
 As soon as he landed, a person walked over. It was Li Hao.
 He looked at Hao lianchuan.
 Hao lianchuan was also looking at him.
 After a long while, Li Hao said gloomily,"thank you, Minister Xi!"
 “……”
 Hao lianchuan was speechless. What did she mean?
 "Thank you, Minister nie, for helping me retrieve the eyebrows-measuring stick!"
 “……”
 Hao lianchuan finally understood.
 He was a little embarrassed for a moment. He had actually wanted to keep this and send it to the night patrol for the head to study it, but ... But he had just said that this was Yuan Shuo's spoils of war.
 According to the rules, it belonged to Yuan Shuo and Li Hao.
 "Li Hao, this ..."
 "Thank you, Minister Xi!" Li Hao said gloomily.
 “……”
 He wanted the eyebrows-abrest stick.
 It wasn't because this thing was a treasure. He had a treasure, but he hadn't even figured out what the starry sky sword was.  However, the eyebrows-abrest stick was the weapon of his teacher's enemies ... At the last moment, he had seen his teacher's opponent swing his fist and hold back.
 This eyebrow-scepter ...
 Li Hao wanted to take it back. When the time was right, he might send it back to the central continent and return it to Qi Mei staff King's successor.
 Yes!
 Even if he knew that the other party would not be grateful to him after taking the item, and might even want to kill him.
 But ... He still wanted to send it back.
 The legacy remained even after the person died.
 Qi Mei staff King's inheritance, and ...
 Was he pedantic?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Just like what he had thought before, he was very pedantic. It was fine if he didn't cut the weeds and eliminate the roots, but he still wanted to return the will staff left behind by Qi Mei staff King. Was he stupid?
 He was silly.
 However, wasn't a Martial Master the same?
 I'm still a Martial Master!
 Li Hao's blood hadn't turned cold yet.
 Hao lianchuan was speechless. After a while, he said,""There are a lot of people watching us now. I'll give it to you when we get back to the Nightwalker headquarters."
 "Thank you!"
 Li Hao thanked him.
 At this moment, he silently looked up at the sky, and then at sun moxian's grave in the distance. He walked over and looked for something on the ground that could prove the identity of the rod King.
 It couldn't be too precious. If the eyebrows-length stick was buried, people would probably come to dig the grave every day.
 A moment later, Li Hao found some torn clothes left behind from the previous battle. There was also a small section of the eyebrow-raising stick, which was the one from the beginning. There was only a little bit left, but it wouldn't be too noticeable.
 In front of the grave of rebirth, Li Hao buried all these things.
 After a long silence, Li Hao only left a few words.
 "The king of eyebrows-up staves, sun Yifei. The tomb of the successor of eyebrows-up staves, sun moxian."
 There were no battle records, no merits, no months, nothing.
 And this was enough.
 At this moment, there was one more person beside him, Hong Yitang.
 He brought his daughter and walked over step by step. Hong Yitang took a look at the gravestone and sighed. He bowed slightly,""Brother Sun, now that you've witnessed the birth of the yunshen, I think you'll be willing to leave!"
 "The path of the Silvermoon Grandmaster hasn't been cut off ...."
 He was a little emotional and sad.
  There was one less person.
 He looked at Li Hao and said softly,"you're not bad either. Don't think too much. Martial masters ... Are like this!" The pugilistic world no longer exists, but when your master left the Silver City, the pugilistic world reappeared!"
 "I believe that the legend of the Silver Moon martial forest will continue!"
 "Li Hao, take care of yourself. Your master killed sun Yifei and broke through the level of spirit accumulation, breaking the shackles of Qian warrior. Now that he has left, if you can't find him, I believe that someone will come to find you soon."
 "I don't care if I spar with you or kill you, but I won't let you feel at ease. You must know that ... Martial masters have already declined!"
 These words had a deep meaning.
 He also felt a little sad.
 The Martial Master had been replaced.
 What replaced martial arts were superpowers that were at the peak of their power.
 However, there was an exception among the martial masters. Would the superpowers tolerate the rise of martial masters again?

 Not necessarily!
 Back then, the rise of superpowers had killed many martial masters, and many martial masters had no choice but to become superpowers. If it was proven that martial masters were better ... Wouldn't it be a slap in the face for many people?
 Not everyone was like sun Yifei, and not everyone hoped for the rise of martial arts again.
 Some of the Super martial masters rose to power in the Tong Heng state.
 This meant that they had made the wrong choice back then.
 No one was willing to admit that they were wrong!
 Therefore, it was in line with their thoughts that the martial masters would completely fall silent.
 Hong Yitang was a super Martial Master. At this moment, he could deeply understand this feeling. He didn't say that when he saw how powerful Yuan Shuo was, he also felt a little regretful. Although the path of a Martial Master was difficult, was it more powerful?
 These thoughts quickly dissipated.
 But in his heart, there was always a lingering regret.
  He felt that he was an open-minded person. If he wasn 't, he would have avoided Yuan Shuo's challenges a few times. This situation was very humiliating, but he could still endure it. Now, even he felt a little regretful. One could imagine how the other martial masters were.
 Beside him.
 Li Hao looked at Hong Yitang and slightly bowed.""This junior understands! However ... I'm not afraid to challenge you openly! If my master can kill his way out, so can I! If it's an assassination or a sneak attack, then Swordmaster Hong has underestimated the night patrollers!"
 Li Hao revealed a faint smile."The night patrollers are all over the 99 provinces. It's still the star dynasty's world. If they want to kill me, they have to see if the night patrollers agree or not. Even if they agree ... I don't know if they've forgotten that my teacher is still alive!"
 It's not like he's dead!
 Hong Yitang smiled and nodded.""It's good that you have a plan. Tomorrow's trip to the ruins may not be smooth. Even if it's smooth ... You'd better not go in. It's too dangerous."
 "Thank you for your warning, sword head Hong!"
 After saying that, Li Hao looked at Hong Qing beside him.""Miss Hong Qing, the sword is broken. I'm sorry. When I return to the night patrolman, I'll get someone to make a new one and send it to you."
 "I'm fine. "
 Hong Qing looked at him curiously and shook his head.""It's just an ordinary sword. It's not an extraordinary item. It's fine if it's broken."
 "You ... Have only been practicing martial arts for three years?" she asked curiously.
 "Yes."
 "That's amazing!"
 Hong Qing was somewhat impressed. It had really only been three years.
 A genius!
 She had been practicing martial arts since she was a child, and she had been practicing martial arts for more than ten years. It was already very impressive for her to break through the late-stage of 100.
 However, the person in front of him had practiced martial arts for three years and killed sun moxian ... The genius who had comprehended force and was about to step into the universe of thousands.
 Hong Qing felt that it was a pity for the two martial masters who had died today.
 Of course, if Li Hao and Yuan Shuo died in battle, she would also feel that it was a pity.
 They were both geniuses and experts in the path of martial masters. She couldn't help but feel sad that they had died just like that.  "You're too kind!"
 Li Hao didn't say anything more. He turned around and left.
 He didn't like to talk too much with strangers. Even though Hong Yitang was very friendly, one could only know a person's face but not his heart. Who knew what Hong Yitang's true thoughts were?
 ……
 When he returned to the night patrolmen's camp, the others were cleaning up the mess.
 The people of the Crimson Moon were dead, so they needed to clean up the battlefield and extract the mysterious energy. This was something that others did not dare to do, but it did not matter to the night patrolman. In any case, the night patrolman was going to take the blame!
 Yuan Shuo said that he was not a night patrolman ... But outsiders did not think so.
 Back then, hou Xiaochen had protected Yuan Shuo. In the eyes of others, Yuan Shuo was one of the night watchers. Since that was the case, Hao lianchuan would not be polite. Yuan Shuo had killed people and taken the red shadow. No one else had seen it, so everyone thought that Yuan Shuo had only killed for the sake of killing.
 At this moment, the mysterious energy was all there.
 Many powerful cultivators had died today, and there was a lot of mysterious energy. As for the fire energy in the air, it was still overflowing, but no one was going to collect it. Even though Hao lianchuan felt that it was a pity deep in his heart, he still chose to give up.
 He didn't collect it!
 Although sun Yifei was also a member of the red moon, Hao lianchuan was impressed by his glory as a Martial Master. A master like him shouldn't be humiliated like this after his death.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It had nothing to do with the camp, it was just pure admiration.
 If everyone in the red moon was like this, he would admire the men in the red moon, but unfortunately, there were too few people like sun Yifei.
 ……
 At that moment, Wang Ming also came over and sighed."Senior brother, I didn't expect this battle to end like this!"
 “……”
 He was stunned.
 Li Hao was stunned, Liu Long was stunned, Liu Yan was also dumbfounded, and Hao lianchuan looked as if he had just met Wang Ming.
  What?
 Senior brother?
 Wang Ming didn't seem to see their expressions and said a little worriedly,"Senior brother, the teacher left. Is he too heavily injured? We all saw how our teacher was injured, and if news of today's battle were to spread, I'm afraid that countless people will want to kill our teacher or force him to reveal the secret of his Martial Master breakthrough ... Our teacher is in grave danger. Senior brother, is there any way we can help our teacher?"
 "Old Wang ..." Li Hao replied with some difficulty.
 "Call me little Ming!"
 Wang Ming said firmly,"senior brother, the etiquette of a Martial Master can't be abandoned. I didn't understand it before, but today I'm deeply touched. Seniority matters; you're the senior brother, and I'm the junior Brother. Even if I'm older than you, you can't call me old Wang. Just call me little Ming!"
 The group of people were speechless.
 But ... Could they argue?
 It couldn 't.
 He was indeed Yuan Shuo's disciple. An in-name disciple was still a disciple.

 Back then, Yuan Shuo had wanted to pave the way for Li Hao, but he hadn't expected that Li Hao would improve so quickly. He himself had also improved so quickly that he had directly entered the spirit accumulation stage. Now, the three in-name disciples he had accepted had earned themselves a title.
 The five birds sect!
 Hao lianchuan's eyes were also strange. He quickly smiled and said,""Right, Li Hao, if you need any help, just tell me. As for Wang Ming ... Wang Ming, you and your senior brother should ask for some advice. Martial arts ... Still have a very bright future. "
 He was happy to see it happen.
 He was even gloating in his heart. When Yuan Shuo had forced them to acknowledge him as their master, he had felt that it was a little inappropriate. But now, hehe, Yuan Shuo, you didn't expect this either, did you?
 Your in-name disciple is sticking to you!
 Li Hao couldn't be bothered to say anything else. Wang Ming was like this sometimes. He just casually said, "Don't shout when you're outside. Don't think that you're taking advantage of me. You have to understand that right now ... There are many people who wish for my teacher to die, and for me to die."
 Martial Master, superpower, Crimson Moon ...
 Even among the night patrollers, not all of them hoped that Yuan Shuo was still alive.
 He then thought about hou Xiaochen's words ... If the higher-ups continued to force him, he would rebel!
  At that time, it was even more terrifying.
 Moreover, there was a powerhouse in the middle stage of the three yang realm who was silently spying on them nearby.
 If he said too much, it would be easy to attract attention.
 When his teacher left, he didn't absorb the sword energy. He only took the red shadow with him. He didn't know if the red shadow's power could help his teacher recover. Also, he had forcefully nurtured his second soul. His kidney must be suffering from severe kidney deficiency.
 Li Hao was still a little worried.
 As for his teacher's escape, he could understand.
 If he didn't run now and the news spread, he would be a target if he didn't recover from his injuries!
 It was easy to be surrounded and annihilated here.
 At this moment, Hao lianchuan also thought of this. He said solemnly,""There's some trouble with the ruins! The news might have spread out by now. I have to report it to Minister hou immediately! Li Hao, come with me!"
 Then, he led Li Hao to the night patrolmen's camp.
 He felt that he might not be able to handle this matter ... No, he was 100% certain that he would not be able to.
 This was big trouble!
 Fortunately, Yuan Shuo had run away. If he had not, he would have been in even more trouble.
 He was glad that if Yuan Shuo had stayed, the top powerhouses from the three major organizations would have rushed over from the central region at the fastest speed possible. Even if the central region was too far away, the other provinces would have also mobilized their forces urgently.
 ……
 At the same time.
 The news had indeed spread.
 At the foot of white moon Mountain.
 In a tea house.
 The Samsara King had just reached the foot of the mountain when a mirror in his arms vibrated. He took it out and looked at it. Gradually, his expression began to turn serious.
 In the end, it became heavy.
 There was not much news.
 However, it was extremely shocking.
 Yuan Shuo had broken through and advanced to the level of spirit accumulation. Beyond the thousand-warrior tier, there was still a path for martial masters!
 Yuan Shuo's formation killed sun Yifei, and sun Yifei used the mysterious source as a weapon, but he was still killed. Yuan Shuo's combat strength was almost above three suns!
 Terrifying news!
 Of course, there was also an additional message. Yuan Shuo was seriously injured and fled. Before he left, he killed all the members of the Crimson Moon exploration team, including Hao Kong.
 This news made the reincarnation King laugh.
 He was not Yama's man. The three major organizations were cooperating and targeting each other, so it was better for him to die.  Of course, he didn't have the mood to mock anything.
 He, who was originally prepared to go up the mountain, instantly changed his direction and broke through the air, flying towards the crosscut Canyon.
 At this moment, holding back hou Xiaochen was no longer a big deal.
 He left first!
 A moment later, an angry roar resounded through the world. In an instant, a purple figure floated into the air.
 It was the leader of the red moon, Zi Yue!
 She had also received the news that although all the people from the Crimson Moon had been killed, one of the supers present would tell her. As for who it was, it was not important. The Crimson Moon had always been good at gathering information.
 ……
 On the peak of white moon Mountain.
 Hou Xiaochen was currently drinking tea in a Pavilion at the top of the mountain when Chief Steward Yu quickly brought over a screen and said,"Urgent report from Minister kun!"
 "Receive!"
 Hou Xiaochen already knew that something had happened. He had sensed the departure of Zi Yue and the Samsara King.
 But what could make them so anxious?
 Did Hao lianchuan take out his Fire Phoenix spear?
 So, they were in a hurry to get the origin god weapon?
 This was within his calculations.
 I'll go!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The origin god weapon was not so easy to take away.
 Therefore, he was not too anxious.
 When Hao lianchuan's face appeared on the screen, he was still in the mood to laugh.""You're still not running?"
 The origin god weapon was exposed, and you still stayed there?
 "Run?"
 Hao lianchuan was stunned. The next moment, he said hurriedly,""Minister, should we withdraw?"
 "What else?"
 "But ..."
 "But now is a good time," Hao lianchuan said anxiously."The red moon has been severely damaged. I think it's a good time."
 "Let's make it simple,"
 It was as if hou Xiaochen had everything under control. In reality, he had already predicted many situations, so even if something happened, he would have made arrangements.
  "Department head, Yuan Shuo advanced to the spirit accumulation stage and found the martial arts path above the Qian warrior stage. He killed sun Yifei, everyone in Red Moon, and destroyed Light Island ..."
 Pa!
 The teacup was crushed into pieces.
 "Minister?"
 Hao lianchuan was puzzled. Didn't the Minister already know?
 Hou Xiaochen's expression didn't change as he nodded,"Yes, what else?"
 At this moment, he was shocked.
 What was going on?
 Yuan Shuo ... Possessed spirit?
 It wasn't completely out of his consideration that Yuan Shuo could defeat sun Yifei. For example, it was very possible that Yuan Shuo could use the fiery phoenix spear and unleash a powerful force.

 Using the mysterious weapon of the eight great families, Yuan Shuo's explosive strength to defeat sun Yifei ... Was also in his consideration.
 Yuan Shuo couldn't defeat sun Yifei, so he had to escape ... Well, that was also in his consideration.
 The only thing he didn't consider was that Yuan Shuo actually killed sun Yifei with his own strength. That's right, even a God wouldn't be able to think about this. Yuan Shuo, who had just advanced to the Qian warrior level a month ago, had quickly found the path to the Qian warrior level.
 He had even stepped into it!
 The accumulation of spirit?
 Hou Xiaochen was truly shocked. He couldn't believe it.
 How was that possible?
 However ... He was so calm just now that he couldn't show his shock.
 Only Chief Steward Yu saw that the Minister, who was always calm, was almost crushing the cup in his hand into powder at this moment.
 "Department head, Yuan Shuo killed all of Hong Yue's men and escaped with serious injuries! So, are we not going to explore the ruins now? are we going to give up the ruins and retreat now?"
  Evacuate?
 Retreat, my ass!
 The cross-section Canyon would soon become the focus of everyone's attention. They couldn't leave now. If they left, the relic would be gone. Once they left this time, a large number of experts would come to the cross-section Canyon to explore.
 He had to explore the ruins before they arrived.
 And he ... Had to personally oversee it!
 At this moment, they could not even care about Whitemoon city. Of course, not only him, but also the three large organizations and the higher-ups, no one could care about Whitemoon city. What a joke, who would still have the mood to care about Whitemoon city?
 They were all looking for Yuan Shuo, and if they couldn't find Yuan Shuo ... It would be the same if they looked for his disciple first!
 "I'll be there immediately!"
 After saying this, hou Xiaochen hung up the call. As he descended the mountain, he said,"Send a message to the garrison headquarters!"
 Chief Steward Yu quickly connected the call, and hou Xiaochen picked it up. He said in a deep voice,"No matter what, the garrison will start to station in the Hengduan Canyon and seal it. All weapons, cover the Hengduan Canyon! In addition, activate level one combat preparation ... At the critical moment, we can use those things to launch a large-scale attack!"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "The Marquis's Department?"
 "Trust me. Otherwise, I'm afraid there will be some trouble this time."
 "Alright, I understand. It's just that ... If we do that, I'm afraid it will lead to some bad effects."
 "It's okay, we're prepared. At most ... We'll just do the worst case scenario."
 "Understood!"
 Hou Xiaochen hung up and thought for a while before dialing another number,"Spread the news that Yuan Shuo has advanced to the level of spirit accumulation, stepped into the Qian warrior stage, and killed sun Yifei, who was in the late stage of the three yang realm, in three moves! At this moment, Yuan Shuo is already heading to the central region. He wants to kill Ying Hongyue with the power of his spirit so that she can wash her neck and wait for him to kill her!"
 "Also, Yuan Shuo has the intention to rebuild the Silver Moon martial arts world. He's willing to impart the method of accumulating spirit energy to those who share the same goal and are willing to kill the martial masters of the Crimson Moon with him. He's willing to accept them and impart the method of accumulating spirit energy to them ..."
 At the side, Chief Steward Yu's eyes kept blinking.  Was this ... Appropriate?
 Of course, with this, Ying Hongyue and the others would keep an eye on Yuan Shuo no matter what. There was a high chance that they would wait for him in the central region.
 Most of the martial masters and experts in the world would go to the central region to find Yuan Shuo.
 As for whether he would kill Yuan Shuo or the people of the Crimson Moon, it was hard to say.
 As for whether everyone believed it or not ... Why not?
 This tone was too in line with old demon Yuan's style. Those who understood Yuan Shuo would most likely not suspect anything.
 At this moment, hou Xiaochen had also calmed down.
 He was no longer as shocked as before.
 He regained his calm and thought for a while before saying,""Send a message to the central!"
 "Just say that we need reinforcements. Ask them to send a few experts at the rising light realm with three to five origin God weapons. Otherwise, we won't be able to stop them!"
 "Are we really going to report it like this?" chief Yu was shocked.
 "Right!"
 Hou Xiaochen suddenly laughed,"we'll do it this way!" "Also, inform them to take care of Yuan Shuo in the central region. Yuan Shuo has already secretly joined the night patrolmen and told the headquarters that Yuan Shuo has agreed to provide us with the most complete method of accumulating spirit energy if we help him kill Ying Hongyue. He'll help us solve some of the problems caused by the supers and will also teach us the higher level version of the five birds breathing technique ..."
 Even if it was made up, it was extremely similar to Yuan Shuo's tone.
 "As for me ... I have no choice but to go to the transverse Canyon with my injuries. Tell the headquarters to bring me a primordial spirit fruit when they come to help me heal. Otherwise, I'm afraid I won't be able to hold on for long!"
 Chief Steward Yu quickly noted it down.
 At this moment, his heart was already full of admiration. The Minister was still the best.
  "In the end ..."
 At this moment, hou Xiaochen was standing on the mountainside, looking into the distance. "I'll tell the world another piece of news. Hong Yue's blood deity is the key to Yuan Shuo's breakthrough to the amassing spirit realm. You can extract the blood deity from any origin divine weapon. The method of extracting it is to be made public!"
 He was smiling!
 However, Chief Steward Yu felt a chill in his heart. If this news were to spread, regardless of whether it was superpowers or martial masters, any organization with an origin divine weapon would be tempted.
 Be it research or storage, they would definitely be tempted.
 In the past, this piece of information was actually of little use.
 Who would believe that?
 But now!
 He would believe it!
 "Prepare the details. After he killed Duan Tian, he seized the blood deity and quickly advanced. This time, he killed haokong and took the blood God after he was seriously injured. When Yuan Shuo reappears, he might be even stronger. All of this must be revealed. From his track and speed of improvement, this is the most suitable treasure for him to advance to the spirit accumulation realm!"

 Hou Xiaochen's brain was spinning rapidly. In the blink of an eye, he had already come up with a plan.
 If one were to investigate carefully, there was indeed something invulnerable.
 "Also, spread the news that the night patrolman has gifted him a three-sun blood deity. Spread the news that he has been in seclusion for many days after obtaining the blood deity ... Through the spies!"
 "Understood!"
 Chief Steward Yu was even more impressed, and he also mourned for Hong Yue.
 As such, even if Red Moon was able to withstand the pressure, she would not have the energy to cause trouble for Silver Moon or the Silver City in the near future.
 They should take care of themselves first!
 ……
 Li Hao didn't know any of this yet.
 Otherwise, he would be in awe of his teacher.
  No wonder his teacher had told him to leave the mess to hou Xiaochen before he left. It was obvious that Yuan Shuo believed that hou Xiaochen would be able to solve the problem and minimize the danger.
 Hou Xiaochen did not let her down.
 In the blink of an eye, arrangements were made one by one. When the news broke out, the one who suffered the most was not Yuan Shuo or Li Hao, but Hong Yue.
 The blood God could be promoted.
 Killing the red moon's people would also give him the method of accumulating spirit energy.
 Those who were ambitious had more or less taken action. If they didn't kill a few Crimson Moon experts and test it out, who would be willing?
 Even if they knew that the news might not be true, there would still be experts who would try.
 He definitely would!
 Even the strong ones within the Crimson Moon might not be able to settle down.
 ……
 On this day, before hou Xiaochen's group had even reached the transverse Canyon, the news had already spread.
 ……
 "Yuan Shuo advanced to the spirit accumulation realm and became a warrior master above the warrior dimension. He also killed sun Yifei, who almost broke through to the rising light realm!"
 ……
 "Big news, big news! The Silvermoon old demon, Yuan Shuo, who dominated the martial arts world more than twenty years ago, advanced to the warrior of thousands and killed sun Yifei who was at the rising light realm with one strike. The method of his advancement was provided by Red Moon herself, and red moon's shadow God is the key to the breakthrough of a Martial Master!"
 "No wonder! I knew it. Hongyue's shadow God is not ordinary, but Ying Hongyue never let martial masters train her shadow God. They are all superpowers, and after a period of time, she will take back the shadow God ... So that's how it is. Could it be that Ying Hongyue still has her inner strength?"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com “……”
 ……
 "The heavens have changed! Some martial masters can advance to beyond the thousand-warrior level and are comparable to the rising sun. The key to this advancement is the red moon's shadow God, a treasure with a particularly powerful concealment ability. Many Red Moon supers have it. As long as three clones of Blood God formed by the shadow God of the three suns level can advance to the Yushen level!"
 "Really?"
 "I'm not lying to you. I'm afraid that the news has spread throughout the 99 provinces!"
 "Three yang ... Just three yang? Let's go and make some preparations ... You need an origin god weapon, right? Quick, bring the origin divine weapon ... We'll kill a few before the others are ready!"
 “……”
 At this moment, the entire star dynasty was in an uproar.
 Actually, killing a late stage three yang expert wasn't that impressive. In the central region, it wasn't like late stage three yang experts hadn't died before. Even those in the sunrise realm who were above the three yang realm had died.
 However, a Martial Master killing his opponent ... That was the biggest news.
 Furthermore, this Martial Master had broken through the limits of a Martial Master. To many people and organizations, martial masters had never been given up on. This was because everyone knew that the ability of a Martial Master to advance was very powerful!
 Many organizations would train martial masters, and the three major organizations were no exception. Advancing with a Martial Master would make everyone stronger.
 Therefore, some people went crazy when they heard that he could be promoted to a warrior beyond the thousand-star level and even be comparable to the three suns or even the rising light.
  This was because they knew that when a Martial Master advanced, they would usually advance by one level.  If he advanced by accumulating spirit energy, wouldn't he be directly at the rising sun?
 Or even stronger!
 If the rumors were true and Yuan Shuo was comparable to Xu Guang ... Didn't that mean that Yuan Shuo would be able to surpass Xu Guang and reach the ultimate realm of superpowers that had yet to appear?
 This was something that no organization would let go.
 It was chaotic!
 The aftermath officially spread out.
 Yuan Shuo, Hong Yue, Blood God ...
 All of these became the key words that the experts from all over the world were talking about.
 Hou Xiaochen was the one who added fuel to the fire.
 Countless organizations began to find out if the news was true or false, using silver moon's spies or the night patrollers 'spies in the hope of obtaining more real news.
 The information that hou Xiaochen had revealed ... Was extremely true.
 This was especially true after Yuan Shuo had broken through to the thousand warrior tier and killed Duan Tian. He had improved rapidly, hou Xiaochen had given him the three yang Blood God, and Yuan Shuo had gone into seclusion for a few days before coming out to fight sun Yifei ... All of this was extremely real!
 No matter who it was, no one could find any problems with it.
 Yuan Shuo's disciple, Li Hao, had studied martial arts for three years. After taking a Blood God at the radiant sun level, he entered the realm of surpassing one hundred perfection and killed sun moxian, who had mastered force. This had also appeared in the news of many organizations.
 A newbie who had studied martial arts for three years had quickly entered the realm of surpassing one hundred perfects......This further confirmed the accuracy of the news!
 Of course, Li Hao also gained a lot of attention because of this.
 Since he couldn't find Yuan Shuo, he could only look for Li Hao.
 The premise was that he had to kill a Crimson Moon elite, get a Blood God, and find the real treasure. Otherwise, if he found Li Hao and didn't have any treasure, what could he do even if he told him how to absorb it?
 Li Hao's team obviously didn't have it. Even if they did, they had already used it.
 If he didn't bring a Blood God's seed, how could he run so far to find someone?
 ……
 The star dynasty, which was already in chaos, became even more chaotic at this moment.
 On the Crimson Moon's side, before they could react, many Crimson Moon experts disappeared in the blink of an eye.
 He didn't die, he disappeared.
 He had disappeared without a trace!
 Forget about the weak ones, there were even a few three sun powerhouses who disappeared without a trace. No one could find them, Dead or Alive. It had been less than an hour since the news was leaked, which showed how powerful some of the hidden super organizations were.
 ……
 Central region.
  In a secret place, an extremely handsome man with a slightly feminine face suddenly had a sharp look in his eyes!
 "Bastard!"
 He was furious!
 If Yuan Shuo were to see this, he would probably scold Ying Hongyue for being so coy. It had been so many years, yet she still maintained this appearance. She was already an old man, yet she still acted like a young person.
 Although he was angry, he quickly shouted,""Quick, gather the forces of the major provinces! Everyone, wait for orders. Destroy the stronghold and hide!"
 'Damn it!'
 At this moment, he was also so angry that his liver hurt. His reaction was a little late, and as a result ... He couldn't contact several of the three suns in charge of the province. Why?
 Was there a need to ask?
 Bastard!
 The large organizations and night patrols had contributed to this. Otherwise, how could the three suns have disappeared so easily? moreover, they needed the origin divine weapon. It was impossible for small organizations to have it!

 Yuan Shuo's matter had caused a large number of experts to head towards Silver Moon.
 Originally, there would have been more.
 However, as the news spread, the Crimson Moon was in a lot of trouble at the moment. Some of the Masters were trying to kill the Crimson Moon Masters, so the number of people who came was less than expected.
 However, there were still many martial masters in the world who had set out towards the Silver Moon.
 Beyond thousand warrior!
 The martial masters who had yet to reach the warrior dimension might have come with the mentality of revering the Silver Moon, but there were also some martial masters who had reached the warrior dimension. For the warrior dimension Masters, the road up there was cut off.
 There was no way out!
 If he couldn't become a superpower, there was no way up, and his martial arts path was broken.
 At this moment, they saw an opportunity. Even if it was just a sliver of hope, they wanted to take a look.
 Yuan Shuo had disappeared. They didn't know whether he had gone to the central continent or not, but they all knew that Yuan Shuo's last disciple, Li Hao, was in Silver Moon. Moreover, his whereabouts were public. Martial masters like Yuan Shuo would usually leave their inheritances behind.
  This was a Martial Master!
 Martial masters were afraid that they would die an unnatural death in the next moment. Under normal circumstances, they would pass on all their inheritance to one person. It was rare for them to treasure their own belongings. After all, martial masters had declined.
 ……
 Hengduan Canyon.
 At the night patrolman's encampment.
 Many people were a little nervous. As the battle ended, they also realized the problem. Yuan Shuo had broken the limit of a Martial Master. Putting aside Red moon's revenge, just the secret of his advancement was enough to make countless people go crazy.
 Hao lianchuan's brows furrowed deeply.
 He contacted the Head of the Department and the Head of the Department said that he understood and that there was no problem. He looked calm, but ... Was he really calm?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Could the ruins still be explored?
 If they did not explore it, would the ruins still belong to them as more and more powerhouses paid attention to the Silver Moon?
 The more he thought about it, the more his head hurt.
 He had already told Yuan Shuo not to accept the challenge, but he had to accept it.
 This old devil was born to cause trouble.
 He glanced at the well-behaved Li Hao ... But he thought, could this little guy be the second Yuan Shuo, and also a little devil?
 Well-behaved ... He naturally didn't believe it.
 When this guy fought with sun moxiian, he had some of Yuan Shuo's style in the past. His moves were fast, accurate, black, and ruthless. Sun moxiian could be considered an outstanding Martial Master, but he was still killed by him.
 Would anyone believe him if he pretended to be an obedient boy?
 The silence lasted for a while.
  "The department head should be coming," Hao lianchuan said."We were supposed to be enough, but it looks like that won't be possible!"  "Do you want to enter the ruins in advance?"
 On the field, a handsome uncle with a long sword on his back spoke up. This man was also the Deputy Minister of the night patrol. His surname was Zhou, and like Wang Ming, he was of the metal element.
 "No!"
 Hao lianchuan shook his head and said,"you didn't come for the previous expeditions." The reason why he chose the 28th was not because it was auspicious, but because the 28th was the day with the least danger in the remains. If he entered early, the danger would be greater! The previous few times, I didn't choose the right time, resulting in heavy losses. "
 "28th, is there anything special about it?" Minister Zhou was a little surprised.
 "Moonlight!"
 Hao lianchuan did not intend to hide it from her, but he did not want to spread it too widely. He explained,""On the 28th, the moonlight from the Silver Moon is the weakest. Some of the mechanisms in the ruins may need the power of moonlight to activate! The weaker the moonlight is, the safer the trap is. If you choose to enter in the middle of the moon, you're just courting death!"
 "This ancient ruin has been buried for who knows how long, but it can still maintain its current state. The energy can't be stored inside, so we all deduce that the energy source is the power of the moonlight."
 "Why can't it be the sun?"
 Wang Ming asked curiously,"the moon isn't necessarily visible every day; it's the sun that can be seen every day. Shouldn't the ancient people have considered the sun's energy more when designing these mechanisms?"
 Why moonlight?
 This was just a normal question, but the words that came out of this guy's mouth all had a bit of a troll tone.
 Hao lianchuan glanced at him but still explained,""Because the sun doesn't appear at night, and the ancient people always had people guarding the city during the day. The normal people rest only at night. At this time, some mechanisms are activated to prevent chaos at night!"
 Therefore, he needed a source of energy at night.
 "Then if we go in during the day, won't there be no interference from moonlight force?" Wang Ming still didn't understand.
 "Energy is accumulated," Hao lianchuan shook his head.
 "Isn't the sun better? If you accumulate it during the day, you can use it at night!"
  He was very tough, but his tough words made sense. Now, what Hao lianchuan said about needing an energy source at night did not make sense.
 Hao lianchuan was speechless.
 'This kid has become bolder after entering sunlight!'
 "Anyway, that's how it is. When the moonlight is at its weakest on the 28th, the power of the traps in the ruins will be at its weakest!"
 Wang Ming still wanted to say a few more words, but when he saw the unkind look in Hao lianchuan's eyes, he quickly shut up.
 Forget it, you're good, you're right.
 Everyone understood that the 28th was the most suitable time. Otherwise, it might have to be the 28th of next month.
 After a month's delay, it was hard to say if the remains were still under the control of the night patrollers.
 For a moment, the others also looked worried.
 Liu Long didn't know much about this and had been silent all this while. At this moment, he said in a low voice,""Most of the people in the red moon division are dead, and the light Island has been destroyed. Yama, flying heavens, swords gate, none of them are stronger than us. Compared to before, their situation should be better. Even if they have reinforcements, do you think we don 't?"

 "The fact that the night patrollers are fighting them in the central region and are not at a disadvantage means that they are still very strong! If the other party is going to deploy experts from the central region, can't the Nightwalker's headquarters also deploy some forces over?"
 Since the balance could be maintained now, it didn't make sense that the situation would become more dangerous after killing some people.
 Before Hao lianchuan could say anything, Minister Zhou of the metal element said coldly,""The central continent is eager for the large organizations to withdraw their forces from the central continent. As for the unrest in the border, that's the border's problem! It's even better if more people die Here!"
 Liu Long became slightly stunned.
 "What nonsense are you spouting?!" Hao lianchuan scolded.
 "We're all Silvermoon citizens, what's there to hide?"Minister Zhou said coldly. The dynasty had already lost control of the border, and they had no time to care about the border. They were also worried that the border provinces would become independent, and the more chaotic the border, the better! Only with chaos will they have enough time to pacify the chaos in the central region, and then slowly take care of the provinces at the border, putting an end to the chaos. "
 "So, the central continent's intentions and attitude are actually very clear now. It doesn't matter if you're in a mess. As long as you can delay the enemy, it will be considered a success. As for how many people you will lose or how many people you will die, these are not within their consideration. "
 Liu Long was momentarily dazed.
 He had never heard of this before.
 At this moment, when he suddenly heard this news, he was a little distracted.
  The central region ... Will not send reinforcements to the border?
 He looked at them, especially Hao lianchuan. At this moment, his feelings were complicated and he said in a deep voice,""Hao bu, the Silver Moon is also a part of the star dynasty. If they encounter a crisis, will the central region just ignore it? Our Silver Moon has not yet reached the point of unrest, and we have always acknowledged the rule of the dynasty. The people under our rule have also acknowledged that they are a member of the dynasty, and there has yet to be a situation where anyone has stood on their own or rebelled. Why is this happening?"
 Hearing his question, Hao lianchuan was silent for a long time before he slowly said,""Perhaps it's not that I don't care ... I really don't have the strength to care. The war in the central region had already taken up too much of their energy. At this time, the central region also wanted to take a break. It would be better if some people could leave. If they sent people to Silver Moon now, would it not prolong the war in the central region? As for Silver Moon ... He's too far away from the central continent!"
 Out of the 99 provinces, Silver Moon was located at the border. Just the 20 provinces in the central region alone were already a huge territory.
 The Silver Moon would not appear any further out. It would only appear when it extended all the way to the border.
 The current star dynasty only hoped to drive the various super organizations out of the central region and consolidate their dominant position. Then, they would slowly spread to the surrounding areas. This was in line with the general policy.
 Otherwise, if they continued to divide their forces, they might end up losing the central region.
 The direction and strategy were right.
 However, to the border provinces, especially those that had no intention of rebelling and becoming independent, this was giving up.
 Moving a small city to a large city was a form of giving up for many people on Silver moon's side.
 Moreover, the central region did not migrate at all and gave up directly. This was a huge blow to many people.
 "You don't have to worry too much about this," Hao lianchuan said."It's actually pretty good. As long as we take care of the enemy, Silver Moon will be at peace! It's not like dynasty doesn't care and doesn't support us at all. Sometimes, they would still send some superpower resources over ..."
 He still said a few words to avoid disappointment or even anger.
 That's not good.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Besides, this wasn't the time to discuss this. He added,""Everyone, please calm down. When the Minister comes, all the trouble will be over."
  Hou Xiaochen.  When they heard that the Minister was coming, everyone suppressed their fear.
 Even though this person had not made a move for many years, he was still a stabilizing force in everyone's hearts. With him around, there would not be a big problem.
 Li Hao had been silently observing them the whole time. Seeing their expressions, he knew that hou Xiaochen's prestige among the night watchers was very high.
 He didn't know if it was because he had long wanted to be independent and had won over the hearts of the people.
 Or was it really to protect Silver Moon that he had repeatedly rejected his superiors 'summons?
 Li Hao didn't know hou Xiaochen very well.
 As such, he only believed half of what hou Xiaochen had said.
 Silver moon's current situation was not only because the higher-ups did not care about it, but also because hou Xiaochen had disobeyed orders several times. In Li Hao's opinion, no higher-up would be satisfied with such a subordinate.
 When a general was outside, he would not obey military orders.
 It didn't sound like a problem, but the central region was in a period of war. The border generals were unwilling to return to the central region to help the Emperor. In the eyes of the central region's higher-ups, this was no different from a rebellion.
 Of course, everyone had their own understanding of this matter.
 Li Hao didn't know the inside story, so he chose to watch from the side.
 The group discussed for a while, but they still couldn't come up with any good ideas. They could only wait for hou Xiaochen to arrive.
 ……
  The wait didn't last long.
 Hou Xiaochen hadn't arrived yet.
 A monstrous aura rose up. In the tent, Hao lianchuan frowned slightly and quickly walked out of the tent.
 In the distance, a purple shadow flashed and disappeared, instantly appearing in front of everyone.
 Hao lianchuan's expression was grave.
 "Ziyue!"
 The highest leader of the Crimson Moon in the Silver Moon, the purple Moon!
 Zi Yue was not wearing a grimacing mask. She looked like a young woman, at most 30 years old. Her eyes were purple, and there was a faint power of lightning flickering around her body.
 Lightning element expert!
 She didn't say much. She glanced at the crowd and saw Li Hao at the back. Then, she said calmly,""Hand over Li Hao, Hao lianchuan. You know the reason!"
