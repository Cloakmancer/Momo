Did the other party not know that such a situation could happen?The father and son of the Zheng family had become the leaders of the rebellion.What about li daoheng?There were even more members of the Li family involved. These people ... Didn't make any preparations?When the Snake King talked about sword Dao, Li Hao thought of the Li family.However, it seemed that no one had ever mentioned them, and they could not be found in the world's remains."The Zheng family's father and son ... Are they really the leaders of the traitors? I heard that there was more than one Heavenly King who participated in the battle. Sun Xin said that there were other Heavenly Kings, but the Zheng family is the only one who has appeared!"The number of Saints did not match either.Sun Xin had said before that there were many saints who had destroyed the Heavenly Star Town, and it was definitely not limited to the few that they had encountered.The water in Silvermoon was still very deep!However, Li Hao had gotten over it. At the very least, li Fuhai's words made him feel that he was right. After planning for 100000 years without making any progress, such a person was destined to be unable to achieve great things!Whether it was the Li family, the Zheng family, or even the red moon sovereign ... For 100000 years, they had not been able to take down a small world. A venerable sovereign had been easily suppressed by the seal of no venerable sovereign and suppressed by the shadow left by the sword venerable ... Such a guy should only be a small character in new martial arts.The other party's main body has already left, and you're still so weak. Just based on this, what do you have to fight with the neo martial artists?Li Hao didn't say anything else. He glanced at the Snake King and said,""The Snake King should be more active recently. Don't always sleep! Winter is about to pass, and spring is coming. All living things are coming back to life, and flowers are blooming in the warmth of spring. The world is about to welcome a great change!"The Snake King didn't quite understand. Li Hao seemed to be talking about the weather, but also seemed to be not.Although it didn't quite understand, it quickly nodded its huge head,""Great senior, don't worry. This little snake will immediately mobilize the demons of Mount kui ...""Oh, and ... If possible, enter the grey Mountain area. There are several demons in the grey Mountain, and they are not weak. You can mention my name. The demons of the grey Mountain ... Don't mess up.""I understand!"The Snake King didn't dare to ask any more questions. She was just a little confused and curious. Why did Li Hao think of giving her a task today?Li Hao didn't say anything more and quickly disappeared.The Snake King heaved a sigh of relief.This man ... Was getting more and more terrifying.……At this time, Li Hao wandered between heaven and earth. After a while, he disappeared from where he was and entered the bright star sector.It followed the imprint that was left behind and swam through the void.After a while, it tore the sky apart and disappeared. In heaven battling city.Li Hao reappeared. At this time, the energy fluctuations in heaven battling city had also weakened. In the past few days, everyone had been cultivating, and countless energy stones had been used up, but the aura of living people in heaven battling city had greatly increased.With Li Hao's reappearance, several experts arrived at the city Lord's mansion.This time, there were even more people.The old turtle, general Huai, li Fuhai, and the ninth master were all in the Saint realm. Even the ninth master's aura had reached the Saint realm, but it was slightly unstable.Apart from that, two other Masters had also recovered. They were the third master, the sixth master, and the eighth master, who had recovered earlier.There was also director Wang, the 11th Division commander who had just joined the heaven battling Army.In addition, the Sequoia family and the Imperial Guards arrived quickly. The Sequoia family had not stepped into the divine path, and it was very difficult for the Yao Zhi to enter the divine path. However, his aura was much stronger than before.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  These were all existences of the neo martial era.Li Hao did not bring the silvers with him this time. After taking down boundless city, they had been developing at a rapid pace. Now that everything was settled, Li Hao did not want to summon them for another battle."How's your recovery?""Everything is fine!"The old turtle nodded slightly."In addition to us, thousands of people in the heaven-battling Army have also been revived ... Now, we can mobilize twenty thousand people, but some of them have not been revived, only lingering spirits ... The ninth Division is still outside. The heaven-battling Army can mobilize a total of thirty thousand soldiers!""Yes!" Hong Mu quickly said,"the monster plant Army is ready, waiting for your orders!"Li Hao said,"then let's not waste any time. Guardian turtle, Sea Protector, general Huai, and the others, create a clone. I'll also take a divine text clone. We'll head to the Saturn relic from the surface!""As for your true bodies ..."Li Hao pondered for a moment."I want to take you to the bright star realm. However, the bright star realm has opened. You're all too strong. I'm worried that I won't be able to secure your positions. I need some help ..."The few of them were a little puzzled. How could they help?"I want to ... Activate heaven battling city and teleport into the bright star sector!" Li Hao said slowly."What?"At this moment, the powerhouses were stunned,"no!"At this time, the old turtle said,"heaven battling city hasn't fully recovered yet. If it is activated now, it can still suppress the world for a while. Once it is activated and left, it may cause the seal to loosen. This is the first reason!" Second, it's easy to enter, but hard to come out ... If you can't come out ..."Li Hao said,"cities are dead, but people are alive!" There was another benefit, which was that he could directly destroy the power of the Crimson Moon in the city! Heaven battling city was powerful, and with the two words "heaven battling" left behind by the blood Emperor, it had been suppressed for many years. Even if it entered the bright star field, it would not collapse! We'll work together to move the city in ... And in the future, we'll have a base in the bright star sector!"

"There are many opportunities in the new Dao universe. This is also an opportunity and not necessarily a bad thing!""As for the loosening of the seal ... It's unlikely! The main body of the seal is still sword city. As long as sword city is not broken, the seal will not be broken ..."The powerhouses looked at each other ... At this moment, they felt a headache.Give in ... After giving in the first step, Li Hao took advantage of the situation and climbed up. Gradually, they were all a little hesitant and conflicted.If this continued ... Their base would be moved away.What was this good?However, he had already given in a few times. Was he not going to give in now?As expected, with the first time, there would be a second time!Li Hao ... Was getting better at controlling people's minds.Li Hao continued,"moreover, I have an idea. I'll fix heaven battling city on my access channel. Once a powerful enemy chases after me and enters the bright star Universe, heaven battling city will suppress them directly!" Why not? It could also make everyone safer ... They didn't even need to enter the ruins with their true bodies to avoid being taken advantage of by the other party! In the bright star field, that's our home ground. The bright star great Dao, combined with the neo martial artists, and the ancient city's suppression ... Even a Heavenly King would die with hatred!""Then ... Didn't you take down boundless city?" the ninth master could not help but ask.Teleport the endless city!Why did he choose heaven battling city?Li Hao shook his head."The Zheng family has been in control of boundless city for many years. They might have left behind some other connections. The Zheng family might even have refined boundless city. If anything happens to boundless city, the other party might be able to sense it. Or if they cut off contact after entering the bright star realm, the other party might speculate that I moved the ancient city into the bright star realm!""Only heaven battling city is here, and all the rulers are here!"The few of them were at a loss! Li Hao said meaningfully,"a new era is coming. Countless heaven-battling armies will be resurrected. If the bodies of the new era can be condensed in the bright star sector from the beginning, they will definitely be closer to the great Dao. They will be no different from the humans of the new era. In fact, they might even be closer to the great Dao. By then, we will have more opportunities! "It shouldn't be like this. Artificial bodies have limited potential. Even someone like director Wang has only formed 36 Dao meridians. However, there are countless Dao meridians in the human body. I can't help everyone form countless Dao meridians ...""After heaven battling city enters the bright star realm, its safety is also guaranteed. Unless I die, the bright star realm is unbreakable. The great Dao universe ... Isn't a place that just anyone can enter!"To move the main city away ... The few of them fell into deep thought.Li Hao had made this decision to prevent any information from leaking out and to suppress the fixed passages, preventing them from breaking. What divine weapon could be more powerful than an ancient city?The starry sky sword might not even be as sturdy as an ancient city!Third ... After heaven battling city entered the bright star cosmos, he had absolute authority.There were many benefits to this.But for heaven battling city, there were advantages and disadvantages.The advantage was that it was more closely tied to Li Hao, but the disadvantage was that if something happened to Li Hao and no one could open the bright star field, heaven battling city would become an isolated city, even lonelier than sword city. The seal on sword city would break sooner or later.However, once the great Dao universe was sealed and no one could open it, heaven battling city would become a Dead City. Even if the human ruler and the others came, they might not be able to find the new Dao universe!There was no place to save!After struggling for a while, the ninth master sighed.""We've already come this far ... Let's just leave it at that, my two guardians!"One step back, one step back.Having retreated to this point ... Was he still afraid of retreating a little more?He wasn't afraid anymore!The two guardians also had bitter expressions on their faces. Their cooperation with Li Hao this time ... Had really been taken advantage of by Li Hao. Just like that, without them knowing it, step by step, they had been taken advantage of by the other party!The turtle Guardian still wanted to make a final struggle.""Activating heaven battling city will consume a lot of energy ..."Li Hao nodded."It's fine. I've prepared 300 million energy stones. I've almost emptied the Heavenly Star Mine!" With that, do you think we can't activate heaven battling city?"“……”Alright, I have nothing to say! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Guardian turtle didn't say anything else, and Li Fuhai was also secretly speechless. He had seen with his own eyes how heaven battling city had walked step by step into the abyss ... Of course, perhaps it wasn't the abyss, but the heavens calling out to him in bed?However, it was also surprised by Li Hao's methods.He was throwing them away bit by bit, not asking for so much in one go, but waiting for you to take a step back, and then come back a few days later, again, and again ... In the end, he was throwing all his money into it!He was trapped!At this moment, heaven battling city actually didn't have much choice. They had already been trapped, so what else could they do?Cut their own flesh to stop their losses?That ... Was really not human at all. The losses were too heavy, so it was better to walk down the same path to the end."There's no time to lose ... Then ... Let's do it!" Li Hao's smile was brilliant."While we're at it, we'll wipe out all the rebels in one go. So, spies, return heaven battling city's heart and soul. Return heaven battling city to its peaceful days!"General Huai did not say anything more, but said,""Governor li, heaven battling city ... Can we enter? I'm worried that I'll be rejected by the Dao universe ...""I should be able to!"Li Hao nodded."The current Dao universe isn't too powerful, and it's somewhat connected to neo martial. The repulsive force has never been strong. Moreover, there's another benefit to moving in. Everyone's origin Dao might be able to be imperceptibly influenced and gradually transform into a new Dao ... Of course, it's fine if you're unwilling. You can take the initiative to disconnect."

2082 Chapter 352
At this point, the old turtle no longer hesitated and said,""Then ... Let's shift! However, if we cause too much of a commotion ...""Don't worry, it won't cause too much of a commotion. I'll set up restrictions in all directions! Now that heaven battling city is closed to the outside world, no one will come to investigate. ""Alright," he said.The few of them discussed for a while and soon, they began to prepare.City Lord seal, defensive formation, activating the city core ...With all kinds of preparations, such a giant city consumed a lot of energy each time it was activated. Only Li Hao had excavated a large star Mine. Otherwise, heaven battling city wouldn't have been able to be activated.He prepared for a day.On the second day, a loud sound reverberated in all directions, and the huge city was rapidly compressed.In the sky, Li Hao opened a crack, his expression grave. This was his first time teleporting an ancient city ... He was under great pressure, but if he succeeded, the result would be completely different!The Dao universe didn't limit one's strength.It was equivalent to bringing a large city with him to battle!Moreover, with the large city standing, the entire bright star sector had its coordinates and could suppress powerful enemies, which added an extremely powerful line of defense to the bright star sector.At this moment, heaven and earth trembled.The city slowly floated up and entered the void.……At the same time.In the other ancient cities.At this moment, they were all trembling slightly, but the movement was very small.Soon, a huge suction force came from boundless city.In some of the ancient cities, someone cursed,""Boundless city ... What the hell is going on? "If this devouring continues, I won't even be able to think about a second recovery. What's going on?""Here we go again ... Why don't we just devour the energy as well? let's not revive and wait in the main city for the rest of our lives ...""Has boundless city completely cut off all contact with us? I feel that the remnants of the great cosmos formation seem to have been completely shattered ...""Who knows?"“……”In the ancient cities, some people cursed, some felt helpless, and some felt sad.At the same time.In Feng city.Red dust frowned slightly and looked up into the void. He was a little confused. Was boundless city absorbing energy again causing the eight major cities to tremble?But ... He had only absorbed it once before in boundless city.The second resuscitation had been interrupted by Li Hao.Now that it was resuscitated ... For Li Hao, it would instead draw out the energy of the world, causing the world to become even more fragile. This would not be a good thing for the training of the entire Silvermoon people.Li Hao, what is he doing?In his heart, he felt slightly uneasy.At this moment, someone quickly came to report,"my Lord, the great desolate King seems to be in conflict with the desolate beasts. The desolate beasts have started to invade the eastern continent ... What should we do now?""Did they take the initiative to invade?"Red dust put aside his uneasiness and smiled.""Continue to come into contact with the great desolate King ... And also give the desolate beasts some pressure ... Of course, the most important thing is to detect where the will of chaos is ... And grasp the absolute initiative! We can stop the invasion of the great wilderness at any time and destroy the chaos!""Yes!"The person left quickly.As for Hong Chen, he fell silent again. After a long time, he muttered,""Everything is going according to my plan, but why ... Am I feeling more and more uneasy?"Why did it turn out like this?On Li Hao's side, although he had taken down boundless city and killed Zheng Gong, it was said that he had suffered heavy losses as well. This was only natural. That day, Zhang an had been with him. Without Zhang an's help, if Li Hao wanted to kill Zheng Gong and the others, he would have suffered heavy losses.Then why was he still so worried?Or rather, the uneasiness didn't come from Li Hao, but from someone else?Who was it?The sealed venerable sovereign of Hong Yue?Or ... Some people from sword city? Or could it be someone from another ancient city?However, those guys had only just recovered and their strength was limited. He knew them very well. These people shouldn't be able to cause him too much trouble.……At this moment, Hong Chen felt uneasy.At this moment, Ying Hongyue's expression was not too good either. The three major organizations and the clear sky divine mountain had sent tens of thousands of supers to the Li Dynasty, but at this moment, there were only a few thousand people following her.He thought that he had been extremely careful, but ... He had still suffered heavy losses in the Li Dynasty!Since Qian Wuliang came to this place, he had suffered many setbacks.At this moment, he saw the grey Mountain in front of him. From the North to the West, he just had to walk along the grey Mountain. He didn't need to cross it.However, Ying Hongyue once again felt a great sense of danger.Beside her, the Yama had already lost control and was irritable. When he saw Ying Hongyue stop in her tracks, he gritted his teeth."What are you doing? Weren't they going to the West? Let's go! F * ck, if you stay any longer, I'll lose all my Yama members!""Don't be impatient ...""What do you mean?"The Yama was furious."I've been chased by someone. That pretty boy is extremely detestable. You can't kill him ... If you ask me, I'd fight him to the death. Can you really not kill him?" Or are you going to hide something and wait until we're all dead before you fight?"Ying Hongyue immediately frowned. This wasn't a good sign.Previously, the leaders would not question his decision.But now ... Yama was extremely irascible, while flying sword immortal and vast sky Mountain's Mountain Lord didn't say a word. Clearly, they'd had enough of such days. They'd been running here and there, and had suffered countless casualties!He looked towards the Cang mountains, as if he wanted to see something, and his expression became more serious.Was it Qian Wuliang who was chasing after him, or ... Was it Li Hao who had been watching him? he felt that Li Hao had never given up on the idea of killing him, but he didn't come in person because he might know something.Qian Wuliang knew that he was going to the West to seek an opportunity, so did Li Hao...Also observe him in secret?The little guy who was targeted by the members of the red moon organization in the Silver City seemed to be getting more and more profound.In his heart, there was some uneasiness and anxiety, and even some indescribable fear.At this moment ... He seemed to have understood something. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Was everything going to be returned?Li Hao from the silver Blizzard city must have felt the same way.It was as if there was someone staring at him all the time, threatening his life. With every step he took, there was someone who arranged how he should go. The people around him died one by one, panicking and waiting for death to come!And now, such emotions seemed to be emerging in his mind!But ... It seemed like he couldn't resist it.The only way was to risk his life. However, Yan Luo had put it simply. If he risked his life and the seal broke, it would not only be Li Hao's problem, but also his. He would be the first to suffer!As for Li Hao ... It was said that Yuan Shuo had died!His heart ached in an inexplicable fear. With Yuan Shuo's death, Li Hao had no more worries. Now that the seal was broken, was Li Hao ... Really that worried and scared?And now, the seal was not broken. It was him, yueshen, the world of mortals, and everyone else who had to hold onto the bottom line!And this bottom line did not belong to Li Hao! How laughable!"Killing Yuan Shuo ... Was their stupidest decision!" Ying Hongyue muttered.The few of them looked at him in surprise. Who was he talking about?Ying Hongyue didn't say anything else. She said in a low voice, "Let's go! Be careful! Qian Wuliang might try to stop us. We have to be careful, especially Yama and the other three!"After saying that, he transmitted his voice,'don't linger in the battle. Run when you need to. As long as you're alive, there's hope!' "Even if we leave all our troops behind ... As long as we are still here, we will have a chance. Do not let the other party seize this opportunity! Li Hao has already lost control. Someone has released his demon. Damn it!"The few of them were speechless!What did it have to do with Li Hao?F * ck, it's Qian Wuliang and the Li Dynasty king who are chasing after us. Ying Hongyue, that B * stard, is she so angry that Li Hao didn't come here at all?Ying Hongyue didn't say anything more.It was Li Hao!At this moment, he had many thoughts in his mind. Going to the West to find the moon goddess, perhaps ... That would be something Li Hao would be happy to see. He might not be in trouble, but the people around him might die.Does he want me to experience fear, loneliness, and betrayal?Li Hao, you won't succeed!

Bright star sector.The universe shook, and the great Dao was somewhat repulsed.Li Hao roared. Like a giant that opened the sky, he supported the city with one hand and madly expanded his body, lifting the city into the bright star sector.Lightning instantly struck everywhere!It seemed that Li Hao's actions had displeased the great Dao.Normally, it was fine to transport a few people in, but today, they had directly transported a large city in. This was simply intolerable for the great path universe. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  From all directions, stars gathered.From some distant areas, stars flickered and flew over.Some stars that Li Hao had never seen before also quickly floated over and unleashed the power of great DAOs, as if they were going to suppress them, the ancient city, and the world!This was the first time the universe of the great path had exploded without the power of the Crimson Moon.Li Hao's expression was grave.Even though he had some guesses, he still felt helpless when he saw that the Dao universe had really started to target him.Thunder and lightning struck!Li Hao rose into the air and shattered the Thunderbolt with a punch. The next moment, more Thunderbolts swept over. Li Hao shattered the Thunderbolts and absorbed the power of the great Dao. Normally, he liked to fleece people.But today...He was worried that there would be too many Thunderbolts and he would be struck to death by the great Dao Thunderbolts.He looked powerful, but in reality, he was only a cultivator with 36 paths.Compared to the entire Dao universe ... It was still not worth mentioning.The lightning kept striking Li Hao.Li Hao's eyes flickered. The next moment, he roared,""Heaven-battling Army!""Here!"Below, tens of thousands of heaven-battling Army soldiers shouted!"Do you dare to fight the heavens?""Zhan Tian!"His roar shook the heavens and earth!"Open the Dao meridians in your body, face the lightning of the great Dao, absorb the power of the great Dao, and today ... Fight the heavens!""Zhan Tian!"His roar resounded through the world.In the next moment, tens of thousands of soldiers and several golden-armored experts rose into the sky.In his body, the Dao Meridian began to activate.Not many people had recovered their physical bodies, only a few thousand.The other heaven-battling Army members had not recovered their physical bodies.However, at this moment, it still soared into the sky, just like in the past when it dared to wave its sword at the heaven and earth!Lightning burst!Boom! Boom! Boom!"Get into formation!""Welcome the enemy!""Fight, fight, fight!"Several Masters shouted. For countless years, the heaven-battling Army had no enemies to fight and was trapped in a Lonely City. Today, they could fight against the heavens and the Thunder of the great path. Their fighting will burst out one by one, and their killing intent shook the sky. In the ancient city, several Saints stood in the air with grave expressions.Guardian turtle sighed and did not say a word.Activating his Dao Meridian, changing to a new Dao, and fighting the heavenly Dao with Li Hao ... To the low-level soldiers, all of this was enough. Their new commander seemed to be a good choice.For soldiers, no matter how much they were unhappy or disdainful, after a great battle, they would become good comrades. If they gained some benefits and activated their Dao meridians, they would become stronger and invincible. They would then become Li Hao's men.It was such a realistic situation!Moreover, Li Hao's position as army commander had been given to him by heaven battling city, and it had been justified, not taken by force.At this moment, the old turtle understood that heaven battling city ... Had changed its name after Li Hao's several changes, whether intentionally or not. At the very least, heaven battling Army had changed their last name!'Wu Peng ... This bastard, why did he betray us?'The old turtle's heart was bleeding!If he hadn't betrayed the Army, Li Hao wouldn't have stood a chance.BOOM!Just as it was lost in its thoughts, tens of thousands of heaven-battling Army soldiers waved their swords and slashed the sky!The great path Thunder shattered, and the power of the great path gushed in. The military formation was activated, and the power of the great path and the power of the new path were rapidly absorbed into the bodies of the soldiers. These soldiers did not have any origin aura.The so-called origin, even in neo martial arts, was something that happened after rank-9, when they were at the peak.As for the ordinary soldiers, not many of them could reach that level.,m It was actually very simple to change to a new Dao.Director Wang and the others were in a difficult position because they had to protect the great Dao of origins and continue the great Dao in case they really had to start all over again.At this moment, the heaven-battling Army soldiers quickly opened their aperture acupoints.The method of opening apertures had also been taught through the armor.A few Gold Division commanders also faced the lightning head-on. It was difficult for them to change their auras, but as their soldiers changed their auras one after another, the targeting of the great Dao on them seemed to have weakened in an instant.Because they were all people of the new Dao!There was no reason for the great Dao to kill those who developed the new Dao.The new Dao was the people of the great Dao.Li Hao absorbed a large amount of great Dao power. At this moment, as the last aperture was opened, the 36 Dao meridians in his body completed a cycle.The 36 Dao meridians were a basic cycle.It was also the most basic circulation system.At this moment, when the 36 meridians were completely connected, an invisible force enveloped Li Hao. The next moment, the 36 meridians condensed into a small sword. It was not as powerful as the 360 meridians, but it was a dagger-like sword.Li Hao's body also began to transform.White Dao meridians appeared near his physical body's Dao meridians once again.At that moment, he actually triggered the other physical Dao meridians.Sure enough!He had more than one physical Dao Meridian.As Li Hao completed the first cycle, three more physical Dao meridians appeared. In addition to the previous one, he had four in total.The physical body's Dao meridians were actually very easy to identify.It was filled with a white liquid.Previously, a large amount of white liquid had appeared when he opened up a Dao Meridian to strengthen his body. According to Nan Quan and the others, this was the origin power of life.

2084 Chapter 353
At this moment, Li Hao smiled brightly and roared again,""Attack! Gather the lightning of the great Dao, strengthen myself, and battle the heavens and earth again!""Fight!"Everyone began to roar. It had been too many years. Even if the enemy in front of them was not a real person, but just a bolt of lightning, they were still ecstatic and roaring!Like a tiger out of its cage!At this moment, even the commanders, including the eighth division commander, were roaring and chasing the Thunder of the great path. Tens of thousands of soldiers were fighting against the heaven and earth.The lightning was extinguished, and the great Dao retreated.Stars appeared all around him. Although they weren't very bright, Li Hao knew that these newcomers had new Dao meridians. The heaven battling Army ... Some of them had already activated their Dao meridians.The lightning that had struck the ancient city had mostly dissipated.​ The great planets around them seemed to be retreating into the depths of the universe. Li Hao shouted,""Capture the stars, pluck the stars and moon, gather in one place, pluck the stars with your hands to raise the might of our Army!"Capture the stars!As soon as these words came out, all the soldiers were overjoyed. What a good 'picking stars and moon'!In fact ... Li Hao only asked them to help move the goods.It was too tiring to be alone.This time, so many people had come. It just so happened that these stars had appeared from the depths of the universe. They could be captured and stuffed into their own great Dao circulation system to perfect their own great Dao River.Of course, he couldn't say that to the soldiers. He had to say that he could pluck the stars and grab the moon!In an instant, tens of thousands of soldiers rushed out and formed huge divine weapon nets to capture those stars. The military naturally had ways to deal with these things.The stars were quickly captured.Li Hao's voice rang out again."Move the stars and set up the star formation. Distinguish the stars by their colors. Fix the stars of the corresponding colors by force and stuff them into the river of Dao. Set up the formation of Dao!""Yes!"Everyone was still excited.However, a few powerhouses could not help but curse when they saw the clues!艹!Li Hao was not a human.The soldiers of the heaven-battling Army were treated as porters, but they didn't feel bad about it. They were all very excited. They felt that having a great battle, picking the stars and moon, fighting against the universe, and erupting in the chaos was simply a dream.As a defense Legion, it had been too many years since they had participated in such a battle. Fighting in the universe, fighting against the great Dao ... It sounded so exciting.One by one, the soldiers plucked the stars and moon, captured the stars, and returned them to their positions.The ring-shaped River of Dao was originally sparse, but at this moment, it was gradually filled with energy, and even its brightness was stronger than before.  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  In the next moment, Li Hao looked back at the crowd and said,""Release the great battle heaven city!"Guardian turtle and the others did not say much. In an instant, they burned a large number of energy stones, and the ancient city instantly expanded countless times!"General!" Li Hao shouted again."Soldiers, let's support heaven battling city and occupy the center of the universe. Heaven battling city will be the number one city in the new Dao universe! From now on, the title of number one city in the bright star sector belongs to Zhan Tian!""Zhan Tian!"The soldiers were so excited that they almost went crazy.We, Zhan Tian, have occupied the great Dao universe. The few Saints were all silent.It's finished!The heaven-battling Army ... Had been tricked and crippled by Li Hao.Tens of thousands of soldiers returned one after another, their blood boiling. They raised their hands to the sky, and the city floated in the air. Li Hao, wearing orange armor, waved his arm."Advance!""Advance!"BOOM!Tens of thousands of soldiers 'qi and blood shook the sky. The city floated in the air as they advanced toward the center of the galaxy.……In the ancient city.Li Fuhai couldn't help but transmit his voice,""This ... I don't know how the war is going, but you're good at stimulating morale. We haven't even met the enemy yet, but the heaven-battling Army seems to be on drugs."At such a young age, Li Hao's military formation was probably average. In large-scale battles, he had probably only fought with the Li Dynasty's Army a few times, and not all of them had been deployed.However, it had to be said that ... Educated people were indeed different. At the very least, their slogans were first-class.It's just moving a city, yet you're making your blood boil.In fact ... This giant city was moving forward by itself. Did he really expect tens of thousands of soldiers to move this giant city?Maybe he could ... But that would take forever!A giant city that could hold 50 million people was not something that tens of thousands of soldiers who had not reached the peak could easily move.Guardian turtle didn't say anything, and general Huai didn't say anything either.The ninth Division commander had already led the Army to move the city ... For a while, no one responded. It was Hong Mu who saw this and immediately sent a message,""Your Excellency Sea Guardian is wrong. No matter how big or small the matter is, the heaven-battling Army is full of fighting spirit. The Marquis is a good leader ..."“……”Li Fuhai looked at Sequoia and said,""Shanqi, be it a monster plant or a monster beast, they are all monsters!"Do you understand?Don't target me!We're all demons, and we have to fight with humans!This blockhead seemed to have the intention of competing with him, which was not good.Today, Li Hao had subdued heaven battling city, had the battle strength of a Saint, controlled a great path universe, and constantly perfected new paths. It could be said that Li Hao's Foundation had been formed.And it was said that Li Hao was not alone.There were many suns and moons in the Silver Moon.The sun and the moon both represented stepping into the peak.At the middle stage of the sun Moon realm, he had the battle power of an undying. Even though he might not be able to fight against a Saint at the late stage, he was still between undying and Saint.Now, Li Hao's wings were fully grown.The eight ancient cities had been destroyed, zhantian was in the pot, and sword city was sealed. Without the Zheng family, the other five cities would not be Li Hao's match.

2085 Chapter 353
At this moment, Li Hao was already showing signs of unifying the world.A Heavenly King could also fight!However, venerable sovereigns were no match for them.The huge city was gradually moved to the center of the galaxy. With a boom, the city stood in the universe. At this moment, a golden passage merged into the ancient city."Where's the Yao Zhi Army?"Li Hao shouted again."Here!"Dozens of monster plants appeared one after another."Defend this place, day and night, extract the power of the great Dao, and solidify this place! Pour in the spring of life, strengthen the channel, and set up a sealing formation. If anyone tries to force their way in, kill them!""Yes!"The monster plants were also extremely excited. They finally had something to do. Although they were only guarding the passage, it didn't look simple.At the same time, Li Hao said,""The power of the stars, Yao plant Army, you can try to extract the power of various regions and gather it here to solidify the channel and merge the entire Galaxy into one!"He wanted these monster plants to extend their roots into the Galaxy and extract the power of the great Dao from different areas to strengthen their physical body and divine power.As for whether it would work or not ... He would know after trying. In this way, there would be a connection between the scattered galaxies.The monster plants had no objections.Although they didn't cultivate new DAOs, extracting the power of a great Dao didn't necessarily mean failure. Demonic plants were very complex, and any power could make them grow. They were just used to their essences.In the next moment, countless roots spread out, covering the void. Each crystal-clear root pierced through the sky and earth, spreading to various major areas in the distance. The entire heaven battling city was like the center of the sky and earth, and at this moment, a circular Galaxy gradually took shape.The few Saints saw this and felt weird.What was this?They didn't know!However, they knew one thing. With the existence of heaven battling city and the 48 monster plants guarding the passage, they had set up a monster plant protection sealing formation. Even if a Heavenly King really broke in, they could at least block the Heavenly King for a while, even if they didn't directly suppress him.Li Hao looked around and nodded slightly."He's good at defense, but not good at offense ..."This was a problem.Whether it was humans or demons, the defensive power of the formation they had set up was still very strong. However, their offensive power and destructive power were still lacking.  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  There weren't many undyings in the city.Now, it seemed that Silver Moon actually had a lot of undying.At the 4th level of the sun Moon stage, he had undying energy.Moreover, they were all cultivating new DAOs. Li Hao had been busy with these things for the past few days, but he could still see some people from the bright star sector. The people from the light sword sect were probably close to the middle stage of the sun Moon realm.Putting aside the peak and middle-tier combatants, Silver Moon was actually rapidly catching up to neo martial.A group of people with innate Dao bodies could actually cultivate very quickly in the new era, when new DAOs were born.As for the new martial artists, they had lost their universe of origin and had been sealed for many years. They had been silent for many years. Other than those traitors, they had not recovered quickly. Even if they were traitors, their cultivation speed was very slow without the great Dao of origin.Without the immortal energy and Origin Energy, it was actually very difficult to advance.Li Hao thought to himself that a neo martial artist didn't seem that scary anymore.When the Silvermoon people reached the late stage of Sun Moon ... By then, even a Sage level neo martial artist would not be so terrifying.Of course, only those at the ninth level of the sun Moon tier might be able to fight a Sage level expert ... Even if there was a high chance of losing, it didn't matter.Li Hao didn't give any more instructions. The power of the great DAOs in his body erupted, and the three newly discovered great DAOs of the physical body were quickly penetrated and activated. The next moment, three giant Dragons flew through the void and quickly merged into the channel.In his body, he still only had 36 opened Dao meridians.At this moment, Li Hao had no other divine power Dao meridians.They were either given away or integrated into the passage.However, the power was still there.However, he looked more like an ordinary person because he had no attribute Dao meridians. However, his sword intent was still abundant.Recently, Li Hao didn't seem to have become much stronger. He had only activated a few Dao meridians. In fact, Li Hao felt that he had been completing the repair and sorting out of the entire Dao system recently, and it was quite fruitful.The power in his body was no longer mixed.Instead, it was extremely pure!There were fewer fancy methods, and more of them turned into a kind of purity.The expansion of the Galaxy would be of great help to his future cultivation.Compared to the battle at borderless city, Li Hao's number of Dao meridians had not increased by much. However, Li Hao felt that if he were to meet Han Jiang again, he would not be suppressed by him all the time. He would have to wait until the last moment to counterattack.If he had such strength back then, Han Jiang ... Could have easily killed him!,m His physical body also grew stronger at a speed visible to the naked eye.In his body, 360 Dao meridians appeared. However, only one aperture had been opened for the other 324 Dao meridians. Li Hao's next step was to open the second big circulation.However, he didn't have the time to do that. The guy in star suppression city might be on guard now. He had to be careful and finish him off as soon as possible.After a short rest, Li Hao opened his eyes and landed in the center of the ancient city.He looked at the others and said,"you can split your clones. Just make them slightly weaker. Heaven battling city is here, and I can enter at any time. You can come with me to see fellow Daoist Yu Hai!"

That person called himself Yu Hai. He didn't have to say anything, but ... Li Hao had planned for a long time to kill him.The few of them looked at each other and did not say anything.Soon, many clones appeared. They were not too strong.As for Li Hao, he made a grabbing motion with his hand, and Origin Energy appeared. In the next moment, an orange suit of armor appeared, and a moment later, Wu Peng's appearance was revealed.The few of them felt their teeth hurt.He was really going to impersonate Wu Peng!As for Li Hao's main body, he had lost his armor and changed into a green robe. He smiled brightly. "That's about it. What needs to be planned, what needs to be prepared, has all been done! If you still can't kill this person ... Then it can only be said that it's not a crime of fighting!"After saying this much, he turned around and glanced at the gate of heaven battling city before quickly disappearing.A moment later, the two characters were put into Li Hao's bag like two heavy mountains. Li Hao gasped for breath, then put the two characters into his mind. In the blink of an eye, the two characters disappeared.The turtle Guardian and the others had a splitting headache!This was what he had agreed to before!However, when they saw Li Hao take away these two words ... Everyone was still somewhat sad. Heaven battling city ... Would be surnamed li in the future.It was just a cooperation ... Why did it suddenly turn out like this?He really didn't expect this at all!"Let's go, you guys! If a war were to break out ... In short, everyone just had to adapt to the situation! One might be a Heavenly King, or even not an ordinary Heavenly King. It's not that easy to deal with, but once we succeed and kill a Heavenly King ... Everyone will be full!"No one said anything. In the next moment, several clones, including Li Hao's own clone, followed Li Hao and disappeared into the tunnel.……- Eastern continent-There were fewer guards around Star Town City.Even more experts went to the great wilderness in the East. The great wilderness had invaded recently, and there were already signs of a war. All the vicerooms were leading their troops over from all directions.Sky sword, BA Dao, and the other experts who suppressed the various regions were all gathering toward the east.In the ruins of Star Town City, a small tree was standing on the top of the mountain and looking into the distance.The great wilderness ... Had invaded!Or rather, the dire beasts had invaded.At this moment, a face appeared on the small tree. It looked at the end of the East and fell into deep thought. The great wilderness invaded, the desolate beasts invaded, and turned this place into chaos ... Could he come out now?Chaos, cutting heaven and earth!If he appeared, would he not be restricted by Silver Moon?This was a good thing.  As he thought of this, he thought of Li Hao, who had disappeared for several days. Then Li Hao ... What was he doing now?Was he just going to leave her alone?Or ... Had she been planning how to deal with him these days?Thinking about it in his heart, he didn't fear anything.During this period ... He would be an invincible existence.No matter how strong Li Hao was, he couldn't be a match for him. Even if he brought a few powerhouses from the main cities, they wouldn't be able to do anything to him. Besides, he was here, and those people couldn't come.Even if they came ... It didn't matter.While he was thinking, the void suddenly rippled. Li Hao, whom he had not seen for days, appeared. Not only that, but he was also accompanied by several origin clones.Upon seeing these clones, the figure in the small tree had a thought.Li Hao did have some face.They were the old turtle of heaven battling city, general Huai, and the sea-suppressing envoy of the Silvermoon sea-suppressing Prefecture. They were All Saints!Had this person been looking for them these past few days?And that armored warrior ... This is ... Wu Peng from the heaven battling Army, right?That would be Four Saints!No wonder Li Hao had disappeared for several days. It turned out that he had gone to find these people. He must have paid a great price to persuade them, right?However, it was only a clone!"Senior Yu Hai!"Li Hao took the lead, stepping on the air with a brilliant smile."Senior asked me to find the people of the eight great families. I'm not familiar with the other ancient cities, so it's not easy to find them. However, the seniors of heaven battling city and the sea Guardian were very excited when they learned that senior Yu Hai was still alive and insisted on coming with me ..."At this moment, general Huai's clone took the initiative to speak,""Yu Hai? Aren't you in the Shen family's residence in Star Town City? Why would he appear in the land of Silver Moon?"At this moment, a helpless face appeared on the small tree and repeated what he had told Li Hao.  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  Li Fuhai's clone seemed a little simple and honest.""So that's how it is. It's actually His Majesty the human King's backup plan ...""Who knows if it's true?""Wu Peng" said coldly,"don't rashly believe such words! Yu Hai was the vice-captain of the Shen family's guards and had participated in the war in the early stage of the neo martial arts. How could he leave the Shen family so rashly? Moreover ... He was only at the peak of the Saint realm. Was the person His Majesty the human King had prepared only a peak of the Saint realm? In order to resist the red moon, even if they don't have venerable sovereigns, they should at least have a Heavenly King, right?""Heavenly King," Yu Hai explained,"this will attract the attention of the venerable Swordmaster. The venerable Swordmaster doesn't want others to interfere with the Silver Moon ..."The old turtle smiled brightly and said,"commander Wu, don't doubt a comrade!" And he was a senior at the early stage of neo martial realm! I'm more curious about what you've found that can solve the threat of a venerable sovereign. Little friend li came to us and told us everything. We couldn't believe it. Who would have the means to get rid of a venerable sovereign just by leaving behind some things? This ... Is what we are curious about!"Yu Hai hesitated."We can't talk about it here ... It's easy for the Heaven's Will to spy on us. And the Heaven's Will has been invaded by the red moon sovereign. If you really want to know, you can enter the city and find out."

"Hmph!""Hmph!""Wu Peng" snorted coldly."You're at the peak of the Saint realm, and we're only avatars. If you enter rashly and have any ill intentions, won't we all be annihilated?" It's hard for us to come out with our true bodies, and the loss of our avatars is also difficult to bear. There's nothing we can't tell others! What's there to worry about?"“……”They echoed each other, and Li Hao said,""Senior, I've found the person for you. The problem now is that great desolation is invading ... Previously, senior said that once great desolation invades this place ... Senior can help me deal with the desolate beasts. Is that true?"Li Hao's smile disappeared. He looked to the East and frowned."There are Saints in the wild beasts, and there's more than one of them! I think I'm not weak. I can even ... Fight Saints!"Yu Hai's heart trembled!Was Li Hao, who could rival Saints, really that powerful?It was too fast!Li Hao, on the other hand, seemed to have nothing to worry about. He said in a deep voice,""Senior, let's not talk about the venerable sovereigns first. I have an idea, let's let the wild beasts invade here! I can pin down a divine desolate beast ... Then, senior ... Can you help me kill the other divine desolate beasts? These dire beasts are truly detestable!"Yu Hai's mind was racing.Kill the wild beasts ... Revive the second time ... But we have to destroy chaos first.Only when the dire beasts invaded this area could he move freely.All sorts of thoughts flashed through his mind, and he quickly said,""Of course, it's my duty! "The dire beasts invaded the Silver Moon to invade the new martial world. I can't move now and can't enter or leave. If the other party comes here ... I can kill them! It's just that ... I only have the battle strength of the divine path. If there are too many of them, I'm afraid it'll be difficult. Do you know how many divine path desolate beasts there are on the wild beast side? I'm at the peak of the Holy Dao, and I can fight two or three of them ... But I'm afraid it'll be difficult to fight more than that!"Li Hao shook his head,"I don't know yet!" He could only go and investigate and see the situation. "Also, the dire beasts have evolved much more than before. They can actually use neo martial combat techniques, which is extremely terrifying ...""Wild beasts can use neo martial combat techniques?"When these words were said, not only Yu Hai, but the others were also baffled. How was this possible? The two were not in the same system!Li Hao was also having a headache."I don't know why it's like this either ... Moreover, desolate beasts that can use neo martial combat techniques can even transform into humans. It's said that desolate beasts can't transform into humans!"Everyone was very surprised!The old turtle and the others are really strange. Are you ... Serious?We didn't even know about this!  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  Li Hao, are you trying to fool me again?But what was the point of saying that?Yu Hai also found it extremely strange."A desolate beast that has transformed into a human ... And also knows neo martial combat techniques. This ... My young friend, did you recognize the wrong person?" he thought. Could it be that the humans of the new martial era only move around in the wild beast area?"Li Hao shook his head and said,"I'm not sure, but it's highly unlikely!" I can tell that the desolate beasts and those humanoid desolate beasts have a close relationship ... However, we still need to investigate a little more before we can find out. "Li Hao said solemnly,"these guys are very difficult to deal with. If I let them spread to this side, which is the core of the eastern continent, it means that I've lost half of the eastern continent. If you can't defeat them, I might lose the entire Eastern continent!" After saying that, he looked at the others and said, "It's a pity that seniors 'true bodies can't appear. Otherwise ... If necessary, could senior Yu Hai ... Could he use that special treasure or technique to help us kill these desolate beasts?""This ...""At the moment, we can't use this method," Yu Hai said hesitantly."Like this?"Li Hao frowned."That's troublesome. I think there are more than two or three desolate beasts on the desolate beast side ... No matter what, I'll have to trouble you this time. Seniors, please have a chat here. I'll go to the vast wilderness to investigate!""Little friend ... Don't you want to come in and sit?""This is an urgent matter. Let's talk about it after we've settled Da Huang!""Seniors, please continue chatting. I'll head to the vast wilderness first!" Li Hao cupped his fists.Then, without waiting for the others to say anything, he disappeared from the spot."He's rather impatient!"The old turtle chuckled,"if he doesn't come, let's go in and have a chat. There's no need to rush. If something needs the eight great families to join forces, then we'll wait until the matter of the great wilderness is over before we go find it ... But ... The Zheng family might have betrayed the eight great families, so we might not be able to gather enough of them.""I've heard about this before. Sigh, the Zheng family is from Star Town City ... I didn't expect ..."Yu Hai didn't say much and said,""My fellow Daoists, please!"After saying that, a circle of light appeared.Yu Hai glanced in the direction Li Hao had left in and felt a little regretful. Li Hao ... Was he unwilling to enter? was he suspecting something, or was he really too anxious?These few people were only clones.And extremely weak!He said that the death of his clone was a great loss, but in reality, he saw it with his eyes and cursed in his heart. Each and every one of them, did their clones have the strength of a seventh or eighth grade?He had never seen such a weak clone!From the looks of it, they were also very suspicious of him, and their vigilance was extremely strong.Such a weak clone would be a burden even if he were to kill it.The avatars of these people were probably only here to test the authenticity.And Li Hao didn't tell the truth.This person was blessed by heaven's will and even some great Dao. If he really had the intention, perhaps ... He could bring a neo martial artist's main body here. This was his own judgment.The possibility was very high!

Now, he could only cast a long line to catch the big fish. If he could transport a saint's true body ... That would be a good thing. If not, he would have to wait for the great wilderness to invade this place before thinking of a way.Also, have the other main cities been destroyed?Why didn't he see any experts from the other main cities traveling around the world?Although there were restrictions in this world, there were not many restrictions on the avatars of the weak. The great wilderness was about to invade, so why was there no neo martial expert avatar to investigate?It was really ... Incomprehensible!Don't you care?Or has it not recovered?That shouldn't be!……At the same time.Aside from Star River City, martial Union, and the other ancient cities, other than the Hong family's ancient city, whose location had yet to be revealed, and the missing Hurricane city, the other ancient cities all had people guarding them.Outside of martial Union, the seventh elder's clone was slightly angered. He looked at the thousands of Demon Hunter guards and Liu Yan, and said in a slightly angry tone,"My martial Union has already formed an alliance with Heavenly Star. Why won't you allow our avatars to enter? No one has ever dared to limit neo martial, and no one can limit neo martial!"Liu Yan was wearing a silver battle armor, and her aura shook the heavens and the earth. The power of the sun and the moon was revealed, and the water surged. Behind her, the water gathered around thousands of soldiers.Liu Yan's voice was cold and indifferent. She no longer had the flirtatiousness of the past, but instead carried an icy intent."The Marquis has ordered that the people who betrayed new martial arts in the past are hiding in various major cities. In order to be safe, I ask all seniors to be patient. The Marquis is currently tracking down the people who betrayed us. Once the list of traitors is found ... The Marquis will definitely personally apologize to all seniors. Before that ... No one is allowed to enter or leave. Those who disobey the order ... Will be killed without mercy!""Kill!"Behind them, almost all of the thousands of soldiers had stepped into the thousand-warrior level. There were even many mountains and seas. In an instant, their auras surged.The seventh elder's expression changed slightly.He didn't expect that this group of people would have such power in such a short time."Are you suspecting that there are traitors in martial Union?" Shi Feng asked, slightly enraged."Not bad!""Anything is possible!" Liu Yan replied coldly. "Everything Lord Marquis has done is for everyone's good. For the sake of peace, why should the Alliance continue? could it be ... That martial Union is going to break the Alliance? If that's the case ... The heavens will punish him!"The seventh elder was extremely furious!How aggrieved!  please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  If I can walk out, I'll kill you with one slap!Although the sun Moon was strong, it was only at the peak.His original body was ranked low among the nine great elders, but he was still at the peak of immortal realm. However, the world was getting weaker and weaker, and his clone wasn't even as strong as last time.Li Hao's side had sealed off the ancient city. Their attitude was completely different from last time.Before this, the experts of the ancient cities could still enter and leave freely.Now, communication was impossible. The base station had probably been taken away by Li Hao. No one would dare to come here rashly, even if they had trained some people before.Just as the seventh elder was getting angry, another shadow appeared on the ground."Second elder!"The seventh elder quickly called out. In the city, the second elder was the one in charge. He didn't expect the second elder's clone to come out.At this moment, the illusionary figure softly said,""General ... Martial Union does not wish to have any conflict with Governor li. However, right now ... The main city is in turmoil, and I'm afraid that an unforeseen event has occurred. All of our sources of information have been sealed off. I wonder if general can give us some information?""Greetings, senior!" Liu Yan said calmly. We don't know the specific situation! All they knew was that the Zheng family of boundless city was probably the main force of the traitors. They had wanted to revive the world by killing a large number of powerful cultivators, but the Marquis saw through their plan. After that, boundless city suddenly disappeared and activated the city. In recent days, they had disappeared without a trace, and the Marquis was tracking them down ... Not only that, it was said that Hurricane city had disappeared as well. To be able to activate a main city, the Marquis suspected that there was a completely revived peerless powerful cultivator in the city. That was why the Marquis was worried that similar situations would occur in other main cities. That's why we're in charge of the various places, just in case!"As soon as he said this, the second elder's expression changed, and the seventh elder was also a little shocked.""You're saying that both boundless city and Hurricane city have disappeared?""Right!"Liu Yan nodded and said,"now, the Marquis is worried about the Zhou clan's star River City. Will there be any changes?" After all, they all came from star suppression city! In truth, the Marquis already had complete trust in martial Union. He only allowed us to hold the fort. As for the other places, there were thousands of the Wei Wu Army stationed there. They would not allow any of their clones to enter. If they dared to leave, they would be killed immediately! Seniors ... This is also a helpless move!" The two elders gasped. The two main cities had disappeared.No wonder!It was no wonder that there had been so much movement recently. It felt strange, and even the last connection seemed to have been cut off, as if it had completely disappeared. No wonder Li Hao, who had been easy to talk to, had sent people to forcibly suppress the main cities and not allow the experts of the main cities to enter.If the three main cities really betrayed them ... The consequences would be unimaginable!"In addition, the Marquis asked me to pass on a message to all the seniors. Be careful of any changes in the city. The bandits have already invaded the major cities, and I heard that even heaven battling city has been affected. Don't trust anyone so easily ..." Liu Yan continued.The seventh elder couldn't help but say unhappily,""Be careful with your words! As soon as these words came out, everyone was in danger. How could I, a fellow neo martial artist,...""This is the Duke's will. Whether you believe it or not is up to you!" Liu Yan interrupted. It was better for everyone to be in danger than to be ignorant! If not for martial Union and heavenstar forming an alliance, I would never have said such words!"

2089 Chapter 353
After saying that, he added,"I don't care if you seniors believe me or not!" Before Lord Marquis's order is given, not a single person from martial Union is allowed to step out. Otherwise ... Don't blame heavenstar for being rude! For the sake of heavenstar, for the Silver Moon, for the entire human race ... Seniors, if you can bear with it, then bear with it. If you really can 't, Lord Marquis has also issued an order ... To be polite before resorting to force. If you dare to trespass, you will become an enemy of heavenstar and will fight to the death!"The seventh elder even suspected that this person was faking Li Hao's order.He had met Li Hao before.The last time they met, he was very easy to talk to. He was gentle and refined, and his conditions were also discussed. He looked like a gentle person. How could Li Hao say such words?I don't believe it!This was too overbearing!They were used to being overbearing towards their enemies, but this was the first time they had seen someone being so overbearing towards themselves.Liu Yan didn't care about them. She just kept staring at them. In fact ... There was even a hint of provocation in her eyes.Kill these people!A flame was burning in her heart, but she didn't say it to anyone. As long as these people dared to step out of her range, she would quickly kill their clones and break the peace. Then, when the Marquis had time, he would destroy the ancient city!If they could destroy boundless city, they could also destroy martial Union!I've already said it, but these people won't listen. I can't do anything about it.When the Demon Hunter Guards Army was formed, she and a few others became the commander of the Demon Hunter Guards Army. When Yuan Shuo, Liu Long, and the others disappeared, she actually understood everything.Endless city was finally under their control!Would it be that easy to take down an ancient city?So ... Was there a need to guess?What mission? Liu Yan knew that she would probably never see those people again in her life.She endured the pain and never mentioned it in front of Li Hao. She knew that Li Hao would only be in more pain than she was, so ... She also knew that if an ancient city took the initiative to break the peace, they would soon be met with a thunderous blow from the Heavenly Star!Li Hao still wanted to rope in some new martial artists, so he wouldn't take the initiative to fall out with them. However, if the other party did so, he didn't have to worry about anything.On the other side, the seventh elder seemed to want to say something, but the second elder said softly,""In that case ... We won't go out. It's no big deal to go out. I can't go out. Since Li Hao has given the order, we don't have to make things difficult for you. Seventh brother, go back.""Second elder, this ...""Let's go back,""Alright," he said.The seventh elder was indignant and sullen. What was going on with Li Hao? Did he have a change of heart?Wasn't it Li Hao the last time they met?It was really like seeing a ghost!As for Liu Yan, when she saw that they had taken the initiative to return to the ancient city, she frowned slightly as if she felt a little regretful. However, she didn't take the initiative to provoke them again. It was one thing for the other party to come out on their own. If she provoked them again and forced them to fall out, it would be difficult for her to explain.……At the same time, the other ancient cities were in a similar situation.Li Hao had truly sealed off the ancient city and forbade the enemy from entering or leaving.Not only that, but there was also a demon-hunter Army that had been searching for the location of the Hong family's ancient city. If an ancient expert's clone appeared, they would definitely rush over and destroy it with a thunderous blow.But now, Li Hao had ordered that all the clones of the ancient experts who appeared were enemies, not friends, and could be killed directly!The restrictions of heaven and earth made it impossible for these ancient experts to appear in their true bodies, and the power of their avatars was greatly reduced. They were unable to fight back against sun and moon experts, or even thousands of mountains and seas.……This was only the land of the Silver Moon, and there were some changes everywhere.The Snake King of Mount kui called on all the demons in the world to gather at Mount kui and create a Holy Land for the demons.The White saint cult in the North had secretly sent out a message to all the factions in the world, saying that they were willing to accept experts from all over to resist the tyranny ... As for who they were going against, they didn't say much. They only suggested to rebuild heavenstar.In the four Seas, the soldiers of shuiyun wiped out the Pirates one after another. On the four Seas, Pirates had become extinct. The Empress Dowager of shuiyun even wiped out the strongest Pirates of the North Sea, the Starlight Pirates, with a single sword strike. All the magical powers of the mountains and seas had died under her sword.At this moment, other than the invasion of the eastern wilderness, the entire place was silent. Even the divine Kingdom of the West kept a low profile, as if it did not exist.However, the world was full of undercurrents. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Many people rushed to the White saint cult in the North, and a large number of demons also migrated quickly to Mount kui.
