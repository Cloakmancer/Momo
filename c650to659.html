        Just as Li Hao was busy with his work ...
         Outside the city.
         The sunrise experts gathered again.
         LAN Yue shook her paper fan and said with a frown,""That coward Hu Qingfeng said he doesn't want to work here anymore ... He said hou Xiaochen was willing to be transferred, and that idiot took it seriously!"
         At first, it was Hu Qingfeng who had contacted them, saying that the higher-ups of the night patrol supported the idea of getting rid of hou Xiaochen.
         In the end, this guy was afraid again.
         Because hou Xiaochen had agreed to be transferred ... Hu Qingfeng took it as his own credit. He had reported to the night patrolmen's headquarters that it was all his credit. He had put pressure on hou Xiaochen and forced him to agree.
         Anyway, director Zhao and the others wouldn't fight for credit for this.
         Since he had made a contribution, hou Xiaochen didn't look like someone to mess with, and two more people had died, Hu Qingfeng was a little scared. At this moment, he wanted to back off and no longer wanted to join forces.
          Under the cloak, Banshan said in a cold voice,""It's normal for Hu Qingfeng to be unwilling. This guy is a little scared. The death of Yu Xiao and Huang Jie was probably a warning. This guy is famous for being a coward in the central continent. He'll take advantage of the situation and run away if there's nothing to be gained ..."
         LAN Yue didn't say anything. After thinking for a while, she said,""Without Hu Qingfeng, do we still have to continue testing hou Xiaochen? Do you have any ideas?"
         "Why don't we wait?"
         At this moment, King Pingdeng spoke,"we'll test him after we enter the ruins!" Hou Xiaochen seems to be preparing to enter heaven battling city ... At that time, we can avoid some extra trouble!"
         A relic!
         "I'm just afraid that the guy won't let us in,"LAN Yue said in a deep voice.
         "It's not up to him to decide!"
         King Pingdeng said coldly,"we must enter heaven battling city!" The three great organizations all have the same goal this time. If hou Xiaochen thinks he can stop them ... Then he'll be putting himself to death!"
         This was an ancient ruin that had yet to be completely explored, and it was guarded by a top-notch puppet. Many people wanted to go in and have a taste of the soup.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Now that even the central continent knew about it, it was no longer up to hou Xiaochen to decide.
         At this point, the king of equality sneered.""Besides, we're not the only ones! The next time we enter, it'll probably be a matter for us. As for the imperial family, He Yong has been here and hasn't left. Is he here to watch the show?"
         "Among the nine divisions, only Hu Qingfeng has shown his face. The other eight divisions have no movements. Did no one come?"
         "Also, did anyone from the nearby provinces have any ideas? "Out of the 19 provinces in the North, other than the three northern provinces, which are a little more chaotic, there are still experts in the other places. The news has spread, but no one is tempted?"
         "Hou Xiaochen won't be able to stop him."
         Blue Moon nodded slightly. They would definitely not be able to stop them. If they really did not let everyone in, it might bring huge trouble to Silver Moon in the end.
         "Now, we can only wait. If we wait, the night patrollers have joined hands with the military and the inspection Office to hunt down our three families ..."
         LAN Yue was just about to speak when ban Shan spoke,""I still have things to do, so I'll be leaving first!"
         King Pingdeng also disappeared instantly.
         I'm not interested in this!
         This was because the night patrollers 'main target was red Moon. They were hunting down Red moon's people and tracking down their strongholds. They didn't have that much strength against Fei Tian and Yama.
         The three major organizations were not really as close as a family.
         They didn't care if the red moon's people died or not.  LAN Yue coldly looked in the direction the two of them left and snorted!
         These two guys wanted more people to die in the red moon.
         After the two of them left, Ziyue, who was standing at the side, said,""So you're giving up on hou Xiaochen?"
         LAN Yue nodded slightly.
         If Hu Qingfeng didn't participate, they would only lose Xu Guang. It wasn't like they couldn't make a move, but if Hu Qingfeng didn't participate, it meant that something had changed. This guy ... Might turn on them and betray them. Then, he would join hands with Silver Moon to deal with the three large organizations.
         This fellow was capable of doing that.
         If he could even sell out hou Xiaochen, then what about the three major organizations? that guy had no bottom line at all.
         LAN Yue let out a soft breath and was a little irritated. She quickly said,""Since hou Xiaochen said that he's going to explore the ruins ... That's an opportunity! In the remains, they could avoid some unexpected factors, such as external help! Silvermoon isn't that simple. Too many things have happened while he was trying to kill hou Xiaochen. "
         "But ... That also means that we're the same!" Ziyue said in a deep voice. Once we enter the ruins, we'll lose the chance to get outside help. It's not just hou Xiaochen ..."
         LAN Yue was silent.
         Entering the ruins with hou Xiaochen was dangerous, but what could he do?
         "Is hou Xiaochen really one of the three great commanders of the star Army?" Zi Yue asked.
         "I'm not sure, probably, but probably not ..."
         Nonsense!
         Ziyue was speechless. After a moment of hesitation, she asked,""Is that Chief Steward Yu the legendary Yu Luosha?"
         "It's possible!" LAN Yue thought for a while and smiled."It's possible!"
         "You don't know him?"
         Ziyue was extremely surprised. You don't know the first generation Ziyue?
         LAN Yue laughed."What are you looking at me for? back then, during the gathering in July, first Blue Moon was my master, not me." The seven of them are all very mysterious, including your mother. If you don't know the first generation's purple Moon, how can I know her?"
         Ziyue nodded in agreement.
         July was actually very mysterious, including the first generation's Ziyue. Whether or not she was the Jade Rakshasa was also a mystery. It was just a piece of news that was circulating in the outside world. Ying Hongyue had never mentioned this before.
          Her mother also rarely mentioned these things. When it came to these things, she would always keep her mouth shut.
         LAN Yue didn't want to say anything more. She stood up and said,""Be careful these days. Silver Moon is going all out against Red Moon, so it's quite dangerous. Don't get caught by Silver moon's men. If you die, I'll be in trouble."
         Ziyue frowned and did not say anything.
         LAN Yue floated out of the hall, her voice spreading,""Don't get in touch with that Chief Steward Yu. Even if she really is Yu Luosha, a Purple Moon, and your mother's best friend, she's now the chief Steward of the night patrols! Once a woman gets carried away by love, she won't care about being best friends. That's a joke ... If she really kills someone, you might know how she got her name!"
         "I won't be that stupid!"
         Zi Yue snorted coldly. How was that possible?
         She couldn't possibly look for that Chief Steward Yu and throw her life away.
         Not to mention, although hou Xiaochen's spear attack that day didn't kill her, that spear attack had scared her out of her wits. How could she have dared to go to the night patrol to court death?
         "I hope so!"
         LAN Yue's laughter was left behind, but she had already disappeared.
        
         In the new dormitory.
         The good thing about being single was that no one would interfere. The nearest building was a few hundred meters away from him, and there was no one in the nearby buildings.
         At this moment, Li Hao took out the embroidery needle and the Luan Luan Phoenix spear.
         The blazing Phoenix spear quickly returned to its original appearance, but it was still dull.
         Li Hao looked at the dull Phoenix spear and frowned.
         He's actually autistic!
         He took out a divine power Stone, but there was no reaction from the fire Phoenix spear.
         Chief Yu had said that after he became autistic, only hou Xiaochen could activate the fire Phoenix spear.
         This was troublesome.
         If he told hou Xiaochen that he had activated his Fire Phoenix spear because he wanted to fight with his will and force, would he be willing to?
          Li Hao was afraid that hou Xiaochen would kill him.
         "Why do you want to be autistic?"
         Li Hao mumbled to himself. He took out a sword from his boot. It was a small sword that wasn't very long.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He knocked on the spear lightly, and it seemed to tremble.
         Li Hao sighed."I didn't say I'd cut you. You're Minister hou's weapon. Do you think I dare?" It's just a little stimulation to let me see the fire Phoenix, why are you autistic?"
         "Clang clang clang!"
         The small sword tapped lightly, and a series of metal clanging sounds rang out.
         The fire Phoenix spear was still dim.
         Li Hao frowned and mumbled,"I heard that the fiery phoenix spear is of an extremely high level. My starry sky sword broke the shadow snake sword and ate its soul. I wonder if it can break the fiery phoenix spear." I don't think so?"
         "It's said that this is a heaven-grade origin divine weapon. It's frighteningly powerful. "
         The fire wind Spear seemed to be trembling.
         Li Hao sighed again."Forget it. I can't activate it ... I'll just give it a few slashes and return it later. If it breaks, no one will believe that I did it. I don't have the strength to break the Phoenix spear. It must be a fake!"
         “……”
         The moment Li Hao raised the small sword, the fiery phoenix spear glowed with a fiery red!
         Li Hao's eyes flickered and he smiled.""Amazing!"
         It was really amazing!
         This fire Phoenix spear could actually hear people's words, or understand people's meaning.
         The soul of a weapon!
         He had seen the shadow snake sword before. There was the shadow of a snake in the shadow snake sword. When the shadow appeared and Li Hao slashed with the sword, the little snake seemed to understand. At least, at that moment, Li Hao seemed to be afraid.
         Previously, after he had dripped his blood on it, the fire Phoenix spear had shut down.
         Li Hao guessed that the Phoenix spear might be able to connect to the gods!
         He could understand and sense it.
         Sure enough, this thing could really understand.
         Li Hao was actually quite shocked. A weapon that could actually understand human language? what was this?
         If the weapon really had a soul ... Didn't that mean that the weapon could also be alive?  This was too unbelievable!
         Also, why did these weapons all have the shadow of demons?
         For example, the fire Phoenix and the shadow snake ...
         p Also, there seemed to be the shadow of a lightning-type demonic beast on Zi Yue's Thunder God's banner.  What the hell was this?
         A kind of force?
         Or a will?
         Li Hao didn't quite understand.
         Could it be ... A weapon made from demons?
         At this moment, Li Hao thought of the dead Black Panther. If he used the Black Panther to make a weapon, would there be a dog's shadow on the weapon in the future?
         'My poor Black Panther, it ate so many good things from me and now it's gone.'
         Li Hao sighed.
         However, the dog was smart. Li Hao felt that it might not have died. It might have run away. After all, Yuan Shuo had always wanted to eat it, which might have frightened the Black Panther.
         From the Phoenix spear, he immediately thought of the Black Panther.
         Looking at the red fiery phoenix spear, Li Hao held the spear and suddenly thrust it forward. The void exploded. The material of the spear itself was extremely solid, and it pierced through the void.
         Some of the fire energy had leaked out, bringing with it a burning sensation.
         It was a very powerful weapon!
         At the very least, it was stronger than the small sword ... Of course, the small sword had always been sealed, so Li Hao felt that the small sword was still stronger. Otherwise, what was the fire Phoenix spear afraid of?
         Li Hao held his spear and stood silently.
         At this moment, he felt like he had become hou Xiaochen and was trying to understand something. But a moment later, Li Hao shook his head and put down the spear. He couldn't feel anything with the fire Phoenix spear that wasn't activated.
         Only the killing intent that was vaguely present was somewhat interesting.
         "Nan Quan said that if I activate the fire Phoenix spear, I might be able to feel hou Xiaochen's will and power. At the very least, the spear that hou Xiaochen used to kill the red-haired man should still be here ..."
         What kind of force is hou Xiaochen's force? Li Hao thought.
         Was he still a Martial Master?
          If he wasn't a Martial Master, but just a superpower above Sunglow, would he still be able to display force?
         "Spear force?"
         Li Hao thought about it. The divine power Stone was very valuable. It would be a waste if he fed it to the fiery phoenix spear and got nothing.
         Lightly stomping his feet, Li Hao looked at the floor ... And nodded in satisfaction.
         The houses in this place were not simple.
         Hou Xiaochen must have used his powers to build this base. He had noticed yesterday that the floor tiles here were much stronger than the ones outside.
         Yesterday, he had smashed a warrior into the ground. If it was an ordinary floor tile, it could have been smashed more than ten meters deep. But here, it could only be smashed one meter deep.
         As expected, this house was probably built with earth powers.
         It was very sturdy and not bad.
         Looking at the Phoenix spear in his hand, Li Hao suddenly said,""Can you display hou Xiaochen's divine intent and power? How about you let me see it?"
        
         The blazing Phoenix spear was silent.
         Li Hao picked up the starry sky sword and sighed."It seems like I can 'T. I'll give it a try with my sword. Maybe I can activate it!"
         The fire Phoenix spear was still silent.
         Li Hao raised his eyebrows. In an instant, the momentum of his sword appeared, and he slashed down ...
         Before he could slash down, the fire Phoenix spear disappeared instantly. When it reappeared, it was already a few meters away, floating in the air.
         Li Hao laughed, and then exclaimed,""Is it really a good thing that a weapon has a soul?"
         A weapon with a soul might be able to protect its master, but a weapon with a soul could also easily devour its master!
         This might not be a good thing!
         "It seems that you can't run away? You can only run this far?"
         Li Hao smiled."I'll feed you a divine power Stone. Can we fight?" If you do well, I'll continue to feed you. If you don't ... I'll use the starry sky sword to hack you to death!"
          Then, Li Hao suddenly said,"ordinary sword techniques might not be able to cut you in half. I know a special sword technique. Break my sword. Or longevity sword?"
         In the next moment, Li Hao's sword momentum burst out!
         At this moment, he was substituted by the sword in his memory. It was as if the sword was going to break the sky!
         The fire Phoenix spear was originally just floating in the air. At this moment, it suddenly trembled violently and disappeared without a trace.
         Li Hao's expression changed. He ran away?
         F * ck!
         If I run, I'm finished! Hou Xiaochen will beat me to death!
         He hurriedly rushed out, but as soon as he did, he saw the fire Phoenix spear fall to the ground with a bang. It seemed that it couldn't get too far away from Li Hao. Li Hao was surprised. This thing could run, but he seemed to have restricted its range when he had used his blood.
         He couldn't be too far away from him.
         Interesting!
         He picked up the Phoenix spear, which was still trembling.
         Clearly, Li Hao's attack just now had really scared the fire Phoenix spear.
         Longevity sword, starry sky sword ...
         When these two things were put together, the fire Phoenix spear still trembled.
         "Keep running!"
         Li Hao also noticed this. He laughed."It seems that this antique weapon of yours is quite knowledgeable. You've seen the sword of my ancestor. Do you think I can cut you in half now?"
         The fire Phoenix spear trembled, as if in response to Li Hao.
         He believed it!
         Li Hao's eyes flickered,'Fire Phoenix spear, were you really a Phoenix in the past? Did phoenixes really exist? Were there really such monsters in the ancient civilization, such as dragons and phoenixes?"
         The fire Phoenix spear continued to tremble, as if it was a response. Indeed, there was.
         Li Hao touched his chin."Were you good at the Phoenix spear in the past?"
         He still trembled.
         Li Hao speculated that "a little" meant "certain". Did this mean that this guy felt that he was very strong?
         "Then, compared to my starry sky sword, are you stronger?"
         “……”
         This time, the fire Phoenix spear trembled twice.
         Li Hao was overjoyed!
         Damn, this spear could actually respond to people. Obviously, it felt that the starry sky sword was more powerful.  Li Hao was overjoyed. This thing could still respond. Did it mean that ... He didn't have to feed it, and it could recover on its own without spending divine power stones?
         Alright, that was all Li Hao could think of at this moment.
         As for the fact that the starry sky sword was stronger than this thing, Li Hao didn't doubt it.
         Their ancestors must be very powerful!
         Just looking at the sword momentum, it was very frightening.
         The fiery phoenix spear did not give him such a feeling.
         "Who's better, Minister hou or me?"
         Li Hao asked, but the Phoenix spear didn't move.
         He probably didn't know how to respond.
         "I'm better than Minister hou?"
         The fire Phoenix spear trembled twice and denied. It trembled without any hesitation, clearly thinking that Li Hao was overthinking.
         "Minister hou, are you a Martial Master?"
         This time, the fiery phoenix spear didn't tremble. Li Hao frowned. What did it mean?
         Li Hao suddenly thought of something and said,""Minister hou has chosen the path of energy?"
         This time, the fire Phoenix spear trembled. Once, twice ...
         No!
         The path of energy was the path of superpowers. Li Hao had heard this from the silver-tier Warriors. In the ancient civilization, this might have been how it was called, but the Phoenix spear might not have understood superpowers.
         Of course, it was hard to say.
         At this moment, Li Hao frowned. Wasn't it about superpowers?
         That would really be the path of a Martial Master.
         A Martial Master!
         It must be, Li Hao thought. As for why he didn't just walk the path of a Martial Master, Li Hao thought for a moment and concluded that it was highly unlikely. Otherwise, his observations wouldn't have been so glaring that he didn't dare to look at them.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Martial masters were reserved!
         He definitely wouldn't let himself feel that it was glaring!
         Maybe Minister hou's transformation was not complete, but he still had a surge of superpower in his body. That was why he gave off such a glaring feeling. The others were the same. They all gave off an extremely uncomfortable feeling.
         But even martial masters wouldn't have such a feeling.
         At this moment, Li Hao was somewhat interested in asking, so he asked,""Do you know force? Don't say that you don't understand. I've read ancient books and the ancients also talk about power! If you can, then tremble a little. "
          He trembled.
         They would!
         Li Hao's eyes lit up. Forget it, it's all the same. The elements are based on one's own comprehension, momentum is not specific ..."
         He recalled Hong Yitang's words. At this moment, he suddenly felt that Hong Yitang had a unique understanding of force.
         Li Hao didn't ask any more questions. There was no point in trembling.
         Let me experience force first!
         "Fire Phoenix spear, let's fight!"
         Li Hao flicked his spear. The spear flew up ... And instantly fell.
         Playing dead?
         Li Hao was speechless. He walked forward and picked up the spear. Frowning, he said,""Let's fight, or I'll cut you in half!"
        
         The spear trembled.
         This time, it shook a lot.
         Li Hao was speechless. What did he mean?
         The souls of these weapons did not seem to be very bright at times.
         "It didn't activate? He wanted to eat the divine power Stone? Can't you stimulate yourself?"
         Li Hao still wanted to save some money.
         The spear was still shaking.
         Li Hao was speechless. He got it. They still had to eat. If they didn't eat, they wouldn't work. He guessed that this might not be the case. These origin God weapons had been dormant for too long. Without the power of their Masters, they might not have enough power to support them.
         It was obvious that hou Xiaochen had injected some inner strength or superpower into Hao lianchuan when he gave it to him, but he probably didn't inject any into Li Hao.
         This was the so-called stimulating the truth!
          Li Hao didn't say anything more. He took out a fire energy stone from his storage ring. When he killed Yu Xiao and the others, he had obtained 13 pieces. He had a few pieces himself, but he didn't use them recently, so he kept them.
         However, there weren't many fire attribute ones. After checking, there were only three pieces in total.
         "One piece can be used for a long time, right?"
         Li Hao thought to himself. He looked at the fire Phoenix spear again. It still couldn't resist the temptation, so he decided to give it a try.
         Although the divine power Stone was precious, he would have another chance to get it later.
         However, he could only hold onto the fire Phoenix spear for three days.
         The next moment, he gritted his teeth and cracked the divine power Stone. A stream of fire-elemental energy gushed out, but the starry sky sword in his hand was too lazy to absorb it. Under normal circumstances, it would only absorb it when Li Hao used the five birds breathing technique. The small sword was a picky eater.
         As for the fiery phoenix spear, it wasn't picky. The moment it shattered, the fiery phoenix spear began to absorb it madly.
         From this point of view, the small sword was of a higher grade than the Phoenix spear.
         The starry sky sword must have been good food in the past, but the fire Phoenix spear was of a lower grade.
         After absorbing a large amount of fire energy, a fire Phoenix was faintly visible at this moment!
         A burning sensation appeared in the entire Hall.
         Li Hao's eyes lit up. Was it about to be activated?
         What was the thing that was triggered?
         Was it the Soul of the Fire Phoenix or the fire Phoenix spear itself that could attack?
         I don't really understand. It's my first time, so I don't have much experience.
         The reason why he chose to do it here was that he was worried that he would have no place to do it when he went back. He was afraid that he would cause too much of a commotion and destroy Hao lianchuan's house.
         Just as he was thinking, a small Phoenix suddenly appeared on the fire Phoenix spear.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Because the Phoenix was about to make a move, Li Hao waited expectantly. He was ready to start, but the Phoenix suddenly disappeared.
         No more!
         Li Hao was stunned. He waited for a while, but there was still no movement.
         He walked forward to take a look. The Phoenix spear seemed to be more glamorous than before.
         But ... There was no movement?
         "Let's fight!"
         Li Hao shouted, but the fiery phoenix spear trembled, as if it was saying that it had not eaten enough and had no strength.
          Li Hao was stunned for a moment. After a while, he understood what he meant, and his face suddenly darkened."What a fellow! I was actually played by a weapon!"  Do you really think I'm stupid?
         Li Hao gritted his teeth, raised his sword, and slashed at the fire Phoenix spear!
         I'll let you eat more!
         Bullshit!
         The divine power Stone contained a lot of fire energy, so how could it not be activated? this weapon dared to play with him?
         I'm going to Cut You Down and see if you'll fight back!
         The moment he slashed down, the fiery phoenix spear suddenly moved. This time, it was extremely sudden and instantly pierced towards Li Hao's throat!
         Its speed was extremely fast!
         It was as if he had planned this all along. He was waiting for Li Hao to approach.
         Li Hao was shocked. He felt a strong sense of danger.
         This thing can even sneak attack?
         The sword slashed down, but the fiery phoenix spear disappeared instantly. When it reappeared, it was already close to Li Hao's throat. Li Hao dodged instantly and activated the deer fighting technique to its maximum. He flew backward in the air like a feather.
         BOOM!
         The spear was like fire!
         At this moment, the fire Phoenix spear erupted with intense flames that burned the world. Li Hao suddenly felt like he was in a sea of fire. The furniture around him was intact, but he felt like his spirit was burning!
         What kind of attack was this?
         He was a little shocked. At this moment, he suddenly understood how the red-haired man had been killed!
         This spear was full of spirit!
         It was not to destroy the physical body first, but to kill the God first. If the God died, the body would die. Therefore, the red-haired man did not have enough time to Dodge, because the moment the spear stabbed into his body, his God was actually trapped or burned to death!
         "Ha!"
         Li Hao bellowed and roared. A Tiger was released from its cage!
         In his heart, a fierce tiger suddenly appeared!
         Possessed by a fierce tiger, Li Hao swung his sword. This sword did not seem to have appeared in reality, but rather a battle of divine will!
         A Phoenix appeared in his mind.
          Phoenix burning the heavens!
         Sharp claws, accompanied by flames, instantly clawed at the Tiger. In reality, the spear also instantly stabbed at Li Hao's throat. Li Hao swung his sword, and in his mind, the Tiger had come out of its cage. He also swung his claws!
         BOOM!
         His mind was buzzing. In reality, the starry sky sword slashed out and with a bang, the fiery phoenix spear was slightly deflected. However, the fiery phoenix spear was extremely strong and did not break.
         Li Hao instantly sobered up. The Tiger and Phoenix seemed to be evenly matched.
         He looked at the fire Phoenix spear in front of him and then at the sword in his hand. He was a little surprised.
         Then what were you afraid of before?
         Soon, he realized that ... The small sword ... Could only cut souls, which was why the soul of the fiery phoenix spear had never appeared. Only when the soul was cut would there be a chance to cut the origin divine weapon. Was that right?
         He didn't really understand.
         However, he was worried that he would really break the fire Phoenix spear. He inserted the small sword into his military boots and grinned."I don't need this thing, in case you get scared. Just like what you did just now. Impressive. I want to see the real phoenix spear ... Come at me!"
        
         This time, he had some experience.
         This time, as he inserted the small sword into the military boot, in an instant, the illusion of a fire Phoenix appeared in reality. As expected, the other party was really afraid of the small sword. The spear was not afraid, but the souls were.
         At this moment, the Phoenix transformed into a spear. In the blink of an eye, the spear was brandished!
         A living gun!
         Li Hao was extremely agile. He quickly dodged and did not attack directly. However, the fiery phoenix spear instantly produced countless afterimages. For a moment, Li Hao was unable to tell if they were real or fake. Perhaps they were both real. The spear was too fast, and he could only see the afterimages.
         Li Hao transformed into a fierce tiger. He roared and threw a punch.
         This punch hit nothing!
         The spear disappeared, and when it reappeared, it was already close to his head. Li Hao quickly dodged, and his head tilted, but he still couldn't stop the spear. In the blink of an eye, the spear passed through, and Li Hao hurriedly turned his head ... But he still felt pain in his ear.
         His right earlobe was directly scratched by the spear force, and a piece of flesh fell off. It was stained with blood, and fresh blood began to drip.
         The sharp air of the gun brushed past his face. Li Hao's face and neck were covered in blood!
          Not only was there blood, but there were also burn marks.
         Li Hao gasped. He jumped up and hurriedly dodged the Spear's second sweep. The fiery phoenix spear was even more agile than a human. It was so fast that Li Hao couldn't keep up.
         As soon as he stomped on the ground, the spear streaked across the sky like a bird and stabbed at Li Hao's lower body, as if it wanted to pierce through him.
         Li Hao broke out in a cold sweat. He didn't even feel this way when he fought peak three suns.
         At this moment, he couldn't care too much. With a roar, he kicked down. With a loud bang, the spear trembled from his kick. The next moment, the spear turned into a small snake and wrapped around his leg.
         This was what Li Hao liked to do. He knew the five birds technique, and sometimes he liked to use his agility to entangle the enemy's weapon and defeat the enemy. But he didn't expect that he would be taught a lesson by the Phoenix spear today.
         Li Hao's legs trembled. He opened his fist and grabbed at the Phoenix spear!
         At this moment, the tip of the fire-Wind Spear suddenly turned into the beak of a fire-wind bird. It was extremely sharp and pecked at Li Hao's claw. Was this the tip of the spear?
         Li Hao was in a daze!
         He felt that he wasn't fighting a spear, but a fire Phoenix. He couldn't tell what it was, but it made him think of the five birds technique, his teacher's five birds technique!
         When the teachers were in battle, the enemies actually felt the same way.
         When one thought that he was fighting with someone, that was not the case. Yuan Shuo seemed to have transformed into a ferocious Tiger, a black bear, a flying bird ...
         "Flying bird technique ..."
         A thought flashed through Li Hao's mind. Suddenly, his claw took the shape of a bird's beak, and he instantly pecked at the Phoenix's beak!
         Clang!
         Sparks flew in all directions. Li Hao felt a pain in his palm. When he looked at it, he found that his palm had been pierced through, and a bloody hole appeared.
         Li Hao secretly cursed. It was too sharp!
         This wasn't hou Xiaochen's Shi, this was the Phoenix's own ability!  As for him, his finger had also poked the Phoenix spear, but it did not have any effect ...
         Li Hao felt that he was stupid.
         His palm was strong, but it was still made of flesh and blood. The fire Phoenix he thought was alive wasn't a living one. This was a spear, an extremely strong spear. It was like his palm pecking at the tip of the spear. It would be strange if he wasn't injured.
         He couldn't be blamed for making such a choice, because this fire Phoenix was too real!
         The next moment, Li Hao came back to his senses. He no longer thought about all these random things. He now understood that he shouldn't treat this thing as a weapon, nor a fire Phoenix, but ... Yuan Shuo who knew the flying bird technique!
         Yes, Li Hao finally understood!
         This was an expert who could use the flying bird technique. If he couldn't even deal with the Phoenix spear, it meant that he couldn't deal with his teacher who only knew the flying bird technique.
         "Flying bird technique ... Interesting!"
         This scene appeared in Li Hao's mind. He didn't care what hou Xiaochen's force was, and he pounced on it like a tiger pouncing on a bird!
         A Tiger could also catch a bird!
         A Tiger and a Phoenix seemed to be real at this moment. In this small room, they were fighting madly. The Tiger roared in the forest and the Phoenix cried in the nine Heavens!
         ……
         At the same time.
         Mu Lin quickly rushed over. His expression was ugly. He looked at the small courtyard in the distance and frowned. What the hell?
         An expert had barged into this place to assassinate Li Hao?
         He wanted to get closer, because he felt two extremely powerful forces colliding. As a Martial Master, he was very sensitive to forces. One was Li Hao's Tiger Force, and the other was somewhat like fire, but also like a bird ...
         The feeling he got was that Yuan Shuo had come. An internal battle between the members of the five birds sect?
          The flying bird technique against the Tiger fighting technique?
         It was precisely because of this that he hesitated slightly. Could it be that Yuan Shuo had run back and was teaching his disciples?
         Mu Lin had a headache. After hesitating for a moment, he still decided to rush in!
         Even if Yuan Shuo had returned, it would not do to start a fight without informing him.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com If they made a wrong judgment and Li Hao was really killed here, would the Wei Wu Army still have any face left?
         Just as he was about to rush in, a figure suddenly descended from the sky!
         At this moment, a tall man landed in front of him and grabbed Mu Lin with one hand. His body was straight like a spear.
         The person who landed looked to be in his fifties, and his eyes were exceptionally sharp.
         It looked like a gun that could be fired at any moment.
         "Boss!"
        
         Mu Lin was shocked. Why did boss come back?
         It was the Golden spear!
         At this moment, Jin Jin's eyes were like torches as he looked at the small building a hundred meters away. It was as if he could see through the small building. At this moment, what appeared in his eyes was not the building, but a Tiger and a Phoenix that were engaged in a battle!
         Jin Jin's eyes were extremely sharp. He looked in that direction, thought for a moment, and said in a deep voice,""Li Hao?"
         "Yes, boss, I think he was attacked ..."
         "No!"
         The Golden spear stood still, and the sharp look in his eyes gradually disappeared. "It's an origin divine weapon!"
         "What?"
         "You don't understand,"
         He didn't say much. It wasn't that Mu Lin didn't understand, it was just that he had never experienced it.
          It was the hou tribe's weapon!
         Fire Phoenix spear!
         Li Hao ... He had heard hou Xiaochen mention him before. He was Yuan Shuo's disciple.
         He was very bold!
         Of course, he was also very powerful.
         The Tiger fighting technique had actually reached the acme of perfection.
         The Marquis was ruthless enough to lend the fire Phoenix spear to this person. He wasn't afraid that the fire Phoenix would revive and kill Li Hao.
         Jin Jin looked on silently. At this moment, he felt as if he was looking at Yuan Shuo from many years ago, a Tiger roaring in the forest, sweeping across the land ..."Can this disciple of yours defeat the Phoenix spear?"
         "Boss, it's not Yuan Shuo?" Mu Lin asked nervously.
         "What a joke! Of course not!"
         Jin Jin said coldly,"it's the fire Phoenix. Li Hao is very bold to train with the fire Phoenix spear. I don't know if it's to comprehend the five birds technique or to probe the Marquis 'intent ... Let's see how he will deal with it. This is only the beginning. The fire Phoenix intent is only the first obstacle!"
         To dare use the hou tribe's weapon as a Whetstone ... This Li Hao was either stupid, crazy, or extremely confident.
         When you defeat the Phoenix, you'll find out ... That's the real beginning!
         The will of the Marquis tribe is on the second level. Whether you can see it depends on your ability.
         In the huge Wei Wu Army, apart from him, only Mulin had some hope. The prerequisite was that Mulin would not be burned to death by the fire Phoenix.
         ……
         In the room.
         Li Hao didn't want to kill the Phoenix ... At this moment, after fighting for a while like a tiger, he suddenly realized something and frowned.
         I'm not here to kill the Phoenix!
         I'm here for learning!
         Fire Phoenix ... Flying bird technique!
         He didn't spend a divine power Stone to kill the fire Phoenix.
         He changed his attitude and was like a fierce tiger returning to the mountain.
         Suddenly, a set of mountain armor seemed to appear on Li Hao's body. The next second, Li Hao imitated the fire Phoenix. Swaying in the wind, he spread his wings and flew. In the air, a fire Phoenix was pouncing on a faintly discernible bird.
         Wind and rain wavered!
         Birds couldn't fly, at least they didn't feel like they could fly, and they wouldn't fly too high ... It was a little ... A little like an eagle catching a chick!
         Yes, this was the feeling.  That was what Li Hao felt. He was a chicken on the grass, and the Phoenix was an eagle in the sky.
         He no longer tried to force a collision, but instead, he tried to escape!
         Using the flying bird spell to escape, Li Hao discovered that imitation might also help him improve his flying bird spell. The flying bird spell required him to see some real birds flying in the sky, and in the instant they hunted ... What bird was stronger than the fire Phoenix?
         This was an existence that was even more powerful than an Eagle!
         Li Hao twisted his body and straightened his arms, constantly avoiding the Phoenix's sharp claws and sharp beak.
         Her actions were very ugly.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com With a bang, the bird's beak pecked at Li Hao's Mountain armor, causing it to crack. But in an instant, the armor recovered. Armor of earth!
         He didn't dare to be pecked, as that would be the same as being pierced by the fire Phoenix spear. If he didn't die, he would be seriously injured.
         In the small room, the Phoenix kept chasing Li Hao, while Li Hao kept dodging ...
         A moment later, Li Hao gritted his teeth and rushed out of the room. The room was too small for him to Dodge.
         As soon as he rushed out of the room, Li Hao seemed to have transformed into a bird and soared into the sky.
         Behind him, a fire Phoenix was chasing after him.
         Soon, Mu Lin also saw this scene, and his mouth opened slightly. At this moment, he saw a fire Phoenix chasing a bird ... A very small bird.
         The Golden spear naturally saw it as well.
         However, there were some ordinary people nearby, and what they saw was completely different.
         What they saw was a person Walking in the Air, staggering. Behind him, a fiery red spear was chasing after him.
         At this moment, someone in the distance also saw it.
         Those who had a deep understanding of 'force' would see 'force'. Those who did not see 'force' would only see 'spear' chasing after 'force'. The difference in 'force' was enough to divide the entire Wei Wu Army into two levels.
         ……
         In the air.
         Li Hao turned around, and the Phoenix continued to pursue him. Li Hao suddenly mimicked the Phoenix and stretched out his arms. Like an arrow, he soared into the air.
         It turned into an arrow!
         On the ground, Jin gun raised his head and his eyes flickered.
         This kid's learning ability was very strong.
         He was imitating!
         He actually stopped fighting the fire Phoenix. He wanted to learn from the fire Phoenix and comprehend his own flying bird technique.
          The people of the five birds sect were indeed beyond expectations.
         But ... Could imitating lead to one's own path?
         "Back then, Yuan Shuo was also imitating the five birds. But in the end, he still comprehended his own path. If you blindly imitate, you might not be able to comprehend the momentum of the birds.
         What was the core of the flying bird force?
         The Golden spear actually had some understanding of it. It wasn't speed or flight, but freedom!
         At least, that was what Yuan Shuo's flying bird force felt like.
         It wasn't attacking or defending, it was freedom, like a little bird, flying and going wherever it wanted to go without any restraints.
         Li Hao seemed to only be pursuing speed.
         He looked on silently, his eyes constantly changing.
         Li Hao, who was in the air, didn't think too much. At this moment, he only had one thought, and that was to go faster, faster!
        
         It was even faster than the fire Phoenix!
         If the sword was fast to the extreme, it was also a kind of momentum.
         He was like an arrow, tearing through the void and flying into the sky.
         Behind him, the long spear pursued.
         The man and the spear disappeared from the yard in an instant. The Golden spear kicked its leg and shot up like a cannonball. It disappeared from its original spot in an instant and chased into the distance.
         As for Mu Lin, his eyes flickered for a moment. In the next moment, he charged forward at an extremely fast speed, as fast as lightning!
         He wanted to see what the final result would be.
         In the distance, a few Centurions also flew over quickly. Their eyes were filled with doubt and anticipation, wanting to see the result.
         What the hell was that?
         Li Hao was actually being chased around by a gun. It seemed to be ... The Phoenix spear!
          ……
         In the forest.
         Li Hao turned, and the spear turned.
         Li Hao flew straight, the spear flew straight, and from time to time, a wave of fire attacked.
         Beak attack!
         Li Hao felt a pain in his heel. The spear had caught up to him and injured him.
         At this moment, Li Hao's eyes flickered. He seemed to have transformed into an ape that instantly burrowed into the forest, moving from one tree to another.
         Bang! Bang!
         With a loud noise, a large tree was pierced through by the spear. Li Hao, on the other hand, kept thinking about the flying bird technique ... What was the core?
         What was his pursuit?
         Was it fast?  Extremely fast?
         He turned his head to look at the fire Phoenix. The fire Phoenix was very fast, but at the same time, it also had a powerful attack.
         It was fast and powerful.
         Was this the flying bird technique?
         Bird force was like this?
         "No, no... That might not be the case ... Besides, everyone's Shi is different ..."
         "It doesn't matter if it's fast or destructive ... If it's fast to the extreme, it'll be beneficial!"
         At this moment, Li Hao thought of water. When a drop of water was extremely fast, it was also incomparably sharp. The Phoenix's beak was so powerful that it could instantly pierce through his body and defense because it was too fast!
         And the same goes for the bird claw.
         Why did the Eagle dive down from the sky to pounce on its prey? it was because if it landed quickly, it would have more powerful killing power ...
         The five birds technique was also a killing secret technique, and the flying bird technique was no exception!
         "Therefore, the core of the flying bird technique isn't about escaping, nor about speed ... But the instantaneous burst of speed when it reaches the limit!"
         A drop of water, at its extreme speed, could also break steel.
         The flying bird technique was extremely fast. Did it mean that any part of the body was a killing weapon?
         Li Hao turned his head again, but his speed suddenly slowed down. The Phoenix behind him seemed to have seized this opportunity and pecked at him again. Li Hao's movements were not fast ... This time, his arm was pecked through!
         He didn't even have time to bleed. It was too fast!
         It directly penetrated his body!  Behind him, Jin gun's expression changed.
         What was going on?
         Li Hao's movements suddenly slowed down, and the fiery phoenix spear instantly injured him. It was not a light injury. His arm was pierced through by the spear.
         Down below, Mu Lin's expression also changed. Why did Li Hao suddenly slow down? was his inner strength not strong enough?
         ……
         Li Hao, on the other hand, was in great pain!
         Despite the intense pain, he reached out his uninjured left hand to grab the Phoenix spear!
         With this grab, the fire Phoenix pecked again!
         Puchi!
         The bird's beak broke through Li Hao's defense again and instantly pecked into his left arm, but this time, it didn't penetrate it!
         Feeling the two kinds of pain, Li Hao suddenly smiled.
         Right!
         It was a different feeling. His right arm had been pierced through, and it was extremely painful, but his left arm had not been pierced through. This meant that the lethality of the fiery phoenix spear was slightly weaker!
         "So that's how it is ... The flying bird technique still pursues speed, but the core is the instant when one's speed reaches the limit ..."
         His comprehension was completely different from Yuan Shuo 's!
         However, the path of a Martial Master was different, so Li Hao didn't think there was anything wrong with it.
         At this moment, he thought of something and suddenly flew up. His speed was extremely fast, much faster than before.
         The blazing Phoenix spear once again chased after him!
         Li Hao kept accelerating, accelerating, and accelerating ...
         He accelerated until he could no longer accelerate. Li Hao suddenly turned his head and threw a punch. All the speed he had turned into an explosion at this moment, turning into an instant of sharpness!
         It was a process of explosion, convergence, and explosion!
         BOOM!
         With a loud noise, the fiery phoenix spear was knocked back by the punch, and Li Hao's hand was covered in blood.
         He didn't care!
         He revealed a smile and suddenly thought of something. He looked at the fire Phoenix spear and grinned,""Run, the faster the better. If you're not fast, I'll cut you!"
         The fire Phoenix spear exploded in an instant. Escape!
         Li Hao, on the other hand, used all his strength to quickly pursue!
          Accelerate!
         He recalled the process of accelerating and used all his strength to pursue. He kept chasing, and his speed grew faster and faster. At this moment, Li Hao turned into a bird, and his beak pierced through the void!
         Buzzzzzz!
         With a loud explosion, Li Hao's right hand formed a claw and grabbed the tail of the spear. He then slashed down!
         With a loud boom, Li Hao's fingers seemed to have been fractured. However, at this moment, a few claw marks were left on the tough blazing Phoenix spear, which disappeared in an instant.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The spear was intact, but Li Hao's claw had instantly left a hole in the Phoenix!
         The joy in Li Hao's eyes grew, but at this moment ... The Phoenix disappeared, and the spear fell.
         Li Hao was dazed for a moment before he came back to his senses.
         No more!
         The energy of the divine power Stone was gone.
        
         There might have been some left, but when he clawed down just now, the fire Phoenix seemed to have suffered some injuries and absorbed the energy, and then ... It was exhausted.
         Li Hao grabbed the fiery phoenix spear and felt like vomiting blood.""So fast?"
         The divine energy stone!
         In the blink of an eye, you've used it up?
         What the hell!
         He frowned and was a little annoyed, but he didn't care about the wounds on his body. Both his arms were pierced through, his palms were pierced through, and so were his feet ...
         In this short moment, he had suffered heavy injuries.
         His earlobe was a bloody mess.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't care. He didn't even feel any pain. At this moment, he was very depressed, but his eyes were bright.
         "I see ..."
          He seemed to have figured something out and muttered,""Flying bird ... Extreme speed, turning into killing ... Metal element?"
         The approaching golden spear was slightly startled.
         What was going on?
         He knew very well that the flying bird technique was used to escape. It was an extremely special movement technique, not an offensive one. But what was Li Hao saying?
         Extreme speed, killing for profit?
         The flying bird technique, killing people?
         At this moment, although he saw that Li Hao was distracted, he still interrupted him.""Flying bird technique, free and unrestrained, this is what a bird is!"
         He didn't want old demon Yuan's disciple to randomly comprehend it, nor did he want this martial Dao genius to take a fork in the road.
         Li Hao blurted out,"nonsense!" Be it birds or Eagles, all living creatures must hunt. The five birds technique is a killing technique. Where does freedom come from? only killing. The root and origin of secret techniques is killing!"
         What did he know?
         The five animal technique was used to imitate animals hunting, but in fact, the five secret techniques were used to kill people. What freedom?
         Nonsense!
         Only after saying this did he come to his senses. Looking at the spear-like figure in the distance, Li Hao seemed to have realized who he was. He immediately coughed and said,""Greetings, Captain. I thought brother ermu was talking and was just joking!"
         Jin Jin didn't say a word. He looked confused.
         The five birds ... Were all for killing?
         He frowned slightly. This was different from Yuan Shuo's five birds technique.
         The five birds technique was an all-rounded secret technique, but it didn't mean that it was a killing secret technique. However, the statement that Li Hao had just blurted out was different from the five birds technique, or rather, it was different from Yuan Shuo 's.
         But Yuan Shuo was the founder!
         Who was right and who was wrong?
         Also, this Li Hao...Is he so murderous?
         It was clearly a secret technique for escaping, but why did it become a killing technique in his mouth?
         To be able to comprehend the flying bird technique and turn it into a great killing technique ... It had to be said that at this moment, even an old Martial Master like gold spear couldn't change his inherent thoughts. Yuan Shuo's influence on them was too great, and they couldn't walk out of the shadow of Yuan Shuo's five birds technique.
         As for Li Hao, he once again took a closer look at the old man in front of him. Jin gun was not young, about the same age as his teacher. He looked to be in his 50s, but in fact, he should be in his 70s.
          As for what the Golden spear had just said, Li Hao recalled and felt it for a moment. He roughly understood what it meant. This was his teacher's divine will!  However, her teacher's path was not the only one.
         Jin gun was heavily influenced by his teacher!
         Yuan Shuo himself had said that he didn't have to walk the five birds Road like him.
         Hong Yitang had also said that the power of the technique varied from person to person. Liu Long's father had the fire Dragon Spear, but Liu Long had become the water wave axe. The same secret technique had different results.
         At this moment, Li Hao actually felt that this golden spear might ... Might not even be as good as Hong Yitang!
         Yes, this was the feeling.
         It wasn't strength, but a kind of comprehension of martial arts and force.
         The Golden spear must be very strong. There was no need to test it. The opponent gave Li Hao a feeling of invincibility just by standing there. However, despite its strength, the Golden spear did not give Li Hao the feeling of wisdom.
         Yes, wise!
         Hong Yitang had it!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Among all the martial masters he had met, Hong Yitang had this feeling, He Yong ... It was half and half, and Yuan Shuo had the same feeling.
         Because he had been in contact with Yuan Shuo for a long time, Li Hao didn't feel much when he saw Hong Yitang. However, after meeting He Yong, Jin Jin, and the others, he was suddenly stunned.
         Hong Yitang ... Was no longer a Martial Master!
         However, he ... Seemed to have a very deep understanding of martial arts!
         If chief Yu was Yu Luosha, she wouldn't have given him such a feeling. Hou Xiaochen, on the other hand, did, but he felt more like a mysterious person than a wise man who could see through everything.
         At this moment, Li Hao was also distracted.
         Hong Yitang ... One of the cowardly thirty-six heroes, the second person of the Seven Swords, was he really ... That bad?
         Blinking his eyes, Li Hao suddenly wanted to see Hong Yitang. He had an impulse to see this man's sword power!
         Even if the Golden spear was right in front of him, it could not stop his impulse.
         Why did Hong Yitang choose to walk the path of superpowers?
         Was it just to become stronger?
         At this moment, his curiosity about the Golden spear was actually less than his curiosity about Hong Yitang. The Earthcover sword seemed to be more interesting than the Golden spear. The Golden spear was obviously an old-fashioned Martial Master. This was the only thought Li Hao had.
          No matter how strong he was, he didn't feel like he had learned anything.
         "Captain, brother ermu, I'm injured. I need to go back to the city first ..."
         After saying this, Li Hao suddenly ran away.
         Mu Lin, who had just caught up, was slightly stunned. Why are you running?
         What's going on?
         Golden spear was also stunned. This Li Hao ... What was going on?
         To be honest, as a well-known figure in the martial arts world, many martial masters looked up to him when they saw him. He didn't want Li Hao to be like this, but wasn't it ... Inappropriate to just leave them here and run away?
         Could it be that old demon Yuan often badmouthed him in front of Li Hao?
         At this moment, Jin gun could not help but think so.
         A smile appeared on his old-fashioned face. It was interesting. As for Li Hao's understanding of the flying bird spell, he didn't say anything. Perhaps Li Hao was right. He wasn't li Hao's teacher, so there was no need to say anything.
        
         He galloped.
         This time, Li Hao didn't have anyone catch him. Instead, he leaped into the air like a bird, covering a hundred meters with each step.
         Just now, he suddenly had an idea. He wanted to see Hong Yitang.
         Even though the Golden spear was right in front of him, he had no intention of discussing martial arts with it.
         A thousand goblets of wine meet a bosom friend.
         He did not communicate much with golden spear. They only exchanged a few words, but Li Hao understood that he and golden spear were not the same kind of people.
         Jin Jin might be a good person, a good teacher, a good general, a good Martial Master ...
         But all of this wasn't too important.
         What Li Hao needed right now was someone with a unique understanding of martial arts.
         The famous great Martial Master, Golden Gun, had given Li Hao an impression in that instant. From this, he thought of some people he knew in the past and some classmates he hadn't seen in a long time.
          Step by step, standard answer, top student.
         The existence of a perfect score!
         Li Hao's grades were not bad. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to get into the Silver City ancient Academy. However, good grades didn't mean that he would get full marks. In the eyes of some teachers, he was actually a problematic student. Sometimes, they would have some inexplicable thoughts.
         During the exam, the answer was clearly fixed, but he insisted on going one round and not following the process. He might have to take a few turns before he could return to the starting point.
         Only Yuan Shuo felt that this was very good, quite good, and that it was not an ordinary path.
         But not everyone was like Yuan Shuo.
         Therefore, when Li Hao heard golden spear say that the flying bird technique was freedom, he understood that golden spear was that kind of person. He was old-fashioned and serious, and in fact, he didn't know what true freedom was.
         "No wonder the Golden spear didn't try to break through teacher's will suppression ... He ... Can 't!"
         Li Hao thought of this while he was running.
         At the same time, he also felt some pressure from the Wei Wu Army. A serious person like Jin gun might not like him. He thought of Mu Lin. Mu Lin looked unruly, and Jin gun might not like him too much.
         These people preferred obedient children.
         Soon, Li Hao forgot about the Golden spear.
         His speed was extremely fast, and he had just comprehended some extreme sharpness. When he ran, he was like an arrow piercing through the air.
         Not long after, he entered the North City.
         This was the territory of the inspection Office.
         As soon as Li Hao entered the city, he saw people from the inspection Office patrolling in front of him. They seemed to have sensed Li Hao's speed and were a little nervous.
         A token instantly appeared in Li Hao's hand.""Night patrolman!"
         As soon as he said that, the people from the inspection Office heaved a sigh of relief.
         "Where is the swords gate's office in white moon City?" Li Hao quickly asked.
         There were three patrol inspectors in front.
         One of them was slightly older. He glanced at Li Hao and made a rough judgment, then quickly said,""It's close to the south of the city, near the clock tower ..."  "Many thanks!"
         Then, Li Hao jumped and disappeared.
         The few inspectors from the inspection Office looked on with envy.
         Was this the night patrolman?
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com They knew and had seen night patrollers before, but they were usually in a normal state when they met. They had seen Li Hao running over from afar just now. He was as fast as lightning!
         "Hey, is a gun still useful for such a person?"
         One of the patrol officers sighed.
         With that speed, you can't even see it, and you want to hit the other party with a gun?
         What a fool's dream!
         At this moment, these people were envious of these extraordinary people. However, the old patrol officer was indifferent. He reported a few words through the communication device and said,""Being ordinary is the truth. The stronger you are, the greater the danger. The world of transcendents has more troubles."
         The old patrol officer didn't say anything else and continued his patrol.
         Young people always liked to pursue excitement. At his age, he understood that no excitement was as real as ordinary life.
         Superpowers were good, but they could die anytime.
         ……
         p Swords gate encampment.  The swords gate had an office in the White moon City, it was a small six-story building. The swords gate was not a dark power organization, as a local superpower organization, the swords gate would sometimes assist the night patrols.
         The authorities had never classified the swords gate as a dark power organization.
         The main point was that swords gate was actually similar to a sect, a martial arts sect.
         The swords gate still had the culture of the pugilist world. Be it superpowers or martial masters, they were all involved in the pugilist world and not the world of ordinary people. Therefore, the superpowers of the swords gate rarely interfered with the ordinary world.
         An organization that did not interfere with the mortal world would not be officially classified as a dark power organization under normal circumstances.
          There were not many people in the office.
         Leaving an office here was only to prove to the night patrol that the swords gate was an organization on the surface, an open and aboveboard existence, not a secret.
         At this moment, on the first floor of the office.
         In a large private room, Hong Yitang was having dinner with his family. In fact, it was only his daughter and his second wife.
         These few days, he had been staying in white moon City without leaving.
         The swords gate headquarters couldn't be in the White moon City, but right now, there were many people gathered here. In order to gain more time to react, Hong Yitang had been staying here until the next time the ruins opened, or when hou Xiaochen left Silver Moon.
         The family of three chatted.
         Hong Qing was a talkative person, and it was the rule of many old martial masters not to talk when eating or sleeping. Hong Yitang doted on his daughter, so he didn't have so many rules.
         "Dad, are we still going to stay here? When can we go home?"
         "Let's wait a little longer,"
        
         Hong Qing wasn't dissatisfied. The swords gate's base wasn't bustling at all. On the contrary, it was very cold. In fact, after entering the White moon City, she quite liked it. It was very lively, and there was a lot of food, clothes, and fun.
         However, she saw that her father seemed to be a little absent-minded these days and thought that he was missing home.
         Hong Yitang took a mouthful of food. He didn't drink, but he was still thinking about something.
         Beside him, Madam Hong saw this and gave him some food. She said softly,""Let's just eat. Don't think about anything else. "
         "Yeah, you guys eat too."
         Hong Yitang smiled.
         "Are the night patrollers looking for trouble with us, dad?" asked Hong Qing curiously. "If it really doesn't work out, we can just give all the black armors we obtained last time to the night patrolmen. Money can move people's hearts. We've split 100 sets of black armors ... The night patrolmen will definitely be after us!"
         He had killed nearly 900 black puppets last time, so he had obtained more than 800 Black puppets.
         With all the wandering cultivators dead, the three major organizations, the night patrollers, and the swords gate were the biggest winners.
         However, many people from the three great organizations had died.
          In the end, because of the two three suns, the swords gate managed to obtain quite a number of black banners. In fact, if the swords gate didn't take the initiative to ask for less, with the strength that the swords gate had left behind at that time, it would be normal for them to get 200 black banners.
         "Let's use the black banner to exchange for some mysterious energy," said his wife,"there are many people in swords gate, but not many martial masters. It's not much use to have so many black banners, and it's easy to be targeted by others."
         Hong Yitang laughed."I want to send him away ... But it's not easy!"
         He did not really care about the black Phoenix and wanted to give it away, but ... Sometimes, you can't just give it away when you want to. He had communicated with the night patrolmen and the reply from them was very simple. They did not want to take it by force!
         Unless it was one of their own, no one would accept such a gift from the swords gate!
         Obviously, hou Xiaochen's meaning was simple. If they didn't become one of his own, then these things would naturally belong to the night patrolmen, along with their armor.
         Why don't you ... Take it yourself!
         It was not a good thing to hold on to it.
         The three major organizations also knew that swords gate had hundreds of armors, how could they not be tempted?
         So what if there were only two three suns?
         "Hou Xiaochen, you're trying to win swords gate over without shedding a single drop of blood, and you're saying that you can't say anything about it? they don't want your treasure, and you're blaming them?
         What about offering it to the three great organizations?
         "Alright, once you offer yourself to the three major organizations, you'll be a fellow who colludes with the dark powers. You'll be part of the dark powers.
         Therefore, even Hong Yitang sighed.
         Hou Xiaochen had killed people without even seeing blood!
         Killing people in the open was nothing.
         Standing on the clouds and looking down on you, you don't have to do it yourself, and you have to take the initiative to come to your door to seek refuge. That's the true method.
         With two three suns, more than ten sunlit cultivators, more than a hundred martial masters, beheading ten and Starlight over a hundred, swords gate was considered a powerful force in Silver Moon. Once they were recruited, the strength of the night watchmen would greatly increase.
         More importantly, the swords gate also had a strong foundation, they could even be self-sufficient, they didn't need to start from scratch.
         When the heaven battling city ruins appeared, they destroyed the island of light, dealt a heavy blow to the three large organizations, and cleaned up those daring itinerant cultivators ... At this moment, Hong Yitang had long realized that perhaps the heaven battling city ruins were deliberately leaked and opened to the public.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It was all for the sake of clearing out Silver moon's extraordinary domain!
         Every step was within someone else's calculations. The method was extremely brilliant, but everyone had to fall into the trap obediently.
         Just as he was thinking about these annoying things, his eyebrows suddenly twitched.
          After a while, his wife seemed to have sensed something. She frowned and said,""Someone's here?"  It wasn't too obvious, so it didn't seem like a superpower.
         A Martial Master?
         After a while, a laugh came from outside the door,""Li Hao of the five birds sect is here to pay a visit to senior uncle Hong!"
         In the private room, the three of them were slightly stunned.
         Li Hao?
         Hong Yitang was also a little strange. Why was this guy here?
         "Come in, you're too polite!"
         Hong Yitang stood up and was about to go out to welcome him when the door of the private room opened in the blink of an eye. Li Hao appeared at the door.
         Behind Li Hao, the disciples of swords gate were all shocked.
         So fast!
         "Master!"
         "Sect master!"
         “……”
         These people spoke one after another. They were somewhat terrified that someone had actually barged in in an instant.
         "I'm fine!"
         Hong Yitang waved his hand, looked at Li Hao, and said with a smile,""Li Hao is here. Have you eaten?"
         It was time for dinner.
         "Not yet,"
         Li Hao cupped his fists at his wife and said,""Good day, Madam Hong!"
         He looked at Hong Qing again, smiled, and nodded."Thank you for the sword last time!"
         Hong Qing didn't say anything, either. He just looked at Li Hao curiously.
         Why was he here?
          Madam Hong also revealed a smile, but she was inwardly shocked. This Li Hao was so fast!
         "Martial uncle Hong, shall we have some?"
         Li Hao laughed and casually sat down. Looking at the table full of dishes, he rubbed his stomach and said with a smile,""I'm really a little hungry ..."
         Hong Yitang's eyes flickered and he smiled.""Then let's eat together. But we've already moved, I'll get someone to serve some hot dishes ..."
         "There's no need to go through so much trouble!"
         Li Hao picked up an unused bowl and chopsticks and began to eat. Hong Qing and Mrs. Hong were both a little startled.
         This was something that only extremely close disciples or senior and junior brothers would do.
         It represented closeness!
         However, if it was an outsider, it actually meant that they didn't know any manners.
         They looked at Hong Yitang, but Hong Yitang didn't seem to mind. He smiled and sat down. Watching Li Hao eat, he said,""Don't you usually go to the canteen for lunch? Why are you here at the swords Gate office?"
