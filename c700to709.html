        the remaining two, who had been defeated by Hong Qing and Liu Yan earlier, quickly went up to the stage and each chose a person to challenge.
         Li Hao only looked at it for a while and then didn't care much.
         These martial masters had no influence.
         A Martial Master without force was only good at martial arts, but they didn't have any special abilities.
         The two middle-stage cultivators were able to defeat the late-stage cultivators, so they naturally had their own abilities.
         After another ten minutes, Li Heng was sweating like rain. He still used the Willow silk sword to defeat his opponent. He fought two consecutive battles, both of which were of a higher level. At this moment, he was exhausted. He was originally talkative, but now he couldn't say a single word.
         On the other side, Wu Chao was already sweating profusely from running away. The disciple of swords gate who was chasing after him was also filled with anger, he kept on swinging his sword, each slash was fiercer than the last, but he still couldn't defeat Wu Chao.
         "Brother Chao's speed is really not slow."
         Li Hao also watched for a while. He didn't pay much attention to it before, but now he was a little confused."Brother Chao is also a great teacher?"
         Chen Jian's iron cloth was everywhere, and there were many inheritances.
          However, there were not many well-known martial masters who had inherited movement techniques.
         Wu Chao was very fast. In fact, Li Hao knew that Wu Chao could escape with Heibao and yunyao when he was faced with Red moon's superpower, and he managed to shake off Red moon's superpower.
         Looking at it again now, he felt that he was much faster than the average late-stage Martial Master.
         Liu Long pondered for a moment before saying in a low voice,"There are some things that I didn't want to say, but ... I've told you before that everyone in the team has their own secrets. They all have their own reasons for staying in the Silver City. Wu Chao ... Wu Chao is actually Wu xinghong's grandson ..."
         Wu xinghong?
         Li Hao thought for a moment, but he had no impression of it. He glanced at Liu Long, who smiled and said,""You might not know his name, but he also has a nickname, verdure glider."
         "Oh!"
         Li Hao understood and was a little surprised."It's him ... He was a famous person back then. He wasn't among the 36 heroes because he wasn't strong, but he was the best in movement techniques. Many people say that he should be listed on the hero list!"
         He was not one of the thirty-six heroes, but he was known as the number one in Silvermoon's movement technique. This was not simple.
         Wu Chao was actually his grandson?
         "Then brother Chao ... Why is he in the team?"
         "Wu xinghong is dead. He was killed. Not only that, the Wu family was annihilated ... I heard that it was Fei Tian who did it. A super from Fei Tian seemed to have his eyes on their family's movement technique. I'm not sure who did it, but the Wu family was indeed annihilated."
         "Flying heavens?"
         Li Hao had a headache.
         Small teams, how interesting.
         His enemy was red Moon, Liu Yan's enemy was Yama, and now Wu Chao's enemy was flying heavens. Good Lord, the three major organizations had all gathered!
         "Yes, there are many flying assassins, and they come and go without a trace ... Although they may not be able to use the Martial master's movement technique, how can the flying assassins not be interested in the secret technique of the Silver Moon's number one movement technique?"
         Liu Long also shook his head and sighed,"at that time, Wu Chao wasn't at home. That's how he escaped. Later on, he came to Silver City. Because Silver City is remote and your teacher is here, he also knew that the night patrolmen were protecting your teacher. So, he came here to take refuge at the beginning."
         Li Hao understood.
         Of the five members of the demon hunting squad, he now knew about Liu Yan's situation and Wu Chao's situation. Only Chen Jian and Yun Yao's story was not mentioned.
         Obviously, there was a story behind it.
         Of course, Li Hao didn't care. Now that the three great organizations were all here, it didn't matter if he had another enemy.
         While the two were talking, Wu Chao kept running and jumping ... In the end, the swords gate Martial Master chose to give up because he couldn't hit the enemy. Plus, Wu Chao was Liu Long and Li Hao's old colleague, so he gave up after thinking for a while.
         The battle was over.
         Looking at the completely exhausted Wu Chao and Li Heng, then looking at the other four people, Li Hao directly said,""The four of them don't need to take the assessment anymore. They'll become the team leaders directly. Wu Chao, you and Li Heng don't have any objections, right?"
         What opinions could they have? the two of them didn't have any thoughts at all. At this moment, anyone could knock them down.
         However, the two of them were helpless and unwilling. In this way, one of them would be eliminated.
          Li Heng was very nervous, because he knew that Wu Chao was with Liu Long and was also Li Hao's former teammate. It was obvious that he didn't stand much of a chance if Li Hao had to choose.  "Guild leader ..."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Heng hurriedly said,"I've known old Wu before. Old Wu runs fast, but I'm not slow either ... I've thought about it. Why don't I be in the same team as old Wu? he'll be in charge of scouting, and I'll be in charge of killing the enemies. We'll be the team leaders, and the other eight members of the team will each get 40% of the battle achievements ..."
         "We're a little weaker than the other team leaders, but together, we're not weak!"
         He said it like he was the king!
         p In fact, he was afraid that he would be eliminated.  Even Li Hao laughed. "I haven't said anything yet, but you said it yourself." At this moment, Wu Chao was also panting from exhaustion. He thought for a while and said,"Leader, I think it's pretty good too ... Although Li Heng only knows the basics of catkin sword, his swordsmanship is pretty good ..."
         Li Heng glanced at him and cursed.
         This guy, he didn't get along with him in the Silver City, and now the two of them were together, he was speechless.
         "Then let's do this!"
         Li Hao didn't want to waste his time and said directly,""Then it's decided. As for the team members, you can choose them yourself! Whoever is willing to follow you, that's the best. If you're not willing, the rest will take turns to choose!"
         "It's best to be more unique. You can either attack and defend, or you can attack and defend ... But don't be too mixed. For example, learn from Wu Chao. The first team is full of people who can run. If you guys run fast, what about the others?"
         The crowd burst into laughter.
         "That's all for today," Li Hao said."Make some arrangements. We'll form a team by tonight and set off tomorrow morning!"
         Liu Long was a little speechless. This was too fast.
         He knew what Li Hao was thinking. This guy wanted to do big business, and he wasn't the kind of person who would do small things.
         Seeing that Li Hao had left, he quickly followed him and said in a low voice,""This team has just been formed, and we are not familiar with each other yet. Wouldn't it be too abrupt to set off tomorrow morning?"
         "Buy us some time!"
         Li Hao said via voice transmission, I'm not afraid of danger. I will first choose the weaker ones for them to train in battle. I won't start off with the stronger ones. Boss, do you still not trust my judgment?"
         Liu Long thought for a moment and nodded.
         This one was trustworthy.
         "Then, if we encounter a powerful existence ..."
         "I'm not afraid even under the light of dawn! If we really encounter Xuguang ... Boss, just take your men and run first, I'll stop you!"
         The rising light!
         This previously unfathomable level seemed very ordinary in Li Hao's words.
         He would stop the rising light if it appeared.
         Liu Long was silent. Although Li Hao was strong, how could he let Li Hao fight against Xuguang?
          "I know."
         Liu Long replied in a muffled voice and didn't say anything else.
         Li Hao didn't say anything else. He went to the Golden spear office to borrow some divine power stones. Yes, he wanted to borrow some and return them when he came back. Injuries were unavoidable for martial masters. In order to not reduce the number of people in the battle, he had to have sufficient sword power.
         He would first borrow a few dozen or a hundred, and when he returned, he would naturally have the money to pay off his debts.
         As for whether the sword energy could be revealed, that was fine. When the time came, there would naturally be other explanations.
         At this moment, Li Hao had some wild ambitions ...... If he could strengthen this demon hunt squad, he would have some helpers to use in the future. Fighting alone was convenient, but sometimes it would also be a waste of time.
         Soon, Li Hao walked out of the office.
         After a long period of silence, Jin gun finally managed to borrow 30 divine power stones. The price was that he took 50 sets of black armor. If he could not return the rest, the remaining 50 sets would belong to the Wei Wu Army.
         The 50 sets of black armor were obviously more valuable than 30 divine power stones. Divine power stones were consumables, but black armor was not.
         Li Hao didn't haggle too much. He was confident that he could return the money.
        
         15th of September.
         Before the sky was completely bright, a small team of 50 people gathered at the entrance of the Wei Wu Army.
         Hong Qing, Hong Hao, Wang Chao, and Liu Yan had successfully formed their own teams. Needless to say, Hong Qing and Hong Hao were all sword cultivators, disciples of the swords gate.
         The people that Wang Chao and Liu Yan brought were almost all from the inspection Office.
         Only Li Heng and Wu Chao had picked the remaining people from the others, so the whole team seemed a little messy.
         At this moment, everyone was a little nervous.
         Some of the swords gate disciples were out on a mission for the first time, and although they trained hard, they still felt uneasy when they were dragged out to kill people.
         At this moment, Li Hao strode over.
         He looked at the crowd and nodded slightly. He said in a low voice,""Everyone's here. Get in the car. The team leaders will teach everyone how to use the black sniper!"
         Last night, after he had retrieved the black banner, Li Hao knew how the Wei Wu Army used it.
          The black Phoenix had a special device. Its surface looked smooth, but there were actually a few bumps on it. As long as he unlocked it in order, the black Phoenix could be opened naturally. This was something Li Hao didn't expect.
         Li Hao didn't know how hou Xiaochen had figured it out.
         At this moment, two mini trucks were parked in front of the Wei Wu Army's building. They were specially used for the Wei Wu Army and had their own drivers. They did not need a driver and could drive themselves.
         "Team one and team two, get into the car in front. Team three, four, and five, get into the car behind!"
         Li Hao ordered. Liu Long was in the truck in front, while team one and team two were led by Hong Qing and Liu Yan.
         The few female martial masters in the group were almost all divided between the two of them.
         Everyone quickly got into their respective cars. As martial masters, although they had not undergone professional training, everyone knew how to follow simple instructions. This was especially so for those people from the inspection Office, who had also received professional training.
         ……
         In the second car, three groups of people got on one after another.
         Li Hao didn't enter. Instead, he disappeared.
         The Wei Wu Army's carriage was specially made. The carriage was not completely sealed. There was no roof, and there were openings in the surrounding carriages for them to observe if there were any enemies.
         Li Heng was a talkative person. When he got into the car and saw that Li Hao wasn't there, he started to nag,""There are 30 of us, and we'll squeeze into one car. There are 20 people in front. Also, old Wu's and my team only has 9 people. Vice-commander Liu is a warrior of the thousand, and the regiment commander has included him ... Do we still dare to command Regiment commander Liu?"
         No one paid him any attention.
         Li Heng was very depressed."Also, we just got to know our own team last night. We're not even familiar with the other teams, and the leader hurriedly dragged us out to carry out a mission. This is too ... That!"
         He had never seen anyone like this.
         ,m Fortunately, this time, they were only going around the area. Many people actually treated it as an outing. The new regiment commander had to follow the circumstances. Li Heng had been in the inspection Office for many years, so he understood this.  Saying all this was just to gain some acknowledgment and a sense of existence.
         At this moment, Wang Chao ignored him. As Wang Henggang's nephew, Wang Henggang had told him before he left that Li Hao ... Wasn't a kind person. Although he was young, the disciple of old demon Yuan was no simple person.
          Be careful. When you're in the Wei Wu Army, just be obedient.  Therefore, Wang Chao didn't say much. He turned to his team and said,""Put on your black armor!"
         After saying that, he began to guide everyone to put on the black armor. Some of them curiously put it on, and soon, someone said,""Captain Wang, it's quite heavy. It'll affect my movement. Why don't I take it off? this is white moon City ..."
         "Put it on!"
         Wang Chao mumbled. Of course, the black armor was a little heavy, but to a Martial Master, it wasn't too heavy. The impact wasn't too great. Furthermore, the armor wasn't stiff, so it didn't affect his movements much.
         It wouldn't be a big problem if they got used to it.
         Obviously, the powerhouses of the ancient civilization had also considered this and would not casually make armor that would affect their combat power.
         Upon seeing this, Hong Hao also instructed his team members to start dressing up.
         The carriage wasn't too big. If they didn't wear armor, they could still squeeze in. But with armor on, the 29 martial masters seemed a little crowded.
         Seeing that the others in front of him had started to put on their clothes, Li Heng nagged and told the others in the team to put on their clothes.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Soon, the entire carriage was filled with black-armored warriors.
         "Everyone, do you know where we are going today? The Guild leader didn't even mention the destination ..."
         Wu Chao put on his armor and could not help but say,""Why do you have so many questions?"
         "Old Wu, aren't you curious?"
         "I'm not curious. "
         "That's true. You've worked with our Regiment commander before. Old Wu, do you think our Regiment commander ... Ahem, is he reliable?"
         Wu Chao ignored him.
         Was he reliable?
          You're asking me?
         How would I know!
         Li Hao was quite reliable, but he was also quite bold. Last night, he chatted with Liu Long for a while. Although Liu Long didn't say it directly, he hinted that Li Hao should be more careful this time.
         ……
         The two trucks, one in front and one behind, left the Wei Wu army camp.
         And Li Hao had already reached the front.
         He didn't take a car but sped along the way. His speed wasn't any slower than a car.
         Before long, he found Wang Ming, who was yawning in the sports car.
         Wang Ming didn't sense Li Hao's arrival until he was close enough. He quickly stood up in alarm."Li Hao ... You're too early!"
         Li Hao glanced at him and said nothing,""I told you last night. Are you sure you want to come with me?"
        
         "Of course!"
         Wang Ming said excitedly,"you don't say. Ever since I hung out with you a few times, going back to the night patrol is too boring. I heard you're going out for field training. Take me with you. I promise I won't cause any trouble."
         "The Wei Wu Army doesn't recruit supers because, on one hand, it's inconvenient to cooperate with each other. On the other hand, it's also to hide ... Do you understand?"
         "En!"
         Wang Ming nodded. Of course he understood; Li Hao had told him about it last night.
         Seeing this, Li Hao added,"since you want to join, I won't refuse. You only have one mission. Be the bait!" Supers are easily discovered. You're not weak, it'll be best if you can lure some supers out to target you!"
         "Don't come with us ... If you go alone and something happens to you ... I won't be responsible! The danger is not small. If an expert quickly appears and quickly kills you ... I will at least maintain a distance of 1000 meters from you. At the very least, whether you can avoid it or not ... It's all up to you!"
         Li Hao didn't refuse Wang Ming's offer to join.
         It just so happened that he was lacking a bait.
         Although he had good eyes, he couldn't really search bit by bit. It was best if Wang Ming could draw out a group of superpowers.
          However, being bait was definitely filled with great danger.
         Wang Ming grinned,"as long as the benefits are in place, there's no problem with being bait!" Days like this ... Are more exciting!"
         "If we don't kill a few three suns this time, we'll be letting ourselves down for waking up so early, right?"
         This fellow's appetite was not small now.
         Li Hao glanced at him. Old Wang was getting more and more daring.
         Li Hao nodded slightly.
         Wang Ming coughed lightly."Oh, that's right. Senior ... Brother li. Can I add one more person?"
         "What?"
         "That Zhou Qin from last time ... He's the one who raises the Tiger."
         Wang Ming explained,"it'll be suspicious if I run around alone." The other one is from riyao, running around and doing nothing. Superpowers aren't stupid either, and they look like bait ... If Zhou Qin is with me, we can race, stroll around, or look like Playboys out for fun ... If we're alone, we don't look like that. "
         "He's Yue Ming, right?"
         "That's right. The level of a full moon and a Dark Moon is indeed a little weak ..."
         Li Hao said calmly,"this is killing someone, you know it yourself!" You should know how dangerous it is. We're not going on a trip. If you insist on bringing him along, it's not impossible. But if he dies, I won't care!"  Li Hao wasn't a babysitter when a moon nether-level superhuman wanted to go out and have fun. He didn't ask Wang Ming to find anyone else, and he wouldn't care if Wang Ming died.
         Zhou Qin ... His surname was Zhou. He didn't know if he was related to Deputy Director Zhou of the administration Bureau.
         However, Li Hao didn't really care.
         He didn't care if they were related or not.
         Wang Ming grinned."It's fine. If he's dead, then he's dead. This guy just wants to get excited. If he really dies, I guarantee no one will say anything. Senior brother, I won't hide it from you. My friend is sick from holding it in. If he wasn't sick, would he have gone to catch a tiger to play? With him around, if it's not inconvenient, you can bring two female companions and drive a car. That's what a real tour is like. With a few bodyguards ... One look and I can tell that he's a young master from a rich family out for fun. I guarantee that no one will suspect anything!"
         This was his own thought. He felt that this was the only way to make it look like bait.
         The bait was two men, and both of them had superpowers.
         Seeing that Li Hao didn't say anything, Wang Ming said,"If senior brother wants to find someone ... I'll find someone immediately. I guarantee that it'll be done quickly without any delay! Needless to say, the female companion is also my friend. They're all people who look for excitement, the kind who don't blame others if they die! As for bodyguards, it doesn't really matter. After all, we are all supers. Young people are bold and it's normal for them to look down on others. "
         Li Hao looked at him with a frown.
         To be honest, he didn't quite understand what these people were thinking. These second-generation heirs seemed to be a little different. They weren't like what he had imagined. Each and every one of them was looking for some excitement.
         If he were one of them, Li Hao felt that he wouldn't have the intention to seek death and excitement.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Seeing that Li Hao didn't respond, Wang Ming hurriedly said,""If senior brother thinks it's inappropriate, then so be it. I just wanted to disguise myself more perfectly."
          Li Hao thought for a while and said,'there aren't any descendants of important people, right? The kind that finds fault after they die?"
         "No, I didn 't!"
         Wang Ming immediately said,"even if I do, I won't look for trouble. Don't worry about that, senior brother. Would I cheat my own people?"
         Li Hao raised his eyebrows and glanced at him. After a long while, he said,""Ol 'Wong, do as you see fit. I won't care about you from now on. You go your way and I'll go mine. There's no need for us to contact each other. You just need to lure out a large number of evil superhumans ... I don't care about the rest!"
         Wang Ming immediately nodded and said,"then the target is ...""
         "First, follow the main road and head towards the crosscut Canyon! I will contact you again when we reach the transverse Canyon. We will cross the gorge or simply sweep through the gorge ... There must be a superpower hiding there!"
         "Understood!"
         Wang Ming hurriedly nodded, a little excited. This was going to be a big business!
         Ever since he returned to Whitemoon city, he had been feeling bored. There were not many missions and exciting battles. He was only one step away from the middle stage of the sun glory realm, but he had not been able to break through.
         He couldn't get his spirits up now because of the night patrolman's small missions.
        
         Even though the night watchmen had been dealing with the three major organizations for the past few days, it was all talk and no action. Hao lianchuan and his men had killed some of the red moon's men, but the strongest was just sunlight. They were quickly killed.
         A large number of people were dispatched to kill a few Crimson moons, and the benefits they got ... Were not even enough to fill the gaps between their teeth!
         Li Hao didn't say anything more. He turned around and left.
         Wang Ming was quite well-informed. Of course, this was also because Li Hao didn't keep it a secret from him. If this guy wanted to take a risk ... Then let him be.
         This was Li Hao's attitude towards martial masters and superpowers.
         He wasn't a child anymore, so he had to take responsibility for himself.
         Wang Ming was right; in that case, they would look more like second generation travelers ... But in fact, they weren 't; they had always been.
         ……
         Not long after, Li Hao caught up to the two cars of the Wei Wu Army.
          He stopped running and quickly jumped into the second car. Li Heng and the others were so shocked that they almost thought that the enemy had attacked. Fortunately, they quickly saw Li Hao's appearance and heaved a sigh of relief.
         ……
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At the night patrollers 'headquarters.
         Hou Xiaochen had returned.
         At this moment, he was caressing the blazing Phoenix spear, as if he was trying to comprehend something. After a long while, he chuckled lightly, seemingly having come to a realization.
         Li Hao!
         As expected, it's you!
         I didn't expect you to break the spirit-splitting Spear's consciousness.
         At this moment, Chief Steward Yu knocked on the door and entered. He said softly,""Li Hao went out with his people. He just formed the team yesterday, and he went out today before he even knows who the members are ... Li Hao's resume didn't mention that he was so radical!"
         Li Hao's background was clear. He was a young man who planned before making a decision. He wasn't as impatient as he appeared to be.
         The red moon murder case had been exposed in Silver City because of Li Hao.
         If Li Hao hadn't been tracking them down for a year, perhaps no one would have known that they had all died at the hands of Red Moon even after Li Hao's death. Red moon's actions were very secretive.
         But why was Li Hao so impatient now?
         Hou Xiaochen gently stroked his spear and said,"He has his own thoughts. Perhaps he has seen more and experienced more, and he has felt the difference in strength. In addition, he might want to support Yuan Shuo, or rather, take some of the pressure off Yuan Shuo ... Yuan Shuo went to the central continent to kill the people of the Crimson Moon. Do you think Yuan Shuo is really that crazy?"  Chief Steward Yu pondered for a while and said softly,""Head of Department, you mean ... Yuan Shuo was so bold and arrogant just to divert Hongyue's attention?"
         "What else?"
         Hou Xiaochen looked into the distance and sighed,"His disciple is a thorn in Red moon's side, and silver Moon has become a quarrelsome place. If he doesn't come out to divert the attention of those experts, orange moon and yellow moon, who are chasing him now, might be on their way to deal with Li Hao!"
         If Yuan Shuo didn't cause trouble, how could Hong Yue have mobilized so many strong cultivators? who was the target?
         It was Li Hao!
         Many people could understand this logic.
         Even Ying Hongyue was able to see it clearly.
         However, compared to dealing with Li Hao, who was still unknown, Yuan Shuo had to be dealt with. Everyone knew how terrifying Yuan Shuo was. This guy had broken through the shackles. If he was left alone, he would soon become a major threat!
         If it wasn't for the fact that Ying Hongyue couldn't leave, he would definitely deal with Yuan Shuo personally. Cheng Yue and Huang Yue, the second and third-ranked people in the entire Hongyue, were currently ignoring the countless major events in the central continent and focusing on dealing with Yuan Shuo. This was evident.
         Ying Hongyue had already attached great importance to Yuan Shuo!
         Blue Moon and purple moon's main target in Silver Moon was actually Li Hao. The ruins and hou Xiaochen were secondary. Blue moon's plan was to take Li Hao away when she fought hou Xiaochen.
         In order to deal with the master and disciple, Red Moon had placed the core of July and April on them.
          Hou Xiaochen continued,"you said that Li Hao is a man who plans before he acts. Why did he stop?" He was running out of time. His master had gone to the central region alone for his sake. Otherwise, if Yuan Shuo had kept a low profile, who would have been able to find him? Li Hao also understands this. Just because he doesn't say it doesn't mean he doesn't understand. If you think he doesn't understand, then you're underestimating him!"
         Chief Steward Yu nodded slightly.
         However, he was still a little confused."He's not Yuan Shuo's only disciple. He's only taken Li Hao in for three years. They might be close, but is Li Hao worth Yuan Shuo paying such a huge price for?"
         "Li Hao is one thing, but there's another thing ... Yuan Shuo himself is unwilling to accept this!"
         Hou Xiaochen seemed to know Yuan Shuo very well, and he laughed, "He's not willing to accept that those who were inferior to him in the past can step on him now! Before this, he was in despair and dejected, so he didn't show it. However, as he saw an opportunity ... Once these people seized the opportunity, they could use 10 points for every opportunity. "Yuan Shuo also wants to give himself some pressure. Only in a life-and-death situation will he have a greater chance of catching up to those who have surpassed him."
         "Tian Jian, BA Dao, and the others are still alive and doing well. Ying Hongyue is even more so. Southern Fist and golden spear are also doing well. There are also some of his old friends in the central region. Do you think Yuan Shuo will be satisfied?"
         These two reasons caused Yuan Shuo to go crazy.
         From Linjiang, he had killed his way to the central region. Although he had hidden his whereabouts, he would be exposed every time he killed someone. He would not hide too much. He wanted to put himself in an extremely dangerous situation at all times.
         Such madness made many of the people who were paying attention to him feel uneasy.
        
         If this person didn't die, he would probably be a huge problem in the future.
         From the moment he killed the three suns, Yuan Shuo had even begun killing peak three suns experts.
         The Jade light sword that was with him was also said to have stepped into the spirit accumulation stage.
         In the beginning, the Azure light sword seemed to be only comparable to some weaker early three yang realm martial artists. Not long after, news came that the Azure light sword had killed an early three yang realm martial artist with a fast sword technique. Once these senior martial masters seized the opportunity, they quickly and madly became stronger.
         At this moment, Chief Steward Yu understood everything.
         "Can't you tell?"hou Xiaochen laughed. Why are you asking me?"
         Yu Luosha wasn't a fool.
         Fool, you can't be the night patrolman's manager.
         She was in charge of the night patrolmen, so hou Xiaochen didn't really care much.
         Chief Steward Yu pondered for a while and said,"I can see some of Li Hao's thoughts, but I'm still a little confused. He is very confident, or rather, very calm ... Whether he saw the Golden spear or an even stronger existence, he seemed to be respectful, but he was not too shocked or shocked. This doesn't match his identity. He comes from the Silver City, and has not been out much since he was young ... How could he do this?"
          "It's only natural that I'm so knowledgeable. "
         Hou Xiaochen wasn't surprised at all."Perhaps he saw something, an incomparably powerful existence. That's why he dared to swing his sword, swing his sword to split the gods! After seeing a higher world, your strength might not be as good, but why should you be shocked by a lower world?"
         "Do we need to send someone to protect him in secret?" Chief Steward Yu nodded thoughtfully.
         Li Hao was a thorn in Red moon's side.
         Perhaps Hong Yue was also concerned about his whereabouts.
         The red moon might not know about it now, but it would find out sooner or later that Li Hao had gone out and was no longer in white moon City.
         At that time, it would be a crisis.
         "No need ... Every Martial Master has to walk their own path," hou Xiaochen said with a smile. He won't die so easily. If he dies, it means that he's lacking some luck. Just continue to put pressure on the Crimson Moon and keep some of their powerhouses in check. Whether Li Hao can break the Crimson Moon's seal or not is up to him. "
         "You didn't treat Yuan Shuo this way back then ..."
         "Can the Blue Moon compare to Ying Hongyue?"
         Hou Xiaochen's face grew serious,"Although Ying Hongyue was scolded by Yuan Shuo and his disciple to be worthless, you know what kind of person he is. He was able to lead Hongyue to rise rapidly. He's not someone trash like LAN Yue can compare to. Moreover, LAN Yue is only the second generation of LAN Yue!"
         He attached great importance to Ying Hongyue. In fact, no one dared to ignore her.
         She was one of the leaders of the three great organizations and an existence that could run amuck in the central region. Whoever looked down on Ying Hongyue would be out of luck sooner or later.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Understood!"
         Chief Steward Yu did not say anything more.
         Just as he was about to leave, hou Xiaochen thought for a moment before saying,"You ... Get ready!"
         Chief Steward Yu's footsteps faltered slightly.
         "It's about time,"hou Xiaochen said softly,"let's give it a try. He could give it a try once sunrise started. The drawbacks were still not completely resolved, but there were some ways to make up for it. The effects of the blood God were still acceptable. Of course, there aren't an infinite number of blood gods, and there aren't many at the suguang level either. The Crimson Moon will take back all of them sooner or later ..."
         "So, hurry up before the Crimson Moon takes this step!"
         The clones of the blood God could make up for some of the disadvantages, but these things were not unlimited.
         This was a plan that only treated the symptoms but not the root of the problem.
         Only Yuan Shuo's breathing technique of five birds, if successfully adapted, might be the true cure. This was the reason why so many powerhouses had their eyes on Yuan Shuo. Even if the effect was slightly worse than the blood God, there must be a truly suitable cultivation technique.  Otherwise, when the blood deities were all used up, what would they do next?
         Not everyone could use external objects to solve the drawbacks.
         This wasn't the normal path either!
         Chief Steward Yu let out a light breath and nodded,""Alright!"
         The day had finally come.
         Return to Martial Master!
         She no longer mentioned the name Yu Luosha, because she was no longer the Yu Luosha of the pugilistic world.
         But now ... If he successfully returned, the rampaging Yu Luosha of the past would be back.
         "I've made some preparations, but they might not be enough,"hou Xiaochen said with a serious expression. If I fail ..."
         His powers were destroyed and his body was heavily injured.
         It was not that simple to become a Martial Master.
         The price of failure was almost no different from death, and success would leave behind many problems. All of these could only be fixed when there was a greater opportunity.
         "It doesn't matter!"
         However, Chief Steward Yu did not care. She was not afraid of failure.
         "Then go back and cultivate for a few days. Don't worry about those trivial things for the next few days."
         "I know."
         Chief Steward Yu left.
         After she left, hou Xiaochen coughed, shook his head, and sighed.
         He looked out of the window and thought to himself,'is there anyone who has completely resolved these after-effects?'
         Even silver Moon and the others could not.
         What about the central region?
          What about the royal family?
         What about Jiusi?
         What about the top existences of the three great organizations?
         There were also some fellows in hiding in the provinces, how were they now?
         Whoever took this step first, perhaps ... Would be the time for the turmoil to erupt completely.
         Now, the balance was still maintained.
         It was unknown how many existences like him there were, but there would definitely be a lot. They were all waiting for the right time.
         ……
         At the same time.
         It was a dark place, like a cave or a karst cave, with a dark environment.
        
         A black shadow suddenly appeared in the deathly silent cave.
         "Pavilion master, Li Hao seems to have left white moon City,"
         The cloaked man, flying heavens.
         The powerhouses in charge of the province were all known as Pavilion Masters. It was obvious that the mountain where Fei Tian lived in Silver Moon was located here.
         In the darkness, Banshan's voice slowly came,""Li Hao ... Instead of obediently hiding in white moon City, he came out when the Crimson Moon is gathering the Silver Moon ... Yuan Shuo's disciple is as bold as Yuan Shuo!"
         "Pavilion master, do we need to do anything?"
         "No need ... Just continue to watch! Red Moon has been in Silver Moon for many years, and hou Xiaochen won't be able to cut off their spies so easily. He can hide it for now, but he can't hide it forever. Red Moon will find out Li Hao's whereabouts sooner or later ... Let's keep an eye on him first!"
         "Yes!"
         Soon, the cloaked man who reported disappeared.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com After a while, some light appeared in the cave.
          In the darkness, Banshan was not the only one. There was also a cloaked man, but it was so quiet that it was frightening. It was so quiet that it was frightening. He was not discovered by the person from before.
         "Elder, is Li Hao really the only successor of the eight great families?" Banshan asked.
         Elder.
         The flying organization was extremely mysterious. Even the night patrolmen knew very little about the flying organization. They were similar to an assassin organization. They would kill for money. Of course, what they wanted was not money, but cultivation treasures.
         The night patrolman did not know much about the structure of the flying sky. It was the most mysterious of the three major organizations, but he knew a little about the general situation. There was an Elder Council in the flying sky, and they were all top assassins.
         In the dark, the cloaked elder's voice was a little hoarse.""There might be others alive, but on the surface, it's only Li Hao! However ... Who knew if the one from the red moon was one of the eight great families? His understanding of the eight great families is much greater than ours. All these years, Hongyue has always been the one to set up the trap first while we follow closely behind ... Ying Hongyue, is her surname really Ying?"
         Banshan also fell silent.
         That's right, Ying Hongyue was also a member of the Silver Moon martial forest. Whether she was one of the eight great families or not, Fei Tian and Yan Luo had also guessed it, but they didn't have many clues. Whether she was or wasn't important now.
         After Li Hao was exposed in Silver City, the information about the eight great families was completely revealed. Now, Red Moon no longer hid anything.
         "Then should we make the first move? Once Li Hao is captured by Hong Yue, some uncontrollable things might happen. For the sake of the eight great families, Hong Yue has been very careful and has been planning in the Silver City for more than ten years. It's obvious that she's planning something big!"
         "Let's just wait and see ... Hou Xiaochen and the others are still here. They won't let Hongyue succeed!"
         "Yes."
         The conversation ended there, but Fei Tian would not really ignore it. As the messengers of the darkness, they would always pay attention to this.
         ……
         The two trucks gradually left white moon City.
         The bustling city gradually faded away.
         Li Hao looked into the distance and around. He was looking at the ball of light. His departure from the city might have attracted some attention.
         Was someone following him?
         After observing for a while, he did not find any tracking superpower. There were no light orbs within a thousand meters. Or were they too weak for him to see?
         The car drove on the main road.
         The journey was bumpy, and after a few hours of driving, it was drowsy.
         It was not until the car passed through a forest that everyone perked up. Before they could think further, they heard Li Hao's voice."Get out of the car!"
         In an instant, the martial masters quickly got off the car.
         Some didn't even have time to react before they were pulled down by a force.  A group of martial masters in black armor landed on the ground.
         The two trucks were still moving.
         Li Hao didn't stop. Instead, huge rocks appeared in his hands out of thin air and he stuffed them into the carriage. He then opened the roof of the carriage to cover it.
         The voice rang in the ears of the two drivers,""Don't stop all the way. When we reach yaoguang city, you guys can go down and eat. We'll solve our own food problem!"
         These were the chauffeurs arranged by the Wei Wu Army. They weren't strong, but they were very obedient and wouldn't disobey the orders of a Centurion.
         The two drivers didn't think too much about it and continued driving.
         However, there was a lack of voice in his ears. In the second car, Li Heng, that talkative guy, seemed to have stopped talking.
         ……
         Li Hao looked ahead until the truck was far away. Then he said,""Be careful and don't leave too many traces. This is the forest area of the celestial mountain. We'll walk on the mountain and climb over it. We'll move out only when it's dark!"
         Everyone looked at each other and felt that there was no need.
         But at this moment, no one dared to refute.
         Some martial masters who knew about the situation in this forest all complained in their hearts.
         This forest had a large radiation range. It wasn't too far to go through it directly, but once one crossed the mountains and went over from another direction, it would be at least a hundred miles of mountain road.
         At this moment, everyone was wearing black armor. Even a Martial Master would be exhausted.
         A moment later, the group of 51 people did not make too much noise. They quickly began to walk through the forest and disappeared on the road.
         ……
         Outside the forest of the heavenly Mountain.
         Far away, someone was holding a specially made telescope and observing.
         When the two trucks drove out of the forest, the observer from afar frowned slightly. The truck's roof had been open before, so why was it closed now?
         Was it because the sun was too bright?
         Or was it to hide?
         As such, it was not easy to observe.
         This was the disadvantage of being a Martial Master. If one didn't observe closely, they wouldn't be able to detect anything. It was very troublesome.
          If it was a truckload of supers, they didn't need to be watched. Wherever they went, they would be like light bulbs, and the strong could easily observe the other party's whereabouts.
         ……
         On this day, Li Hao's departure from the city attracted the attention of many people.
         The two trucks filled with martial masters were also in the sights of some people.
         After all, they knew that Liu Long had entered the Qian warrior realm, and Li Hao was likely to have done the same. A Qian warrior's Shi was very sharp.
         It was not until the car drove into yaoguang city, the driver finished his meal, got in the car, and waited for the next order that the truck still did not move. This attracted some attention, but no one dared to approach and observe.
         The sky gradually turned dark.
         On the other side, a group of second-generation rich kids were driving their sports cars. The handsome men and beautiful women were talking and laughing as they headed towards the cross-section Canyon, attracting some attention.
         However, he didn't care too much. They were just a group of people who came out to get some fresh air.
         At this moment, Li Hao had already led the members of the demon hunt squad through several mountain forests, avoiding all the places where the balls of light existed. The group of 51 people didn't cause the slightest disturbance, and disappeared from everyone's sight.
        
         At the edge of the heavenly Wood Mountain forest.
         The night fell.
         Like a stone statue, Li Hao stood still. Some of the armored warriors behind him were breathing weakly.
         Tired.
         They had been running the whole day, and it was all mountain roads. This was a real field training. They didn't eat or drink.
         They didn't understand what Li Hao was doing.
         Find the enemy?
         Search for the members of the three major organizations?
         But ... Was there such a way to search?
         If he continued to climb, he would reach the crosscut Canyon. If that was the case, he might as well take a car there. At least it would be easier.
          Those who broke through 100 were still fine, but some of the martial masters in the tenth realm were already unable to hold on.
         It was super tiring.
         Everyone's faces were covered by black armor, so nothing could be seen. However, some of the people in the team were clearly resentful. They didn't understand and were dissatisfied with Li Hao's actions, because Li Hao didn't give them any explanation.
         At this moment, Li Hao said,"rest here for half an hour. Eat something and drink some water. If it's convenient, do it as soon as possible. Don't leave the team. Stay here. We'll set off again in half an hour!"
         "Reporting, regimental commander, where's our destination?" someone couldn't help but ask in a low voice.
         "Just follow!"
         Li Hao didn't give an exact answer. He didn't know where they were going.
         His destination would be wherever the members of the three major organizations were.
         Not far away, Liu Long took out some rations and water from his storage ring and distributed them to everyone. Here, other than Li Hao, only Liu Long had a storage ring, which Li Hao had given him.
         When he killed Yu Xiao and Huang Jie, he had obtained two.
         He gave one of them to Liu Long and asked him to collect some items.
         A moment later, Liu Long walked over.
         In the team, only Li Hao and Liu Long did not wear armor.
         Liu Long's expression was grave as he looked at Li Hao. He knew that Li Hao was trying to avoid the gazes of some people, but ... If this continued, he would even avoid the gazes of the Wei Wu Army and the night patrols.
         The Wei Wu Army had a special tracking device, but when Li Hao got out of the car, he threw it into the truck.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Therefore, they were a lone Army that had lost contact.
         As for the others, they had not had the time to equip themselves with these tracking devices. They had only joined the Wei Wu Army for a short time.
         "Do you have a target?"  Liu Long asked in a low voice. Li Hao took out a map and pointed at a place,""This is the preparation work done by department head Hao from the night patrols. He has locked onto some areas that may be the strongholds of the three major organizations. However, now that the red moon is marching in, he has given up on searching. This is a good thing for me. "
         Was this considered cheap?
         Li Hao continued."This is the closest place to the transverse Canyon. It's possible that the Crimson Moon stronghold is here. I've already asked Wang Ming to go there first. Perhaps we can lure some people out."
         As he spoke, Li Hao also took a bite of the hard flatbread and said in a low voice,""We'll sneak over tonight. It's still early. If we rush over and everything goes smoothly, the other party might also have their eyes on Wang Ming ... Let's follow the trail and clean up this stronghold!"
         Liu Long looked at the map and said in a deep voice, "There's still nearly a hundred li left. Can everyone hold on?"
         ,m "I did it on purpose. There's not much inner strength in cutting Ten Realms. I'm going to exhaust them!"  Li Hao said in a low voice,"only when they are exhausted can we continue their old strength. If we can obtain some Red Shadows or mysterious energy and absorb them all, the effect will be the best!"
         This was reasonable, but Liu Long felt that this might lead to some complaints from the team.
         However, after thinking about it, he didn't bother about it anymore.
         Half an hour later, Li Hao shouted,""Let's continue forward. If anyone falls behind, I'll knock you out and leave you here. If any wild beasts or martial masters pass by at night and die ... Don't blame me!"
         As soon as he said this, some of the martial masters of the tenth realm almost cursed. Are you still human?
         People had to bow their heads under the eaves. No matter how resentful they were, they could only follow silently. Some of the 100-odd martial masters would also help out when they encountered some difficult roads.
         Martial masters weren't that weak, but once they used up all their inner strength, they weren't much different from ordinary people.
         ……
         About 50 miles away from the cross-section Canyon, there was a large lake surrounded by green trees. The environment was beautiful and the scenery was good, but because it was far from the city, not many people would come here.
         Usually, this place was extremely quiet at night.
         Tonight, two men and three women had set up camp here, had a bonfire party, and were having a picnic here.
          The tent was set up by the lake.
         The five of them laughed and ate the barbecue. The smell of the meat and the wine made people drool.
         The laughter was very loud, but if one looked closely, they could see that they were all nervous.
         Of the two men, one was Wang Ming, and the other was naturally Zhou Qin, the one who had caught the Tiger back then.
         At this moment, Zhou Qin was eating a barbeque. He was smiling, but his eyes were filled with anxiety. In fact, some cases had happened in this place before. People often disappeared here. It was not a good place.
         However ... This time, they were going to these places.
         Excitement was what they were after.
         After taking a few bites, Zhou Qin lowered his voice."Old Wang ..."
         Wang Ming laughed, but when he heard that he was about to speak, he shook his head and laughed."This place is so beautiful. White moon City is such a ghostly place. It's so annoying to stay here for a long time!"
         The other women quickly chimed in.
        
         There was some nervousness in their eyes, but there was also some excitement in their nervousness. They pursued excitement and knew what they were doing on this trip. At this moment, they couldn't wait for someone to watch them from all directions.
         ……
         In fact, there were indeed people following him.
         The five rich kids were all supers, so they didn't see any storage rings, but each of them was wearing a few. The flashy Wang Ming had Five Rings on both his hands.
         The storage ring was quite valuable.
         This was not the main point. The main point was that almost all storage rings stored a large amount of mysterious energy. A single ring could usually store 1000 cubic meters of mysterious energy.
         These rich kids might not have that many.
         But even if a ring had a reserve of one hundred cubic meters, Wang Ming alone had five. Five hundred cubic meters of mysterious energy ... Aside from the top-class powerhouses, it was a great temptation to any superpower.
         Besides, Wang Ming wasn't the only one here.
          A total of five!
         As for the others, Zhou Qin was also wearing rings.
         About 500 meters away from them, two figures appeared underground. One of them was releasing his Earth Power to open up a space underground, while the other's ears were twitching and growing longer.
         After a while, the superpower with the long ears whispered,""They're chatting about some trivial matters. However, one of them revealed his identity ... One of them is surnamed Wang. I think he's an early stage sunlit stage super and has a high status. His family has some power in the White Dragon Army."
         "The White Dragon Army?"
         The earth element expert pondered for a while and thought of something. He said in a low voice,""The White Dragon Army's vice Commander-in-Chief's surname is Wang. This guy ... I think I know who he is. He's Wang Ming from the Wang family and is known as a peerless genius! The night patrolman's superpower ..."
         "Night patrolman?"
         The long-eared superpower frowned.
         "I'm fine, what's wrong with the Nightwalker?"the earth Power whispered. From the looks of it, he's just here to have fun. Let's go back and report this first. We'll just be careful. "
         The two of them moved quickly. Not long after, they dug into the ground and continued to move forward. After a while, a space appeared in the ground. It was a large area solidified by the earth element. It was close to an acre in size.
         At this moment, there were quite a number of people coming and going in this underground building.
         It was only a few thousand meters away from Wang Ming's Lake.
         In the wilderness, it still existed dozens of meters underground. Under normal circumstances, it was almost impossible to be discovered.  As the two of them returned, one of the superpowers wearing a ghost mask said,""Long-ear is back. How is it? what's the situation?"
         "Five second-generation heirs, all descendants of officials in white moon City ..."
         Very quickly, the two of them explained the situation.
         A moment later, a burly man walked over from the distance. He didn't wear a mask, and his brows furrowed slightly."The night patrolmen ... Are they the bait?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "I didn't find anyone following us. As for the bait ... The five of them are descendants of government officials. One of them is a genius Night Watcher. It'll be troublesome if we lose them ... Will they use them as bait?" the earth Power replied.
         "Even if it's bait, Hao lianchuan isn't here, and hou Xiaochen isn't here ... We can still eat him!" Someone else laughed.
         "The other party has one sunlit and four Dark Moon ... They're not weak, but they're not a big deal either."
         "We still have to think it over carefully. Don't act rashly. That place is too close to our base. If they go missing, it'll easily attract powerful people to come and patrol ..."
         These people were talking one after another. Some wanted to eat those people, while others suggested that they be more cautious.
         This was indeed one of the Crimson Moon's strongholds. However, there used to be very few people here. Recently, with the arrival of a large number of Crimson moon's elites, there used to be only a dozen people here. Now, there were forty to fifty supers gathered here.
         Because of this, this place was a little chaotic. There were many people from different places. A small stronghold had people from three provinces here. There was no authority between each other.
         Therefore, there were different voices and suggestions when they spoke.
          This place was not far from the crosscut Canyon. They were here for a mission, which was to kill any lone supers. As long as they were not from the red moon, they could kill them.
         If they were too strong, then don't kill them, just record them. There were a few people here who were good at scouting. For example, long-ear, even though he was only at the level of a full moon, his ears could hear sounds within a thousand meters. This power was especially useful.
         Other than the long ears, there were also superpowers that were good at observing from afar. However, it was already late and it was inconvenient to observe, so he did not go over earlier.
         However, there were also experts in this place.
         The brawny man was an expert at the peak of the sun glory realm and was also the temporary commander of this place. Hearing the noise, he felt a headache and frowned."Alright! Be quiet! The night patrolman was not a big deal. As long as it was not a trap, whether he was killed or not, he was killed! Those bastards, they've killed many of our people these days. When has Hongyue ever been afraid of the night patrollers?"
         "After hou Xiaochen killed the red-haired elder, the Silver Moon officials have long since decided to fight us to the death!"
         After he finished speaking, he thought for a moment and said,"let's observe for a while longer. It's fine as long as he's not the bait set by the night patrollers. In addition, let the people in white moon City investigate whether there are any movements from the night patrollers."
         "Alright!"
         The group didn't say anything else. They had to dig underground every day, and with so many people and no way to cultivate properly, they were all panicking from holding back. When they thought of the three women outside, the soft and tender skin, and Wang Ming, who carried a large amount of mysterious energy ... Smiles appeared on their faces.
        
         Finally, he didn't have to stay here and do nothing.
         ……
         "Hu hu ..."
         The sound of breathing and gasping once again rang out in the group.
         At this moment, in the darkness, a group of people were running until they were about to collapse. Some of them leaned on their long swords and moved forward. They no longer cared about the value of their long swords and could not use them recklessly.
         In front of him, Li Hao stopped.
         He turned his head to look at Liu Long and transmitted his voice,"Wang Ming seems to be in the vicinity. I'll go take a look first. If I can attract some people ... Then I'll rest for a while and make a move!"
         Liu Long was also somewhat helpless because of this fellow.
         He had been running for an entire day!
         Li Hao ignored him and quickly disappeared.
          After a while, Li Hao saw five orbs. Wang Ming's wasn't small, but the other four weren 't.
         "This guy is really not afraid of death. He even brought 4 Dark Moon Warriors with him!"
         Li Hao was also speechless. He quickly approached, and his movements were very light. He had absorbed a lot of wind energy, and his deer eluding technique was not weak. In the darkness, he leaped a few hundred meters forward and instantly landed on a big tree.
         Looking in the direction of the fire, he saw Wang Ming, Zhou Qin, and three young girls.
         Li Hao didn't pay much attention to them. They were eating barbecue in the middle of the night. If someone paid attention to them, they would definitely notice.
         He looked around and did not miss the underground.
         His eyes were especially bright in the dark.
         Soon, Li Hao's eyes flickered, and he disappeared. When he reappeared, he was already on another tree.
         At this moment, a ball of light appeared in Li Hao's eyes. It wasn't very big, and he estimated that it was at the perfected Dark Moon realm.
         This ball of light wasn't underground, but in a tree. It was a wood element!
         Nearby, there was a wood element super hiding in a tree, observing the group.
         Li Hao looked around again to see if there were any Red Shadows.
         The people of the Crimson Moon loved to release Red Shadows to observe their targets because they were invisible and were often more useful than superpowers.
         He looked around and saw a small red shadow, but it was a distance away from the light. It was floating in the distance, and the red shadow was facing the direction of the wood element.
         Was he afraid of being watched, so he let the red shadow Watch from a distance?

         On the treetop, Li Hao smiled. He hadn't run in vain.
         The Dark Moon level supers obviously didn't dare to target Wang Ming's group.
         Therefore, there might be a Red Moon stronghold nearby.
         However, Li Hao didn't find anything after looking around.
         He waited in silence for a while. A moment later, there was a sudden movement underground. Li Hao's ears twitched. He focused his eyes and saw a ball of light.
         Earth element!
         Very quickly, the earth element managed to get close to the wood element and revealed his head.
          The two of them got close and seemed to be talking, but Li Hao didn't hear them clearly.  He didn't care and just watched the earth Esper leave. He didn't care about the person who was watching him anymore and followed the earth Esper.
         The earth descent power travelled a few thousand meters underground before disappearing.
         Li Hao was stunned.
         The ball of light was gone?
         He frowned slightly. The ball of light was gone ... This meant that the other party had gone deep underground. Earth-type experts usually wouldn't go too deep, because the deeper they went, the more pressure they would put on the other party.
         "The stronghold is underground?"
         Li Hao was a little surprised, but he soon felt relieved. As the number of supers increased and their abilities were developed, it did not seem difficult to build an underground stronghold. In fact, it would be more concealed.
         However, if they were too deep underground, Li Hao's observation would be affected.
         Li Hao landed lightly and pondered for a moment. Then, a fluctuation of the terrain began to seep into the ground. As the earth sword force burrowed into the ground and the Divine Will spread, Li Hao's range of observation increased.
         A moment later, his vision expanded along with the Divine Will and he sensed some supernatural fluctuations.
         The fluctuations of power could be felt clearly if one was close.
         Li Hao silently sensed it. A moment later, he had an idea.
         "There are four to five people in sunlight and more than thirty people in Dark Moon ... This is not a small stronghold!"
         Then, Li Hao looked around and vaguely saw some red figures.
         These guys from the Crimson Moon had hidden the red shadow very well, in some places that must be passed by. Once someone discovered this place, the other party would be able to sense it through the red shadow very quickly.
         Therefore, it was usually very difficult to hunt down the people of the red moon.
         Li Hao watched for a while, then quickly disappeared.
         ……
         After a while.
         Li Hao returned to the demon hunt squad's location.
         At this moment, some people were lying on the ground, exhausted.
         However, after resting for a while, he felt much better.
          With Li Hao's return, those who had sat down could only stand up again.
         "We've found the enemy!"
         Li Hao didn't hesitate. He said,"there's a Crimson Moon stronghold in front. There are about 40 people. There are four or five sunlit ones, and the rest are almost all at the level of Dark Moon."
         As soon as these words were spoken, there was a commotion in the crowd.
         They found the stronghold just like that?
         It was that simple?
         They weren't newbies, and they knew that the strongholds of the three major organizations were very well-hidden and hard to find. Li Hao had only gone out once, and he had already found them?
         Moreover, if it was true, this person's strength was not weak.
         "It's just a few sunlit cultivators ... You're all wearing black armor, so it's hard for the sunlit attacks to break through them. With the help of the 100-level sunders, it's not too difficult to break them!"
         Li Hao smiled."You have to know that this is the Crimson Moon. They're all highly sought after. The blood God's clones do exist!" To a Martial Master, this is the greatest treasure. Kill the people here and take the blood God ... Tonight, there will be many people who can break through the tenth realm!"
        
         As soon as he said that, everyone was a little moved. Hong Qing hurriedly said,""Guild leader, are you going to make a move as well?"
         "No, you guys do it. Commander Liu and I will be in charge of the surroundings ... If anyone tries to escape, we will be responsible for clearing the area!"
         He wasn't prepared to make a move.
         As soon as he said that, Hong Qing and the others were a little worried. The other party was not weak.
         Besides ... They weren't that familiar with each other. It would be fine if they were in the same group as swords gate or inspector, but if they were mixed up, it would be troublesome to work together without knowing the strength of the other party.
         "Go!"
         Li Hao gave the order and told them about the area they were in.
         Underground ... For martial masters, it was a little difficult.
         However, Li Hao knew that when these martial masters appeared in the enemy's territory, they would soon attract the attention of the superpowers. This meant that the stronghold had been leaked.
         ……
          After they left, Liu Long frowned and asked,"are we not going to interfere?" It's their first time working together, so they might not be able to bring out the full potential of Black Phoenix ..."
         "The other party is also a mix of various provinces, and there is no cooperation to speak of ... Training the Army is too troublesome, and they will gradually develop tacit understanding in battle ..."
         After saying this, Li Hao added,"you deal with the wood-type super near Wang Ming. I'll go and keep an eye on him. Ordinary sunlit experts can't kill black-armored martial masters, but that peak sunlit expert ... Might kill them. If he's killed in the first battle under my watch ... That'll hurt our morale!"
         Don't let anyone die in the early stages.
         In the later stages, everyone got used to it and their fighting spirit rose. If they encountered a crisis and some people died, everyone would be able to accept it.
         What he needed to do in front was to win every battle!
         Li Hao didn't know much about military affairs, but he knew that even a worm would dare to fight a Dragon if they were to win every battle.
         ……
         In the underground building.
         Everyone was making a ruckus. At that moment, they had already decided to get rid of Wang Ming's group.
         Just as the powerhouses were about to make their move, the long-eared man suddenly frowned.""Wait!"
         "What's wrong?"
         "It seems ... There are footsteps on the ground ... Eh, there's more than one ... There's quite a number of people ..."
         Everyone was stunned.
         Many people?
         The long-eared man continued to listen and looked up, frowning,""The footsteps are very heavy, as if they are carrying heavy weights ... There ... There are about 40 to 50 people."
         "So many people? A caravan?"
         Someone tried to sense it, but they did not feel any mysterious energy fluctuations. It was not a superpower. So many people, could it be a merchant group?
         As for martial masters ... Which family had 40 to 50 martial masters?
         In the huge Silver Moon, it was hard to find a Martial Master. Even if the Wei Wu Army's tracks were exposed, not everyone would know.
         "Don't worry about them. If they're a caravan ... I'll just take care of them. There won't be a single strand of hair left after a fire!"
         "That's right!"
         Everyone was making a ruckus, but they didn't really care.
         A few of the supers frowned and said,""The shadow God seems to have observed something ... This ... Doesn't seem to be a merchant group, but an Army?"
         Someone's Red shadow noticed something. Through the images sent back by the red shadow, they frowned. Armor?  An armored Army?
         It was similar in ancient times. The military today did not have such a configuration. However, he heard that the royal family had a black armor Army that always wore armor.
         The group of Red Moon supers were also confused.
         Armored Army?
         If it wasn't for the fact that there were so many people, everyone would have thought that they had transmigrated and returned to ancient times.
         Where would an armored Army come from these days?
         "It can't be the black armored Army, right?"
         Someone chuckled in a low voice, but it was mostly a joke. The black armored Army had always been protecting the royal family in stellarsky city. They did not even participate in the war in the central region, let alone in a godforsaken place like silver Moon. How could there be a black armored Army?

         “……”
         Someone suggested.
         While these people were talking, the brawny man at the peak of the sunlit realm frowned.
         The next moment, his expression suddenly changed.
         BOOM!
         There was a loud bang, and the earth shook.
         The sturdy underground structure started to shake as if there was an earthquake. The superpowers were flustered as they were dozens of meters underground.
         There was an endless amount of soil above. Once it collapsed, except for the earth element, everyone else would be in trouble.
         Was it an earthquake?
         "Hurry up and go!"
         With a low shout, everyone ran up. There was a way up here, but it was completely sealed. Without the earth element, they were finished.
         The group of people ran along the tunnel and a few earth descent supers escaped through the earth at an extremely fast speed.
         ……
         At the same time, above the underground building.
         Li Hao stomped his foot, and the earth trembled. After several tremors, Li Hao quickly disappeared from his spot.
          Hiding underground and not coming out?
         Then I'll just feel the sword's power.
         As soon as he left, the demon hunt squad quickly arrived, and as soon as they arrived, a few heads suddenly popped up from the ground. Both sides were caught off guard, and in the blink of an eye, they met each other.
         "Kill!"
         Liu Yan was very clear-headed, as she had experienced such a scene many times. At this moment, she did not say anything. With a low shout, two daggers appeared and she quickly stabbed them into the head of a person not far away!
         Hong Qing also quickly came back to his senses and slashed out with his sword!
         The next moment, the martial masters came back to their senses.
         They were caught off guard, but they were here to kill these people, so they were naturally more prepared than the other party.
         BOOM!
         The sword Qi exploded. There were many disciples in the swords gate, and in an instant, the sword Qi was everywhere. The earth element super still had time to escape, but his face changed drastically and he immediately retreated.
