The inspection Office almost had nothing to do!From this, it could be seen that this person was extremely meticulous. Even at this point, at this critical moment, he did not forget to get rid of a group of bad people who might delay things.……At this moment, Li Hao was continuously strengthening his Foundation.Meanwhile, in the chaosverse ...North of the Crimson Moon.The shadow of a Stargate appeared, and countless tribulation clouds surrounded it, shrouding the world.At this moment, a massive Chaos Beast with eyes as bright as the sun and the moon was looking in that direction in surprise. Chaos lightning tribulation!Small world advancement?That's not right!Even if a small world were to advance, it shouldn't attract the chaos lightning tribulation. Otherwise, how many worlds could withstand it? "This ... Is it advancing to a medium-level world?"The giant beast was extremely confused. This world did not seem to be a small world. From the current situation, it seemed ... It had advanced from a low-tier world to a medium-tier world, surpassing the advancement of a small world.Could it be that this was the reason for the birth of the chaos lightning tribulation?That's strange!Such a situation rarely occurred. Under normal circumstances, it would take countless years for a small world to advance to a medium-level world. How could it be done in a single leap?Why was it like this?The fluctuations here were getting stronger and stronger. The door in the middle of the primal Chaos lightning tribulation seemed to be trembling slightly. Could it be ... That it was about to break through?The giant beast's eyes were filled with greed.It seemed like he had struck it rich.A mid-tier world, a mid-tier world that was formed in an instant, if he devoured it, wouldn't he be rich?Under normal circumstances, there would be at least three to five venerable sovereigns in a medium-level world.This was under normal circumstances. There must be a world Lord among them. A world Lord of a medium-level world was at least a third stage venerable sovereign. Under normal circumstances, he would have to avoid such a world.He might not be able to gain any advantage!But ... This world didn't even seem to be a small world before. Didn't that mean ... There might not be venerable sovereigns in it?As for why it had advanced to a medium-level world, the giant beast did not understand.However, such an opportunity was worth waiting for and worth trying.It was too rare!It didn't seem to be very dangerous, but the key was that the benefits were huge. At this moment, he should be more worried about whether other experts would appear and seize this world with him. He couldn't devour it now.He had to wait until the world advanced to maximize the benefits ... The key was that he had to wait for the lightning tribulation to dissipate. This lightning tribulation was probably aimed at the world's advancement, and after the World advanced, there was a high chance that it would dissipate. The giant beast was filled with anticipation. It even started to breathe in and out some chaotic Qi that spread in the surroundings to block the fluctuations of aura and attract more experts.At the same time.In the vast universe, a powerful existence was constantly rushing toward Silver moon's direction. He was very fast, but he still could not find Silver moon's exact location.It was only when the giant beast breathed in and out the aura of chaos that the expert suddenly opened his eyes and looked in a certain direction. His eyes moved slightly, and the aura of chaos fluctuated. It was worth a look!He quickly rushed in that direction, somewhat afraid that if he was late, the benefits would be snatched away.……Silver Moon.Ten days passed in the blink of an eye.On this day, the Silver Moon elites all gathered under the Stargate.One by one, they looked up at the sky with some complicated feelings. The remaining members of neo martial arts felt even more complicated.The Stargate ... Had been sealed for a hundred thousand years!No matter how much time had passed in the outside world, they had indeed been trapped for 100000 years. To them, this 100000 years was actually of no benefit. They could only waste their time and their lifespans. It should be known that the limit of Paragon existences was 100000 years. Almost all paragons had died of old age!The remaining paragons of Yuanping martial Sciences University were protected by Zhang an and turned into puppets. They were almost unconscious, which allowed them to avoid the disaster.The other ruins, normally only undyings had a chance of surviving.To be able to survive to the peak, and even to the death of some undying ... To these people who had been tortured to death, how desperate was this!To other Saints, 100000 years was an extremely long time.Everyone had exhausted their energy and could not make any progress.At this moment, the Stargate opened again and connected with the chaos. Time was the same and time was the same. To everyone, this was the thing they desired and feared the most in their lives.The old turtle, the ninth Division commander, general Huai, and the others all had complex expressions on their faces.The students of Yuanping martial arts university also had complicated expressions on their faces.The Stargate ... Protected them, but also trapped them.Who knew if it was a blessing or a curse when it opened today.At this moment, everyone in the world was looking at the sky. Li Hao's voice resounded between heaven and earth."Stargate, the gateway to the Silvermoon world, the gateway to the chaosverse!""The chaos is infinite. There are thousands of worlds like the Silver Moon!" He said."The Stargate has protected us for 100000 years, but it has also restricted Silver Moon for 100000 years! Without the Stargate, martial arts will reach its limit. Those who come later will no longer have the chance to improve, and the opportunities of the world have been exhausted!""Staying behind closed doors can protect us for a while, but not forever! Therefore, I'm going to open a Stargate today to connect with the chaos. There will definitely be powerful enemies coveting it, and a disaster will definitely descend!""Only when we are United can we hope to resist the strong enemy, break through the catastrophe, and welcome a new life!" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Today is no longer in the celestial calendar or the Silver Moon Calendar ... I will call today the Qi Yuan calendar, January 1st! A new era was about to set sail! Everything will start anew!"

"Survive this, and the Silver Moon shall soar!""Once the Stargate is opened ... It's hard to predict what will happen. Life and death are unpredictable. Everyone, I hope this is a good start!"Li Hao's voice disappeared. He didn't speak anymore.A long river appeared in the sky.The Stargate in the sky was swaying and shining.In the next moment, the DAOs of illusion and reality, as well as two long rivers of chaos, appeared between heaven and earth. The three long rivers ran through all directions in the world.At the same time, heaven and earth kept shaking.Li Hao stretched out his hand and grabbed at the sky. The aura of heaven and earth surrounded him. At this moment, everyone was nervous, nervous, expectant, and uneasy.Could the Stargate be opened?Could he?Naturally, he could!The powerful Stargate came into contact with the auras and the power of heaven and earth. Gradually, it began to tremble.Li Hao carried the firmament sword on his back and kept pushing the Stargate.The figure was also becoming more and more illusory."Dong Dong Dong ..."Like a knock on a door, the huge Stargate started to shake. A narrow crack appeared in the center of the Stargate.……At this moment.The new martial Supreme, who was thinking about something, suddenly raised his head and looked in one direction. His eyes moved slightly, and he smiled."The Stargate has opened, and the Silver Moon has once again appeared in the chaos ... Everyone, the time is up!""Kill, kill, kill!"Shouts came from all around.The Stargate had opened!The land of Silver Moon had disappeared for more than 50 years, and now it had reappeared. Although it wasn't too long ago, the Supreme martial artist knew that the small world had sealed itself off and its energy had been cut off. It must have been a very, very long time!……At another location.The human King, who was still on his way, suddenly turned around and mumbled,""Over there? I think I've been there before ... It's strange that I didn't find it ..."Only today did he discover his own aura, the aura of the plaque.But ... It seemed to be quite far away.Should he go there or in front? he had already seen a major world that stretched across the primordial chaos. It had been difficult for him to make it. This was the first time he had been so lucky to find the Dark Moon world. He was reluctant to give it up!The next moment, he smiled. Who cares!We're already here, and you can still walk?"Dark Moon world ... I'm here!"The human King laughed heartily and instantly charged toward the great world!In this world, an extremely ancient and powerful existence appeared at the top of the world and looked into the distance coldly.He was acting dumb!The Dark Moon world?This was the great dark world!Was this the neo martial human King?That was good too. He wanted to see the strength of this top-notch expert and see how strong the neo Martial Emperor who rampaged through chaos was!In the next moment, a large saber appeared in the chaos. The long saber pierced through the chaos with boundless killing intent. The chaos faded, and the red power of killing and blood covered the entire area!This blade was simply powerful to an inconceivable extent!The neo martial human King slashed down with his saber and his eyes turned cold. "You're hostile! He had wanted to ask about the situation, but there was no need for that now. The Lord of the nethermoon world, was it? As expected, you and the red moon Lord are Birds of a Feather. I'll kill you today!"The long blade whistled and the chaos trembled. As the blade was drawn, a world, yin and yang, and everything appeared on the blade.Saber intent swept across the world!At this moment, it was as if this blade had suddenly appeared in the chaotic universe, stretching out for billions of miles. A man was arrogant and unparalleled, like the reincarnation of a Demon King. His roar shook the chaos!"Dark Moon master, take my blade!"In the distance, on another major world, a world Lord was stunned. Dark Moon master?Me?I'm right here ... What's going on?Wasn't that where the great dark world was located? That Master of Darkness is stronger than me. Is this neo martial King mocking the Master of Darkness?Did he say that on purpose?But wouldn't this make people look down on me?"Or ... Did he do this on purpose and then tell the public that he got the wrong person?"Dark Moon master frowned slightly as he thought about it. Soon, he sneered. How cunning! This neo martial human King was pretending to be stupid!However, this strength was really powerful!In the chaos, there were not many world Lords who could match him, right?Dark Moon master's expression was grave.At the same time, while the other worlds were shocked by the sudden appearance of the human King and his direct attack on The Dark World ... Even further away, powerful figures suddenly appeared.A cat was floating in the chaos.All around, the overlords were divided into four directions: new martial Supreme, Heavenly King Zhen, blood Emperor, sun god ...Countless neo martial artists emerged in an instant.A great world instantly reverberated with a boundless roar of anger. How dare he!Neo martial had attacked two great worlds at the same time!And they were all top-notch great worlds!……At this moment, Li Hao, who was pushing the Stargate, had no idea that the chaos was in chaos.That place was still far away from here.It was also not something that ordinary venerable sovereigns could observe. Only the world Lords and top-notch existences could see a thing or two. The terrifying pressure was only directed at those top-notch existences.The Stargate gradually opened under Li Hao's push.Outside the door, there was nothing else ... Only endless dark clouds!Lightning tribulation!What welcomed Li Hao was not chaos, a strong enemy, neo martial, or the Crimson Moon, but the endless tribulation clouds that seemed to have been waiting all along. At this moment, the Tribulation clouds even began to take shape, and Thunderbolts were brewing like real people!He was going to exterminate this world, and all the people in it!Thump!The Stargate was immediately activated.It opened!In an instant, Li Hao sensed something. The power of time rapidly returned to one. An extremely special aura instantly appeared inside and outside the Stargate, but soon disappeared!The others didn't notice it, except for Li Hao, who was instantly stunned.The change in the flow of time!In an instant, he was in an extremely complicated state. The chaos and the Silver Moon connected, and the flow of time inside and outside became the same! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The energy was so special that no one could detect it. Only Li Hao had some understanding of it because he had sensed time.His eyes were a little dazed.The difference in the flow of time!It wasn't just the flow of time. It seemed to contain many other things. It was an extremely special Dao that was slightly different from his time Dao.While Li Hao was in a daze, the sun-like eyes outside the world suddenly showed some joy.A bunch of weaklings!Very, very weak!It seemed like ... There was really no venerable sovereign!The opportunity was here, a truly great opportunity without any danger. The Chaos Beast almost laughed out loud at this moment.It had roamed the primordial chaos for countless years, and this was the first time it had encountered a medium-sized world without a single venerable sovereign!As for the person who opened the realm ... He was actually in a daze. Was he frightened by the primal Chaos lightning tribulation?After all, this was the primal Chaos lightning tribulation that even venerable sovereigns were afraid of!"It's opened ..."At this moment, Li Hao let out a complicated sigh. The Stargate had opened.As for the light of the sun and the moon behind the Tribulation cloud, it was obviously an extremely powerful being. Li Hao wasn't surprised at all, but he was a bit surprised. There was only one!I thought there would be a lot of them ... Just one is fine!He didn't know if it was a Chaos Beast. If it was, that would be even better. If not ... It would be a little troublesome.

2552 Chapter 425
The Stargate that had been sealed for 100000 years was opened today.Li Hao sighed with emotion.At the same time, he saw the eyes as huge as the sun and the moon and felt the faint pressure coming from them. Obviously, the expert in the chaos didn't try to hide it.Was there a need to hide it?A newborn world without a venerable sovereign, a world that had instantly advanced to a medium-level world, facing the primal Chaos lightning tribulation, it would be difficult to resist the primal Chaos lightning even if they used the entire world's power.It was a free bargain!As a venerable sovereign, at this moment, if he still wanted to cover it up carefully, wouldn't that make him look too incompetent?It was unexpected that this new world could be promoted to the medium level.Its huge eyes swept over Li Hao.This should be the strongest person in this world.It was pretty good!Roughly ... The aura of a peak half-step sovereign?It was more or less like that.It was not a venerable sovereign.Otherwise, even if the great Dao of each world was different, venerable sovereigns had their own special characteristics. At the very least, when a venerable sovereign encountered a venerable sovereign, they could still feel the other party's pressure.Li Hao didn't have the time to pay attention to that expert.That person was not the key.The key was still the primal Chaos lightning tribulation.In the chaos, human-shaped Thunderbolts appeared. Li Hao raised his head and glanced at them, but he didn't care. He just thought in silence.Time, speed, flow of time, spatial isolation ...The change in that instant just now made him think of countless things in the blink of an eye. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The change in space, speed, and the flow of time ...It was just a moment, but it felt like he had experienced thousands of years.The flow of time inside and outside was actually hundreds to thousands of times faster!It was unimaginable!"Relative time?"Li Hao mumbled again. He didn't even care about the lightning tribulation, even though it seemed to be more powerful than the last time. Last time, three existences close to venerable sovereigns had been killed.However, that was inside. A venerable sovereign was not a true venerable sovereign.Although it was stronger this time, it was not much more threatening to Li Hao than last time. It would have to wait and see.BOOM!At this moment, the lightning struck Li Hao. A figure appeared, as if it wanted to kill Li Hao on the spot. It was only the first lightning strike, but at this moment, behind Li Hao, even the celestial pole's expression changed drastically!What a powerful Primal Chaos lightning tribulation!In his opinion, he could at least survive seven or eight lightning bolts in the last lightning tribulation. He definitely couldn't handle the tenth one, but he should be able to handle the first one.But now, just the first strike had made the celestial pole feel a fatal threat! Was the chaos lightning tribulation targeting Li Hao or the entire world?Li Hao was only a half-step sovereign, but the first Thunderbolt already had the ability to kill a half-step sovereign. After all, Li Hao had reached the ninth level of Dao integration and was a true peak half-step sovereign!However, the first Thunderbolt ... Didn't seem to be any weaker than Li Hao 's.BOOM!The figure of the lightning tribulation struck down as if it were holding a weapon. Indeed, it was only targeting Li Hao and not the entire world.At this time, the Silvermoon world was also rapidly expanding and swallowing chaos.The Silvermoon world, which was originally not very large, was rapidly expanding.At the same time, the two-Dao universe began to revolve around the world inside. With the Silver Moon as the core, a new great Dao core was created, no longer Li Hao's time star.Therefore, Li Hao was the only one outside the door.Li Hao raised his sword and slashed down!Today, it was only the first lightning tribulation. If he couldn't resist the first lightning tribulation ... Then he would be too useless.Although this Thunderbolt could even kill a half-step sovereign, it still let out a deafening sound when it encountered Li Hao's sword intent. It instantly exploded, and Li Hao's sword cut his throat!The lightning figure crumbled.The scattered Primal Chaos energy scattered in all directions and fused into the world of Silvermoon.……"Eh ..."At this moment, the giant Beast of Chaos made a very weak sound.Strange!The chaos lightning tribulation wasn't targeting the world that was advancing, but the world expert ... Why was that? It had never seen the chaos lightning tribulation before, but it had seen it once a long time ago. It was not sure why. Could it be that this person represented the world that had advanced, so they had to kill him first before dealing with the world?Not bad strength!The giant beast could tell that this was not a weak fellow. It was a pity that he was facing the primal Chaos lightning tribulation. Otherwise, he might have a chance to become a venerable sovereign with the help of the world's advancement!If he could master the entire intermediate world after his advancement, he would soon become an even stronger existence ... Unfortunately, he would not have this opportunity.The giant beast observed in silence.He was calculating when the lightning tribulation would end.Of course, the chaos lightning tribulation was very specific. It wouldn't strike anyone other than the person undergoing the Tribulation. The behemoth could actually interfere and even kill Li Hao, but it was afraid that the lightning tribulation wouldn't dissipate after killing him. It would still have to deal with the advancing world. If no one could stop it, not even the behemoth itself, the world would explode.That would be such a pity!It was still thinking that the second lightning tribulation would come so quickly that it would not give anyone any time to prepare.Li Hao held his sword and said nothing.A long river appeared and surrounded the area. The long river seemed to have transformed into a long sword and merged into the firmament sword. The sword slashed down!"What?"The giant beast once again let out a soft sound of doubt. What was this?Rivers ... Is this the orthodoxy of this world?

2553 Chapter 425
It was a little special!It felt a special power, very special, but it was not sure.As the river appeared, Li Hao slashed out with his sword. A burst of sword intent exploded like the explosion of thousands of stars, killing the second Thunderbolt on the spot. The chaotic force spread out again.The two lightning strikes could probably kill many weak half-step sovereigns.But in front of Li Hao, they were easily destroyed!At this moment, even the giant Beast of Chaos sighed with emotion. He was a good guy. He could still produce strong cultivators with the support of the world's power. He was very close to being a venerable sovereign!If this fellow did not have the chaos lightning tribulation and him, he would have a bright future.The third Thunderbolt descended again!A giant sword appeared in the sky.With a low roar, Li Hao soared into the sky and took the initiative to fight. He stepped out of the Stargate and slashed the sky with his sword! The sword will that emerged was full of killing intent, just like the heaven battling Army in the past, when the silver-tier warrior he had seen for the first time led an Army of heaven battling Army and slashed the sky with his sword!"Kill!"Li Hao's killing intent surged as he slashed at the third Thunderbolt coldly.It was only the third!Li Hao was very clear about the appetizer.Therefore, he had to destroy the Thunderbolts as quickly as possible. Taking advantage of the fact that there were not many experts around, he had to pass the Thunder tribulation as soon as possible, absorb the power of the Thunder tribulation, and step into the venerable sovereign realm.Otherwise.....The difficulty of this crisis!BOOM!His killing intent shook the sky, and the third Thunderbolt collapsed instantly. Li Hao's longsword trembled, and the destructive power spread on his arm, even burning it!At this moment, someone's face was pale.The Queen of Dali! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  They were both pale. According to their agreement, Li Hao would let them each take one lightning tribulation. More importantly ... The first three were already so powerful, but Li Hao didn't let them.Could it be ... That they had to endure the rest?F * ck!The third lightning tribulation this time was no weaker than the sixth lightning tribulation. If they were to be counted on to pass the Tribulation ... This ... Wouldn't this be equivalent to passing the ninth or tenth lightning tribulation or even more?Is this a joke?He wouldn't even know how he died!The king of Dali's face was pale, and the Queen was also frightened. Stop it.He would really die without an intact corpse. In the last 10th lightning tribulation, three top existences had died, and Li Hao had to resurrect himself to return. He had also been split into three. This time, she and King Dali would each take one?At this moment, Li Hao, who had defeated the third Thunderbolt, said,""What are you doing? The Silvermoon world is about to advance ... Take this opportunity to generate countless connate energies. You two must take this opportunity to reach the seventh level of Dao integration or above and have a chance to survive ... Otherwise, you won't have any chance!"The two of them looked at each other and only wanted to curse! Even if he became a pseudo-Emperor, he would still die!Why don't you let us try the fourth one ... Maybe we'll have a chance. As for the ones after that, wouldn't that be suicide?But Li Hao obviously didn't give them the chance.At this moment, the fourth tribulation lightning hadn't descended yet. Li Hao looked at the void in the distance and said,""Who's ahead? I am the master of Silver Moon, Li Hao! This place was the world attached to neo martial, the Silvermoon world! "The world's advancement is closely related to neo martial. If you don't retreat now, a neo martial expert will soon arrive!""New martial ..."The giant beast was stunned. The next moment, it understood. So that was the case!"I was wondering how it could be promoted to a medium-level world in an instant. It turns out that it's a subsidiary world of neo martial. It knows something about the situation and instantly understood. A few years ago, the Crimson Moon seemed to have a venerable sovereign attack the Silver Moon world.In the past, the sword Saint was in charge.The two sides fought their first war in the universe, and the red moon lost several venerable sovereigns ... It turned out that they had a strong foundation. No wonder they could be promoted to a medium-level world.But ...Neo martial couldn't afford to offend them, but they couldn't afford to offend a Silver Moon?It had wanted to leave this place for a long time. It was too chaotic, and the neo martial human King and the others were too ferocious. Now ... It seemed that it was not bad. Knowing that it was a subsidiary world of neo martial, it was relieved.It knew something. There was no neo martial Supreme Emperor in this place!Everyone knew about the venerable sovereigns of new martial arts. They were all fighting in various places and wandering around. He would leave immediately after finishing this job. The chaos was vast. Although the yin-yang world of new martial arts was powerful, could it still chase him to other areas?Besides ... This was the Silver Moon world. If he devoured this world and went to the Crimson Moon, perhaps the Crimson Moon world would give him some benefits ... Of course, he didn't need the benefits!This world was enough for him to digest.At this moment, Li Hao shouted again,"the hidden guy, the neo martial human King, is coming!" If you're willing to contribute a little and help me pass the chaos lightning tribulation, you'll definitely get some benefits. New martial will definitely repay you! "The Silver Moon is extremely important to the neo martial artists. The small world is promoted to a medium-level world because of the birth of the great Dao universe ... No one has completely controlled it yet. It has fused with the neo martial's origin universe and was born from the same source. The neo martial human King will definitely advance further and unify the chaos!""After it's done, I, neo martial arts, will definitely repay you ..."The giant Beast of Chaos instantly shook violently!What?The great Dao universe?How was that possible?No, perhaps ... It was true.It was also because of the birth of a Dao universe that it could instantly advance to a medium-level world. At this ... At this moment, the eyes of the Chaos Beast were somewhat red. Countless small worlds, medium-level worlds, and even some large worlds had not given birth to their own Dao universe.

2554 Chapter 425
Under normal circumstances, only when a Dao universe was born could it be considered a great world.A large world represented an orthodoxy, countless potential, and countless futures ... However, some large worlds were not like that. Some were accumulated over time, bit by bit, giving birth to peerless experts, but they did not have their own great Dao universe!He had not expected to encounter a weak world that had given birth to a great path universe here today.A subsidiary world of neo martial!At this moment, the giant beast knew that it had really encountered a treasure!It was even a little impatient. It wanted to attack and kill this person, seize the great path universe, seize the world, and run away. This temptation was too great!It was so big that it felt a little uneasy and nervous.It was afraid!He was afraid that the commotion here would attract the attention of the Crimson Moon world. Even though he had already concealed himself, this place was too close to the Crimson Moon world.However, such a temptation ... Was enough to make it ignore the threat of the great world.It was only a Ranger in the chaos.A Ranger ... Was actually a Vagabond who didn't have a world of their own. The reason why they didn't have one was because they were quite powerful, but they weren't the best. Ordinary small and medium-sized worlds couldn't accommodate them. Even if they could, it was difficult for them to cultivate.However, in the great world, they were considered outsiders and it was not easy for them to survive. Moreover, if they went, they were likely to be treated as nourishment.If he could devour this world, perhaps ... He could advance from second level venerable sovereign to third level, or even fourth level!The giant beast was overjoyed to the point of fear.First-stage venerable sovereigns were those who had just proven their Dao as venerable sovereigns. They were also at the level of ordinary venerable sovereigns born in small worlds. Second-stage venerable sovereigns were actually on par with the Masters of small worlds, but they were slightly stronger.When it came to Level-3 ... Under normal circumstances, a medium-level world Lord would have such strength. Judging from the situation, some of the more experienced ones might even be stronger.Venerable sovereigns had different names in different worlds.However, in recent years, they had gradually unified. There were originally many names, but they were not conducive to communication among the chaos experts. They were too profound and troublesome to say. It was better to be more straightforward.People like the neo martial human King and the red moon Lord ... It was actually difficult to judge their strength to the giant beasts.However, a second stage venerable sovereign was not the weakest existence.They were qualified to roam the primordial chaos.However, a second-stage venerable sovereign was only at the level of an ordinary lord of a small world ... There were many such existences. Only when one reached the third or fourth stage would they have a place in the entire chaos!Based on its cultivation speed, it would take at least tens of thousands of chaos years to advance. But now ... The opportunity had come!It was overjoyed, afraid that it would have too many dreams at night. Seeing the fourth lightning bolt descend, it was somewhat impatient at this moment. It hoped to quickly enter the battle, kill this person, and seize the world and the great Dao!Its voice trembled a little because this was an opportunity."Neo martial's subsidiary world? The Silvermoon world? "I've admired neo martial for a long time. The yin-yang world is very famous in the chaos ... How did you encounter the chaos lightning tribulation this time?" Do you need my help?"Li Hao seemed to be relieved. He quickly said,""Senior, you know neo martial? That's good ... I was worried that senior didn't know! "There's no need for senior's help. This Primal Chaos lightning tribulation is only aimed at me, not the entire Silver Moon! I'm afraid I won't be able to survive this tribulation ... Senior, you only need to guard the Silver Moon for a while after I die. This place might be close to our enemy, the Crimson Moon world ... The neo martial human King will need some time to reach this place!""Senior, you shouldn't be a Crimson Moon expert. I've seen the power of the Crimson Moon before ...""As long as senior can help us consolidate Silver Moon for a period of time, the human King will definitely reward you handsomely when he arrives!" Li Hao said quickly.What?Only targeting him?The giant beast was stunned. In the next moment, its thoughts began to wander. It was only targeting him and not the entire world. Didn't that mean that the lightning would naturally dissipate once this person died?The primal Chaos lightning tribulation only killed those who had to be killed.But ... How did a half-step sovereign provoke the primal Chaos lightning tribulation?"Little friend, you don't have to be so polite. Everyone knows the neo martial human King and the chaos expert! If you can get the support of the human King, little friend's future is bound to be boundless ... You'll be able to advance to venerable sovereign soon! However, why did you provoke the primal Chaos lightning tribulation? is there a way to dispel the lightning tribulation?"Li Hao looked at the fourth tribulation lightning in the sky. He was a little nervous and stressed. "There's no way to dissipate it, I can only forcefully cross it! The reason for this is because the new Great Dao in my Silvermoon world is special. I devoured the heart of the great Dao and mastered a special power. Chaos will definitely kill me ..."The heart of Dao?The giant beast trembled again!What heart of great Dao would let chaos kill you?There are countless great DAOs in the world, and many macro worlds have their own unique great DAOs. I don't see chaos killing them, so why would he kill you?At this moment, its heart was itching. Li Hao continued."Senior, as long as I survive nine Thunderbolts, I'll definitely become a venerable sovereign ... By then, I'll have a chance to survive. However, the commotion here is too great, and I might attract the red moon's attention. So ... Please help us cover it up!"Nine bolts of lightning tribulation, a chance to become an Emperor? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The giant beast's heart stirred again.At the same time, the fourth Thunderbolt descended. Li Hao roared, and his long sword floated in the air. Hundreds of swords appeared, and hundreds of stars turned into a River. He slashed the Thunderbolt, but the Thunderbolt still descended and destroyed half of Li Hao's body with a BOOM!

However, the fourth lightning bolt was also destroyed.The fourth Thunderbolt was very powerful and was even close to the power of the ninth Thunderbolt. The giant beast was also shocked when it saw this. What a powerful Thunderbolt!More importantly, master of Silver Moon Li Hao was not weak either. He really blocked the attack!As a result, it was really hard to say whether he could pass the ninth Dao.Once this person became a venerable sovereign, if he could instantly control a medium-level world ... He would at least be a second-stage venerable sovereign. Wouldn't that mean ... He would be on par with me?Jealousy!Envy!This was the advantage of being a world Lord. They would grow together with the world, and in fact, they were much more advantageous than Rangers who had no one to rely on."Should we make a move?"At this moment, the giant beast kept thinking.Should he make a move now?He definitely couldn't let the person in front of him pass the nine bolts of tribulation lightning.This person might not have too much knowledge and was sealed in the Silver Moon. He knew some things about the new martial artists, but he obviously didn't know that the human heart was sinister. He was a greenhorn and was desperate. He actually told him everything he knew!How ... Childish!Of course, it was also possible that ... He was doing this on purpose, hoping to use neo martial to intimidate him?At this moment, the giant beast suddenly looked into the distance and was shocked!Was there an expert rushing over to him?Could it be that ... He had attracted the attention of others?It was shocked!This was a newly Advanced Medium-level world with a universe of the great path. Once discovered by others, it would be a life-and-death battle. In order to seize such an opportunity, even venerable sovereigns would fight each other to determine the winner and even the life and death!Not good!Its huge eyes looked at Li Hao again. No, no matter what, it had to deal with this as soon as possible. If everything went well, the lightning would dissipate, and it would swallow this world and run!At the thought of this, the giant beast began to move!……Li Hao, on the other hand, was panting heavily after defeating the fourth Thunderbolt. Half of his body was melting.He raised his head and looked at the endless void!The true form of that huge existence could be vaguely seen. It was too huge!It was the size of a real star!For a moment, he couldn't even see the other party's face clearly. He could only see a pair of frighteningly huge eyes, which were also looking in his direction. Li Hao watched silently.He was hoping that the giant beast would come.Now that he was here to kill, he felt more at ease.Otherwise ... The lightning would get stronger and stronger. No matter how much he prepared, he didn't know when the lightning would end. If he didn't kill them now, when they came later, the Dali King and the others would have no chance to stop the power of the lightning!Furthermore, this place should really not be far from the Crimson Moon world. Li Hao also knew that a long delay would bring more trouble.Seeing the giant beast looking at him, he didn't say a word. Whether his words were effective ... Depended on the degree of this giant beast's greed. If it was greedy, it might attack. Of course, if it was a pure good person ... That was a different matter!At the same time, he heard a voice. It was celestial pole! Best novel online free at nσνEℓnєXт  "I've met a big guy!"Tian Ji's voice was a little serious."Not good. It's not the weakest venerable sovereign. Its strength is not bad. Looking at its shape and intent ... I'm afraid it's a level higher than those inferior venerable sovereigns. Even if it's not as good as my original body ... It's not something you can deal with!"It was not good news.They were not the weakest venerable sovereigns, but at the level of venerable sovereigns, even if they were slightly weaker, the difference in strength would be very big.Li Hao was unmoved.Wasn't he the weakest?No wonder it felt much stronger than the aura of the bone erosion. Although the bone erosion had been consumed for many years and did not have the support of the great Dao, it was still a venerable sovereign in essence. Its pressure would not change, but it was indeed not as strong as this beast!It would be difficult to kill it!Moreover, this was a behemoth. It was best to keep the corpse intact when killing it, which was even more difficult.Perhaps ... He would have to pay a price.With all sorts of thoughts in his mind, Li Hao shouted,""The fifth lightning bolt is about to arrive. Everyone behind me, boost my strength!"Very quickly, two long rivers extended from behind.At this moment, the giant beast suddenly moved. It looked at the two long rivers that were spreading over and thought,"this ... Seems to be the river of Dao. It doesn't have it, but it has seen it!"Many world Masters and great Dao Masters had condensed similar Dao rivers! There really was a universe of the great path here.Its huge head looked in one direction, and its huge eyes revealed some light. Someone was really coming. This place was very close to the Crimson Moon, and it was very likely that it was a Crimson Moon expert!Once the other party came, he would have no chance.It suddenly spoke."Not good, little friend. It seems that a strong cultivator has come to the Crimson Moon world ... Little friend, this place is very close to the Crimson Moon world. The neo martial human King seemed to have appeared nearby before, but now I don't know where he is ..."As it spoke, it looked at the Tribulation cloud.The fifth Thunderbolt gathered. At this moment, this Thunderbolt was even close to the power of a venerable sovereign. It no longer thought about it and had to make a move.In an instant, its huge body suddenly shrank by hundreds of millions of times.It looked like ... A bull?The bull had sharp horns on its head, and its body exuded a dense aura of chaos. In an instant, the bull moved when the lightning struck!It wanted to kill this person, extinguish the lightning, devour the world, and escape quickly!As for the danger?Where was the danger?I don't care!In an instant, it appeared in front of Li Hao, and the Thunderbolt struck at the same time. The venerable sovereign had grasped the perfect timing. Although he was not afraid of Li Hao, it was a good thing to save some energy.

,m To be able to kill him smoothly and easily ... That would be the best!At the same time, Li Hao shouted coldly,""I knew it!"In an instant, two figures appeared behind him. The king and the queen of Dali teleported and appeared under the lightning. They were scared out of their wits. Li Hao's voice reverberated, "It's good to block this lightning and not die ... Don't be afraid even if you die. I've succeeded, so I can naturally resurrect the two of you!"The two of them didn't have the mood to listen. They only cursed and felt fear.艹!Li Hao, you're really a piece of trash. We're very weak.He was only at the peak of the Heavenly King realm.You haven't even reached the half-step sovereign realm yet. This Thunderbolt can easily kill a half-step sovereign and you want us to block it?Fortunately, it wasn't one person, but two people, and they had to share it.Otherwise ... He would just be courting death.But even so, it wasn't much different from suicide."Die!" At this moment, the Queen howled in rage. From within the Silver Moon world, countless energies swept out and entered her body. The remaining heaven's will energy instantly entered her body.She could no longer hide anything, only helplessness and sorrow.Li Hao, this bastard, definitely knew that he had a hidden card up his sleeve.He really was a bastard!Her aura instantly soared. She had originally planned to make plans after the Silver Moon opened, but now, she couldn't care about that!……At the same time.Silvermoon.The Black Panther's mouth suddenly twitched. Li Hao was really powerful. As expected, the Queen of the West still had a trick up her sleeve. If it wasn't for the fact that it had extracted all the power of heaven's will and wanted to merge with heaven's will ... It might have become the Queen's puppet.The opportunity had come!Now that the entire Silver Moon heaven's will was in a state of vacuum, it was time for it to merge into the Silver Moon.In an instant, the Black Panther let out a long howl!BOOM!A huge devouring force exploded, and its body expanded infinitely. Like a beast of Chaos, it opened its mouth and swallowed the sky. At this moment, it was swallowing the Silver Moon!Its huge body began to collapse.The Queen, who was outside the door, had actually sensed something ... But there was nothing she could do.No more!Li Hao, what a bastard.He would rather let a dog control Silver Moon than let himself control it, how infuriating.No wonder he forced me to resist a lightning bolt!At this time, the Dali King also let out a roar. The boxing gloves on his hands exuded a powerful light. He instantly looked much older, but he couldn't care less about this. If he didn't block it, he and the Queen would die!Li Hao might not really resurrect them.The two of them joined forces and charged at the lightning with all their might! ……However, Li Hao didn't care about this. Two long rivers instantly appeared in front of him. As the long rivers merged, thousands of DAOs converged, and both reality and Phantom DAOs merged, two figures vaguely appeared.Hong Yitang didn't say anything. Qian Wuliang felt helpless. He merged into the river and turned into a long sword, falling into Hong Yitang's hand.On the other hand, Hong Yitang wielded his sword and slashed out. He wasn't attacking, but defending!Earth overturning sword!Hundun stood in front of Li Hao. At the same time, the giant beast attacked with its horn. Even though the earth overturning sword had unparalleled defense, even though it had fused its two DAOs, even though it had United all its people ...At this moment, the powerful earth overturning sword still cracked instantly!Qian Wuliang screamed!This venerable sovereign was not an ordinary venerable sovereign. He was stronger. Two masters of the great Dao had joined forces and integrated the DAOs of all people, but they could not even block one horn from the other party. One could imagine how powerful this Chaos Beast was.And this was just a wandering existence in the chaos.The giant bull's eyes revealed a hint of contempt.He had many tricks up his sleeve!"Unfortunately, you're underestimating a second stage venerable sovereign. There are many experts in the chaos. To the neo martial human King and the others, they aren't considered strong. However, you must know that how many weak people can wander in the chaos?What was more interesting was that ... These two seemed to be a part of the great Dao universe. If he devoured them, perhaps ... The great Dao universe would also be devoured by him.The giant bull's eyes revealed a hint of joy!Li Hao's means were not worth mentioning to it. It was not a venerable sovereign, so it had no idea how powerful a venerable sovereign was!At this moment, a time sword instantly shot out from behind the earth-overturning sword. It was also extremely powerful and was not weaker than the combined power of the two. The sword struck out and hit the bull's horn!BOOM!The bull horn burst out with extremely powerful chaotic force, sweeping in all directions. The firmament sword trembled and even showed some weak cracks. The longsword deviated, and the bull horn directly pierced through the earth-covered sword, knocked the firmament sword off course, and hit Li Hao in the chest!A sure-kill strike!No matter how many tricks one had up their sleeves, they were all a joke in front of absolute strength.Li Hao had said that the master of great Dao could block a venerable Emperor ... But that meant that this bull was obviously stronger than him!BOOM!At first, the giant bull had thought that this attack would kill Li Hao directly, crush him, and completely kill him.But when it hit Li Hao, it suddenly felt a sharp pain. Best novel online free at nσνEℓnєXт  On Li Hao's chest, a small token suddenly flickered with a faint radiance. A shadow appeared faintly. It was very weak, but it really appeared. Without any movement, the shadow punched out!The bull's horn instantly cracked!"Owwuuu!"A scream that didn't sound like a cow's was heard. The giant cow was shocked. What was this?The human King plaque!Li Hao knew what was going on. He had kept the man king board for this moment, but he didn't expect it to be used so soon.This was the moment he needed.After all, it was only a plaque. It couldn't really kill a venerable sovereign.

2557 Chapter 425
The river instantly surrounded the giant bull!At this moment, a sword intent emerged in the river. This sword intent instantly fused together. It was originally in a scattered state, but at this moment, it instantly fused together. A true longevity sword intent emerged in the river.An illusionary figure appeared. It seemed to be venerable the sword!The giant bull seemed to recognize him and was shocked.Sword Saint, longevity sword!He had killed a medium-level world Lord before. That world Lord was highly qualified. He was probably at the fourth stage. To be able to kill a fourth stage venerable sovereign ... How strong was venerable sword?Fifth rank?Sixth rank?Who knows!At this moment, it felt the emergence of the longevity sword intent, which seemed real. It was shocked. This place was indeed a world attached to neo martial. There were so many treasures and techniques!Dodge!It was about to Dodge, to avoid this sword.At this moment, Li Hao moved. A long river shook heaven and earth, and Time and Stars flickered. The giant bull that was about to escape suddenly felt that it had fallen into a quagmire. Suddenly, time seemed to flow backward.It had just taken a step forward ... But it was instantly forced back!Li Hao's face turned pale. It was a torture to turn back time on a venerable sovereign.His body shook violently!The river was also shaking violently. At the end of the river, er Mao was helpless. He swept his tail and the river calmed down. However, the giant bull had a moment of time reversal and its eyes were filled with shock!Flowing time?That was impossible!Just as he was thinking about it, there was no way to avoid it. A powerful sword intent slashed out from the hands of an illusionary figure!Annihilate everything!Ten thousand DAOs return to one!The sword cut through the bull's horn and through its body. The giant bull's eyes were filled with shock and disbelief as the primal Chaos energy in its body instantly crumbled and its life force began to die out!But ... It was a venerable sovereign who wandered the chaos!A true venerable sovereign!Do you think you can kill me easily with just one sword?It suddenly let out a long roar, and its body began to expand in size. The chaotic aura around it fluctuated, and countless amounts of chaotic energy surged toward it. At this moment, the giant bull no longer cared about being exposed!I almost died here!It was a venerable sovereign. If it was killed by a group of non-venerable sovereigns, and a second stage venerable sovereign at that ... Even if it died, it would become a laughing stock in the chaos!Since ancient times, there had always been people who went against the flow to conquer the upper realm.However, it was almost impossible to kill a venerable sovereign without being a venerable sovereign.Even if there were ... They would only be weak venerable sovereigns. It was not. Even if the other party used the sword intent of a sword venerable ... It would not work!Within its body, the primal Chaos energy and vitality energy that had been obliterated by this sword strike began to slowly recover ... As long as it could wear down this sword strike, it would not die!The person in front of him would not understand the life-force of a venerable sovereign and a Chaos Beast.As long as I live ... You're dead!At this moment, Li Hao's eyes were filled with madness and killing intent. Suddenly, the river trembled violently, and the sword that he had already slashed out ... Suddenly began to condense again!Time went back!As if it had appeared from the past, that sword actually appeared again. As for Li Hao, his body trembled violently. He gritted his teeth, and his teeth instantly turned to dust!According to his plan ... If it had been a first level venerable sovereign, he would have been killed immediately!However, the one who came was a 2nd rank.Since that was the case, he could only take more risks and be more radical!In the river, the longevity sword will gathered again.The giant bull's eyes were filled with shock!How was that possible?Li Hao's eyes were cold. He had sensed something ... There might be more powerful people, and there was more than one venerable sovereign! He had to end the battle quickly and kill one first! Otherwise ... Silver Moon would be in grave danger!Time went back for a moment, and in just a moment, the power of thunder in the sky suddenly became stronger. The king of Dali, who was being struck by the Thunder, was instantly terrified.“艹!” Best novel online free at nσνEℓnєXт  How could this be?The power of time once again induced the enhancement of the power of Thunder. Li Hao's action was like drinking poison to quench his thirst!He had been using the power of time all this time, but he was unable to completely block it at this moment. Sooner or later, he would be struck to death by the lightning. But at this critical moment, who would care?The second sword essence appeared!"No!" The giant cow's eyes were filled with fear."No... Someone from the Crimson Moon is coming. I can help you stop them ..."It had just received a sword strike and was at its weakest moment.If another sword came, he would die without a doubt.The sword of the sword venerable only had one sword, two swords ... Even if it was the sword intent of the sword venerable from many years ago, it was not the real sword intent of the sword venerable, and it could not withstand it!It was a venerable sovereign!Buzzzzzz!The long sword merged into the firmament sword and the sword will burst out. Ten thousand DAOs became one, ten thousand swords became one!The sword slashed down!As always, just like before, the giant bull couldn't avoid it. It was extremely frightened. I'm a venerable sovereign ...Bang! Bang!The long sword slashed down, and sword intent poured into it. Countless sword intent poured into its body, killing all life. The giant bull's eyes revealed some unwillingness, some dissatisfaction, and some dejectes...How could it be?This is where my destiny lies ... Why is it like this?They were just a bunch of non-venerable sovereigns!Even if there was a venerable sovereign here, I would still be a little afraid ... But there was no such thing!Why was it like this?The light in Li Hao's eyes gradually dimmed. An extremely powerful being was about to die under the sword will of the sword venerable. At this moment, Li Hao coughed and spat out blood. He seemed to be dying."Seize!"Li Hao's voice was low. At this moment, the Silver Moon world trembled violently. Suddenly, an illusionary dog rushed out of the Stargate and headed straight for the giant bull's body.It instantly entered the giant bull's body!BOOM!The huge Beast of Chaos started to expand like a star!Hong Yitang and the others were shocked!Was this ... Possession by heaven's will?Li Hao had actually turned the Black Panther into the will of the heavens!BOOM!On one side, the Black Panther was still invading the giant beast's corpse. On the other side, the Queen and the king of Dali screamed. The body of the king of Dali instantly collapsed, and the Queen also screamed as she was almost completely turned into ashes!At this moment, Li Hao reached out his hand, and lightning struck.At this moment, a hand and a head flew back to the Silver Moon. The hand belonged to the king of Dali.The head was the Queen's ... Only half of it was left.However, they all survived.At this critical moment, although Li Hao's condition was extremely bad, he still managed to take the lightning instantly. The fifth lightning bolt was extinguished, but the sixth one came in an instant, and it was much stronger than the previous one.Li Hao's use of the reverse Supreme sword's sword mind seemed to have angered the Thunder!At the same time, in the distance, a tall figure appeared. He looked at this place and was slightly shocked. Silvermoon ... Had advanced!Also, that's ... The chaos Ranger in this area, a chaos giant demon beast?Was he ... Dead?Or what?It instantly trembled. What was happening here?

Chapter 2558 The Resplendent Fireworks (1)
They had won their first battle outside the Stargate.Although the price was not small, it was worth it to kill a venerable sovereign the moment he walked out of the Stargate, no matter how big the price was.He was already prepared for this.Li Hao was actually quite calm.They even felt that it shouldn't have ended just like that. The attack of a single venerable Emperor was the safest thing to expect. If there weren't three or five, they wouldn't be able to call it a realm-destroying tribulation!In the distance, an incomparably tall figure seemed to have appeared.The second venerable sovereign was here!The aura of chaos in the surroundings was restless. With the death of the giant bull, there was no one to hide, and the commotion was getting louder and louder ... In fact, Li Hao was more worried that if the lightning tribulation didn't end, more and more powerful existences would be attracted.Neo martial ... Is there any action?He didn't know, because he couldn't sense it, and he wasn't at that level yet.At this moment, the sixth Thunderbolt had already descended.Not only that, in the distance, a figure descended from the sky above the chaos like a Buddha. As soon as the person approached, Li Hao knew that the person of the Crimson Moon had arrived. The power of desire spread infinitely.It was the same as the corrosion bone Emperor, but much stronger.If bone erosion Emperor was the weakest venerable Emperor, and the giant beast he had killed was at the second level, then this one ... Was most likely at the third level.Li Hao sighed in his heart.It turned out that the reason why there were not three to five venerable sovereigns was not because the Tribulation was weak, but because this one venerable sovereign might be more difficult to deal with than several weak venerable sovereigns.At this moment, the celestial pole's voice rang in his ears.""This is not good ... This person ... Might be a little stronger than my original body ..."He was even stronger than celestial pole's original body.Celestial pole was not considered weak among the neo martial Supreme emperors. Of course, he was not too strong either.However, the one who came today should not be considered weak among the venerable sovereigns.In the distance.The figure floated in the air and looked at the Silver Moon wrapped in the primal Chaos tribulation lightning. His eyes flickered as he looked around and suddenly laughed."Interesting. He actually triggered a Primal Chaos lightning tribulation, not because of a treasure, but because of a person! Silver Moon is actually going to advance to a medium-level world ..."The moment Silver Moon appeared, it was clear that this person knew about the situation.He also knew that this was the world where new martial artists were born, the Silvermoon world.In fact, he had come specifically for Silver Moon. Best novel online free at nσνEℓnєXт  The man's eyes flickered with red light. He looked at Li Hao from a distance and his eyes flickered."The current master of the Silver Moon? I didn't expect that the Silver Moon would seal itself for dozens of chaotic years. When it opened again, a heaven-defying person would come out and trigger the chaos lightning tribulation ... It seems that your River of great Dao is extraordinary!"This person was much stronger than the giant bull, and his eyesight was much better. He saw through many things at a glance.Furthermore, he had a better understanding of Silver Moon.At this moment, Li Hao looked up at the sky. The sixth Thunderbolt descended instantly, turned into a human, and charged at him. Li Hao slashed with his sword!The two figures fought fiercely against the chaos, and the power of destruction and the power of time clashed!The more the venerable sovereign watched, the more surprised he was.This was ... Shi Guang?No wonder!It was unexpected that the path of time would be born here. No wonder it could trigger the chaotic lightning. As an expert of the great world, he knew more things than the giant bull.For a moment, they were somewhat amazed and somewhat happy.The Silvermoon world had given birth to its own great Dao!Not only that, the great DAOs that were born even included the powerful power of time. This was ... Unbelievable!A medium-level world, a great Dao that contained time, it was simply unimaginable!In the Crimson Moon world, he was not the top, but he was not weak either.He had just reached level three not long ago, and in the chaos, he was not too bad.Almost all the chaos Rangers were venerable sovereigns.However, most of them were at stage one and stage two. Those at stage three were almost standing in the middle and upper levels of the chaos Thearch. Outside, their status was not much lower than that of an ordinary medium-level world Lord.If he was lucky, like now, if he could seize the Silver Moon, control a medium-sized world, control a great Dao, and become the master of a world or a great Dao, he might be able to break through the current stage and become a preparatory master of a great world!A great world, even in the chaos, was extraordinary!Under normal circumstances, a major cosmos absolute being, even if slightly weaker, would be at least at level five.At this moment, the venerable sovereign's heart was pounding.How many years had it been since he had felt this?Even the red moon world had destroyed a large world before ... But those were the spoils of war of the entire Red Moon. There were more than 100 Red Moon venerable sovereigns, many top-tier venerable sovereigns, and the master of the red moon ...A middle-rank like him would not get much of a share.This time, it was the right decision to come.Those guys were afraid of venerable the sword and neo martial arts, so they didn't dare to come. However, he chose to come and actually had such a great harvest.In his eyes, the power of desire expanded infinitely.He turned his head and looked at the dead Chaos Beast. He was a little vigilant. This was indeed the world where new martial artists were born. Such a group of people had actually killed a second stage venerable sovereign. This was not a weak venerable sovereign like Shi Gu!Bone erosion was only a first stage venerable sovereign.They did not know how strong the new martial Swordmaster was, which was why they sent Shi Gu and the others ... Shi Gu did not die at the hands of the new martial Swordmaster, but fell at this time. From the looks of it, he was probably killed by these people!This person undergoing the Tribulation was most likely not weaker than the eroding bones.With countless thoughts in his mind, he saw that Li Hao was still going through his tribulation. After looking at the Stargate, his eyes flickered and he suddenly laughed."The Silver Moon has reappeared. This is a cause for celebration. Today, it has become a medium-level world. This is the joy of chaos. I am here to welcome the return of Shi Gu ... Where is Shi Gu?"

Chapter 2559 Resplendent Fireworks (2)
There was no sound, only the flashing of lightning.However, at this moment, at the entrance of the Stargate, two bolts of great Dao lightning suddenly intertwined. With a loud boom, the lightning exploded, and the power of the red moon spread out, but it was destroyed by the lightning!At this moment, Hong Yitang appeared, his face pale.With some horror!This person was so strong!Silvermoon's great Dao was somewhat repulsed by the power of the Crimson Moon, so every time it encountered the Crimson Moon's power, it would explode with great Dao lightning, but it would quickly be destroyed.Today, he combined with Qian Wuliang and gathered the strength of the people to merge the two DAOs.Li Hao said ... It could rival venerable sovereigns! Hong Yitang also felt that even if his bones were to be corroded and regrown, he could kill that guy this time!However ... The newly arrived Red Moon Emperor had only shouted from a distance. The power of the red moon that had seeped through had actually triggered the Tribulation of the great path and even consumed a large amount of the power of the great path in an instant.This feeling ... Was much greater than killing a half-step sovereign."This ... Are Qian Wuliang and I really the Masters of the great Dao?"Could he really match a venerable sovereign?The giant bull had pierced through his defense. Now, this new venerable sovereign was even more terrifying, which made him feel extremely uncomfortable.For a time, a voice kept ringing in his ears: "Go, sneak up on that man ... Kill him, and you'll be the master of the world!"Hong Yitang's chaotic River even changed color.At this moment, he realized that ... He was in trouble.Fortunately, he knew some things about Hong Yue. Otherwise, he knew it would be hard for him to control these thoughts. In an instant, Hong Yitang made a decision. He knew it would be hard for him to resist!"Qian Wuliang, you will be in charge!"He didn't hesitate at all. He was worried that ... He would really be bewitched and attack Li Hao.Therefore, even though they had agreed that he would be in charge of dual DAOs ...However, at this moment, Hong Yitang chose to retreat and let Qian Wuliang do it.In the blink of an eye, Hong Yitang's consciousness faded away, and Qian Wuliang reappeared. At this moment, he was a little nervous, excited, and excited. This was his first time controlling a dual-Dao universe!He suddenly felt that he was infinitely powerful, even though he knew that it was an illusion!However, Qian Wuliang knew that he really had the power of a venerable sovereign at this moment. Hong Yitang's consciousness was fading away, just like Qian Wuliang who was being suppressed into the river. At this moment, Qian Wuliang was in control of both DAOs!He looked at Li Hao, who was not far away!Li Hao was busy resisting the sixth tribulation lightning. If he attacked from behind and cut off the connection between Li Hao and silver Moon, the venerable sovereign from the red moon would most likely kill Li Hao ...Of course, this thought only flashed through his mind for a moment. He knew that the powerful venerable sovereign was here for Silvermoon.At least Li Hao dared to be the master of Phantom path.This person ... Had probably swallowed him whole, leaving nothing behind! Not far away, the venerable sovereign took a look and was a little surprised. This new path of Silvermoon was a little strange. There seemed to be more than one person in charge. Interesting. This seemed even more interesting and had more potential.He could even see the existence of the two consciousnesses."Dual DAOs?"He muttered in his heart. The great Dao universe actually had both virtual and real DAOs. This actually represented the potential of the great Dao universe. Under normal circumstances, it would be a single Dao. Such a great Dao universe was very common.Two Dao universes ... In addition to the person who controlled time and the Heaven's Will that was swallowing the Chaos Beast ...This little silver Moon, according to the current situation, could actually give birth to four world Lords!It was unbelievable!Such a situation was extremely rare even in the great world.Neo martial was considered special. It had given birth to the two masters of yin and yang. Under normal circumstances, other macro worlds would have at least One World Master, and at most two, One World Master and one great Dao master.But this place ... Could actually give birth to four!The little silver Moon was only a subsidiary of neo martial arts. Where did he get such potential?He managed to find out a lot of things from this one test.But soon, the venerable sovereign showed a faint smile.It was still alright! Best novel online free at nσνEℓnєXт  If a first stage venerable sovereign had come here, he would not have been able to gain any advantage. A second stage ... Such as the giant demonic beast, had also died here. However, looking at the situation, he had also deduced something.The demonic beast had been killed by the person who had mastered the power of time using some sword venerable methods.He didn't hesitate any longer.He ignored Li Hao and the master of dual DAOs. In an instant, he charged at the giant beast and reappeared. He wanted to kill the Heaven's Will in it first. A venerable sovereign's corpse was still intact ... It was an incredible treasure to him.Eliminate future troubles!It would be troublesome if it was controlled by the other party, and it would become a weapon against him. Furthermore, the Heaven's Will controlling the behemoth might have the intention of devouring the world and escaping with Silver Moon.The venerable sovereign instantly thought through all this.As for Li Hao, he wasn't worried.This person's lightning tribulation was far from over. Just by looking at the Tribulation clouds, one could tell that it was still early.Whether or not he could successfully pass the Tribulation was a problem!……Li Hao, who had just defeated the sixth Thunderbolt, frowned slightly.The result that they least wanted to see had appeared!If this person attacked him or something else, it would be a good thing. He could give the Black Panther Time to control the beast and devour the Silver Moon. At that time, he would have a chance to escape or something else.But the other party had directly dealt with Black Panther ... This was the result that Li Hao didn't want to see.
