Fire Phoenix Pavilion.Led by venerable sovereign Feng Shan, Li Hao entered again ... But this time, he did not enter the fire Phoenix Pavilion. Instead, he entered an inner space in the backyard.Li Hao wasn't surprised by such a method.As venerable sovereigns who controlled the world, what kind of situation had they not seen? he was a little confused. What was the point of creating a small space here?Li Hao soon understood."What?"The extremely rich power of the great Dao seemed to be wandering in the long river of the great Dao.The aura of a venerable sovereign continued to spread.Supreme Emperor Feng Shan glanced at Li Hao and said with a smile,""This place is the External Affairs Department of my Fire Phoenix realm.""The Foreign Affairs Department?""It's a place for foreign venerable sovereigns to rest and cultivate. Not every foreign venerable sovereign can have their own world and share a part of the territory of the fire Phoenix realm like you, senior."Li Hao understood. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The place where the venerable sovereigns were staying.There seemed to be a lot of them, and many of them were giant Beasts of Chaos. They were huge and hovered in all directions. There were also some humans and even venerable sovereigns of the demon race.It was just that everyone lived in a small world, similar to a man-made room. One could vaguely see some powerhouses, and that was Zhang Yang.If it was concealed, it would be difficult to see without careful inspection."There are ... Many venerable sovereigns here?""Yes,"Feng Shan smiled."The fire Phoenix Sector is the only macro world in the Dragon field that's open to the outside world. It's been open for more than 100000 years. Almost 90% of the chaos in the Dragon field ... No, in the square field have come to our world. Many chose to stay.""There are many demons, independent venerable sovereigns, and some who are not proud of themselves in the other three regions. Some of them have enemies ... These venerable sovereigns will all come here."Li Hao had joined them and even signed a great Dao agreement. He was one of the few venerable sovereigns who had come to join them. In Feng Shan's eyes, such a foreign venerable sovereign was trustworthy.At least, he was more trustworthy than most of the venerable sovereigns here.Others might betray him, but this one ... Would not.Not everyone was worth signing a great Dao agreement. One had to sacrifice at least a small world to sign it. Some first stage venerable sovereigns were not even worth a small world."Absorb!""This ..." Li Hao gasped."So, the number of venerable sovereigns here ... Might be over a hundred?"Feng Shan smiled but said nothing. Li Hao didn't ask any more questions, but he knew a lot!Moreover, these venerable sovereigns seemed to be doing well here. The power of the great Dao was actually supplied to them freely. Perhaps it was not as pure as the great Dao crystals, but cultivating here ... Would definitely be more comfortable than being an itinerant cultivator.This should be the power of the great Dao drawn out from the great Dao universe in the fire Phoenix realm.Li Hao fell into deep thought.The Dragon Realm should know that the fire Phoenix realm had gathered so many venerable sovereigns, right? In other words, the fire Phoenix realm and the Dragon Realm were actually considered one. After all, there was a seventh-rank Dragon here. It was simply unbelievable. One had to know that the strength of a seventh-rank master lay in the great path universe and the world itself.However, a level Seven was directly inside ... And could destroy the world at any time. Without the help of the world's power, it would be very troublesome."Senior, please!"Feng Shan gave him some guidance and said as they walked,""The Foreign Affairs Department is only a place for low-level venerable sovereigns to rest. Experts like you have your own arrangements and generally won't stay here for long.""Senior, when you leave the fire Phoenix realm and head to the territory ... You can also choose a few low-level venerable sovereigns to follow you. If you're willing, of course, you'll have to pay some great Dao crystals. Otherwise, these venerable sovereigns won't be willing to go out.""I've brought you here to meet these venerable sovereigns. Of course, it's fine if you don't want to meet them. The main reason is that there's an inheritance crystal here that contains some information, intelligence, and Secrets of the Dragon field. The venerable sovereigns outside can't enjoy it."Li Hao finally understood.Soon, the two arrived at a Pavilion. There were no experts guarding it. All the venerable sovereigns who came in were qualified to enjoy such inheritances, so there was no need to send experts to guard it. There was only an old fire Phoenix with a weak aura lying there, absorbing the power of the great path. It seemed like it was retiring.Feng Shan didn't say anything. He simply released his aura and led Li Hao into the attic.The huge attic ... Only had a piece of fiery red crystal.Feng Shan smiled."We also know that the chaos race has no interest in learning. Therefore, they are only using forced knowledge.""It's not a top secret ... But it's best not to tell anyone about it if it's outside the office."Li Hao controlled the Black Panther's head and nodded.This was simple.If he really wanted to learn ... He had no interest in it and had no time to waste.Of course, this kind of inheritance had its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage was that it was simple and convenient, but the disadvantage was that it was stuffed into one's head. Those who really wanted to learn would find it difficult to absorb some important knowledge. Those who didn't want to learn might not even bother to read it, and the indoctrination would be in vain."Senior just needs to touch the crystal."Li Hao followed the other party's instructions and soon touched the red crystal.In an instant, a wave of spiritual fluctuation spread out.Li Hao's expression changed!

He had thought that it was just a simple legacy. A simple legacy was actually not too difficult. It was just some knowledge that was compressed and played in the form of a small movie. You could watch whatever you wanted to.However, the moment he touched it, he sensed a special spiritual fluctuation!Others might not be familiar with it and might not understand it. They might think that it was a mental energy compression of a knowledge inheritance ... But Li Hao instantly sensed something special. This ... Was the daosource of an expert. It was very likely to be the flame Phoenix Sector Lord 's!What was the use?It didn't seem to be very useful ... The most useful thing was probably ... Locking!Lock onto your position!Surveillance?No, if it was a surveillance camera, it would be too obvious. It was just a simple location tracking. The other party would be able to sense where you were and where you were going!艹!At this point, the other party was still on guard against him?Did I sign the agreement for nothing?In the next moment, Li Hao realized that it was not aimed at him, but at all the venerable sovereigns who had submitted to him. He was just a bonus, and the crystal itself had such an ability.Many of the other venerable sovereigns had not signed any great Dao agreements, so there must be some restrictions.It was actually very difficult for venerable sovereigns to sense this kind of binding and locking on to the Dao source of a great world and universe unless they had reached Level Seven.Li Hao had seen too many daosource!The daosource of Silvermoon, the daosource of Time and Stars, and the daosource of the four major worlds ...He might have seen more daosource than Level Seven and level eight venerable sovereigns.After all, they had seen it, which meant that they had conquered the other world."The daosource aura of the fire Phoenix World ...."With countless thoughts in his mind, Li Hao quickly locked onto this aura. This spiritual power seemed to surge toward Li Hao's Dao origin, as if it was going to merge into one. At this moment, a small realm quickly emerged in Li Hao's long river.The Dao of attachment! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Attached world!The Dao origin in this mental energy was trying to attach itself to Li Hao, and the Dao of attachment happened to be attachment. In an instant, the two forces hit it off and instantly fused together.In the attached world, some light flickered.……Feng Shan looked on in silence.Seeing the Black Dog venerable sovereign stick the crystal on it, he smiled. He only had one purpose in coming here-to see these venerable sovereigns with his own eyes. He just had to touch the crystal.Now, his mission was complete. As for what the crystal was used for, the experts of the inferno Phoenix Clan knew a bit about it. Even if no one said anything about it, in the past, what the foreign venerable sovereigns did and where they went would always be quickly known by the realm Lord.Then the use of this crystal ... Was naturally clear.Of course, he also felt that it did not matter to the Black Dog Supreme Emperor. Since he had already signed the great Dao agreement, it could only be regarded as an additional layer of protection. It might even be able to save his life and lock onto his position. If he was in danger, he could even find you.…… Li Hao didn't have the time to think about this.Looking at that surge of daosource energy fusing into the attached world, he heaved a sigh of relief. He could just bring it along with him during normal times. When he needed it, he could leave this little world behind. This way, the fire Phoenix realmlord wouldn't be able to lock onto him.Luckily!Otherwise, he would still be in trouble. It was not that he could not expel it, but once he did, it meant that he had discovered it. How could an ordinary fifth-stage venerable sovereign be qualified to discover the aura of the daosource of the great path universe?At that time, all the things he had done before would have been in vain.At this moment, the mental energy also leaked out some information, which flashed in front of him like an illusion.It wasn't anything too important.But ... Li Hao was overjoyed. A map appeared in front of him. It was not a complete map of the Dragon field, but of the entire fiery phoenix World.All the small and medium worlds were marked.There were even some planets that would be marked with the strength, race, and origin of some sector Lords ...To the fire Phoenix realm, the information of these small and medium-sized worlds was not worth mentioning.Since they were on the same side, they should know the number and levels of the experts in the territory of the fire Phoenix World.But Li Hao was ecstatic!He was in need of these things, and they were actually so considerate. They even labeled their strength, numbers, and races. Other than their great Dao attributes, they didn't label anything. Those were personal secrets that couldn't be easily divulged.To Li Hao, this didn't matter.Li Hao was overjoyed. This map was worth it!Other than the map, there were many other things, including the allies and enemies of the fire Phoenix Jie ...The enemies here were not demons or humans, but the chaos alliance and the dragon clan, which had a total of 12 factions. Although they were united on the outside, they had some internal disputes, which explained to Li Hao and the others the difference between friend and foe.For example, the fire Phoenix World and the cloud snake world, which were both controlled by seventh level chaos beasts, were not very harmonious. The cloud snake World Master was also a female or a seventh level venerable sovereign. It was said that both sides had some conflicts.However, under the suppression of the dragon world, it didn't explode. However, once they encountered it outside, if no one was around ... There would inevitably be a fight, and it was normal for people to die.Information and information appeared one after another.Then ... A scene that shocked Li Hao appeared. Then, some information appeared, including information about the famous new martial world, Crimson Moon world, light world, cloud world, and crimson sun World, their experts, appearances, levels ...

Chapter 3182 Success Is In The Hands Of Heaven (3)
There were also some Grade 7 worlds, but there wasn't much information on worlds below grade 7.Li Hao's expression became more and more solemn.If the fire Phoenix realm knew so much, what about the Dragon Realm?How did they collect this information?Who provided it?Did he collect it himself?Why would a rank 7 world pay attention to the entire four-sided region? even the world of light did not pay so much attention to the situation of all the worlds in the four-sided region.Then, he saw some information about himself."The Silvermoon world disappeared in the chaos more than 50 years ago and sealed itself. It was once the territory of the Swordmaster, and it is suspected that the origin of neo martial arts was born from it ... The new king of Silvermoon used to be known as the bright moon sovereign. He has the strength of a rank 5 sovereign. In tianfang world, he teamed up with the Son of God of light, mingtang, and is now known as the void venerable sovereign. He once fought against the Qi water sovereign, which was a rank 7 sovereign ...""Possesses the power of a rank six venerable Emperor, skilled in the Dao of the sword, possesses the Qi of life and death, can fuse the five elements, possesses a Dao domain, possesses a mid-grade sovereign weapon ...""The red moon world was destroyed. The Silver Moon King once broke into the other party's calling bed universe. Red Moon Emperor separated the calling bed and came out. It was suspected that bright moon Emperor forced ..."“……”Many pieces of information were revealed by Li Hao in Tian Fang. Tian Fang was quite far away from this place. Although many Level Seven venerable sovereigns were present at the time, it was not easy for chaos to gather complete information in the fire Phoenix Sector so quickly.And this was in public. Perhaps the other party knew more in private.Li Hao became even more solemn.In this piece of information, introducing him was only secondary. The key was that ... Just like the red moon, there was a bounty on his head. They wanted to capture him, capture him, and the key was to seize the Silver Moon!In Silvermoon world, he could lock onto neo martial artists 'positions.In fact, could he lock on to it? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  That was what everyone was thinking. They were all thinking that they could lock onto Silver moon's body that had leaked out from the new martial arts. After all, both parties shared the same origin.But ... He really couldn 't!Li Hao was helpless because what was flowing away was not the power of the origin universe, but the power of Zhan Tiandi. In fact, the power of both sides was not the same. If it was really the energy of the origin universe, it could lock onto the new martial artist.But now ... If he could lock onto it, how could Li Hao not know?It's impossible to lock on!New martial had no way of locking onto Silver moon's position, or else they would have long since found him after more than 50 years. He had sensed something before, but it was because of the Stargate.Although the Stargate was still there, the world was isolated and was in the Black Panther's stomach, so they had long lost contact with it. These guys were only thinking about snatching Silver Moon and locking onto the new martial artist ... Now that the new martial artist had come out, what was the point of keeping an eye on Silver Moon?……After reading the information, Li Hao finally had a more specific understanding of the Dragon field.He opened his eyes and immediately conjured a map."This is the territory of the fire Phoenix realm. Previously, Princess Feng Yan promised to provide me with 100 worlds as my territory ... Can I pick one of these as my territory?"Feng Shan chuckled."Of course you can ... However, you have to rule out some places. Those with sixth-tier worlds can not be your territory. Even my Fire Phoenix realm only controls sixth-tier worlds in name. In reality, they are all subordinate worlds to the Dragon Realm!""In addition, there are two areas, just like you, that are the territories of the venerable sovereigns of the Foreign Affairs Department. Some experts don't like to stay in the fire Phoenix realm. It's a little depressing to have too many experts, so they will choose to go out. These two areas are not to be chosen!"He marked out these areas one by one. Some of the rank-6 worlds could not be chosen, not only by themselves, but also by the nearby areas. Otherwise, it would be easy to get into a conflict. The Black Dog venerable sovereign was only a rank-5.With this ... There were not many areas to choose from.Li Hao looked at the map. The fire Phoenix Sector was in the center.The territory of the fire Phoenix realm was adjacent to the Dragon Realm, the treasure realm, the mammoth realm, and the Tiger realm. The fire Phoenix realm was in the middle. That was to say, in the four directions, half of it was the territory of the fire Phoenix realm, and the other half was the territory of the other Four Realms.The Dragon Realm was to the East of the fire Phoenix realm ...In comparison, this place was much more dangerous and had more experts."Moreover, the dragon world's territory is adjacent to yours. The dragon world is the Big Brother. Choosing the East of the fire Phoenix World is very difficult.However, Li Hao looked over ... And quickly pointed to an area in the east.""I choose this place, is that okay?""Of course ..." Feng Shan was a little surprised. He nodded."But let me remind you that we'll be entering the dragon world from here. Some people don't like to be adjacent to the dragon world ..."Li Hao smiled,"safe!" It was near the dragon world. On one side was the dragon world, and on the other side was the fire Phoenix World. Was there a safer place than this? Even a rank 8 Lord wouldn't dare to be so presumptuous!"This was also true!​ Feng Shan nodded and smiled,"safe ... It's indeed very safe!" It's just that ... Senior, you have to be a little ... Careful. There are some guys in the dragon world who are quite overbearing. Sometimes, they will cross the border, and we can't say anything about it. Generally, we don't dare to do anything, but we can't avoid taking advantage of them. That's why there aren't even sixth-order worlds nearby. Even if there are, they'll find a way to move them away. It's too troublesome!“"But there's no need to worry too much. These guys aren't Dragons themselves, after all. Our Fire Phoenix realm isn't to be trifled with. At most, we'll ask for some blood food ... If we encounter them, senior can just give them some blood food and send them off!"Li Hao's voice was a little displeased,'you still dare to take advantage of me? Aren't you afraid of causing a battle and attracting the Dragon Lord's attention ...""That's not necessarily the case. It's just some blood food ... Of course, I know that you've been wandering in the chaos for many years and probably aren't used to it, so you can't bear to part with it ... Don't worry. The fire Phoenix realm will make up for your losses. It's only right to give some blood food to the powerful people in the Dragon field."

Chapter 3183 Success Is In The Hands Of Heaven (4)
Indeed, the rat monster was right. It was normal to ask for some blood and food when passing by a world in the Dragon field!The so-called blood food ... Was the human race.He was eating it as a dessert.Even the fire Phoenix realm felt that it was normal to give it to him. It was just some humans. Anyway, there was no lack of humans. If he was unwilling to give it up, he could compensate him later.Previously, even if they could see that the other party was learning from the human race and even showed the attitude of accepting all rivers into the sea, the human race could also join ... However, in the eyes of these chaos beasts, the human race ... Were all strong. In their eyes, those below venerable sovereign were not considered human.It was just a two-legged beast, just blood food.Li Hao didn't say much. He quickly said,""Then, I'll choose this place and set my world nearby ... The nearby regions and worlds will be under my jurisdiction?""Cough cough ..."Feng Shan reminded,"it's not under senior's jurisdiction. It's just that ... We need to provide you with some resources. Senior can't order the sector Lords around. Of course, you can do the world-shifting that His Highness promised you. However, you can't order the troops ...""In short, I'll just play with you and give you some resources. The rest has nothing to do with you."Then I'll gather them for a meeting or something," Li Hao said unhappily."Is that okay?""This ... If the various world overlords are willing, we naturally have no objections."Feng Shan smiled ... But he was speechless. A meeting?Are you bored?Those realm Lords might go if they were given face. After all, they were fifth level venerable sovereigns. They had to give some face. Some lower level venerable sovereigns would probably go, but middle level venerable sovereigns might not. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  There were about a dozen middle-rank worlds in this area, all of which were middle-rank venerable sovereigns. There were even two fifth-rank venerable sovereigns, but they were not directly related to the fire Phoenix realm.Li Hao's status was relatively higher than theirs.After all, he was directly working for the fire Phoenix realm."That's good!"Li Hao didn't care about this. He thought for a while and said,""Then, if these guys are affected by my charm and are willing to be driven by me and become my vassals, is that okay?""This ..."Feng Shan had to remind him,"senior, the law of the jungle is a chaotic law!" However, in the Dragon field, senior must remember that there are rules here, the rules of the dragon clan!""If there really is a realm Lord who is willing to work for senior, no one will stop him! However, if the senior were to use force to suppress it ... That would definitely not be allowed! Except for Alliance members, no world can attack another world. The 12 Alliance worlds can, but you have to give them a heads up!"If the other party was very cheap and insisted on listening to you, then there was no other way.But you, you're not allowed to use force to suppress it!Li Hao sneered."There's no need to use force. I'm a fifth-rank venerable sovereign with a strong sense of the great Dao. I can just use the teaching method to take in a few slaves. Don't worry, I know the rules of the Dragon field. I won't offend you, Dragon Lord!""It's fine as long as senior knows. As for the rest ... Senior is free to do as you please!" "That's right," Feng Shan smiled again."Other than that, there's one last thing. If the fire Phoenix realm needs it, we'll call you ..." With that, he handed a piece of Jade to Li Hao."It's difficult to contact chaos. Fortunately, there's a consensus among the various realms of the Alliance that the power of a great world's summoning is allowed to cover a certain area. This is a fire Phoenix Stone. Once it's broken, it means that there's something calling for you. Senior, when the fire Phoenix Stone is broken, you just have to rush back to the fire Phoenix realm. The fire Phoenix realm doesn't have many restrictions on you.""Alright!"Li Hao didn't want to say more."Then ... Can I leave now?" he asked, eager to try."This ... Senior isn't refining a rank six world here?""No, we'll talk about it when we reach our territory!""No one dares to attack me in the Dragon field," he said with a laugh."I'm not afraid of stealing treasures. I would also like to see ... If we were attacked, would anyone pay the price? if not ... Then ...""I'll secretly try it too!"He chuckled.How F * cking bold!Feng Shan had nothing to say. These wandering guys in the chaos were all the same. They were all bold, and some were as timid as mice. If no one tried, then he wouldn't try either. He didn't dare."But once someone tries, I'll also try. I'm extremely bold!These extremely complicated fellows were in line with the character of chaos beasts. Of course, now that Feng Shan and the others had a fixed territory and a fixed race, they rarely did this.Those who were barefoot were not afraid of wearing shoes. These Beasts of Chaos who ruled the great world were all wearing shoes now."Senior, don't worry. The place you're going to is at the border of the dragon and phoenix. Who's tired of living and would dare to be so presumptuous there? There are often some experts passing by there, even seventh level venerable sovereigns!""That's good!"Li Hao smiled."I'll be leaving then ..." He said."By the way, I'm going. How can I prove that this place belongs to me?""Senior, if you don't mind ... I can accompany you. When we arrive, I will visit those medium-level worlds and send the news out. As for the small worlds, even without the orders of the fire Phoenix realm, no one would dare to provoke them.""That works too!"Li Hao didn't mind this guy accompanying him. He would have more credibility if he went.It was a good thing!……Soon, Li Hao left the fiery phoenix Sector and headed straight for the border between the dragon and phoenix.He chose that side ... Just for one thing, a gamble!Bet on what?The dragon world would leave!

Chapter 3184 Everything Is Done By Heaven (1)
Once the Dragon Realm left, there would be no other macro worlds there. It could be said to be a flat plain!He could attack and defend.Of course, it would be troublesome if he didn't go to the dragon world. It would be troublesome if powerhouses passed by frequently. If an eighth-rank Dragon Lord passed by one day and saw Li Hao, they might want to chat with him, and it might be a deadly conversation.It was also a good thing for the fire Phoenix Sector to choose that place. It further proved that Li Hao had no problem. If there was, who would dare to choose that place? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Are you looking to die?Li Hao didn't say anything to Princess Feng Yan. He followed Feng Shan and left the world, heading east.……Fire Phoenix City.Feng Yan knew that the Black Dog had left, but she didn't care too much. She had given Li Hao ten years, and he wouldn't do anything in these ten years.Since that was the case, he would leave if he wanted to.However, he couldn't help but shake his head when he saw the area Li Hao had chosen. What a good choice. This place ... Probably had many experts from the dragon world passing by. Although the Black Dog wasn't very familiar with it, it could sense its pride.Hopefully, there wouldn't be any major conflicts.……At the same time.The world of rats.The Time and Stars fluctuated for a moment. An illusory River faintly appeared, and a consciousness flowed out.Director Zhao quickly received the news and informed the nearby Supreme Emperor Silver Moon to head over to this place to meet up. They had to be extremely careful as it was near the dragon world."How bold!"Director Zhao looked at the map and took in a deep breath.Right at the entrance of the dragon world!This was crazy!And ... How did he end up here? Was it that simple?No one cared?And Li Hao managed to sneak into the dragon world?Also, this location ... There was the dragon world in front and the fire Phoenix World behind. Li Hao really dared to choose it!A pincer attack!If your identity was exposed, you would really die. Even the human King would not be able to save you!He sighed with emotion and then thought of something. If not for Li Hao's boldness, Silver Moon would not be where he was now. How could he have become a Tier 5 world so quickly? if he could really gain a firm foothold here ... Perhaps, Silver Moon was about to reach the sixth step?As for Li Hao himself, there was a high chance that he could reach the sixth step. Li Hao, who was at the fifth step, dared to fight against a cultivator at the seventh step. Although he was no match for him, when he reached the sixth step, he might really be able to fight against a cultivator at the seventh step!……East of the fire Phoenix World.In the vast and boundless chaos.Li Hao and Feng Shan were not very fast, but they still spent more than ten days traveling from the fire Phoenix Sector to this place. They were still middle-stage venerable sovereigns.It would probably take more than a month for him to arrive at the initial stage of venerable sovereign.In the entire Fire Phoenix realm, other than the fire Phoenix realm master who could teleport a great Dao universe and quickly arrive here, the others would take at least five to six days to arrive even if Feng Yan wanted to.It was a short time for chaos, but for Li Hao ... Five or six days would be the end of all the battles.Of course, if a rank 7 Lord wanted to come, they couldn't stop him.If they really came, the world was not nearby ... Perhaps, he could get some benefits, and he was not so afraid.When they arrived at a deserted place where the energy was not too dense, Li Hao stopped and laughed.""It's here. I'll establish my Black Dog world here! Brother Fengshan, you can go to those medium-level worlds and pass on the news. Also, please help me invite all of you. Half a month later, I'll be in the Black Dog world to entertain all the venerable sovereigns in the Black Dog territory!""Time is of the essence ... Everyone, hurry up!"Feng Shan wanted to say something but stopped. Why did he have to humiliate himself?Li Hao laughed and said,"right, I forgot to tell you that I will officially absorb a level six world in half a month. If I come, maybe ... I can get a share. When a level six world is refined, some world power will leak out. It's not worth mentioning to a level five or six venerable sovereign, but it will be beneficial to others!"As soon as he said that, Feng Shan took a deep breath. You're really willing!"With all due respect, fellow Daoist Black Dog, are you ... Trying to establish your own power here?"He was a little puzzled. This was the rhythm of making a contribution.Li Hao laughed and said,"I've been wandering for many years. I know how miserable it is to not have my own territory! "If the Dragon field rules the world, the fire Phoenix Sector will surely expand its territory. By then, if I make some contributions and have my own territory ... Isn't that normal?" he thought. To me, I also want to advance to the seventh step, who doesn't want to? We don't have a Dao universe, so let's see if we can get a level-seven universe to play with by relying on our large territory ..."What an ambitious guy!It was pretty good!Feng Shan smiled."Alright. It's going to be difficult to invite them. However, if fellow Daoist Black Dog wants to refine a rank six world ... There might be many experts coming. Of course, I'll have to go back after informing them, and I'm afraid I'll miss this opportunity ..."Li Hao chuckled and said,"it's fine. Besides, brother Fengshan, do you really care about these things?" If I were a venerable sovereign of a great world, with the support of the great Dao universe and countless pure great Dao power, I wouldn't look down on a medium-level world!""That's not what I meant. It's not that I don't like it, but there have been a lot of things recently. "Along the way, the two of them chatted for a while and became familiar with each other.He was a fifth rank venerable sovereign after all, so Feng Shan gave him face. He smiled and said,""I'm not trying to embarrass fellow Daoist Black Dog on purpose. It's just that the Daoist master has ordered all the fiery phoenix tribe members to return to our world as soon as possible!"Li Hao's heart skipped a beat, but he pretended not to care. He asked in confusion,""So strict? I can't even go out for a walk ..."

"No, no, it doesn't matter in the past, but I might have something to do in the near future ..."It was not a big secret, at least in Feng Shan's eyes. He explained,""Recently, I've heard that there's been some activity in the Thunder World, a rank seven great world of the human race. It might be to prevent turmoil in the Thunder World ... Of course, I don't know the details. However, Brother Black Dog has just joined. Even if something happens, he shouldn't trouble you. He can enjoy some time ... Unlike us, who have to travel around."Li Hao laughed heartily."That's good. How can I enjoy it? I'm here to cultivate too!"His heart trembled slightly. The fire Phoenix realm was going to attack the Thunder realm? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  But ... It was said that the Thunder World was near the Thunder region and would run to the Thunder region at any time. Even the Dragon Master couldn't take down the other party, so what right did the fire Phoenix realm have to dare to go against the Thunder World?In addition, Dragon World might leave ...Leave?That's right, once the dragon world leaves, the Thunder World will definitely lower their guard.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly thought of many things. Could it be related to this?A rank 7 world would only be afraid of a rank 8 world.Once the Dragon Realm really left, the Thunder realm, which had been on guard for many years, would definitely let down its guard. If the fire Phoenix realm could really find the Dragon Realm and attack the Thunder realm at this time ... Perhaps, the human world, which had been established in the Dragon Realm for many years, might really be broken through.Even if one of them was difficult to deal with, it wouldn't be too difficult to take down the Thunder World with the help of the nearby macro worlds if they could hold the other party back.In the past, the other party had been extremely vigilant. At the slightest sign of trouble, they would quickly escape into the lightning territory. Would the departure of the Dragon Realm cause the other party to let down their guard?It was still very possible!Feng Shan's words didn't reveal too much information, so he didn't know what was going on. However, Li Hao thought for a moment, and determined that the dragon world would fight the Crimson sun region. In that case ... Things would be interesting."The fire Phoenix realm might also leave with all their experts ... If that's the case ... Tsk, tsk, if the Dragon Realm leaves, the fire Phoenix realm will also leave with all their experts ... Then ..."Does this mean that I'm the boss of this area?Li Hao was secretly shocked.Would he?Feng Shan was in a hurry to return. The representative was in a hurry, and it would take about ten days to return. He wasn't even willing to stay and participate in the sharing conference. It seemed that the fire Phoenix realm might be taking action soon.And before that ... The dragon world must have left first.In that case ... The dragon world might really be leaving?Such a thought quickly emerged in Li Hao's mind. He looked into the distance. That was the dragon world. Of course, it was still quite far away.The Dragon Lord is taking the dragon world to the war?……At the same time.Dragon World.In a resplendent Hall, the Dragon Lord was high up above, looking down at all living beings with incomparable Majesty.It seemed that the Dragon Lord was very overbearing and impetuous, which was quite in line with the temperament of chaos beasts.However, upon closer inspection ... He was less impulsive and bloodthirsty, and more calm.At that moment, he looked at the hall. Experts were standing there. Dragon World announced that there were only four Type 7 experts, the same number as other type 8 worlds. This was also a number that ordinary type 8 worlds could afford.However, chaos beasts had a special characteristic. They did not need a great Dao universe to step into Level Seven! Therefore, the rank seven venerable sovereigns here knew more than the outside world.Other than the four rank seven dragons ... This did not include the rank seven Dragon that remained in the fire Phoenix World. Other than the dragons, there were also several rank seven venerable sovereigns from other races. There were a total of eight cards and eight seats under the Dragon Lord!This meant that other than the four tier 7 Dragons, there were four other tier 7 Dragons that the outside world didn't know about.This was the true foundation of the dragon world's suppression of the Dragon Realm.Eight seventh level venerable sovereigns. No, including the one in the fire Phoenix realm, there were a total of nine seventh level venerable sovereigns.How terrifying was this kind of strength?The number of Stage 7 experts could even compare to the number of experts from the two stage 8 worlds. And this didn't even include experts like the flame Phoenix Sector Lord who had completely submitted to him.And here, there were only the nine of them.Those who had not reached the advanced level were not qualified to come here.After a long time, the Dragon Master spoke."Chi Yang, Yun Xiao, Hong Yue, and Guang Ming are all watching us. If we don't participate in the battle, they won't be at ease. They won't dare to go all out!"The Dragon Master laughed scornfully."It's said that Chi Yang even colluded with some foreign powerhouses to come here. As for new martial, they've already had an intense conflict with Chi Yang. Ever since Silver Moon left Tian Fang, there have been constant strange movements in Tian Fang recently. It's said that some guys who have obtained great Dao stars seem to have stimulated the great Dao stars to recover ...""There's a lot of movement over there. If the Dragon field doesn't care, none of the three parties will dare to fight ... In their eyes, we're just sitting on the mountain and watching the Tigers fight ... Wrong!"The Dragon Master chuckled."I'm just worried that they'll join forces to besiege us. That's why I didn't dare to act rashly before ... At this moment, several parties have completely shed all pretenses of cordiality. The Crimson Moon is no longer a concern. If we can join forces with them, we'll first destroy the light, then join forces to deal with new martial ... Finally, the square region should perhaps be called the Dragon region!""Everyone, the opportunity for the chaos race ... Has arrived!""In the four-sided domain and the chaosverse, we, the primal Chaos race, are the true natives!" He said coldly. We were born and raised in the chaos, and in the end, the chaos became the territory of the human race. These worlds that were born were like malignant tumors that grew abscesses all over our chaosverse ...""We, the chaos race, can only wander the world like beggars, not daring to stay in any place ... Do you all know why?""That's because there's no ninth stage venerable sovereign in the chaos race," a venerable sovereign said in a low voice.There was no other reason. The human race had produced more than one level nine venerable sovereign.This was the key!His strength was inferior to others.The chaos beasts were strong and it was easier for them to reach the seventh level than the human race. However, they had almost never reached the ninth level before. Only the ninth level was the true Overlord of chaos!The Dragon Lord said in a low voice,"if we take down the four-sided domain ... We'll have a chance!" In the past, the master of Tian Fang achieved level nine in the four-sided region. If he takes down a few level eight worlds, new martial arts, and Tian Fang ... He'll be able to reach level nine in no time!""Three days later, the dragon world will set out! "The Grand Emperor will go to war and tell the four regions that the dragon world is here!" And tell those little guys in the gutter that I'm leaving, and that the Dragon field ... Is a place where they can do whatever they want!"He laughed,'I hope that when I come back, the world outside will have changed, and the Dragon field ... Those ants will be dealt with!' I'm strong, but that doesn't mean that the chaos clan is strong. I need everyone's help. Whether the fire Phoenix and the others can take down the Thunder World and the five demon clans ... I hope they can give me a satisfactory answer!""The Dragon Lord is unparalleled! We will definitely win this battle!"The eight seventh rank venerable sovereigns were like little fangirls, shouting in low voices. Such a scene was extremely rare.A rank seven venerable sovereign had long passed the time of flattery. However, at this moment, he was extremely fanatical! The Dragon Lord laughed heartily.With such a military heart, what was there to worry about?'If there are no type 9 experts in the chaos race, then I ... Will be the first type 9 expert of the chaos race ... I'm not a Chaos Beast. Beast, it's a derogatory term. When that time comes, the so-called human race will be the beast!'"And we, the primal Chaos race, are the true supreme beings!

Chapter 3186 Tacit Understanding (1)
At the boundary of the dragon and phoenix.The nearby worlds had all received some news. It was said that the fire Phoenix Sector had appointed a new Overlord ... Of course, most of the world Lords did not take it seriously.Lord?In the Dragon field, the Dragon Master was the true Lord, followed by the Lords of the major worlds, and then ... Everyone was the same. Who was more noble than the other?Of course, those who were powerful were still respected.However, how could a fifth stage venerable sovereign be considered a Lord?If I give you face, I'll talk to you. If I don't give you face, do you dare to kill me?In the Dragon field, who would dare to kill a venerable sovereign without the Order of the Dragon Master?The Black Dog venerable sovereign was a rank five venerable sovereign.This was the information about the new Lord.It was said to be a wandering Chaos Beast from the other three regions. Actually, all chaos beasts were Wanderers. However, there were very few wandering chaos beasts in the Dragon region.They had learned to take root in the world. This was a change brought about by the Dragon Lord. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Originally, the other party had wanted to gather everyone ... But no one was actually interested.The world was a good thing.The good thing about chaos beasts was that they could run with worlds, but it was very tiring to run with worlds. Under normal circumstances, they would stay in a fixed area, and now that they were going to meet up, they definitely had to take the world.How troublesome!However, Feng Shan also sent a message that the other party had received a reward from the fire Phoenix Princess. A rank six world had come to the meeting this time to devour a rank six world, and there might be a lot of world power overflowing.This time, the venerable sovereigns who were not interested at first suddenly became interested.Not to mention the middle-stage venerable sovereigns, for the lower-stage venerable sovereigns, a sixth-stage world was already the limit in their hearts, because the more powerful one was, the real Overlord world, it was not their turn to hope for.The world Lords who had not been prepared to go to the appointment swallowed their worlds and wandered to the center.This was the biggest advantage of chaos beasts.I can move anytime!It was very difficult for an ordinary first stage venerable sovereign to move a first stage world. Even if he wanted to move it, he would have to move it bit by bit or directly destroy all the living creatures in the world to compress it. Otherwise, it would be difficult to move the world completely.The beasts of primordial chaos had a unique advantage in this.……The boundary of the dragon and phoenix, which had been quiet for a long time, was now bustling with activity.The venerable sovereigns, who were usually too lazy to move, showed their huge bodies and wandered toward the center.Even some of the worlds on the dragon world's side had received the news.It was a pity that he wasn't a Lord of the dragon world, so he didn't want to go over. ……At the same time.At the same time, the enormous Dragon World was not devoured by the Dragon Lord. Instead, under the control of the four giant Dragons, the four seventh-grade giant Dragons forcibly lifted this eighth-grade great world!The Dragon Master did not reveal his true form. He devoured the world and took it away silently.The commotion was huge!The four giant Dragons had returned to their original forms. They did not compress the world at all. Each giant dragon was hundreds of thousands of meters long and spread between the sky and the earth. Although they were still very small compared to the great world, such a huge Dragon was extremely rare because people would not usually show such an exaggerated form.Each Dragon carried a horn and lifted up a grade 8 world. They roamed the chaotic void, and wherever they went, energy swept out and a pressure shook the heavens!The dragon world had set out.In the outer realm, there were countless giant Dragons circling. They were all venerable sovereigns.There were more than a hundred venerable sovereigns in the entire Dragon World!It was a huge commotion, as if it was telling everyone that the dragon world had set out.……On Li Hao's side.The Silvermoon world stood still.Of course, just in case, Li Hao set up a small world with a big one. He unfolded the level 6 world that Feng Yan had given him and set it outside Silver Moon. From the outside, it looked like a level 6 world, a Water World.This was normal. The fusion of the two realms was not just for devouring, but to strengthen the world. No one would care about such a choice.This was also to prevent some venerable sovereigns who passed by and went deep into the place to investigate, and others would see through it.The Silvermoon world was actually quite ordinary.What was unusual was Silvermoon's great Dao universe.Now, in order to prevent experts from spying, Nirvana and second cat were in charge of hiding and suppressing the great Dao universe to prevent others from spying on it.In addition, it was speculated that the Dragon Lord might head to the chiyang region to participate in the war.Although this wasn't a place Long Jie had to pass by, if she were to actually pass by here ... It would still be quite dangerous. If a type 8 powerhouse like the Dragon Lord passed by this place and had nothing better to do and insisted on exploring the place ... Then she would be screwed.Li Hao was also taking a gamble.Even if the other party were to pass by, he would not and would not have the mood to investigate a medium-sized world. The more powerful a person was, the more he would care about his face. A hegemon expert like the Dragon Lord would only appear amiable to his internal affairs ...On the contrary, some small leaders liked to bully others with their power. The higher the position, the easier it was to talk to them, provided that they did not provoke the other party. Otherwise, the small figures could not do anything to you, but the big figures could turn you into ashes at any time!This was the reality.Therefore, Li Hao wasn't too worried that the Dragon Lord would pass by. He was more worried that some overbearing sixth level venerable sovereigns would pass by and insist on checking on him to show off their authority.This kind of person was very annoying.

Chapter 3187 Tacit Understanding (2)
Outside the world, Li Hao was still occupying the Black Panther's body. At this moment, he was looking into the distance. In the flickering shadows, he seemed to see a world moving ... But it also seemed to be an illusion.Even if the dragon world were to go on an expedition, it shouldn't be a movement of the realm, but a movement of the giant Dragons.But at this moment, Li Hao seemed to see an extremely huge world. In the distance, it felt close. It was the dragon world, which everyone knew. However, the dragon world itself wouldn't move.After watching for a while, Li Hao didn't continue.At this moment, Li Hao only had one task. He had to hide himself, the world, and the universe of the great path, and then ... Wait for the dragon world to leave.He would wait for the other sector Lords to send themselves to his door so that he wouldn't have to search for them one by one.……Fire Phoenix World.However, the fire Phoenix Sector Lord knew the result before Li Hao did.At this moment, venerable sovereigns were gathering in the fire Phoenix realm.The red-robed Fire Phoenix Sector Lord suddenly laughed out loud,"the Dragon Realm has set off! The Dragon field will be the sovereign of the world!"The aura of this Stage 7 powerhouse instantly surged to the sky!Suppress all directions!The fire element power shook the heavens and earth.The fiery phoenix World Overlord surveyed her surroundings. The fiery phoenix World was a huge world, and she wasn't the only stage seven expert in it. Other than that dragon race stage seven expert, there was actually another expert from the fiery phoenix race who had also stepped into the stage seven realm.A total of three tier 7 experts!It was considered a top-tier world among rank Seven Worlds."Today, I summon all the Monarchs back for only one thing-to conquer the Thunder World!"The voice of the fiery phoenix World Overlord was loud and clear, reverberating throughout the Great Hall. This place was filled with the sovereign Venerables of the fiery phoenix World. They were all native sovereign Venerables with their great DAOs rooted in their world. Other than the Dragon race, they were all trustworthy people.As for the venerable sovereigns in the Foreign Affairs Department, they didn't need to know more. They only had one mission, and that was to fight!p As soon as he said that, the venerable sovereigns around him started whispering to each other.Conquering the Thunder World?Even Feng Yan was a little surprised. Although he knew that she would do this, but ... Looking at her mother's appearance and attitude, she might ... Be about to take action soon.Above, the Dragon Tribe elder smiled and didn't say anything.The other was a seventh stage fiery phoenix expert. She was also a female who had transformed. She appeared slightly aged. In terms of seniority, she was even higher than the fiery phoenix realmlord. However, in terms of strength, she was inferior to the fiery phoenix realmlord.At this moment, his expression was solemn.Thunder World! The Dragon field was the only human world. If it was easy to break through, it would have been broken through a long time ago. A long time ago, the Dragon Master had personally attacked it once, but the other party had escaped into the Thunder field. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Within the lightning domain, there were countless Primal Chaos lightning tribulations.Even with the Dragon Lord's strength and such a strong practitioner, if he entered the Thunder region, he would still encounter an even stronger lightning strike. The stronger he was, the stronger the lightning tribulation would be. The Dragon Lord had no choice but to leave the Thunder region to prevent himself from being injured and being taken advantage of by external enemies.Although the Thunder World only had one seventh grade venerable sovereign, the lightning Lord was extremely powerful. If it wasn't for the fact that the Thunder World had always been suppressed, there might have been more than one seventh grade venerable sovereign in the Thunder World.Even though the fire Phoenix World Overlord was at the peak of the seventh rank, the Thunder World Overlord was also at the peak of the seventh rank.As for the human race, they had greater control over great worlds and the great path universe. If they fought on their own territory, it would be very difficult to break through the other side's world, even if there were three level-Sevens here."Ever since the rise of neo martial, the four-square region has experienced drastic changes. The Crimson Moon world was destroyed, the light cloud world was in a confrontation, chiyang and neo martial were at war ... The powerful human forces of the past are fading!""The Thunder World has always hoped that the experts from the three regions would come to help, but now ... There's no chance!"The fire Phoenix World Overlord shouted out,"the Thunder World is incomparably important. It's far more important than any ordinary type 7 world. The Dragon Lord could have broken through the other party long ago. However ... The Dragon Lord is tyrannical. The moment he makes his move, the Thunder World will definitely be destroyed!""Not to mention the loss of a great path universe, the key is that a crucial passage has been broken. The existence of the Thunder region has prevented countless venerable sovereigns from entering and leaving the square region. Now, the only realm in the square region that can enter the Thunder region without being destroyed is the Thunder World!"This was very important!It was extremely important.If he only cared about the four-sided domain, it wouldn't matter. However, once he didn't care about the four-sided domain, the Thunder World was too important. The world was important, and the great path universe was important, because this world could enter and exit the Thunder region.Although there were dangers, they did not dare to cross the current Thunder World rashly. That was because they were weak, with only one seventh rank venerable sovereign and the lack of energy inside.Once it was obtained by the dragon clan, with the support of the eighth step, they would be able to consolidate the heaven and earth and inject countless amounts of energy into it. The Thunder World was not just a world, it could also be used as a bridge connecting the inside and outside.He could attack and defend!The experts from the outside world came, but they couldn't bring the world with them.If we want to leave, we can use the Thunder World to transport the world out. This is the key.The heartless chaosworld didn't matter.If they wanted to, they would not only take the Thunder World, but also take it completely. They would kill the Thunder master, take the universe and world of the great path, and control the Thunder World. Whoever could control the Thunder World would occupy an important position and advantage in the Dragon field in the following changes.And this, was the present the flame Phoenix realmlord had prepared for his daughter.A gift for advancing to the seventh step!That's right ... This was a gift for the Dragon Lord's successor. Even though the Dragon Lord was unparalleled, incomparably powerful, and undying, he could at least obtain the recognition of most of the experts in the dragon clan by obtaining the reputation of being the successor.The inferno Phoenix tribe could become the number one tribe under the Dragon Tribe!At this moment, the fire Phoenix realmlord was filled with wild ambitions. He was determined to get the Thunder World. The dragon world had set out for battle. This time, if he still couldn't take down the Thunder World, he might not have another chance.

Chapter 3188 Tacit Understanding (3)
Other than that, among the 12 worlds of the chaos alliance, the seductive Fox from the snake and the Qing Qiu Fox realm were her biggest enemies.Fight for favor?No!They were fighting for the fate of their race!They were fighting for the future of their race!Whoever could take the initiative at this time would be able to take the initiative in the future once the Dragon Lord could really achieve hegemony. Other than the Dragon race, anyone else would be the number one race in the chaos. Resources, worlds, experts, and the great path universe would all take the initiative.Hence, at this moment, the flame Phoenix Sector Lord became even more excited."All venerable sovereigns, get ready. The battle of the dragon Master and the others is outside! And our war will be in the Thunder World! Killing the lightning Lord is our mission. Your mission is ... To kill all the experts of the Thunder World! Do not destroy the Thunder World and take over everything in the Thunder World ... All venerable sovereigns in the Foreign Affairs Department will act as vanguards. Do not tell them our goal, they only need to follow our orders!""Over the years, the fire Phoenix realm has recruited countless venerable sovereigns and paid countless benefits. It's time to use them. In the near future, summon all the venerable sovereigns of External Affairs back. If they don't come back ... Kill them without mercy!"“……”Below, Feng Yan frowned slightly. She had not expected the battle to start so soon.Ten years was really not a long time.However, his mother had already started to mobilize her forces. It seemed that a war was about to break out soon. Then ... The Black Dog venerable sovereign, a fifth rank venerable sovereign who had just left, had even taken a sixth rank world. Should he ... Summon the other party back?At this moment, her mother was still urging her, so she didn't ask.He was also prepared to ask for his mother's opinion after this.He had just let him leave, and he might have already started to absorb the Level-6 world. It would take time. It was not appropriate to let him come back in the blink of an eye. Moreover, he had already agreed not to give him any missions for the next 10 years.In the palace, the fire Phoenix realmlord spoke passionately for a while. Very quickly, he told the various venerable sovereigns to make the necessary preparations and upgrade themselves. In the near future, the fire Phoenix realm would open up its supply of great DAOs.Not only that, they would even supply some of the treasures and Dao accumulation crystals that they had accumulated.This also made the fire Phoenix Thearch extremely excited.……After everyone had left.Only then did Princess Feng Yan step forward. She was a little hesitant, but she still asked,""Mother, if we were to deal with the Thunder World, would it be soon?""Yes, at most three to five months ... However, we have to wait for the time being. When the Dragon Lord arrives at the Scarlet sun region and officially makes contact with new martial world and Scarlet Sun World, or even goes to war with them, the information will be sent back. At that time, the Thunder World will be the most relaxed!"Three to five months passed by in an instant to chaos.It took time to travel.Hearing this, Feng Yan knew that a great battle was imminent. He could only say,""I thought it would take some time, and I even promised the Black Dog that I wouldn't be summoned for ten years. Now that the war is upon us, mother ..." "It's fine!"The fire Phoenix Sector Lord laughed,"it's just a small matter. It's not like I'm lacking a rank 5 venerable sovereign!" However ... If we attack the Thunder World, the dragon world will leave, and our Fire Phoenix World will leave as well. At that time, if battles break out in other regions, the border between the dragon world and the Phoenix World may not be safe ... Let the Black Dog think about it!" A fifth rank venerable sovereign was not bad, but it was not the key to victory. One more or one less did not matter.The flame Phoenix World Overlord didn't really care about this.After saying that, he added,"you don't have to worry too much. It's merely a fifth-tier beast. If we can take down the Thunder World this time, you can take the opportunity to become a seventh-tier beast ... Yan 'er, you have to understand that only a seventh-tier beast is a true expert in the primal Chaos!" Only those at the seventh rank are qualified to do many things. Do you understand?""Understood.""That's good!"The fire Phoenix Sector Lord let out a sigh of relief,"this time, the dragon world of the chaos 12 Alliance will be sent out. We will be the main force to attack the Thunder World. If things don't go well, the giant elephant, mighty tiger and Tong Bao worlds will all help us!" "The other Seven Realms will target the five demon realms. They'll surround them but not attack them. They'll only talk or fight when we're triumphant. We'll be able to unify the entire Dragon field soon! Yan 'er, before the Dragon Lord returns, if you can make enough contributions ... Your future will be even broader than mine!"Feng Yan nodded and didn't say anything.The Dragon field, which had been peaceful for many years, would probably be in chaos for a while.Since Imperial mother said it was fine ... Then there was no need to rush to summon the Black Dog back.……BOOM!The world moved forward.At first, they thought it was an illusion. However, as the dragon world gradually shifted, there were even Dragon Tribe experts opening up a path in front of them, allowing some worlds along the way to avoid them. In an instant, the entire Dragon Realm knew that the dragon world was going on an expedition!He wasn't really worried. Most of them were just excited.The Dragon Lord was going to conquer the human great world!One had to know that the Dragon Realm back then was actually the territory of the human race. These seventh-rank and even eighth-rank Dragon worlds were originally the territory of the human race. Later, under the leadership of the Dragon Lord, this area gradually became the territory of chaos beasts.At this moment, some of the older venerable sovereigns even thought of the past.At that time, it was also like this. When the Dragon Lord went to war, a large number of powerhouses followed him and opened up new territories. They forcefully gnawed down a large piece of the human race's territory!The dragon world was indeed moving in Li Hao's direction.……Dragon World. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The Dragon Master was high and mighty. At this moment, he was not in a hurry to do anything. He was only looking at the map in front of him. It was a complete map of the four-sided region. Even the little realm was clearly marked.

Chapter 3189 Tacit Understanding (4)
Countless worlds appeared densely.All the worlds in the Dragon field, except for the demon clan and the Thunder World, were marked in gold. Gold represented the territory of the dragon world.There were also some golden stars in the three regions.This also meant that it was the dragon world's area of influence.A portion of it was half gold and half red.Or half gold and half white.Gold represented control, red represented enemies, and white represented killing and taking back.Apart from these, there were still a few incomparably huge stars, but now, one of them could be removed. With a wave of the Dragon Master's hand, a star was directly removed. It was the star that belonged to the Crimson Moon.The red moon region was almost crippled.Without an eighth-rank great world, five seventh-rank great worlds, a neo martial artist, and a few seventh-rank great worlds, there were only a few left. However, in this era where the eighth-rank dominated, the seventh-rank great worlds could not form a complete Alliance, so they could only live in a corner.Soon, they turned their attention to the tianfang region. With the tianfang world as the core of the four-direction region, the tianfang region was the most powerful. There were two rank 8 worlds and more than ten rank 7 worlds. They were not inferior to the Dragon field.At this moment, most of them were red, a few were white, and a few were gold.In the chiyang region, which was further away, the Golden color was even less, but there were still some.At this moment, there was still a Red Star that was constantly moving in all directions. This was neo martial. Even the Dragon Master could not determine the specific location of neo martial, so he could only use this moving star to represent neo martial.He silently looked at the stars in front of him. Who should he remove first?Light?Or Yunxiao?Neo martial wandered the world, so it was difficult to lock on to it.Or perhaps ... Chi Yang? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Many thoughts appeared in his mind.Just as he was thinking, he suddenly turned his head and asked someone,""There seem to be many worlds gathering below the dragon world. What's happening?""My Lord, the fire Phoenix World has taken in a rank five Dog Race Supreme Emperor and made this place his territory. The dog Race Supreme Emperor, Black Dog, is currently gathering the realm Lords in his territory to head to the Black Dog world to share the rank six world that the fire Phoenix World has given them. So, recently, many realm Lords are heading to the Black Dog world to gather.""There's no sign on the map. "The Dragon Lord said indifferently. The person behind him was a little frightened and quickly said,""The enemy has only been here for a short time, change the map immediately!" The Dragon Master did not fly into a rage and only nodded slightly.""Be quick! You have to understand that the chaos is too big. Sometimes, any mistake can affect the judgment of the entire battle ... Today, there is only an additional rank five world without a label. If there is an additional rank seven world or rank eight world ... If I don't ask, wouldn't I not know the changes?"The group of people behind were all scared witless and didn't dare to refute.The Dragon Lord had very high requirements for these. Compared to the human race's venerable sovereigns, he was even more meticulous. It was extremely uncomfortable, but one had to admit that it was also because of this that the Dragon race had become what it was today.The Dragon Lord then pointed at the map,"it's said that the Silvermoon world might have escaped to the Dragon field. The Silvermoon world is insignificant. The key is that the Silvermoon King and Kong Ji can kill a stage seven if they work together!" "Although the Dragon field is strong, we can't ignore it. Mark the Silvermoon world on the map. Just like new martial, mark it as a roaming world. Let the other worlds pay attention. Once they find it, destroy it as soon as possible!""Yes, sir!"Someone quickly responded from behind.The Dragon Lord didn't turn his head. Silver Moon ... He had met the Silver Moon King once. Of course, it was only that one time that he had performed well, but ... To him, he had not posed any threat.The biggest threat was the new martial world's human King. He had actually suppressed the Lord of cloud sky that day.He could vaguely tell that the new martial human King was a little exhausted. However, he did not act rashly that day. If he made a move, it was very likely to attract the attention of the human race's experts. Furthermore, the human King might be able to borrow Emperor Cang's power. Once they fought, he might expose himself even more.Many thoughts appeared in his mind.Then, he recalled that when he was travelling in tianfang, he had seen something in a historical site, a place with Taoist connotation. He couldn't help but frown.Neo martial ... The yin-yang world probably had more than a hundred thousand years of history.He had once seen a person in some of the images in the land of Taoist connotation. The person said that he came from the source world ...Origin was also another name for the neo martial world.Other than neo martial, no other world had such a name.He had even seen some things in the video. Back then, the master of Tian Fang had personally gone to welcome him, and the two of them seemed to have had a meeting ... One had to know that he was a level nine venerable sovereign!It was conceivable that neo martial might have been a top-notch major world back then.Did the new martial today inherit the ninth-tier universe?If so ... The potential of neo martial was really not small.In addition, he was also suspicious about another point. The master of Tian Fang had gathered all the experts of the chaos in the past. It was said that there was more than one stage nine expert who had participated. The Dao Masters of all the factions had participated. This was the key!Currently, there were no level nine venerable sovereigns in the outer region. It was said that one had just been born and was currently unifying the chaos ... But it was very difficult.However, a million years ago, it was said that there were many level nine venerable sovereigns in the outer region.In the end ...
