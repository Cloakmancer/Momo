It couldn 't.Originally, they could only live and die on their own. However, if the Dali King had this intention, this would be an extremely difficult path to integrate the human race who did not believe in gods from all realms. Once these people really lived and worked in peace, perhaps ... They would become strong supporters of the monarch!They didn't believe in God, but if they really lived well, they would be crazier and more fanatical than those believers!The king of Dali was stunned. He glanced at Li Hao, hesitated, and asked,""You mean ... Those people that lingyue doesn't want, give them to me ... And then ... I ... I'll take them and establish my own regime?""Right!" "This ... Is very difficult, right?" the Dali King scratched his head.Li Hao nodded and said,"difficult!" However, starting from zero, and these people do not believe in gods, to you, once you submit, these people will all become a group of true warriors! Those who believed in God easily did not have strong will, while those who stayed were the true warriors! I know you can't accept this. If so ... You can take any of the powerful warriors from the Dali dynasty who are still alive and ask them to help you, including Jiang Li. If he is willing to help you, that's fine too!""But I don't have a world ..." The king of Dali was stunned for a while and said again."They're everywhere outside. You can choose the best and most beautiful one to be your territory!""But I can't take the world away!" The king of Dali said again."Then hide and lie low. One day, if you're strong enough, you'll be able to easily take away a medium-level world ..."The king of Dali was stunned again.Is this the path I have to walk? Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  I don't know.At this moment, he suddenly felt a little lost. Previously, when the Queen was around, he thought that he would at least have an acquaintance who could cooperate with him, but now ... I'm alone?Li Hao didn't care about him. Even if the king of Dali didn't do it, he would have someone do it.As for who it was, it was not important.He couldn't care less about the king of Dali. Time was of the essence, and he didn't have time to waste. He quickly said,"Alright, from now on, everyone, do your job. Queen, hurry up and strengthen your Dao Meridian!"The Queen was speechless. She had just been talking about the king of Dali.She didn't dare to offend Li Hao.At this moment, a large amount of power of faith and power of chaos poured into the Dao Meridian in her body. In fact, she didn't really want to cultivate the Dao Meridian. If she did, her Dao Meridian would become stronger, and she would be controlled by the great path universe.But ... He had no other choice.At this moment, Qian Wuliang and Hong Yitang also quickly integrated into the Dao universe and began to locate the Dao meridians of the Queen. There were many Dao meridians in the human body, mainly 360 of which were the largest. They were the real meridians and 360 void meridians.This was the peak ninth level of the Dao integration realm, the half-step sovereign realm.To achieve Dao and become a monarch, one had to focus on the power of one Dao. Only when one Dao was strong enough to open up branches of the great Dao could one become a venerable sovereign.And Li Hao had asked them to locate those 360 stars.As for the others, it didn't matter if he opened them or not.The ninth level of the Dao integration realm was not difficult for the Empress either. Soon, a large amount of Primal Chaos power surged into her Dao meridians, and the stars shone brightly. However, they were very mixed. Under such circumstances, the Dao Meridian that was forcibly raised ... Was not pure and mysterious at all. It was all forcibly raised.The Queen was also puzzled. What was the use of raising these Dao meridians?Could it be ... That he was to guide the chaotic energy into the great Dao universe?But ... Even though Qian Wuliang and Hong Yitang were both at the fifth step, did they have the ability to help him?It wasn't that he didn't trust them ... Alright, he just didn't trust them.She, Empyrean God lingyue, didn't care about these two rank five experts at all. Even though they were much stronger than her, so what?Didn't he also become a Dao master by picking up the Dao universe that Li Hao didn't want?Who cares!Although the Queen was confused, she still quickly strengthened her Dao meridians. To her, strengthening all her Dao meridians did not consume much chaotic energy. The energy consumed was very little and could not be used up at all.Soon, the two Dao Masters teleported stars over."Move all the stars in the illusory and corporeal Dao Meridian out!" Li Hao said.As soon as he finished speaking, he directly appeared in the void."Teacher, you'll move all the stars into my time star ..."After thinking for a while, he looked at the Queen."Should I leave a few behind and place them in the Dao universe?"The Queen was stunned. To where?Below, Lin Hongyu frowned slightly but did not say anything."Are you staying or not?"Li Hao asked again. The Queen was stunned for a moment, then shook her head.""No!"Why stay?"Teacher, it's time to work!"Yuan Shuo was speechless and asked,"do we just move it in directly or what?""Move it in. It'll be best if the star corresponds to the time Dao Meridian ..."Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"also, the great Dao in the stars and time are changing and rotating. It's very difficult to correspond to it ... How about this? I'll find a place where time won't interfere and fix the stars in it!"Yuan Shuo frowned. He glanced at Li Hao and said telepathically,""If her great Dao star explodes one day ... I think it's very possible. Be careful not to hurt her time star!"Li Hao also sent a voice transmission."She's far from capable. She'll be fine!"As long as you know what you're doing.Yuan Shuo didn't say anything else. He was familiar with this job. He had been in there once before. It wasn't difficult to be a Porter.Since Li Hao had said so ... Then he would just get to work.

Chapter 3211 A Perpetual Motion Machine
At this moment, Li Hao looked at the other venerable sovereigns and said,""What everyone needs to do now is to connect all the small realms in my River with the Time and Stars. I will think of a way to extract all the corresponding great DAOs. My teacher happens to be moving them ... Every time he enters, he will find a corresponding Dao. Teacher, please work hard. You just need to move a few hundred times, one star at a time. After all, it's going to be back and forth ..."Yuan Shuo was even more speechless.This little brat!Don't be a son!However, this was also good. Last time, he didn't have time to take a closer look. Now that he had the opportunity, there was no harm in taking a closer look.The venerable sovereigns seemed to have understood something.Second cat understood and was a little confused. He looked at Li Hao and said,""You want to use Time and Stars to transfer her Primal Chaos energy into your little realm? But ... The primal Chaos energy isn't pure and is very mixed ...""I know!"Li Hao nodded."That's why I'll use the heavenspan world to envelop the time stars and purify them. Then, I'll transfer them into other small worlds!" Time can also be slowed down a little, and it can be used for transit and limit-flow!"Second cat thought for a while and nodded."That's right. I'm just afraid that you won't be able to absorb all of it. There may be thousands of small realms, but to be honest, she's connected to the entire chaos great Dao. The power of Chaos is infinite. There are thousands of small realms in the Dragon field and medium realms in the large realm. You're only a small world ... You can't even swallow the Dragon field, but she's connected to the entire chaos great Dao!" Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  In the end, you'll be stuffed to death!Li Hao smiled."It's fine. When the time comes, I'll give up on her. I'll have absorbed enough energy!"The Queen was speechless.I'm not deaf!What the hell is this?So, I'll really be abandoned by then?She was really ... Speechless.Li Hao smiled again."However, the thousand worlds are only for now. It doesn't mean that I won't comprehend the great Dao or condense new worlds. There's still some time. This time is an opportunity for me!""What I'm curious about is whether the Dao of faith is needed to merge with the chaos great Dao. Otherwise, I don't mind finding someone else to merge with the chaos great Dao."Could the Queen's path of faith be integrated, or could it be anyone?Second cat shook his head."I don't know. If you can 't, you can ask everyone to try. Some of them will probably melt away while the others might survive. I think her ability to merge with the Dao of chaos has something to do with her faith. It also has something to do with her replacing the moon god. She's not a pure human. Now, it feels like faith has become a God. Her body has become a very special existence ..."The surrounding venerable sovereigns were all speechless.Good fellow!You're not going to let us try, right? What if it melted directly?This cat was not a good cat.How brutal!Li Hao chuckled."Forget it. One test subject is enough. If more of them die, it'll be troublesome. Even if they don't die, I won't be able to take it. One is fine, but if all of them are like this, who can absorb so much chaotic force?""Teacher, let's be quick. We'll try to finish it in three days!" He looked at his teacher.“……”Yuan Shuo didn't speak anymore. He lifted a star and huffed and puffed as his primordial spirit left his body ... Yes, the God of the five Forces was like a primordial spirit leaving his body, bringing the star with him and entering the time star.Not everyone could do this. The other people's spirits might not even be as strong as Yuan Shuo 's. It would be very difficult for them to enter the time star and they could be easily destroyed by time.With his teacher's help, all Li Hao needed to do was to steer the ship.Void and second cat were in charge of suppressing the chaotic force.It was rare for a group of venerable sovereigns to be so busy for the Queen. If the other venerable sovereigns dared to cultivate in this way, they would have died long ago. Without the help of top experts, they would not be able to last more than a month.One after another, they moved it ...Gradually, the stars entered the time star.Around the space-time star, the small worlds were connected together, and in the middle was the heavenspan world. At this moment, Li Hao glanced at the constantly growing heavenspan world and suddenly said,""In the future, if it really becomes a myriad of worlds, this heavenspan world will probably become a strong world!"Kong Ji, who was suppressing them, took a look and nodded.""This realm is crystal clear. I think it can be called the celestial realm! Of course, those who know the truth will know that it's the impure Qi that's being discharged ..."Li Hao laughed and nodded."That's true. But you saying" ethereal "is more elegant! If this world really becomes a real world, it can be called the celestial world!"It could be called that because in this realm, he was removing impurities. Clouds and mist continued to rise, just like the immortals in the legends of all realms!Were there Immortals in the chaos?No!There were only three major races in the chaos, namely humans, demons, and chaos beasts. As for artifact spirits, they were not considered races. As for the so-called Immortals, gods, and Devils, they were just names. If you were a bad person, you were a devil.If you're a good person, then you're a Saint, an immortal, a God ...And now, this heavenspan realm was connected to the Time and Stars, becoming the transfer station for all the other realms. It was also growing stronger and stronger. If this continued, this world would continue to grow faster than the other worlds.

Chapter 3212 A Perpetual Motion Machine
If this world could one day give birth to a source of life and give birth to living beings ... They would be the so-called Immortals!Li Hao thought for a moment and found it interesting.If that's the case ... If living beings can really be born in this world, does that mean I created a race?How interesting!Li Hao laughed again,'with the immortal realm, how can there be no world of gods and devils? Of these thousands of little worlds, brother kongji, which one should be called the God World and which one should be called the devil World?"Kong Ji laughed,"you're really free!" Are you going to name all the little realms? Then, which realm do you think should be called the human realm? Could it be that the human world was worse than the immortal world? The immortal world is crystal clear. I think it's very difficult for any realm to surpass the immortal world ..."Li Hao laughed,"how can that be?" Time and Stars were the mortal world, where all DAOs were present, gathered, and United ... This was what a man was! In the other worlds, one Dao was strong, but not every Dao was strong. Only time, where ten thousand DAOs were all-rounded, could cultivate ten thousand DAOs, could be strong ten thousand DAOs ... That was the true mortal world! Man is invincible in the world ..."p Kong Ji was speechless!You're really good!However, they were all human beings. It made sense. The human race was the strongest in the chaos. They had all the DAOs and were one with all the DAOs. As for the so-called immortal world, it was only one Dao that was strong!Of course, when he was weak, it might be easy to cultivate one Dao. But when he was strong, he would definitely be even stronger when he had 10000 Dao! Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  "You ... You really dare to think!"Kong Ji sighed."Let's strengthen the world first. Then, the source of life will be born. When that happens, you'll be invincible. Now, you're still far from that. The so-called infinite worlds are just some simple spaces!"Li Hao nodded and laughed,"as a person, I have to have a goal!" My goal is ... To create a real world! Ten thousand DAOs continued ten thousand worlds! Creating the second Primal Chaos is a bigger dream. It doesn't matter if it doesn't come true, but if it does ... I'll be invincible!"Kong Ji laughed out loud.He should support Li Hao's ambition, although he felt that ... The possibility was too low. The key was still the source of life. Otherwise, the infinite worlds were actually nothing, and Li Hao might be able to gather the infinite worlds!The two of them talked freely, and the others heard it in their ears and were shocked in their hearts. They were really ambitious!Now, they were toying with the small worlds in their hands. Li Hao's goal was to turn these small worlds into real worlds, or to make them exist in all worlds. Wasn't this the same as recreating chaos?Even the Queen was sighing at this moment. This guy ... Really dared to say it!He then looked at the crystal clear realm domain. Was this the immortal world?It was quite beautiful!However, when he thought about how those clouds were actually impurities that had been expelled, and how they were nothing more than farts on a human's body ... He felt that it wasn't beautiful anymore. It was truly disgusting!Under such circumstances, the others were still fine, but Yuan Shuo was so tired that he stuck out his tongue!How tragic!He was weak and not a venerable sovereign, but he was the one who did the most work here. His unfilial disciple was actually chatting with the others and making him carry the goods ... How unfilial!Time DAOs quickly connected with the little realm. Gradually, chaos energy seeped out of time and entered the immortal world. After being purified, it entered the other worlds.Some of the impurities evaporated from the immortal world turned into river water and entered the river of Dao. This was the power of Chaos mixed Dao!It was not a waste at all.At this moment, the Queen saw the situation and frantically poured the chaotic energy into the Dao Meridian. She couldn't expel it before, but now, she absorbed and converted as much as she expelled, not wasting a single bit.Gradually, the huge moon started to shrink. A moment later, the Queen transformed into her true form and revealed a happy expression!Success!Previously, she had really thought that she was going to explode. She didn't expect that she would be fine in an instant. She suddenly felt that although Li Hao was a little bad, he was really capable.This matter would be difficult to solve no matter who it was, even those Grade 7 and Grade 8 ones would have a headache.When it came to Li Hao, it was easily resolved.Just as she was rejoicing, Li Hao suddenly said,""It's still the same sentence, treating the symptoms but not the root cause! If you improve too fast and surpass me, my thousandworld will be filled to the limit, and I won't be able to save you! Even if I keep releasing the power of my great Dao, it won't work because the nature of the world is already perfect ... We only have so many venerable sovereigns. Even if we cultivate and absorb like crazy ... We can't stop you from bearing the power of the entire chaos!""Also ... I'll be absorbing other worlds next ...""You already have me to provide you with energy," the Queen could not help but ask."What are you absorbing other worlds for?"“……”Li Hao was speechless."You're only at the 1st rank. Do you think I'll wait for you all the time?"“……”The Queen was helpless. She got it. He thinks I'm not fast enough now, then he's worried that I'm too fast, and then he thinks I'm not fast enough. He's really a fickle man!As for Li Hao, he smiled as he watched the large amount of chaotic force rapidly fill the small realms.Not bad!Very good!In this case, he had been thinking that he lacked a perpetual motion machine that could continuously produce energy to provide energy for his virtual chaos. Now ... He had one!Queen, a perpetual motion machine!In the past, the virtual universe was just a dead circle. The energy was not active and did not flow. Now, with the support of the Queen's Dao Meridian, it could become active!"After devouring those worlds outside, with the Queen continuously providing energy, perhaps ... I can reach rank-6 very soon!"Li Hao smiled and looked at everyone.""Since the Thunder World hasn't made a move yet, then let's ... Make a move first! And now, everything was ready, and the east wind had arrived! There's even a place for humans ... Then there's nothing to worry about. Those without faith will first gather in a world. Senior twomiao, I'll need you and black Panther to work together. One will control Silver Moon, and the other will control the world without faith. Follow me!"Second cat rolled its eyes but didn't refuse.That's fine!Li Hao then looked at the other monarchs and finally at Yuan Shuo.""Teacher, this time there will definitely be a five elements realm, all five realms! Regardless of whether your Dao domain is complete or not ... You have to vindicate your Dao. Otherwise, I don't know when you'll be able to find the five realms again. "Yuan Shuo's expression instantly turned grave. He looked at Li Hao. Must he vindicate Dao?Did he ... Think that there would be a Great War soon? if he didn't vindicate his Dao, it would be difficult for him to survive?Was this guy really going to attack a major world?He was silent for a moment before nodding.Li Hao, if we take down these places, we'll have to attack a rank seven world as soon as possible. We'll help Kong Ji reach rank seven and sweep the Dragon field. Maybe ... A war will break out in the chiyang region before this one.This guy, was he competing with neo martial?

3213 Chapter 524
The Queen's problem was temporarily resolved.Vast amounts of Primal Chaos energy passed through time and the stars, transforming into energy for the thousandworld.At this moment, Li Hao had found a shortcut to improve.Was fusing with the Dao of chaos a good or bad thing?Who knows!At the very least, the Queen wouldn't die. He had a perpetual motion machine, and the Queen could rapidly improve. Even though this woman was frantically transferring the power of Chaos to Li Hao, she had absorbed a lot of it.The path of faith ... As long as there were people who believed in you, as long as there were enough people who believed in you, in theory, you didn't even need to comprehend the great Dao. You could directly become an invincible expert.However, in reality, this was a paradox.If you didn't have enough power, who would believe you?If one didn't have enough power and there were countless experts in the chaos, who would give their people to you and believe in you?"Therefore, you have to first have invincible strength to make people believe in you and not be killed ... But if you have invincible strength and then make people believe in you, the improvement will be limited ...Thus, the path of faith could only be used for a short period of time by the weak.It was still possible for billions or even tens of billions of people.Hundreds of billions, trillions ... How could that be possible?Even his grade 8 son would find it hard to do so.Unless the type 8 expert was the master of chaos.The Queen's future was no longer in Li Hao's consideration. At this point, the plan had already been set up. He didn't care whether the Thunder World and the demon race made their move first. He made his move first!He had to take advantage of the Dragon Lord's absence. Otherwise, once the other party returned quickly, there would be no chance at all."Let's go!"Li Hao gave the order and led dozens of venerable sovereigns to the outer realm.His voice resounded in everyone's ears."Suppress all the realm Lords. Lingyue, you're in charge of killing some realm Lords and displaying a divine miracle. King Dali, you're in charge of eliminating the Beasts of Chaos. All Dao integration cultivators in the Silver Moon realm are to be dispatched by King Dali to suppress the rebellions of those below venerable sovereigns!"Then, hundreds of thousands of Dao integration realm cultivators emerged from the Silvermoon world.These people had received orders long ago. At this moment, they were a little nervous and excited.The ones who were nervous were the newcomers, while the ones who were excited were the Veterans.Many years ago, more than 500 years ago, many of these people were from the Wei Wu Army, the demon-hunter guards, and a portion of them were cultivators who had participated in the war of the four kingdoms.However, the Silver Moon had been peaceful for five hundred years, and the chaos was the battlefield for the venerable sovereigns. They ... Seemed to be useless.Today, they finally had a chance to use their skills to suppress the rebellion of those below venerable sovereigns.The number of venerable sovereigns was limited, but there were many realms this time.They needed these people to maintain order and suppress the chaos in the Jie.This group of cultivators was still wearing the armor they had worn in the past. Even though the armor left behind by the new martial artists was actually dispensable to these Dao integration stage cultivators, the armor they wore meant that they were still the Warriors of the past.The hundreds of thousands of cultivators had powerful auras. Some were excited, some were excited, and some were shouting,""Pioneer for the king, hunt demons, hunt demons!"Some venerable sovereigns in the crowd couldn't help but look over.His gaze was a little complicated. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Demon hunting!The Demon Hunter guards! For Li Hao, it wasn't long, but for some people, it was too long. Five hundred years ago, they had raised their arms and shouted together,"hunt the demons in the world, spread our name, and uphold justice in the world!"In front of him, Li Hao was stunned. He turned around and was dazed for a moment.Demon hunting!How long had it been since he heard such a slogan?In the past, he had established a demon hunt squad, then a Demon Hunter Army, and then a Demon Hunter Guards Army. Ever since he had killed his way out of Silver Moon, he had never heard such a voice again.Silver Moon, more than five hundred years had passed.They ... Were still here.He still remembered!Li Hao was in a daze. A moment later, he shouted in a low voice,""Today, I'll hunt chaos Demons and raise the Silver Moon's might! Soldiers, suppress the chaos in the realms and save the human race!""Demon hunting!""Demon hunting!"The group of old soldiers were extremely excited at this moment.The Marquis still remembered them.The governor still remembered them.The Demon Hunter Army was still there. "Liu Long, Huang Yu, li daoheng, hou Xiaochen, Yao si, five generals, lead the demon-hunting Army and assist the king of the Li Dynasty in killing all enemies! The rest of you, follow me to suppress the primal Chaos sector Lord!"These five people were the heaven battling Army's commander, the Silver Moon Army's commander, the Demon Hunter Army's commander, the night patrolman's commander, and the Wei Wu Army's commander ...In the past, these five people were the leaders of the various armies.It was too long ago!Even Li Hao had forgotten about Zhang Yang at that time. With a wave of his arm, all the powerhouses moved out!Behind him, the five venerable sovereigns were also sighing. They followed the Dali King in silence.The king of Dali was a little excited. He knew that Li Hao had prepared this for him, Yang Wei.Five venerable sovereigns, listen to my command!For some reason, he was a little excited.In the next moment, he suddenly wore a golden armor and shouted,""Is there still a li Army in the Army? If there is, follow me to break the realm and conquer the rebels, exterminate the demons, and raise the might of Dali!""Here!"Among the hundreds of thousands of soldiers, there were indeed Dali powerhouses. At this moment, they were also excited to the point of exploding.[My King is still here!]It had been 500 years. Even though the king of Dali had yet to prove his Dao, these Dao integration cultivators were still extremely excited. They were too surprised, too excited, and too excited.……The outer realm.A group of beasts of primordial chaos was still waiting. Some of them were already anxious. Should they not start?Some middle-stage venerable sovereigns were even cursing.At this level, he was not afraid of the Black Dog Emperor.

How long had he been waiting?It's still not starting!It was just a rank six world, and they didn't know how much they could get. It wasn't like they were the ones absorbing it. They were just absorbing some of the lost energy. This Black Dog venerable sovereign was really good at putting on airs.Did he really think he was the Lord of this place?At that moment, another rank five venerable sovereign looked at the Black Panther in the distance and shouted,""Fellow Daoist Black Dog, when do you want to start refining? If you don't Start Now, I'm going to leave. If it weren't for Feng Shan, I wouldn't have come at all. I've come ... I've been here for several days!"At this moment, Black Panther also sensed the movement in the realm.At this moment, Black Panther was also a little excited.It had been a long time since they had acted together. This 'everyone' included many people, including Liu Long and the Silver Moon martial masters.After entering the chaos, Li Hao had always acted alone. Even in the Senlan realm, there were only a few venerable sovereigns.Everyone was too weak, and Li Hao's opponents were too strong.No one had the strength to participate in the war.Even the two Dao Masters could only participate in very few battles ... Gradually, everyone became depressed, disappointed, desperate, and even self-depreciated.Li Hao had invested too many resources in Silver Moon.It had created a large number of venerable sovereigns!However ... It seemed that there was no need for them to do anything.Today ... He seemed to have a chance.The Black Panther suddenly roared. At this moment, its body shrunk and it was no longer as huge as before. It was like a giant Beast of Chaos. At this moment, the Black Panther soared into the sky as if it was riding on the clouds!The petite black Panther was like an ant under the feet of these behemoths.However, the Black Panther was not afraid at all. Instead ... It was filled with joy.The next moment, the Black Panther disappeared, just like before. It would disappear once the battle began, and in a situation that no one expected, it would appear again. It would kill a strong enemy, launch a surprise attack, and suddenly appear behind someone ...That kind of battle, that kind of hunting, that kind of cooperation ... It had been a long time since they had last seen it.The surrounding beasts of primordial chaos were surprised.Did venerable Emperor Black Dog suddenly disappear?What was he doing?Also, when he looked at the world in front of him ... The world was here. Did he not want the world?Wasn't he afraid that someone would suddenly swallow it?Humans would die in pursuit of wealth, and birds would die in pursuit of food. It was fine in a rank six world under normal circumstances, as there were people overseeing it. But now, you suddenly ran away ... The rank five venerable sovereign who had shouted earlier was suddenly moved.If I eat it, I might even reach the sixth rank.Once I reach the sixth rank, even the fire Phoenix realm won't dare to deal with me. The life and death of the venerable sovereign of the Dragon field can only be decided by the Dragon Master.'The Dragon Lord isn't here now. Even if he comes back, a rank six venerable sovereign ... At most, I'll just compensate him myself and slowly compensate him. Can he really kill me?'Just as this thought flashed through his mind ...The next moment, he was shocked!In an instant, many figures appeared between heaven and earth. They seemed to come from the realm. Were they cultivators from the Black Dog realm? Venerable sovereigns?Just as he had this thought, Li Hao raised his hand and shouted,""Kill!"Buzzzzzz!The void trembled and the sky changed color. Two long rivers instantly surrounded the sky and the earth. The world of Quietus covered the entire area in the blink of an eye. The entire chaotic region had turned into a battlefield!How many venerable sovereigns?A lot of them!The stronger ones, such as Kong Ji and Li Hao, could kill stage seven experts. The slightly stronger two Dao Masters, stage five Dao Masters, could fight stage six experts when they fused their two DAOs. The stage five world Lord, Black Panther, and stage four heaven pole and King Huai ...This time, apart from Kong Ji and a few venerable sovereigns who had come to seek refuge from the outside world, all the experts of the Silver Moon had gathered their strength. At this moment, everyone was in a trance, as if they had returned to the past."Sword, come!"Between the heaven and earth, a huge sword streaked across the sky. Tian Jian roared and the long sword flew through the air, slashing the sky. Best novel online free at nσνEℓnєXт  BA Dao didn't say a word and swept his long saber in all directions.The North fist and the South fist struck out one after another, suppressing the Monarchs in front of them.He's back!At this moment, all the Silver Moon martial masters were shouting in their hearts,"we're back!"All of Silver moon's martial masters had returned!Even though we are the weak in this chaos, we ... Are still moving forward and never giving up, even if we can no longer keep up with Li Hao, even if we can no longer shelter him from the wind and rain like before ...But we, the Silver Moon martial masters, are still here."Just like back then, Silver Moon martial masters came from all directions. Even if we can't see hope or the future ... At least we can see hope now."Kill!"The roar shook the sky.To vent the grievances, depression, anger, panic, and despair in his heart ...Yes, they had panicked and despaired before.We thought that we had been abandoned.Now, we are still here!Momentum!At this moment, Kong Ji in the Nirvana realm was stunned. He looked around him and saw waves of aura emerging madly. Aura was the Silver Moon's unique characteristic. Even now, Li Hao couldn't put his finger on what aura was.Was it Dao? It wasn 't.Dao was Dao, momentum was momentum.What was that?It was difficult to distinguish. It could only be said that it was something unique to martial arts, a kind of powerhouse ... Even if it was an incomparably weak powerhouse in the eyes of others, a kind of comprehension of their own martial arts, a kind of spiritual transformation, in fact, Shi itself did not possess any lethality.

3215 Chapter 524
However, at this moment, it was as if the might of the heavens had descended!The general situation was in a state of panic!It was like a domain. Yes, it was a force, but it was also like a domain, a Dao domain ... It could not be considered a domain, but a domain.The moment the aura was released, many Silver Moon martial masters and venerable sovereigns 'auras appeared. They appeared all over the place, and in just an instant, they enveloped the sector Lords. At this moment, the primal Chaos Beast sector Lords were all dumbfounded.​ What was going on?Where did so many venerable sovereigns come from?It seemed that most of them were venerable sovereigns of the human race. How could there be so many venerable sovereigns of the human race? even if there were, they shouldn't be here. This was the border between the dragon and phoenix worlds!"Damn it, it's the human race ..."As soon as the rank five Chaos Beast roared, a tiny black puppy appeared on its huge head.Its sharp claws were extremely sharp, and in an instant, it struck out nine times!The suppression of the world's power, nine powers superimposed!Kachaa!The Chaos Beast's body was extremely tough, especially its head. However, under the Black Panther's sharp claws, the fifth-rank Chaos beast's head was instantly pierced through like tofu!His brain burst out, and Dao marks instantly appeared in his head like chaotic stars. They were the marks of his opponent's great Dao.The moment the Dao marks appeared, a huge mouth appeared.Kachaa!Its sharp fangs seemed to contain an overlapping force. With a loud crack, a thick chaos Dao suddenly broke. The entire Dao mark crumbled in an instant. The rank five chaos Supreme Emperor did not even have time to scream before he was killed on the spot by the rank five Black Panther!Assassination!The Black Panther wasn't good at using brute force. It knew many things. It knew lightning, water, devouring ...However, everyone, including Li Hao, had forgotten that Black Panther's true specialty was hiding.From the beginning until now.It had always been the king of the darkness. It could hide anywhere and at any time, it could come out and give people a fatal blow. Its body was not strong enough, so it could not compete with some top-tier Masters.However, in the darkness ... It seemed to be able to hide itself naturally, making people ignore it!At this moment, Li Hao turned his head and looked at Black Panther. He was slightly stunned.Until this moment ... Li Hao seemed to have thought of something. Looking at Black Panther, he fell into deep thought. Black Panther ... Didn't seem to be very good at offense, but rather ... Was good at hiding something that even he himself had forgotten and ignored!  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  He didn't seem to care much about it before.As if it was only natural!It was normal for a Black Panther to appear anywhere and at any time to ambush and kill a person, but this ... Seemed to be the most abnormal.Li Hao took a deep look at the Black Panther, but didn't say anything.However, when compared to Emperor Cang, second cat, Tengu, and even li Fuhai, the second and third generation ... Black Panther did not seem to have anything special about him. He was just an ordinary little dog.He had been tainted by the blood of the Holy See ... But the Holy See, in the primordial chaos, was actually nothing. Heibao had already surpassed neo martial's engine.However, it was still so ordinary that everyone felt that if it weren't for Li Hao, it would have been difficult for the Black Panther to reach the Dao integration stage, let alone the fifth stage.At this moment, Black Panther did not seem ordinary.He had killed a rank five venerable sovereign with a sneak attack.From the others 'point of view ... It was just a sneak attack.But in Li Hao's eyes ... You're a Tier 5, but can you sneak up on a Tier 5?Wasn't being ordinary also a type of Dao?He had become a fifth rank venerable sovereign and a world Lord, but he was still so ordinary, like a small black Dog in the mortal world. This was the most extraordinary thing about him. As for Black Panther, he was so ordinary that he had gotten used to it and had even forgotten about the ordinary way.How interesting!Perhaps the Black Panther didn't care, or perhaps it felt the same way. From the bottom of its heart, it felt that it was just a little dog, a stray dog. It only had a home that wasn't exposed to the elements after meeting Li Hao.It was just so ordinary, so ordinary that saying it was a descendant of Yi was like putting gold on its own face. A descendant after a hundred thousand years?On top of the house, there was the heavenly Hound that had been separated by 100000 years!In between, there were hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of generations ... Could this be considered a descendant?It's nothing!He was self-conceited, and when neo martial was strong, he was just sticking it on neo martial's head.In reality, it was just an ordinary little black dog.Li Hao's greatest hope was that ... This puppy could be as fierce as a cheetah, but that was all.Kachaa!BOOM!The sound of an explosion reverberated in the sky. As the rank five venerable sovereign fell, the surrounding chaos beasts seemed to have come to their senses. The Dragon field's centralization of power had its advantages and disadvantages, and the biggest disadvantage was now showing.The Beasts of Chaos, who were used to wandering around the chaos, had lost their guard after years of peace. They had even forgotten that they could die too.This place was too safe."I'm safe. Other than the Dragon Lord, even if a rank seven venerable sovereign came, they wouldn't be so afraid. You wouldn't dare to kill me, because ... This is the Dragon Lord's territory. ""Human!""Enemy attack!"“……”At this moment, the Beasts of Chaos roared madly, shaking the world. But Li Hao and the others had already covered the surroundings.The two great Dao rivers crushed the world, making it impossible for the venerable sovereigns to escape!A bright moon seemed to have appeared between heaven and earth.

3216 Chapter 524
The Queen's voice resounded in all directions."I am the human God Ling Yue! "I'm grateful for the hard life of the world. The human race has fallen, the mountains and rivers have fallen, and our parents, children, and friends have become the food of beasts ... Today, I'll kill the demonic beasts, show our might, and save the human race. Those who believe in me will enter the divine Kingdom. There will be no oppression, no pain, no illness, no torture, and our families will be reunited with joy ..."His bewitching words resounded through the heavens!At this moment, countless humans in dozens of small realms looked up at the sky. Their eyes were full of disbelief, shock, daze, and ... Fanaticism!The human race ... Had turned over?A peerless heavenly God had descended to the mortal world and saved all life!BOOM!The sky was dripping with blood. At this moment, countless cultivators descended from the sky, clad in battle armor. A golden-armored expert, like a peerless Overlord, blew up a demonic beast that was extremely powerful in everyone's eyes with a single punch."I am the king of the human race, the king of Dali!" He roared. It was called Beiwu! Those who believed in God would enter the God nation! Those who are willing to build a home with me, to use their hands, strength, hard work, and struggle to spread the might of the human race, stay where you are and wait for my Army to slaughter all the demons and monsters before you enter the Li Dynasty!"The crowd was in an uproar. Their faces were suddenly covered in blood. Countless demons and beasts of primordial chaos were being slaughtered by a group of human cultivators!Slaughter!Rivers of blood!Some people went crazy, some knelt down, some prostrated themselves in worship, some looked up at the sky, and some directly glowed with golden light, as if they were shrouded in faith. They directly ascended to the sky with a single step and entered the divine Kingdom. In their eyes, it was as if heaven had appeared.Someone stood still and looked into the distance at the Golden armored expert who was killing the demons with one punch. Suddenly, his blood boiled and he shouted,""Li Dynasty, Beiwu!"Even though the language was different, even though the other party had only come with spiritual fluctuations, the humans still shouted out the name.That was the name of the sovereign King!Kill!He would use the most primitive, most powerful, and most violent means to kill this group of demonic beasts and demons!Although God nations were good, gods ... Were too far away.The world was in turmoil, mountains and rivers were shattered, and thousands of demons were bleeding. The once overbearing Beasts of Chaos were now wailing and killing everywhere!……In the chaos.One by one, the venerable sovereign-level Beasts of Chaos were slaughtered. The Silver Moon martial masters were covered in blood. They were crazy and didn't care about their injuries. They had been holding back for too long.Today, he only wanted to kill!Giant swords swept across the heavens and earth, long sabers whistled through the void, fists quelled mountains and rivers, and feet kicked chaos. Powerful martial masters appeared one after another at this moment, as if they had gone completely mad.We've been holding back for too long!In the distance, even the silence was shaken. In his eyes, this group of venerable sovereigns was nothing. They were just a group of guys who had barely reached the venerable sovereign level with Li Hao's help.It was extremely weak and did not have any abilities.However, at this moment, they were all brave and crazy. They had killed venerable sovereigns and were sublimating ... Why was this happening?He didn't understand.He and Li Hao didn't even need to participate in this battle. The two of them only needed to seal the world and conceal their auras to prevent some experts from escaping. In the past, the two sides had worked together in the forest region.However, at that time, the two Dao Masters 'performance was only average.However, today ... It was completely different.Was it because the people he met had become weaker?Or did they become stronger?Or perhaps ... It was because Li Hao didn't take part in the battle this time. Thus, these people tried their best to display their strengths to prove to Li Hao that they weren't crippled. They were still alive!"Emperor Slayer, He Yong of the southern Fist!"After blowing up a Chaos Beast with a single punch, Nanquan's entire body was covered in blood, and his flames soared into the sky. He roared, and even his beard seemed to be drinking blood. This Nanquan, who had been ridiculed by the Silvermoon Martial Master, was now like a Messenger from hell as he roared,""He Yong, Emperor beheading!"No one cared.The southern Fist had always been like this. It had only killed a chaos Supreme Emperor, a first stage Supreme Emperor. Who wouldn't kill a Supreme Emperor here?What are you shouting for? Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  What's there to shout about?Boring, uninteresting, shameless!At this moment, the others seemed to have received some kind of stimulation. The heavenly Sword pressed down. The huge sword was like a mountain. With a loud boom, it was incomparably majestic and suppressed the heaven and earth. A Chaos Beast was directly bent by the huge sword.The next moment, the sword fell, and with a loud bang, the giant beast's head fell!Tian Jian had beheaded him with one strike!On one side, the Silver Moon martial masters were showing off their brilliance, while on the other side, Hu Qingfeng, who was looked down upon by others, was smiling like a fortune-teller as he muttered,"There was the Marquis first, then the heavens. The Marquis was still before the chaos. Once the Marquis appeared, the chaos disappeared on its own!"A Li Hao seemed to have appeared in the world ...In the distance, Li Hao's face turned black!As soon as the illusionary Li Hao appeared, he seemed to be truly unparalleled. He waved his hand to disperse the chaos and instantly suppressed the giant beast. The great Dao collapsed as if a Daoist master had appeared and cut off his great Dao. With a rumble, the venerable sovereign fell!The other venerable sovereigns around them were dumbfounded with their mouths wide open. This works too?Even Kong Ji was stunned. He looked at Li Hao. You ... Borrowed strength?Li Hao frowned slightly and didn't say anything.Bullshit!How can I borrow the force?This Dao was really F * cking evil.'Those who don't know better might think that I've really arrived. What the hell did Hu Qingfeng cultivate?'It was indeed a little ... Powerful.

His Dao was like Li Hao 's, and it was as if Li Hao had descended. Even though he didn't have the real Li Hao's abilities, in Hu Qingfeng's eyes, Li Hao was truly invincible. He could destroy the world with one hand and free from the chaos.It was normal for a venerable sovereign to die with one punch."Lord Marquis, please return!" The chanting sounded again.The shadow Li Hao quickly disappeared, as if nothing had happened. In front of him was a dead Primal Chaos Emperor, who had been furious even at death. The leader of the group had actually tried to assassinate him!艹!That's right, it thought it was Li Hao. That powerful venerable sovereign was at least level five or six, and he had shamelessly assassinated its level one venerable sovereign. F * ck, how shameless!Li Hao himself could sense this resentment, and he was even more speechless!,m 艹!He was really wronged.It really wasn't me.If I wanted to kill you, do I need to do this?From now on, wherever Hu Qingfeng went, he would summon Li Hao ... Those who didn't know him would think that he was his father.While Hu Qingfeng was showing off the uniqueness of his great Dao, Lin Hongyu, who used to be calm and quiet, was extremely crazy today. With the scimitar in her hand, life and death appeared in her mind!She killed a venerable sovereign with one strike, but the venerable sovereign was instantly resurrected as if she had captured him. The next moment, the dead venerable sovereign seemed to have become a dead spirit and followed Lin Hongyu to kill people!At this moment, Lin Hongyu's long robe was dyed red with blood. She looked like the true Lord of the Undead. Behind her, more and more dead venerable sovereigns were resurrected and joined her team. As she waved her curved blade, she slaughtered the venerable sovereigns one by one!Lin Hongyu was silent. There was only killing intent and death Qi in her eyes. She surrounded a fourth level venerable sovereign. Behind her, the dead venerable sovereigns self-destructed one after another. The sound of the explosion reverberated through the sky and the aura of death shrouded the surroundings.The fourth level venerable sovereign was being corroded. He screamed in agony. In the next moment, Lin Hongyu, a third level venerable sovereign, had actually cut off his head!After a while, the fourth level venerable sovereign stood up shakily. Like a guard, he followed Lin Hongyu and continued to kill.On the other side, the Queen, who had transformed into a moon and shrouded the world, suddenly felt a murderous intent. On the moon, the high and mighty Queen revealed her Phantom image and looked at Lin Hongyu. At this moment, the Queen was extremely Holy and Noble!  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Lin Hongyu, on the other hand, was filled with a deadly aura, like the King of Hell.One of them was Holy and high above.One of them was covered in death Qi as if he had crawled out of hell. They looked at each other and then looked away. The Queen was secretly shocked. The next moment, a divine Kingdom appeared between heaven and earth.Countless humans were praying devoutly.The Queen let out a low cry, and the moon began to expand. Countless amounts of power of chaos and power of faith intersected, and in an instant ... The Queen had actually stepped into Tier 2!As for Lin Hongyu, she let out a low growl. The surrounding deathly aura surged into her body.His vitality had been greatly suppressed! However, she didn't seem to care. She allowed the death Qi to surround her. At this moment, countless shadows appeared behind her like guards, protecting their King!Kong Ji and Li Hao were both stunned!'What the hell is wrong with this group of people?The Queen was like a real God. Her faith soared and she reached level two in an instant. Lin Hongyu, on the other hand, was like the real Lord of Death. After killing a venerable sovereign, the corpse of the venerable sovereign could be resurrected and become her guard. Li Hao actually knew a little about this last time, but Lin Hongyu had only said that the people she killed could be resurrected temporarily and self-destruct.But now ... Why did he become a guard?Were these dead venerable sovereigns ... Still venerable sovereigns?Strange!As for Kong Ji, he couldn't take it anymore and said,""Brother Hao Yue ... It's not good! These two female venerable sovereigns ... One had become a God, and the other a ... A demon? Or did he become the Emperor of death? This ... They are born to be enemies!"One side was pure and holy, while the other side was corrupted.Although they weren't exactly two extremes, they could still be considered as two extremes. They were like light and darkness. If they encountered each other, wouldn't they fight?One of them was at stage three, and he was still absorbing the aura of death. It seemed like he wanted to take this opportunity to advance to stage four."A 2nd rank fused with chaos and directly absorbed the great Dao of chaos to condense his faith. His progress is bound to be rapid. If this continues, he'll become a top-notch expert one day. Can my brother Hao Yue hold on?Could he still suppress it?Women were really scary!Could the Dao of death be played like this?He, Kong Ji, also cultivated life and death, and so did Li Hao. However, their life and death were really different. If it was the same, the experts they killed could become death guards, then the Qi water Supreme Emperor they killed back then should have become a seventh-rank guard. How terrifying!These people usually didn't look special.But today ... Each one was more bizarre than the last!Originally, there were about 40 to 50 venerable sovereigns gathered here, including a few middle-stage ones. However, at this moment, they were all being massacred by the same number of venerable sovereigns!Logically speaking, these beasts of primordial chaos should be stronger individually.Li Hao and Kong Ji were only suppressing the surroundings to prevent their auras from leaking out.He did not interfere!But ... At this moment, things had seriously exceeded Li Hao and Kong Ji's expectations. Without them interfering, these lunatics were actually really about to slaughter all the chaos beasts!This made the two powerhouses feel that they were somewhat useless.

It really ... Left him speechless!At this moment, Li Hao suddenly turned his head and looked in one direction. He had been paying attention to that direction before, but he had been distracted by the two women just now.At this moment, he slightly raised his eyebrows and suddenly laughed.Not far away.Yuan Shuo transformed into a giant bear and his domain appeared. The five elements domain was like a Dao domain, constantly rotating and changing, enveloping a venerable sovereign. No matter how the venerable sovereign attacked, the domain only trembled and couldn't be broken.At this moment, Yuan Shuo was also trembling madly. Suddenly, he roared,"metal, wood, water, fire, earth, five elements, five DAOs! The heaven and earth stabilize the five elements, and the five elements transform into the heaven and earth! My Dao, domain formation!"All of a sudden, the power of five elements gushed out crazily in the chaos between heaven and earth!Five elements domain!The five-element domain instantly transformed into a five-element Dao domain. Five extremely thick great DAOs instantly appeared and fused together like a rainbow!The rainbow enveloped the first level venerable sovereign. At this moment, Yuan Shuo seemed to have transformed into a ferocious beast. With a roar, the tiger's roar, the bear's roar, The Deer's Cry, the bird's cry, and the ape's cry!Five birds in one!A monster appeared between the heaven and earth. It had wings, a tail, tiger claws, an incomparably strong body, and also the lightness of a leap ...In an instant, it entered the five-element Dao domain. The Dao domain instantly suppressed the Thearch. The chaos Dao of the Chaos Beast Thearch was suppressed and the power of the five elements was extracted!Even in the chaos Dao, the five elements were the foundation of most venerable sovereigns. Now that they had been extracted, the aura of the venerable sovereigns instantly weakened.BOOM!With a loud noise, the Tiger Claw pierced through the monster's head. The monster turned its head to look at Li Hao and bared its fangs, like the most brutal Chaos Beast in the world. Its eyes were red, but it laughed loudly."I am the devil of the five birds! I was born to be a devil!" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  An eye instantly appeared on his forehead!Under Li Hao's shocked gaze, the eye suddenly opened. The Dao of the five elements appeared in the blink of an eye and transformed into a Dao domain. In an instant, the God of the five Forces surged madly and suppressed the surroundings!BOOM!A venerable sovereign was pressed down directly. Lightning burst out of his eyes, and there was actually ... A vague aura of chaotic lightning. With a boom, the Dao domain suppressed and the lightning tribulation erupted. With a loud bang, Yuan Shuo, who had not completely verified his Dao, actually used the five birds Dao domain to suppress a venerable sovereign until he exploded!BOOM!With an explosion, Kong Ji took a deep breath again and looked at Li Hao.A pseudo-Emperor with a Dao domain? what the hell was this?He really succeeded?Was this even possible?I also have a Dao domain, but I only had some insights after reaching the fourth stage. I only began to perfect it at the fifth stage and only began to grow stronger at the sixth stage ... You, a half-step sovereign, can also create a Dao domain?They had seen a living ghost!Li Hao raised his chin and said telepathically, my teacher!His tone ... Suddenly had a hint of pride.My teacher, the five birds patriarch!The world's number one Martial Master, the first Martial Master to fuse five types of martial Dao forces, the first Martial Master to comprehend a domain, the first Martial Master to enter the great Dao universe, the first ... Martial Dao Grandmaster to be suppressed by his disciple to the point where he could barely raise his head and could only drill a hole.Today, his Dao domain seemed to have been formed!Although he hadn't reached the level of a true sovereign yet, he was able to suppress two first level venerable sovereigns with the power of a half-step sovereign. It was terrifying.In the distance, someone seemed to be unwilling to fall behind and let the Silver Moon Martial Master perform. In an instant, a book appeared between the heavens and the earth, and thousands of DAOs appeared. The shadows merged into one, enlightening thousands of DAOs ...The book swept in all directions, and the chaos beasts fell into it and were instantly trapped. A long river emerged from the book, surging like a river of Death. In an instant, it engulfed all the beasts, turning them into white bones in the blink of an eye! Zhang an exhaled, looked around, and cursed in his heart. Damn it, he felt that the pressure was even greater than the competition in neo martial arts!If he didn't show off his abilities ... He would be crushed to death!The Monarchs all showed their skills!Some were brave, some were crazy, some were special, some were powerful, and some ... Could only sigh.Celestial pole felt a little helpless as he watched the venerable sovereigns erupt one after another.It was really a headache!New martial arts 'venerable sovereigns were not simple. He had not been doing well there, but here, a fourth-stage venerable sovereign was not simple. But now ... He had only relaxed a little, but as a result, they had started to show up one by one.It was as if he was afraid that no one would find out that he was useless. F * ck!He turned his head and looked at King Huai. This guy should also be doing nothing, right?When he saw it, he almost died of anger.In the distance, King Huai chuckled and murmured in a low voice. The path of desire actually appeared. In front of him, a giant beast seemed to have lost its soul and took the initiative to come to his door. King Huai easily cut off its head. King Huai turned his head to look at the celestial pole and smiled slightly, as if to say ..."Don't look at me, I'm also working."Heaven's Fate cursed!All of them had gone crazy!"Roar!" He roared and threw a punch that shattered the heavens and earth. Your grandfather celestial pole was not to be trifled with!BOOM!As he punched out, in an instant, it was as if countless celestial poles appeared. In the blink of an eye, a giant beast was smashed into pieces and died directly. Not far away, a person muttered,""A Tier 4 killed a Tier 3, I thought he killed a Tier 5!"Heaven's Fate was furious. Who dared to expose the truth?He turned his head and saw that he had given up.Why did that dumb cat come out?He was too lazy to care, so he pretended not to hear.He could mess with the others, but he couldn't mess with ermao, Emperor Cang, Li Hao, or even blood Emperor venerable Wang ... Forget it!As the venerable sovereigns unleashed their powers, the dozens of chaos venerable sovereigns were unable to fight back at all. Perhaps it was because Li Hao and the others were holding the line, or perhaps it was because they had lived in peace for many years, or perhaps it was because the Silver Moon martial masters were venting their anger and fighting a crazy battle ... Under such circumstances, the world soon fell silent!The primal Chaos sector Lords were all massacred!Li Hao looked around and sighed.There were quite a few of them, probably one to one!How could there be a one-on-one battle ... Where he was directly slaughtered without even a decent counterattack? this ... Am I overestimating the Dragon Lord?Of course, these beasts of primordial chaos were only minor characters in the outer circle.But ... The Dragon field was too peaceful. It seemed that it might not be a good thing for these guys to lose their wild nature!A great victory!Or rather, it was an absolute victory.Li Hao smiled!"I, the Silver Moon Martial Master ... Seem to still be around. It's not that I'm still around, but that their hearts are still around. They haven't fallen into the abyss yet.

Chapter 3219 Sour And Stinky (1)
Everyone was blooming with their own brilliance at this moment!The 36 heroes of the Silver Moon Empire, who were still alive, were all trying their best to shine, even if the light was so weak, even if it was all thanks to Li Hao's resources.However, at this moment, they were unwilling to give up and sink into oblivion!This chaos was so wonderful! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  There are so many powerhouses out there, so I, Silver Moon, should have a share!"Our origin, the neo martial world, is just so glorious. In the chaos, everyone knows about the sword venerable, the Supreme, Emperor Cang, the human King, the blood Emperor, and many others ..."But I, Silvermoon, other than the Silvermoon King, who else can be famous in the chaos?He couldn't accept this!Even if he died, he had to die in a bad way, right?Slaughter, stop the war!Dozens of venerable sovereigns had been slaughtered by a group of people with similar strength!The venerable sovereigns were covered in blood, but their auras were monstrous. Even though some of them were seriously injured, they were still smiling.We are still here!In the corner, the last Supreme Emperor was easily killed by the Black Panther. At this point, the 50-odd Primal Chaos Supreme emperors that had come were all annihilated!The time taken was about ten minutes.The battle only lasted for a little more than ten minutes, but there were more than 50 fallen venerable sovereigns. Various realms appeared, and the slaughter was still going on. King Dali was killing crazily!In a realm, the Dali King's aura was like the sea!He had yet to vindicate his Dao, but at this moment, his aura was extremely powerful, and the aura of a true sovereign emerged. Among the five kings of Silver Moon, Li Hao, King Li, Empress Dowager shuiyun, King of the great desolation, and the Queen of the West, King Li was the one who looked the most like a king.Although he was left behind later on due to his strength and appeared somewhat incompetent, among the five big countries, perhaps the king of Dali was the most popular. As for Li Hao, he had conquered the world purely with his strength.The king of Dali had the bearing of an Overlord, but of course, if his civil governance was average, it would have to depend on Jiang Li.At this moment, countless humans in the realms were in a frenzy. Some of the native humans were also following the Silver Moon martial masters with weapons in their hands.The cries of the Phoenix, the roars of anger, and the howls of the heavens caused the entire world to tremble at this moment!This was not a realm!There were more than fifty worlds. However, there were also some worlds that were very quiet ... Because there were a few worlds that were actually ... Empty!Not a single person!There were only a few demonic beasts and some chaos beasts, but no one.Li Hao looked inside ... But he could only feel the aura of resentment and death.Did this world not give birth to humans?He didn't know ... Fine, he did.The human race was born in this world.In the world of chaos, there was no world where humans did not exist. They all existed, but where were they? Li Hao didn't say or mention it, because he knew where it was.Other than being eaten and killed, where else could he go?"Lingyue, go!"Li Hao's voice resounded,"spread your faith. Kill those demons. Those who believe in you will enter the divine Kingdom!" Take the largest world ... Forget it, take this rank six world. Those who don't have faith, enter the world!""Gather the human race! Devour the world! Tear apart the Dao net of the world, devour the world's origin, and seize the world's power!"At this moment, he didn't choose to take it slow.Slowly devour!Previously, he had wanted to devour it bit by bit, using his ethereal extent to slowly devour it, but now ... Li Hao felt that it was no longer necessary, because the dragon world had escaped!Since that's the case, why do I still have to plan step by step?I'm going to get it done in one step!There were more than 50 worlds, and he could fill up more than 50 Mirage worlds. He could directly fill them up and use the Mirage world to replace the real world. As long as it was not a top-tier expert, who would be able to tell?Who would have noticed that so many worlds were missing?And the dead venerable sovereigns!More than 50 venerable sovereigns, including rank five venerable sovereigns, were filled with the power of the great Dao. Their bodies and blood were all chaos beasts and treasures.These guys more or less had some Dao crystals, which were also good things.This was probably the most relaxed time for Li Hao. He didn't attack at all.The venerable sovereigns of Silvermoon had easily taken down these guys.Only at this moment did Li Hao feel ... Comfortable.It was so comfortable!The money he spent previously was not wasted.He turned around and looked at Yuan Shuo,""Teacher, I'll choose the five realms. You'll fuse the origins of the five realms and use the power of the five realms to become a venerable Emperor! Your Dao domain has been formed. Today is the day you will vindicate your Dao!"With the world of five regions, he could prove his Dao as a venerable sovereign. With the addition of his Dao domain, he would definitely be able to reach the third stage.This was because there was only so much world power in the world of five regions, so level three was not bad.However, as long as he had enough energy, Yuan Shuo might be able to advance to the fourth rank, or even the seventh rank!That was because of the Dao domain!Dao domain was the foundation of rank seven venerable sovereigns and the most realistic manifestation of their strength. With a Dao domain, rank seven was only a matter of time.Then, Li Hao grabbed the world. In the blink of an eye, the five small worlds around him were in his hands.They were all small worlds, no medium-level worlds. If a medium-level world couldn't gather five five five-element worlds, it would be unbalanced. On the other hand, a small world could be gathered and it would be better if it was balanced. The humans in the realm were shocked when they saw the giant hand covering the sky and directly capturing the sky.At this moment, the Queen's voice reverberated,""This is a human expert, the king of the Silver Moon! Those who believe in me can enter my Holy Kingdom. Those who do not believe in me can enter the country of Dali!"
