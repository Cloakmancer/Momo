        Hao said calmly."Staying dormant will only make the bad guys more arrogant. The good guys will be completely annihilated. People's hearts will be completely destroyed. The world will be completely dark! After lying dormant for so many years ... I've lost all my energy, Qi, and spirit, so how can I have a better outburst?"
         "When you reach the divine power level, you'll say that there are too many divine powers, the nine divisions are too strong, and the three major organizations are too strong. I can't match them, so I'll lay low for a while. "When you've reached the level of divine ability and others have reached it, you'll say,"I'll lay low for a while more ..." After a few years, when you're about to die and be buried in the ground, you'll tell your descendants that I've been waiting for an opportunity my entire life, but unfortunately, it didn't come ..."
         Li Hao laughed mockingly,"yes, I didn 't!" "If that's the case, then it's fine. But because of your dormancy, the entire night watchman, the entire powerful organization, has completely decayed! Isn't that a sin?"
         Yao SI's heart seemed to be in a mess.
         Indeed, he didn't expect such a result. Feeling a little tired, he glanced at Li Hao and said softly,""You can leave first. I'll think about it ... In my entire life ... I never thought that someone would say that about me. I thought ... Thought ... You would need my help ..."
         I thought Li Hao would come to me for help.
         I thought that people like hou Xiaochen and Li Hao would be able to sense how powerful I am.
         However ... He did not expect such an ending!
         Li Hao stood up, looked at the old man, and said softly,""That's what I thought at first, but when I thought of the oath that the night watchman had sworn, to protect the safety of the land, to protect the home and the country ... And look at you drinking the spring of life here, as if you were watching the ups and downs of the world ... I ... Am disgusted!"
         Li Hao turned around and left.
          The old man was stunned. He was ... Disgusted?
         He was disgusted!
         Yao SI's expression changed. After Li Hao had walked far away, he suddenly smashed the table with his palm and Xiao Ye hurriedly entered.
         "Get out!"
         The old man was enraged, like an enraged Lion!
         Xiao Ye was shocked and hurriedly turned to leave. The old man suddenly called out to her and said in a deep voice,""Little ye, let me ask you. In your eyes, I don't care about the night patrolman. Am I right or wrong?"
         Xiao Ye was stunned. She looked at the old man and did not know what to say.
         The old man looked at her, his eyes fixed on her, and gritted his teeth."Let me ask you, are the night patrollers lousy or not?"
         "Of ... Of course not ..."
         "How could it be ..." Xiao Ye said nervously.
         "Then let me ask you, in the past five years, has the world ... Become more chaotic or better?"
         "This ..."
         "Speak!"
         "It ... It's even more chaotic."
         Xiao Ye was extremely nervous."It's all Minister Huang's responsibility. In the past, when the Minister was in power, the night patrollers were still able to suppress them. Later on ... After Minister Huang came into power, they couldn't do it anymore. The war with the three major organizations was also a mess ... Not many people died in the three major organizations. More than ten cities were destroyed, millions of people died, and tens of millions were displaced ..."
         The old man sat down weakly,""I know, you can leave now!"
         "Yes ... Yes!"
         Xiao Ye hurriedly ran away. She was quite frightened and also felt a little regretful. She shouldn't have said that.
         The old man, on the other hand, was completely exhausted.
         He laughed at himself.  The source of my evil?
         But ... But ... Just as Li Hao said, Li Hao was right about one thing. He just felt that there was no hope and that he needed to wait for a while. He would reorganize the country after he became a divine power and stabilized his divine power.
         But Li Hao said ... This was a joke. When you reached the level of divine power, you would feel that it wasn't enough.
         Let's wait a little longer!
         Is that enough?
         He asked himself, he ... Had magical powers!
         However, did he think that was enough?
         It's still not enough!
         In an instant, it was as if that layer of cloth covering his shame had been torn apart. He felt somewhat ashamed, somewhat angry, and somewhat indignant. He was extremely furious and incomparably furious as he gritted his teeth!
         "Responsibility?"
         "You don't have the right to talk to me about this. Back when I was in my most difficult time, I formed the night watchers with a fearless heart. I fought hundreds of battles and suppressed the three major organizations. I killed countless people and earned the reputation of the night watchers. Finally, I became a superpower ... You ... Call me disgusting?"
         "I've suppressed the world for 15 years. It's just that in the past five years, I needed to stabilize my realm, which allowed Huang Long to seize the opportunity. That guy has someone else behind him, so he's not very willing to fall out with him ... And you're actually saying that about me?"
         He was angry, aggrieved, and unwilling.
         But Li Hao's words hurt him again and again.
         You're not a reclusive expert. You're the only powerful organization outside of the nine divisions. You're the only powerful organization in the world that can stand up and protect the people. You've gone into hiding ... You're not just representing yourself, you're representing all the hot-blooded superpowers!
         "Am I wrong?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He slumped into the chair and curled up. No one had ever said this to him.
         Because everyone thought it was normal.
         Yes, it was normal.
          Everyone knew that he was stabilizing his divine-tier, so wasn't this normal?
         He wasn't a divine power, but a Martial Master. Of course, it was almost the same. His Martial Master realm was very high, even much higher than the southern Fist and the others. It could be considered a divine power.
         His five internal organs were powerful and he could even exert the combat power of others who had broken their superpower locks.
         But ... Was he wrong?
         Yao SI's mentality of sitting and watching the storm instantly collapsed. It was fine if Li Hao was making things up, but what was important was that everything Li Hao said was true. Even Xiao Ye said that the five years that he did not care were chaotic, millions of people died, and tens of millions were displaced.
         This was only the central region.
         At this moment, the old man was curled up in a corner, motionless like a dead man. Martial masters cultivate the heart, while superpowers cultivate the strength. His heart was in a mess.
         It was a question from an extremely young Martial Master.
         You, are you not ashamed?
         Yao si, you are a sinner, you ... Are very disgusting!
        
         Walking out of the department head's office building, Li Hao felt very carefree!
         Scolding Yao si, he felt great.
         At this moment, Li Hao was extremely dissatisfied and angry with these high-level officials who had no power.
         As for Yao si ... Li Hao wasn't familiar with him, so it was hard to say. However, the Nightwalker side was indeed in a bad state, but in comparison, it seemed to be slightly better than the other nine divisions.
         That was all!
         As the leader of the law enforcement agency, Yao SI's inaction made Li Hao extremely dissatisfied.
         He understood a bit of the meaning behind Yao SI's words.
         He had said,"I thought you would need my help."
         Yao Si was telling him that he was willing to help Li Hao and the others, but Li Hao also told him ... That he didn't need it!
         Because even if you help, it's only right.
          And it wasn't to help!
         I'm enforcing the law!
         "I'm representing the night patrol to enforce the law and strictly enforce the law. You, Yao si, are the one who should be doing this. How can you think that you're helping someone?"
         This was a mistake!
         Li Hao vented his anger. It was wrong for the leader of a law-enforcement agency to think that he was helping his subordinates when they were in danger.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Hmph!"
         Downstairs, Li Hao heard the sound of things being smashed. He sneered and left in a good mood.
         Of course, he didn't care about the result.
         An unintentional person would not care. If these words were said to Secretary Liu and the others, perhaps they would only be laughed at and forget about it.
         The fact that Yao si could still get angry meant that he still cared about these things.
         These words from the bottom of their hearts, these words from the heart, were useless to those pure politicians. Only with the heart could one ask the heart.
         "Yao si ... Do you still have a heart?"
         Li Hao walked to the side and didn't think about it anymore. Maybe ... There was no more.
         Who could not forget their original intentions?
         Even I ... Do I still remember my original intentions?
         "People will change, they will. Yao si will, I will too."
         "Perhaps I can't stand the darkness, the murkiness, and the era of cannibalism today. But perhaps one year later, three years later, five years later ... I, Li Hao, will be one of them.
         This thought flashed through Li Hao's mind.
         In this era, one would be considered a good person if they could stay out of trouble.
         Only a Saint could benefit the world.
         ……
         Leaving all this behind, Li Hao returned to the Wei Wu Army's camp next door.
         The back and forth took less than 20 minutes.
         However, the Wei Wu Army had close to a thousand people and over two thousand storage rings. Each person could only get two or three, which was more or less enough for everyone to count.
         When Li Hao arrived, all the Wei Wu Army soldiers seemed to be immersed in the joy of counting money.
         The divine power stones were piled up into a small mountain.
         It was placed in the middle of the courtyard.
         Another group of people came forward with a large bag of divine power stones in their pockets. They swallowed their saliva and said,""Ten thousand dollars!"  "A total of 1.76 million," Mu Lin said after counting."Do you have more?"
         "There's still one more thing. Wait a moment ..."
         On the other side, another group of Wei Wu Army soldiers walked over with a big package."There are 9271 Yuan here ..."
         Just as the Wei Wu Army was about to pour them in, Li Hao stopped them.""Stop!"
         Everyone looked at Li Hao in confusion. At this moment, most of them were envious, jealous, admiring, and greedy ...
         In any case, her emotions were very complicated.
         He was also a little numb.
         The thousands of people felt their hands go weak from counting the divine power stones alone.
         1.76 million Yuan!
         This didn't include some special, larger, and energy-rich ones. They were all thrown aside and treated as another kind of resource.
         "Are there only so many divine energy stones?"
         "Right!"
         Mu Lin nodded."1.76 million standard divine power stones. No, there are still 9271 of them. Don't worry, Governor li. I can guarantee that no one will pocket a divine power Stone for themselves!"
         Li Hao nodded, thought for a moment, and then frowned slightly.""Pauper!"
         “……”
         Mu Lin was stunned for a moment.
         What did that mean?
         ,m Li Hao sighed."More than a dozen suguangs, three Metamorphoses, the four Seas Corporation, the star Douluo arena, and the wealth of thousands of nobles ... In the end, 1.76 million Yuan?"  If he wasn't a pauper, what was he?
         That's impossible!
         Li Hao was somewhat puzzled. Why were there so few?
         The two extremely wealthy places, even if most of it was handed over to the financial division, it was impossible for the two big groups to not leave something behind. Not to mention the Douluo arena, the four Seas group really had too little.
         The SI hai Corporation was not much weaker than the Xu family, right?
         Also, there were so many nobles!
         Those who dared to go out and have fun would have at least a few hundred divine power stones on them.
         There would also be great aristocrats like mu Xiaorong.
         There were thousands of people, and an average of 10 yuan per person was tens of thousands. 100 yuan would be hundreds of thousands ...
          On average, they didn't actually gain much.
         Of course, Li Hao didn't suspect that the Wei Wu Army had pocketed it. He was just thinking, did the Financial Secretary take it away in advance?
         He had given the divine power stones that he had seized to yang Shan.
         These were all the resources that he would have in the future.
         Moreover, he couldn't take everything for himself. He would definitely have to split some with hou Xiaochen and the others. It wasn't a good thing to take everything for himself. Hou Xiaochen still had thousands of Wei Wu soldiers to feed, and he was under a lot of pressure.
         Not only that, Li Hao might have to pay more and hand it over to the Nightwalker ... Even if it was just a token of appreciation.
         Therefore, he felt that it was very little.
         Mu Lin hurriedly said,"there's more here. It's the military version of the relic. One is equivalent to ten. There's a lot of them, about 20000 pieces."
         Li Hao nodded."It's about 2 million Yuan, right?"
         "Right!"
        
         Li Hao laughed,"if you exchange it for the spring of life in the nine Dragon Pavilion, it's actually only 20 drops."
         Mu Lin was speechless. So expensive?
         He immediately said,"we have also counted the spring of life. This one is more precious, so I've kept it. There are 12 drops in total. They are mainly concentrated in a few storage rings."
         Li Hao nodded. He had a general idea.
         Mu Xiaorong and the others in the transformation stage.
         Only these people had the right to have it. Ordinary Sunglow didn't have the right.
         12 drops was not a small amount.
         Previously, Li Hao had given four drops to Southern Fist, one drop each to yang Shan and Qin Lian. Li Hao only had three drops left.
         This time, he had replenished quite a bit, reaching 15 drops.
         However, in Li Hao's eyes, the spring of life was only worth 10000 divine power stones. Of course, if it was sold or taken away, he would just take it as 100000.
          "Also, there are 22 origin God weapons ... But almost all of them are yellow-grade ... They're of a lower grade. There are only two Mystic-grade weapons and no earth-grade weapons ..."
         He looked at Li Hao, who smiled and said,""Some of them have been shattered, and some ... Are still in some people's bodies. It's fine if their storage rings are taken away, but we can't really cut them open to obtain the origin divine weapon. That would be inexcusable."
         Mu Lin was speechless.
         I didn't mean it that way.
         What I mean is, are you sure you don't want to give some back?
         In the end, Li Hao understood it as "is it too little?" mu Xiaorong and the others still had some in their bodies, but it wasn't good to take it by force. They had to cut open the other party.
         " 22 ... That's not bad!"
         As Li Hao spoke, he shook his head and sighed.""They're still poor. As expected, if we don't uproot a big force, the harvest will not be as good as we want. There are so many people, but we only got this little. It's just a little better than the Xu family ... No, strictly speaking, there might not be much difference."
         One had to know that the Xu family still had three earth-grade weapons.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com There was also the heavenly Golden Lotus and the mirror fragment ...
         These things couldn't be measured with money. The heaven-grade divine weapon that the small sword had devoured was probably worth as much as this time.
         This was the disadvantage of not being able to uproot it.
         Whether it was the four Seas group or the sky Star Douluo arena, the main wealth was not in their own hands, but in the financial division.
         It could be seen how wealthy the Financial Secretary was.
         It would be good enough if these people could keep a year's harvest. They would definitely have to hand it over at the end of the year.
         "There are many other treasures, but we can't recognize many of them," Mu Lin continued."I put them all into a storage ring. There are also some ancient Dao-enlightenment weapons, but they aren't very effective, so I put them away separately ..."
         As he spoke, he gave Li Hao a few more storage rings.
         Finally, he looked at the small mountain of divine power stones."Keep these too. I found a few storage rings that are quite big. There's enough space to store them all."
          Li Hao nodded and looked at the martial masters who were leading the group. He smiled and said,""The remaining 9000 Yuan, let's split it! It's just a small token of appreciation, just treat it as a bonus. We'll eat the meat and everyone will drink the soup!"  Mu Lin wanted to say something, but the martial masters were excited and shouted,""You're a righteous man, commander!"
         With more than 9000 Yuan, each person would be able to get about 10 yuan.
         Although Li Hao had a mountain of divine power stones, they did not belong to them. Now that Li Hao had given them so many rewards, they were quite excited. In addition, there was a storage ring that everyone had, which made them even more excited.
         The harvest was huge!
         Mu Lin didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He didn't say anything more. More than 9000 stones was an astronomical figure in the past. However, when he looked at the small mountain of divine power stones, he suddenly felt ... That it wasn't too bad. There were only so many.
         I'm floating!
         Mu Lin thought to himself. After seeing so much wealth, he suddenly felt that the divine power stones were nothing.
         Look, I've counted 2 million today!
         Li Hao, on the other hand, was truly astonishing. In just a short period of one month, he had seized more than three million divine power stones and more than 50 origin God weapons.
         However, in the past month, he had killed more than 20 rising lights.
         There were even a few who had transformed.
         It seemed natural to have such a harvest.
         If the spring of life and the like were included, Li Hao's total income was more than 10 million divine power stones, which was more shocking than robbing a fairly large relic.
         It could be seen that this era was actually still very rich.
         The ones who were poor were those at the bottom.
         The higher-ups were all extremely rich.
         Look at Yao si. He had not been in charge of anything for many years, but he was still drinking the diluted tea from the spring of life. This thing was sold in the nine Dragon Pavilion, and a cup of tea cost hundreds of divine power stones. It could be seen that he, Yao si, was not poor.
          Li Hao didn't say anything. He absorbed all the divine power stones into his storage ring. At this moment, the burden on his body was greatly reduced. But soon, Mu Lin gave him another thousand storage rings.
         This was useless.
         The rest had been split.
         ? Li Hao, on the other hand, had more than a hundred of them, all from the storage rings he had taken earlier. Looking at the long list of storage rings, Li Hao smiled bitterly.
         Since when did he have a headache over having too many storage rings?
         After thinking about it, he still accepted it.
         Keep it first.
         The armor had a place to store things inside. Although it was a little crowded, it didn't matter.
         Then, Li Hao's gaze swept over the Wei Wu Army.
         There were more than a hundred people in the Wei Wu Army who had broken through the 100th level. There were not many fighting Qian, only nine Centurions, Jin gun, Mu Lin, Jin gun's Guard Captain, su Dao's disciple, and Kong Jie's daughter.
        
         However, he didn't see the two of them this time. He didn't know where they went.
         It was said that frenzied sword had also come, but he did not seem to see him.
         However, these people had been in the central region for a month, and it seemed that their strength had improved a little. There were almost 200 people who had broken through 100 levels. In the team, there seemed to be a few more warrior qians.
         Li Hao looked at them for a while, thought for a while, and said,""Everyone isn't having a good time in Heavenly Star City, right?"
         Mu Lin was embarrassed.
         It was not good.
         Originally, Silver Moon was not bad. The Wei Wu Army was still very strong. It was not difficult for a 100-man team to deal with a three suns expert. If they worked together and practiced the thousand-man formation, they would be able to deal with a sunguang expert even without a few experts.
         But ... In Heavenly Star City, what was he?
         It's nothing!
         Strictly speaking, breaking through one hundred perfection was only comparable to a full moon, not even comparable to the sun glory.
          Of course, they also had more than 500 black banners.
         In the past, when thousands of heaven-battling soldiers had fallen, hou Xiaochen had taken the most, Li Hao had taken 100, and the rest had been divided among the three great organizations. However, they didn't have the authority to completely activate Black Phoenix.
         As a result, it was only slightly stronger in defense.
         Li Hao still had more than a thousand sets of space-piercing armor, but he had yet to find a way to activate them. He didn't know whether it was because he didn't have enough authority or something else.
         Following Li Hao's question, the successor of the mountain splitting axe, Chen Jin, also said sullenly, "Let's do it this way. After all, this is the central region. There are too many supers here. There are a bunch of sunlit three suns and Sunglow is not rare either ... Compared to a normal Army, our Wei Wu Army is naturally invincible! However, compared to the elites of some major forces, they have more people, more money, and more resources ... We are still not as good!"
         A small silver Moon could not afford to support so many people.
         However, the central region was a place where all the wealth of the world was gathered. Of course, hou Xiaochen and the others couldn't compare to it.
         Li Hao had originally been surprised by the treatment the Wei Wu Army received.
         Later on, he realized that ... He was really not that great.
         If one didn't reach the central region, how would one know how wealthy the central region was?
         Mu Lin also sighed with emotion."Actually, it's not that bad. The mysterious energy here is much richer. Although countless of them don't rely on mysterious energy, with so much mysterious energy, our progress is not slow when we cultivate normally."
         "As you can see, we have many more people who have broken through the 100-realm, and a few of them have entered the Qian warrior realm ..."
         "At least we'll be a force to be reckoned with when we're dealing with the Heavenly Star Douluo arena!" He chuckled.
         Li Hao smiled. He glanced at the crowd and suddenly said,""Everyone, please consider it. I'm about to open the Heavenly Star military governor's office. Would you like to come and help me?"
         “……”
         Everyone was stunned, and so was Mu Lin. After a long while, he said,"That ... Where's the Minister?"
         "Minister?"
         Li Hao touched his chin and chuckled,""He's the governor, I'm the Deputy. Of course, the Minister is the boss."
          "Then ... There's no difference, right?"  He carefully glanced at Li Hao.
         What do you mean by that?
         Li Hao grinned."There is a slight difference. The elites of the Wei Wu Army, apart from being members of the Wei Wu Army, can also join our demon hunt squads. They will have some additional benefits and benefits ... Of course, there won't be too many people, at most 500!"
         "The overall structure won't change, but the scale of my demon hunt squad will be expanded. The team-level units will be a thousand people per team ..."
         Mu Lin's teeth ached.
         He looked at Li Hao from head to toe for a long time, but didn't say anything.
         Li Hao chuckled."Please consider it. We're all friends. There's no hurry." Oh, that's right, there are too many benefits to joining a demon hunt squad. For example, the black flames can be fully activated, greatly increasing their defensive power. This is only one of them! Second, the probability of breaking through to the thousand warrior realm would increase greatly! Third, after you enter the warrior dimension, you all have a very high chance of entering the spirit accumulation stage ... Yes, my teacher has completely understood the first stage of the spirit accumulation stage ... Everyone can cultivate it. "
         "Fourth, I have a unique military formation of five people, which will greatly increase my strength! Right now, a hundred-man squad can only deal with the three suns, but after joining the demon hunt squads, I'm confident that a single squad will be able to deal with an early stage sunrise without any difficulty!"
         "And this is on the current basis. Once everyone's strength improves, I dare to guarantee that a team of 100 people will be able to deal with enemies who are at least two major realms above them!"
         "For example, if all of us fight against one another, it's only comparable to sunlight. But if we work together well ... I can't say for sure about magical powers, but we can kill even a transformation stage cultivator!"
         Hundreds of Qian fighters joined hands, merged their qi and blood, and activated their armor ...
         Was there any hope in dealing with the metamorphosis?
         There were!
         Li Hao was well aware of this. Moreover, after stepping into the Qian dynasty, with his help, the accumulation of spirit would be even faster. At that time, it would be even more incredible.
         The demon hunt squad members left in Silver Moon were too few!
         Previously, Li Hao didn't want to recruit more people, but ... Li Hao realized that the more people there were, the more powerful they would be. Everyone might not be strong, but what was the point of one person breaking a hundred?
         But what about a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand people?
          Didn't Liu Yunqing say that the People's sentiment was useless?
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com What a joke!
         100,000 ordinary people, all wearing armor, with their vitality fused together, as long as they knew the basic circulation method, they would all have vitality. By then, 100000 people could kill Xu Guang!
         He was talking about ordinary people!
         A million people?
         What about ten million people?
         A billion?
         In this world, there was no lack of ordinary people!
         Of course, being able to wear armor was actually a huge problem.
         Li Hao did not have many left. He only had a few dozen black armors. The Wei Wu Army had more than 500.
        
         And this was for ordinary people.
         Li Hao couldn't really let an ordinary person kill Xu Guang. As long as one had some Foundation and some martial arts, and didn't need to start from scratch, it was actually very easy for a person who hadn't entered the ten-slash realm to reach the ten-slash or hundred-slash realm in this era.
         There was no barrier before breaking through one hundred.
         With that, 10000 over 100 martial masters would be enough to suppress the transformation without any difficulty. They could even deal with divine powers!
         Liu Yunqing's words made Li Hao feel indignant!
         Who said that the hearts of the people were useless?
         What a joke!
         It was useful!
         As long as they dared and were willing, ordinary people could still counterattack and rise.
         He even had some ideas in his mind. The 1000 people in front of him were not weak, and many of them had broken through 100 perfection. If they all learned the ten-ringed mountain-sealing array and fused their qi and blood into Li Hao's body ... With him as the core of the array, he would even dare to battle divine powers!
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com In the past, he felt that these guys were not reliable.
         Looking at it now, well, it was still okay.
         At the very least, he was more reliable than anyone other than Silver Moon. Thus, Li Hao's thoughts changed slightly. He wanted to seize power ... No, he wanted to help hou Xiaochen raise his Army. Old hou seemed to be rather poor.
         As for why he didn't greet hou Xiaochen first ... Li Hao didn't bother to explain. Hou Xiaochen seemed to be outside the wall, and he was listening.
         It looked like he wanted to come in and beat him up.
         ……
         Hearing Li Hao's words, some people became excited and their breathing quickened.
         Stepping into the thousand warrior tier, stepping into the spirit accumulation tier, special formation, activating the armor ...
         Oh my God!
         Mu Lin was a little excited, but he quickly regained his senses. He gritted his teeth and smiled with some difficulty, refusing,"This ... We can't make the decision. Governor Li, you ... You can ask the Minister, ask the boss of the Golden Gun ... We ... We can't do this ..."
         As he refused, many people's eyes dimmed, but they didn't say anything.
         That's right!
         They wanted to become stronger, but they had been trained by hou Xiaochen. How could they be ungrateful and betray their master?
         Of course, they would only consider it if Li Hao said so.
         Li Hao was also a member of their system. He was a Silver Moon Martial Master, an acting chiliarch of the Wei Wu Army, and the deputy head of the night patrol ...
         Moreover, he had a good relationship with hou Xiaochen.
         Otherwise, no one would have been moved.
         Li Hao chuckled,"you won't consider it?" "As for the Head of Department, he won't say anything even if everyone is here. At this stage, I won't take all of them. I'll only take half. Only those with armor can come ... Those who want to stay can also give the armor to those who want to leave ... Aren't we all eating in the same bowl?"
         "Well ... Let's ask for the Minister's opinion!" Mu Lin said awkwardly.
         Li Hao smiled.
         "Li Hao, what's up with this time?" someone chuckled outside the door.
         Hou Xiaochen walked in with his hands behind his back, accompanied by majordomo Yu. He looked at Li Hao with a smile, and his eyes seemed ... Murderous. 'Good Lord, what are you doing?
          "Minister!"  Everyone was shocked!
         The Minister was here.
         However, Li Hao laughed and said,"Minister, I'm planning a future for my brothers!" "The Minister also knows that we've seized a lot of things recently. I have too much money and have nowhere to spend it. Money is only money when it's spent. If it's not spent, it's just stone! I was just thinking that since we're all colleagues, I should fight for some benefits for everyone. "
         "Then you can just give it to him directly!"
         Hou Xiaochen said with a faint smile.
         Li Hao sighed,"I also want to!" "However, Silver Moon martial masters aren't the type of people who would take things that they don't get. I know all of you, and I understand all of you. If I were to give it to you for free, would you all feel bad? It will leave behind inner demons!"
         Everyone roared in their hearts, no way!
         We won't leave any inner demons behind!
         Go ahead!
         However, what else could they say? were they really going to shamelessly say that they liked to eat for free?
         Then wouldn't everyone be using the southern style ...
         Cough, cough. The southern style didn't eat for free. If you called him when you were fighting, he would do it. He would just pay.
         Hou Xiaochen was also speechless.
         What could he say?
         Mu Lin also laughed awkwardly."Yes, Governor li is right. We are not that kind of people. We have to work hard to gain something. In the spirit of ancient martial arts, we must work hard for something that we gain!"
         Li Hao spread his hands and said helplessly,"Minister, you heard it too. So ... Can I ignore everyone's martial heart?"
         “……”
         Hou Xiaochen looked at him for a long time before saying,"You can also send me ..."
         "It's a waste to give it to the Minister!"
         Li Hao sighed."The divine power stones that the department head obtained aren't of much use. They can't be converted into combat power in a short time. Time is needed, and what we lack is time!"
         Hou Xiaochen wanted to roll his eyes!
          This dog is trying to abduct my Wei Wu Army!
         He pondered for a while and made a judgment. Then, he slowly said,""Do you really want to establish the governor's office on your own?"
         "What?"
         "Minister, didn't you say so earlier?" Li Hao was stunned.
         Hou Xiaochen was speechless. "I'm just saying. I'm not really opening it. It's just a title. From what you're saying, if you really want to do it, are you going to stay here and not leave?"
         After a moment of silence, hou Xiaochen said,"My energy is still on guard against some powerful people ... I don't have enough time to care about these things. There will be some unrest in the imperial family of the nine divisions in the next few days ..."
         He looked at Mu Lin and the others, thought for a while, and slowly said,""If they are willing ... It's fine for them to join your demon hunt squad."
         "But you have to promise me one thing ..."
         "What?"
         "Don't let everyone die in vain ..."
        
         He looked at Li Hao."You're too ostentatious. It's both a good and a bad thing!" However, your current strength is not enough to support your arrogance. If you encounter any danger, you can escape ... But they ... Can 't!"
         In fact, it was a good thing that these people followed Li Hao. Li Hao was rich, capable, and could teach them the true way of the accumulation of spirit.
         The path that hou Xiaochen and the others took wasn't suitable for widespread use.
         This was the true path of the elite!
         Only the elites among martial masters could learn it. As for the path of spirit accumulation ... Since Li Hao said so, perhaps it could be popularized.
         Hou Xiaochen was not too concerned that Li Hao wanted to take him away, but ... Li Hao had provoked his enemies too quickly. He could escape, but the Wei Wu Army could not.
         After saying that, he continued calmly,"so far ... You're actually still a loner. Other than your master, you have nothing to worry about. You're absolutely unrestrained! Li Hao, a true general ... Would never abandon his comrades! You've led troops in Silver Moon before, even if it's only a few dozen ... You made them stay in Silver Moon, so you should know the danger of provoking an opponent ..."
         "When you really lead a thousand people ... You have to know that they are people, martial masters, comrades-in-arms, and colleagues. They are not just your subordinates and tools. You have to think about their future and their safety ... Maybe it is also a restriction for you!"
         Was it good or bad?
          Li Hao laughed,"you're overthinking, Minister!" "I've thought it through very clearly. In this era, if you want to do something, if you want to be outstanding, if you want to break through the social classes ... Then you have to put your life on the line! If everyone was willing to risk their lives, they could come. If they were not willing ... Then they should not come! "I'll think for them, but I'm not a babysitter. Taking risks is inevitable ... Once I'm defeated, I'll do my best to settle everyone down ... But if things really get out of hand ... I might run away ..."
         Hou Xiaochen looked at him and frowned.
         Li Hao said calmly,"we'll risk our lives and our future!" I don't know what the future will be like. I don't know if it's still so dark ahead, and I don't know what will happen to me in the future ... It doesn't matter if it's good or bad. A General's success is built on ten thousand bones! Minister, someone will die eventually. Let's see if everyone thinks it's worth it!"
         He turned to look at the martial masters."In the Silver Moon martial forest, martial masters are free and unrestrained. They also pursue strength! However, martial masters do have hearts. If you have the heart, then try it. If you are afraid of death, then don't try it!"
         The surroundings were silent.
         Hou Xiaochen looked at Li Hao for a while, then said,"Then let everyone make their own decisions. I won't interfere with anyone! He can't be a deserter, because he paid a great price to get to where he is today. But if he were to go to the Heavenly Star military governor's office or join a demon hunt squad ... That's no problem. "
         "Everyone, do as you see fit!"
         Li Hao laughed,"I won't force anyone!" "The key is to look at one's heart. A melon that is forcefully twisted is not sweet. For example, now, even if Chief Steward Yu wants to, I will not agree ..."
         Chief Steward Yu was stunned. He looked at Li Hao, then at hou Xiaochen, and then at hou Xiaochen. He would not!
         Everyone held back their laughter.
         Hou Xiaochen was speechless. They were talking business, but this bastard had to drag Xiao Yu into it. What was he trying to do?
         He didn't say anything more."You deal with the nobles first!"
         "No problem!"
         Li Hao laughed heartily. At this moment, he was able to speak with confidence in front of hou Xiaochen.  It was a kind of self-confidence and also a kind of clarity!
         The moment he was willing to leave the Silver Moon and come to Heavenly Star City, he felt that he no longer had to fear anything. Whether it was danger or death, it was as if he could see the path ahead in his heart.
         ? I know that I should probably do something.
         Therefore, I have nothing to fear.
         I'm worthy of myself and my heart, so I don't need to be afraid of anyone.
         If I'm not even afraid of death, what do I have to be afraid of?
         He wouldn 't!
         "Teacher, perhaps it's just as you said. You don't need to care about what others think. As long as you think about it, that's enough.
         Everyone had their own path.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Freedom and carefreeness for taking revenge might be a path, but ... In the process, perhaps I, Li Hao, also want to leave something behind. After I die, perhaps people will remember that Silver Moon Li Hao is also a character!
         Perhaps the next time he returned to heaven battling city, the 9th Division commander would not leave him with such a bad evaluation.
         Perhaps the next time he saw Hong Yitang, he could straighten his back and tell him calmly,"little Hong, you can't do it. You're hiding in Silver Moon. I, Li Hao, have never saved anyone. I just want to be clear. My heart is towards the light. Killing and hatred have never caused me to fall into hell."
          What kind of pride was that?
         What kind of pride was that?
         ……
         Li Hao strode away with majestic steps. He was no longer the timid and cautious lurker.
         It was as if there was a Tiger possessing his body, leaping through the forest and looking down on the mountains.
         At this moment, hou Xiaochen kept looking at him. He kept looking at him ... He didn't know what to feel. In just a short month, Li Hao had changed too much. That day, when hou Xiaochen had advised Li Hao to come with him, Li Hao had thought about it over and over again ... And finally decided to stay.
         Hou Xiaochen was a little disappointed and helpless.
         But one month later, Li Hao came back, and he seemed to be a completely different person.
         At this moment, hou Xiaochen was a bit hesitant.
        
         Chief Steward Yu also took a look and suddenly said softly,""He seems to be alone ..."
         Hou Xiaochen was startled. Who?
         "Yuan Shuo! The yuan Shuo from twenty years ago ..."
         "At that time, Yuan Shuo was just like this," chief Yu said softly."He was overbearing and unparalleled. I could do whatever I wanted in the world. Perhaps my strength was not the best in the world, but I ... Dared to fight heroes from all over the world! A man who comes to this world is fearless in life and death ... This master and disciple ... Are becoming more and more similar!"
         Yuan Shuo?
         Hou Xiaochen was stunned.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He had almost forgotten.
         Was Yuan Shuo like this back then?
         "Oh, a little more than Yuan Shuo's ..." Chief Steward Yu added while he was thinking.
         "What?"
          "Slightly better looking than Yuan Shuo ..." Chief Steward Yu said after some thought.
         Hou Xiaochen was stunned. He looked at her for a moment before saying,"Who do you think is better looking, me or Ying Hongyue?"
         “……”
         Chief Steward Yu looked at him with some doubt and surprise. The Minister ... Is he crazy?
         Of course you're not as good-looking as him ...
         Of course, in the next moment, Chief Steward Yu quickly said,""The Minister is masculine while he is feminine. Of course, he's not as good as the Minister!"
         Hou Xiaochen pondered for a moment.
         But ... If I remember correctly, I'm called the sickbed ghost. Everyone says that the sickbed ghost is feminine and unparalleled. When did I become masculine?
         These words were so fake!
         ……
         At the same time.
         Li Hao returned to the night patrollers 'headquarters again.
         At this moment, there was a building at the back. It was not very tall, and it had a large courtyard. It was full of people, and only a few night patrols were on guard. When they saw Li Hao, they all looked at him with respect.
         There were many people in the courtyard, and they were all afraid of Li Hao.
         "Governor Li, can we go now?"
         Someone asked anxiously.
         It was dawn.
         They had all been locked up for a night. It was fine if they didn't eat or drink, but many of them were smelly. They didn't have a place to shower or change their clothes. They couldn't even go to the toilet if they wanted to because there were too many people and there was no place for them to pee.
          The smell here was extremely unpleasant.  Some of the noble ladies had never experienced such a life before. At this moment, they were on the verge of collapse. They covered their faces or wrapped their heads, afraid that others would smell the stench on their bodies and recognize them. If that happened, they would not be able to live.
         With thousands of people, the screening process was an extremely difficult task.
         Besides, Li Hao still lacked a perfect intelligence system.
         These people had explained some things, but who would say that they were unpardonable?
         However, it wasn't a big deal for thousands of people to be locked up here.
         Li Hao didn't say much and simply said,""As the saying goes, kill the chicken to warn the monkeys. I've just arrived here, and it's not easy for me to gain a foothold in Heavenly Star! Be it the four Seas group or the sky Star Douluo arena, they're too far away from ordinary people. They're not enough for me to become famous and establish my authority here!"
         "I'm a man who speaks my mind. You guys must have been wronged to kill all of you! Nine out of ten, there must be some fish that escaped the net!"
         Many people's expressions changed when they heard this.
         Li Hao said coldly,"I'm too lazy to go through them. You guys do it yourselves. There are 4000 people who have been captured!" Pick out 100 of them, I want to behead them in public as a warning to the others! You're all from big families. You have channels, manpower, and resources. Choose 100 people, don't choose people from the Heavenly Star Douluo arena, don't choose those powerless people from the four islands ... All of them must be aristocrats!"
         "I want evidence that they must have killed him! The kind that had all the witnesses and material evidence. With all the information, it would be obvious that this person deserved to die and should be killed! After that, I dragged them to the entrance of the market and cut off their heads ... The rest of them can go back!"
         “……”
         There was a moment of silence, and the next moment, someone was terrified.
         "You want to kill us?" someone screamed.
         Li Hao said coldly,"remember, only kill 100 people!" "The evidence has to be conclusive ... Don't even think about faking it. If there are too many people, I can't be bothered to check and screen them one by one. However, I still have the means to judge 100 people. You can make your own decision ... I'm not participating, so if you don't choose a hundred people ... Then everyone can stay here and see if your backer can bring you out alive!"
         As soon as these words came out, some people's expressions changed, some people were frightened, and some people were flustered and scared.
         Li Hao's words were too vicious!
         Let them choose!
          Mu Xiaorong couldn't help but say in fear,""If you do this, then wouldn't we have offended 100 families ..."
         Li Hao smiled and nodded,"yes!" You just realized?"
         Mu Xiaorong's expression changed."Do you know?" she asked."If we do this ..."
         "I've offended 100 families, right?"
         Li Hao laughed."I'm not afraid. If they have the ability, they can come and take revenge on me!" "Of course, it's your choice ... I didn't have to kill them. Also, killing them is their crime, and they deserve to die. If you don't choose now, by the time I investigate them one by one, perhaps more than a hundred people will die. Some people might not be able to escape!"
         ? Fear, anger, and even the urge to kill!
         Li Hao was a madman. It was bad enough that he had offended people, but he had also dragged them down with him. He had made his choice. The families of those who had been killed definitely hated Li Hao to death, but they also hated those who were alive, or perhaps even more!
         Why are my sons and daughters the ones who died, not you?
         What right do you have to push my son and daughter out as scapegoats?
         Anyone who was smart knew what they would face next. All of them turned pale, and some of them could not even stand still. They were extremely terrified."Governor li ... If that's the case ... The people from the small families ... Would not dare to go against the big families ..."
        
         "The evidence is conclusive," Li Hao said calmly."If you're a good person and the big families accuse you, I'll make the decision for you! If you're a bad person ... Bad people don't matter if they're from big or small families. Since you're a bad person, you should be killed. Is there a problem? "I can only say that there might be some fish that slipped through the net, and those who are worse than you might escape ... It doesn't matter. If there's a first time, there will be a second time. Those of you who leave next, take it easy. As long as I'm alive, don't run into me. Otherwise, you'll still be unable to escape death!"
         "Governor li, are you really not afraid of death?"
         Fear of death flashed in someone's eyes. He appeared tough but was actually timid."For many years, no one has dared to kill a hundred aristocrats in the stellarsky city, or even the entire stellarsky dynasty!"
         "Now I have one!"
         Li Hao pointed at himself and smiled brightly.""I dare! So, don't threaten me anymore. I'll return the communication Jade to you later, and you can contact your family, your parents, and others ... Find evidence. I want to cut off 100 heads ... Unless I die before that. You can also ask your family to send divine powers to kill me. If they don't send divine powers, then forget it, but if they do ... I'm looking forward to it!"
         The group of people instantly froze.
         Use your divine arts ... Kill him!
         Li Hao's arrogance was unparalleled at this moment.
         Mu Xiaorong gave up completely and didn't say anything more. She only sighed. This time ... She probably couldn't stop him.
         Divine power?
          At this stage, which magical power would be willing to take the risk?
         Or, a few more?
         However, Li Hao was so arrogant. Did he have the confidence to do so?
         Who would be willing to be the one to take the lead?
         The financial division was lying flat, and the three major organizations of the Crimson Moon did not dare to rashly enter the city. They were also afraid of the ninth division's plot, and the ninth Division and the royal family were mutually restricted ... Where could they find so many magical powers to join forces and kill Li Hao?
         So ... Mu Xiaorong knew very well that this time ... Li Hao was going to cut off these heads!
         More importantly, he even borrowed their hands to kill people.
         As soon as the communication Jade came back, the news spread that stellarsky city was about to fall into chaos. If the major families couldn't get rid of Li Hao, their first thought would be to kill someone.
         Even good friends might turn against each other!
         Many people could no longer stand steadily, their faces incomparably pale. They knew what kind of stain they had, knew that their own families might not be able to protect them, and knew that there were many families here that were even more powerful than them.
         Under such circumstances, everyone would definitely pick out the people from the smaller families First. The impact would not be too great.
         It wasn't like the head of the family had been killed. It was just a son and a daughter who had died. Under the circumstances where there was conclusive evidence ... Whether they died or not, no one cared. This was the choice with the least loss.
         Someone knew that he might die, so he gritted his teeth and roared,""Then, if mu Xiaorong is chosen, will Governor li dare to kill her?"
         Li Hao laughed."Vote. If she's in the list of 100 people, with irrefutable evidence ... I can hack her for you to see. I'll be the first to hack her!" He said. Her father is here, her grandfather is here, and I can also show you ... I also want to see how many divine powers the Internal Affairs Division has, do you believe me?"
         “……”
         Silence.
         Mu Xiaorong's face was also extremely pale. The next moment, she suddenly laughed."Governor Li, I'm not afraid of these things! True nobles ... Might not be as you think, doing things that violate the law ... You're right, the innocent need not fear anything!"
         Li Hao scoffed and didn't take it seriously.
         He didn't say anything. He threw out some communication jades and turned to leave, his voice echoing,""Three days, three days at most. I want a result! Three days later, if there's no result ... More than a hundred people will die ... Think about it!"
         Li Hao left.
         In the next moment, shouts, curses, and mad roars came from the courtyard.
          Some of them even wanted to escape!  However, they discovered that ... It seemed like they couldn't escape. The number of night patrols around them suddenly increased.
         The night patrolmen who used to be afraid of them seemed to have changed today. Some were gloating, some were gnashing their teeth, and some ... Were looking at Li Hao in fear. They didn't dare to let him go.
         Li Hao had said that they would die with every one of them who left. Who would dare to let them go?
         ……
         On this day, the news instantly spread, and stellarsky city was instantly in an uproar!
         "This is crazy!"
         "He's really gone crazy!"
         "This bastard ... Is he going to make the entire dynasty his enemy?"
         ? "No, my daughter can't die. She didn't do anything wrong. It has nothing to do with our family ... It's someone else's fault. Why should they arrest my daughter?"
         "Go to the nine divisions, to the imperial family, and seek justice. Li Hao can't do this!"
         “……”
         In just an instant, the entire stellarsky city was in turmoil. On this day, the news began to spread. There was too much information, and it was impossible to hide it.
         Almost on the same day, the tens of millions of citizens in stellarsky city learned of the news.
         They were all extremely shocked!
         Three days later, the star military governor's office publicly executed a hundred noble families who had committed crimes ... A hundred!
         Oh my God!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Would the nobles ... Be executed?
         Demonic sword Li Hao, Heavenly Star Governor Li Hao ... He was going to execute 100 nobles. This news was even more shocking than the destruction of the four Seas group and the Heavenly Star Douluo arena.
         On this day, the city was filled with news about Li Hao.
         "This Marquis heavenstar is too reckless ... He killed a noble. I'm afraid he won't have a good ending!"
          "In the past few decades, not many nobles have been captured, let alone beheaded!"
         "Is it true? Maybe he's just saying it. The nobles are so powerful that he would dare to do it?"
         "It's good that he dares, good kill! These bastards, who knows how many crimes they have committed ... I think they should be killed!"
         "It's easy for you to say. If we really kill him, I think Marquis heavenstar ... Won't be able to escape death!"
         "Sigh, it's hard to be a good person ... This northern barbarian is really ... Really too reckless. It's fine to kill two or three of them, but he had to kill so many ... What a pity!"
         At this moment, the northern barbarian did not have any negative meaning.
         It was just a pity and a pity.
         They didn't think that Li Hao could rival the entire ruling class of a dynasty by himself. They felt that Li Hao might not live for long.
         And this news was also spreading in all directions.
         Three days later ... Perhaps that would be the time to decide Li Hao's life and death, not the life and death of the nobles.
        
         Once the news was out, the world was shocked.
         Li Hao's actions were even worse than the destruction of the SI Hai Group. This was not a matter of killing a hundred people. If Li Hao wanted to kill someone, he could destroy an entire city, and the major organizations would not care too much.
         The strong had such a privilege.
         And Li Hao had one.
         However, to kill a noble, no matter how big or small, no matter how many, and to behead them in public, this was subverting the social class and was an extremely terrifying thing.
         This meant that the authority of the ruling class would be broken.
         From now on, everyone would truly know that the Emperor and the common people were the same when they broke the law!
         Before this, even if the imperial family retreated behind the scenes and the nine divisions were established to judge the nobles, there would be no such thing. The Duke of dingguo would disregard everything and directly shoot the city-destroying bomb, but he would only be demoted.
         Hou Xiaochen had only killed the Duke's brother in private, and the news had spread among the upper-class nobles.
         As for Li Hao ... The scariest thing about him was that he was going to be beheaded in public!
          ……
         Jiusi Street.
         Each division was filled with people. A group of old nobles kneeled on the ground and cried out,""We can't let this northern barbarian kill the descendants of all the families in public! He can be killed, even if he has to kill all of them, secretly, to establish his might, he can!"
         "He can't be judged, he must be beheaded in public!"
         "Secretary, this is a subversion. This is a sign of the collapse of the dynasty!"
         An old man wrote a letter in tears of blood, saying that the noble should not be judged in public in front of the people of the world. Otherwise, the world would be in chaos!
         Li Hao could be killed, but he couldn't be killed in public.
         "If you really kill some people in private, it's fine as long as everyone knows. You can use it as a deterrent, or you can use it to kill your enemies.
         But this time, Li Hao had crossed their bottom line.
         As such, the nobles ... Could no longer maintain their so-called face, dignity, and privileges.
         It turned out that nobles could also be killed and judged.
         When their heads fall to the ground, they don't look any better than us.
         This was breaking the barrier in one's heart!
         The nobles knew and understood that once such a thing happened, everyone would realize that the ruling class could be overthrown.
         To break the wall in the hearts of the people!
         An impassable wall!
         ……
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The Financial Secretary.
         Liu Yunqing, who had originally wanted to go into seclusion, opened his eyes and listened to the sound of blood crying outside. This time, it was not just one family, but nine families. Even the imperial family had people kneeling and begging for a petition.
         He couldn't let Li Hao succeed.
         Otherwise, the country would be destroyed.
         Liu Yunqing sneered and sneered."I thought I would have to wait for a long time. In the end ... The other eight divisions will probably regret it today."
          He regretted letting Li Hao Do as he pleased yesterday.  He revealed a cold smile but did not respond, did not speak, and did not appear.
         What does it have to do with me!
         The Financial Secretary had so many powerhouses killed and no one said anything. Now he was worried?
         "I knew that this person would not give up ... He dared to ignore the Royal power and attack us. He also dared to overturn the world ... Just wait and see!"
         Liu Yunqing sneered and chose not to ask.
         He allowed the old people outside to cry and wail.
         ……
         At the inspection Office.
         Today, the Inspector General didn't seem to be as excited and happy as yesterday.
         Outside, the sound of crying and wailing could be heard.
         Inside, Huang Long angrily rebuked,"Secretary, Li Hao's actions are simply crazy. He wants to drag the inspector and the night patrollers into the water!" It's one thing for him to annihilate the four Seas group and the sky Star Douluo arena yesterday, but he actually wanted to kill hundreds of nobles in public ... And even arrest thousands of them ... He's ... Crazy!"
         "I want to dismiss him from his position as the Vice Governor of the star military governor's office ... Didn't he say that this is his right?"
         "Then make sure he doesn't have the right to do so!" Huang Long roared. Li Hao killed the innocent, implicating the entire Inspection Office and all the Nightwatchers. He's too selfish!"
         It was extremely quiet.
         No one spoke.
         Even for the Secretary, if Huang Long had roared like that, he would have punished him.
         However, at this moment ... He was a little hesitant.
         He knew that Li Hao's group was very arrogant, but he really didn't expect that Li Hao would ... Actually execute over a hundred nobles in public. This matter could be a major or minor one. To put it in a major way, it could overturn the rules and rule of the dynasty that had been in place for two hundred years.
         Revolution!
         Yes, at this moment, the Secretary who had read a lot thought of this word.
         Li Hao, this is a revolution.
          Change the order of nobles and change the order of the privileged.
         In fact, all of them, including Li Hao himself, were in this class. As a high-ranking official of the provincial governor, they even proposed that he be promoted to the Deputy Minister of the night patrollers. Whether he succeeded or not, Li Hao would be a noble.
         Moreover, he was the newly-appointed Marquis heavenstar.
         The Inspector General was thinking, did the royal family ... Regret it?
         He smiled. Perhaps he regretted it.
         The royal family wanted to use Li Hao to suppress the nine divisions, but he turned around and did something terrifying.
         "Secretary!"
         When Huang Long saw the Secretary suddenly laugh, he couldn't help but remind him,"I was just talking about whether to dismiss him or not, you have to give me an idea."
         He continued,"Secretary, as you can see, the nine secretaries and the palace gate are all nobles. These people are the foundation to maintain the entire star dynasty. If something goes wrong ... The dynasty will collapse!"
         He frowned."Li Hao doesn't know how to use his brain at all. That's how boorish people are. He doesn't understand. It's not that the night patrolman is not doing anything. He just can't be so impatient!" We have to do it step by step. Once we kill these nobles, the people will be in a state of panic, and the entire dynasty will collapse!"
        
         When he said this, some people in the field agreed. Some people sighed and said,""That's right. The inspection Office also wants to work hard and enforce the law strictly. But Li Hao has to think carefully. If there's really a riot, what should we do?"
         Even the inspection Office, which had previously benefited from Li Hao's radical approach, now felt that it was inappropriate.
         "Secretary," someone said,"it's easy to think that Li Hao's actions are secretly supported by the inspection Bureau. Otherwise, where did Li Hao get the courage to do it?"
         "We need to consider whether he should continue to hold the position of the Heavenly Star Vice Governor ... As long as he is dismissed from this position, he will have no right to make a move in Heavenly Star City!"
         Among the group of people, some were against it while some agreed.
         This matter was really too difficult to bear.
         The Secretary looked at Yao si who was holding the large tea jar and seemed to be a little absent-minded, slowly saying,""Old Yao, what do you think?"
         Yao si seemed to have just woken up. He raised his head and looked at him with a somewhat confused expression."What?"
         The Secretary was speechless. After a long while, he said,"you gave him the Vice governor's office, but the Heavenly Star governor's office is not under our jurisdiction. It's an internal organization of the night patrollers. The official position goes through the inspector, and the Deputy position is decided by you. Let me ask you, what do you think of Li Hao's case?"
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He spoke a little more.
         At this moment, he had a lot of thoughts in his mind, but he felt that none of them were appropriate. Otherwise, with his personality, he wouldn't have asked Yao si.
         p It was obvious that he was hesitating.  Should he continue?
         Yes, Li Hao's move brought great authority to the inspection Bureau. It could even help the inspection Bureau gain a firm foothold and aim for the First Division. However, this would cause great trouble for the inspection Bureau!
         Before this, he had always supported them. Even though he hadn't said it explicitly, he had given Li Hao's group his full support, whether it was to strengthen the inspection Office or for other reasons.
         However, at this moment ... He hesitated.
         This was a revolution, the kind that would change one's life.
         Yao si seemed to be in a daze. After a long while, he said with an aged look: "It's just killing a hundred criminals ... So what if they're killed? there are so many nobles, what's the matter with a few deaths?"
         Huang Long immediately said unhappily,"it's not a matter of killing a hundred people. Li Hao killed them in secret or in some other name. As long as he didn't kill them in public, the dynasty doesn't lack such a few aristocrats. But he killed them in public!" Was the Head of Department old and didn't understand, or did he think that this matter didn't concern him? At that time, the position of the Tian Xing Vice Governor should not have been given to him. Moreover, the Minister did not even say anything and directly signed the appointment letter. Why didn't they hold a meeting to study it at that time? I only found out later that Li Hao actually became the Vice Governor!"
         Yao si laughed and lightly coughed before slowly saying,""I thought it didn't matter. Hou Xiaochen isn't weak, and he sent someone to deliver the documents ... I'm already old, so why should I have any conflict with him ..."  Huang Long was a little irritated."He's just an outsider. The Minister can just push the blame on me. Why are you afraid of him?"
         Yao si gently exhaled and looked around. He didn't care about Huang Long's rudeness. He looked at the chief patrol Secretary and said softly,"Are you going to step down from Li Hao's position? It's not impossible, but the arrow is already on the string ... The night patrol and the inspector have finally established some authority ... If they remove Li Hao now, I'm afraid ... Their prestige will be swept away, and they won't be as good as before. "
         "Old Huang's words make sense." Yao si slowly said,"but old Huang, you've forgotten that our current status was given to us by the inspection Office. It was given to us by the night patrollers. Now that we've removed Li Hao ... It's the same as handing over the law-enforcement power to someone else."
         Yao SI's words were very light, and he didn't have any intention of reprimanding. He only spoke slowly.
         "This time, even if we don't agree ... It's not appropriate for us to object. Opposing Li Hao is actually opposing ourselves ... If even the night patrollers and the inspector don't support us, how will outsiders see us?"
         "Cough, cough, cough ..."
         After coughing for a while, he smiled.""It's just killing a hundred juniors who committed crimes. It's not that serious. The increase is too great! As long as there's evidence, reasonable, and legal, there's no problem. Secretary, what do you think?"
         The inspector glanced at him, and his eyes flickered for a moment.
         "Minister, you don't understand!" Huang Long said anxiously again. Besides, if we remove Li Hao, there won't be much to say. There are too many people in the world who wish for him to die. Everyone will only clap their hands and cheer. Who will doubt us?"
         Yao si seemed to be hesitating, after a while he said: "At least ... Some of the citizens of stellarsky city will doubt us ..."
          Huang Long was taken aback and laughed in spite of himself,"the Minister is really ... Thinking too much!" They were just a bunch of commoners! Do they have the final say?"
         He felt that Yao si had gone senile!
         On one side, there were the insignificant doubts of the commoners, and on the other side, there were the objections of the other eight divisions and even the royal family. You actually said this here?
         What are you thinking!
         The old man was getting more and more confused.
         Yao si looked at him deeply and nodded slightly. He smiled but did not say anything more. At this moment, he was holding a large tea jar and no one knew what he was thinking.
         Seeing him like this, Huang Long thought he was convinced and looked at the inspector again,"Secretary, I think we should take care of Li Hao before things get out of hand. It'd be best if we could take care of hou Xiaochen as well ... Otherwise, the problem will be very serious!"
         The inspection Division Secretary was silent for a moment and then said,""Just watch!"
         "What?"
