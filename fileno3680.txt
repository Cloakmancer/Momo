Huntian's order was very strong, but ... It lacked flexibility. When countless humans shouted, its order seemed to collapse and couldn't bear the changes of the times.Once there were too many civilizations and too many thoughts, his order would be broken.So, true order ..."True order should not be eternal, just like time. It is not eternal and unchanging. It ... Will change!" Time would change.Therefore, there was no such thing as absolute. Once the rules involved absolute ... They would be denied.Li Hao smiled.At this moment, he discovered some problems that he had not noticed in the past. Every creator hoped that the rules they had established could be used for generations to come.History was like this, dynasties were like this, and civilization was like this ...They even hoped that their own rules would become the teachings of their ancestors, the laws of their ancestors.However, they were ... Wrong.Times would change.Not to mention the rules of a million years ago, even the rules of yesterday might not be applicable today. Every day, every moment, the rules should have changed, and people would fill in the gaps. If not the people of that time, how could they establish the rules that would rule the future?"I know how to establish the pseudo-chaos laws! "How should order be established? it shouldn't be absolute rules, only ... An outline or a rough outline. It's enough to have bones. Even bones ... Can adapt to the development of the times and change!""The people of the future should have the courage to change the laws of their ancestors ... The laws of their ancestors can be reversed! As long as we adapt to the times and the development of time ... There's nothing that can't be reversed!"Li Hao mumbled to himself, his voice growing louder and louder. Gradually, the sound of the great Dao seemed to penetrate the world.He revealed a smile.He looked at Spring Autumn and said,"no one said that the law can not be reversed!" As long as they conformed to the times, as long as they abided by the current rules, as long as they did not commit any sins, as long as the framework was still in place, and as long as there were slight restrictions, the law ... Could be reversed! Order should not be absolute!"BOOM!Heaven and earth seemed to collapse, and in the river of the path, the heavenly policy of order seemed to tremble wildly.At that moment, the 5000 Dao laws reverberated madly as they retaliated. Billions of shouts resounded throughout the Dao River and devoured the power of order.Li Hao showed a weak smile.Can a heavenly policy of order invade me?Huntian, you underestimate me too much!Your technique is not invincible.I just want to go deeper and see if your rules and order can be used. I want to make better preparations for me to split the sky.At this moment, the time star did not move.The power of the 5000 Dao laws suddenly began to reorganize. The original River of Dao collapsed in an instant.The 5,000 Dao laws shook violently and the heavenly policy of order was trapped. Li Hao chuckled and said,"Be it rules or order, they're just like a book. A book can be used as a reference, but not as a sacred object. The heavenly policy of order is a book, so why don't you understand this? We should use history as a mirror, and not ... Repeat history!"At that moment, the 5000 Dao laws transformed into divine runes. The divine runes continued to form.One moment, it turned into a book, the next moment, it turned into a sword, the next moment, it turned into a ruler, the next moment, it turned into a sentence, a paragraph of words, a story ... Li Hao smiled.This was right!Just like time, time would also change.I've finally found the true meaning of time. Time, why must it be time?"Fight. Until today, perhaps ... I have only reached the comprehension of the Dao law you had at the beginning of time ... Your comprehension of the Dao law is really too strong.The 5,000 Dao laws were constantly changing.The rules were no longer applicable, and order was no longer maintained.The power of order collapsed in an instant!In the depths of the world of order, a shadow emerged. He looked at Li Hao and suddenly shook his head."Order is absolute, and there is only one will. Li Hao, the freedom you speak of has already affected your Dao. Freedom and sloppiness are definitely not true order!""You're wrong!"Li Hao shook his head, but he didn't want to argue. No one could convince anyone, not even him.At their level, he couldn't use words to sway the other party's choice.This was the foundation of Dao!In an instant, the 5000 Dao laws turned into a sword and merged with Li Hao's hand. The sword was invisible and ethereal. In an instant, sword intent, saber intent, spear intent ...Countless wills erupted!The heavenly policy of order trembled slightly, and spring and autumn's eyes flickered as a smile appeared on their faces. In an instant, the Dao of withering burst forth and suppressed the surroundings. The heavenly policy of order trembled, but it was impossible for it to escape!The sword fell!With a cracking sound, the heavenly policy of order began to shatter. The huntian illusory figure gradually dissipated. There was no unwillingness, only regret."Different paths lead to different plans. After the chaos, all of you will become enemies!"Li Hao, I'm giving you a chance to cultivate time."You and I can control Order at the same time. In fact, you're the master of order, and I'm the assistant, but you ... You broke all of this by yourself.I originally thought that you and I would be the same.The demon of spring and autumn was stunned. The human King was too overbearing. Long Zhan was the same as the demon of spring and autumn. Only you. I feel that you and I ... Can walk together!  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ Li Hao laughed."You can't force a melon to taste sweet. Thank you for your kindness, fellow Daoist huntian!"The sword fell, crack ...The heavenly policy of order began to collapse completely!Countless wails seemed to be heard at this moment. Not far away, the spring Autumn Emperor looked at him and suddenly laughed."Before we enter the origin of chaos ... You and I can travel together!"After that, they looked at their respective requests.She looked at the huntian realm in front of her and smiled."He will create chaos. You and I will destroy the other realm! Completely destroy the order!"The old order should be shattered!

Chapter 3681 Chaotic Battle (1)
Li Hao had broken the heavenly policy of order and the will of chaos heaven.To put it nicely, you and I are in charge of order, you are the master of order, I am the assistant of order ...But how could there be a support that occupied the master's long river of Dao?Of course, it was just a nice way to put it. One would be a fool if they took it seriously. As Li Hao had thought, too much faith would eventually turn cultivators into puppets. Huntian's idea was to turn Li Hao into a puppet of order.To become the heavenly Dao that maintained order!Yes, the heavenly Dao.It was just like how a world needed an executor, a protector, and a Guardian. This would save them a lot of trouble and trouble. If Li Hao was really controlled and became a puppet of order, he would have to fight spring and autumn to the end today.Huntian was also willing to spend a lot of money.With the heavenly policy of order as the price.At this moment, the power of order was still flowing into Li Hao's River, but it quickly turned into the power of other great DAOs. The spring Autumn Emperor looked a little strange. The power of order was being assimilated by Li Hao!And not ... Li Hao being assimilated by the power of order!Li Hao had actually managed to forcefully reverse the power of order.This wasn't because his ability was special, but because ... Among the DAOs that Li Hao grasped, there were DAOs that surpassed the power of order.Time?Perhaps, only time could be stronger than order!As for Li Hao, he seemed to have seen through Chun Qiu's thoughts. At this moment, while he was thinking and looking, he suddenly said,""Time is the strongest? Does the most powerful Dao really exist in this world?"I don't think so.Who dared to say that they were the strongest in any great Dao?In the past, he pursued time and pursued the ability to replicate time. Today, he had a new understanding. What I pursue, perhaps ... Is not the Dao of time.Rather, it was the changes and impermanence of Dao.The great Dao was traceless!There was no Dao that was invincible.What Dao was unparalleled in the world?He could only change!Everything was changing. Time was like this, order was like this, and all great DAOs were like this. If one looked at it with an old perspective, one would be wrong.Nothing was constant.Even if time couldn't be felt, it was still flowing and changing.In the distance.Huntian realm.Rank 8 auras appeared one after another, all of them extremely nervous.Because they could also sense that the power of order was collapsing!Li Hao!  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  Spring and autumn!They had seen the two of them fighting each other. Li Hao's improvement was terrifying. Before, he had barely killed Samsara, but today, he was actually a match for Chun Qiu!Peng Cheng, who was guarding the realm gate, was extremely nervous. Behind him, the Vice commander of the ninth guard appeared with a grave expression.The Overlord of the South, Spring Autumn, time cultivator Li Hao.The heavenly policy of order ... Had been shattered!This had already shaken the foundations of some of the Western countries.They didn't expect that the heavenly policy of order would actually be shattered by someone. It was unbelievable. That was the source of order in the entire West. Now, the Dao master wasn't here, and these two people had shattered the heavenly policy of order ... The huntian realm was in danger!At this moment, the order in the West even collapsed!Just as Spring Autumn was about to attack huntian, a powerful power of order suddenly emerged from Li Hao's body. It filled the air, and the turbulent power of order in the West suddenly began to stabilize.Spring Autumn turned to look at Li Hao, and his expression changed."Li Hao!"Chun Qiu revealed a look of anger. Why did they still want to stabilize the order in the West?Li Hao was as calm as water,"rise and fall are the suffering of the people!" "Although the order in the West is still flawed, at least it's still peaceful for now. It's enough to maintain peace in the West ..."Spring Autumn was about to speak, but Li Hao said,"times have changed. Victory or defeat is a battle between the strong. The weak can only obey. I have no intention of breaking the short-lived and slightly hypocritical peace in the West ..."He laughed and looked into the distance, his voice resounding,""Don't worry. As long as you hand over the reserves of the chaos heaven great Dao and extract the world's power, I'll retreat!"Spring autumn's expression changed slightly, and his tone became slightly lower,""Only by breaking through the chaos heaven realm can we break the rule of the chaos heaven! Li Hao, if he kills chaos and seizes the power of Chaos, chaos and order will be balanced, and the power of the two poles will be stabilized. Even a tier 9 ... Might not be able to defeat him!"Had Li Hao been affected by the power of order in the end?Li Hao remained silent.What was order?He didn't care. He didn't care.Attacking others, ambushing others, snatching the power of the other party's world and great Dao, letting others come to his door and retreat ... Yet he also wanted to preserve the peace of the West. Was this hypocritical?Perhaps.Did Li Hao care?He didn't care.At this moment, he didn't even need to find a reason for himself. When he reached this point, he was already seeking to settle his debts and revenge as he pleased.Seeking peace of mind.It's not anyone else 's, but my own. Where my heart is at ease, it's a sunny day.This Hundun, no one is a good person. Huntian is not, Chunqiu is not, the human King is not, long Zhan is not ... I am not either.There were no good people.There were no absolute villains.Ideology, orthodoxy, supremacy, desire ...These were the things that changed everyone's life and the meaning of life.Spring autumn's expression was slightly ugly. She had come this time to break the order of huntian domain and break the foundation of huntian. She was not Li Hao. Li Hao did as he pleased, but she still had her own goals. "Li Hao!"Li Hao looked at her. Although she was small, she wasn't a little girl. She was a real old monster. Monsters were a fact, not a derogatory term.

Chapter 3682 A Chaotic Battle (2)
Spring Autumn was very powerful. Even Li Hao, who had 5000 Dao laws, might not be her match. But Li Hao was not afraid of her.There were more Dao laws and fewer Dao laws. The difference was limited when there were less than 9000 Dao laws. The main issue was the spirituality of the Dao laws. Dao laws with spirituality were stronger, but the spirituality of Li Hao's Dao law ... Was not weaker than anyone else 's.He looked at Chunqiu and said,'you want to take huntian down in one go? It's very difficult. He doesn't rely on the weak power of order here to maintain his strength. "Spring Autumn quickly calculated in his heart.If she insisted on killing everyone, perhaps ... Li Hao would fall out with her. Li Hao had a dog's face, and he would fall out with her at any time.It looked easy to talk to, but in fact, it was not easy to talk to at all.The human King might seem difficult to talk to, but in reality, as long as it was in line with the human King's wishes, the human King would be easy to talk to.In the distance.At this moment, the experts of the chaos heaven realm were both nervous and expectant. They were looking forward to a fight, but they were nervous because once the two sides stopped fighting and instead ... Directly went against the chaos heaven realm, they would be very difficult to match.Even though they had more level 8 experts!However, they were powerless against two Overlord-level existences. At this moment, they could only pray that they could delay for a while longer. When the path Lord returned, they wouldn't have to worry anymore.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  However, Li Hao clearly didn't have such thoughts.He stepped into the air and crossed the spring and autumn, heading straight for the huntian realm. He smiled.""Fellow Daoist Pengcheng and the other fellow Daoists, I'm here for nothing but money. I'm here to save you from disaster ...."Pengcheng was a little nervous. The old man behind him suddenly said,""Silver Moon King, it's said that the Silver Moon King was born in the pugilistic world, and he's a man of honor and justice ..."Li Hao laughed."Don't talk about this. It's meaningless. There are many martial masters who Rob and help the poor. There are no good people in the chaos. I'm not, and neither is your Dao master. He's rich, but he's not a good person. I'm poor, so why can't he help me? Right?"The old man wanted to continue.Li Hao suddenly turned his head and glanced at the North. His eyes flickered, and in the next moment, they disappeared. Sword energy appeared!It was overwhelming!The old man's expression changed drastically, and he roared,""Attack!"Many grade 8 experts appeared and attacked, their expressions solemn.This Silver Moon King was really unpredictable.They had been talking nicely just now, but in an instant, he changed his attitude. Spring Autumn, who had just arrived, was also speechless. This Li Hao ... Changed his attitude so quickly that she was not used to it.At this moment, she didn't say anything. She didn't have the heart to fall out with Li Hao. Since Li Hao had made a move, she didn't say anything more.He attacked instantly!A powerful aura burst forth, and the chirping of cicadas resounded in all directions. The entire world seemed to freeze in an instant, and tens of thousands of palms slammed down toward the few level 8 experts, about to turn them into dust!The strongest of them all, the Vice commander of the ninefold guards, only had around 5000 Dao laws. Although he was not weak, in her eyes, he was not much different from an ordinary rank-8.The only difference was whether he had to use one or several moves to kill him."Order!" "Die!" The elder roared, and the power of order appeared in the entire huntian realm. There was also a special power mixed in. It was like ... The faith of countless cultivators in the world!As expected, the order here had some traces of the path of faith.At the same time, the entire West seemed to be gathering energy, faith, and cultivators. They seemed to have sensed something and surged towards the huntian realm.Li Hao didn't care about that. He activated his devouring power, and the surging mental power instantly fell into Li Hao's River of Dao.Countless energies gathered into balls of light and were suppressed by the river.Li Hao's eyes flickered, and he smiled. Suddenly, he waved his hand, and the power of countless great DAOs erupted, blocking and weakening Spring autumn's attack.Spring autumn's face changed!"Li Hao!" He was furious.She had been very sincere and accommodating to Li Hao, but Li Hao had provoked her time and time again!Why?What did this person want to do?Li Hao didn't say anything. He just attacked again, pressing toward the old man and the others. The old man's expression changed again. For a moment, he couldn't understand what Li Hao was doing. Was he going to kill them personally?How hateful!He once more mobilized a large amount of Primal Chaos energy, and countless great Dao crystals began to burn, erupting with an extremely powerful aura. With a roar, he joined hands with a few rank eights, and a shield of order appeared.But in the next second, a book seemed to appear in Li Hao's River of Dao-heavenly policy of order.The broken heavenly policy of order.The old man's expression changed when he saw Li Hao engulfing the power of order.This guy ... Damn it. Li Hao seemed to be able to control the power of order. If this continued, they would definitely be no match for Li Hao. The old man's only hope was huntian path master.Only by returning would he have a chance of defeating these two.Li Hao continued to absorb a large amount of energy with a smile on his face.He didn't kill people.Why kill?"If there's no blood, it's better for each other. Isn't my teacher still there?"I've killed these people, and if huntian kills chaos, he'll kill my teacher as well ... Yuan Shuo's weight is far greater than these people.Therefore, at this moment, Li Hao was only trying to tempt them to use more explosive power, and then ... Draw.Again and again!As long as he sucked out all the energy in the chaos heaven domain, he didn't need territory and a few more rank eights weren't important.

Chapter 3683 A Chaotic Battle (3)
Spring Autumn wanted to kill them, but that was not what Li Hao wanted.Supreme Emperor Spring Autumn seemed to have read Li Hao's mind, and his expression changed again and again.Bastard Li Hao!At this moment, she was very annoyed and unhappy. She suddenly disappeared and left in an instant.Li Hao turned around and saw that Spring Autumn had disappeared without a trace!Li Hao sensed it for a moment. His eyes flickered for a moment, but he didn't care.Very quickly, an explosion came from a rank eight world in the distance.Spring and autumn had appeared!BOOM!An extremely huge Spring Autumn Cicada appeared, covering the entire world. In that world, a type 8 powerhouse's face was pale as he howled,""Chunqiu, our realm has never offended you in the slightest ..."BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated throughout the world.At this moment, the spring and autumn only wanted to vent. Who asked you to be in the huntian realm, in the West?We'll talk after I kill you!The expressions of the experts from the heaven combining realm changed slightly. The old man hollered,""Silvermoon King, spring and autumn is currently killing innocents ..."Are you not going to save him?Li Hao was stunned for a moment, then laughed."It's already my greatest restraint to not kill the innocent. If I weren't here, perhaps you would have been killed by her long ago. Or do you think you can resist the Spring and Autumn period?"Good fellow!Who else do you want me to save ...Why did you think of it?Am I that kind?"Silvermoon King, once the Dao master returns and you attack our world today, you'll definitely face the Dao Master's Revenge ... Your enemies aren't us, but those rank 9s. The Dao master once said that you want to break through the source of chaos and fight against those rank 9S. You and the Dao master ..."He wanted to say that there was still a chance for them to work together.But Li Hao didn't care about this at all. At this time, he was constantly suppressing a few people, forcing them to explode. If they didn't explode, they would die. Their boundaries were broken, but under the explosion, a large amount of order power was directly drawn away by Li Hao!Although they were strong, they couldn't resist Li Hao at this moment.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  It was mainly because ... Li Hao's power of great DAOs had a great restraining effect on them.The heavenly policy of order ... Had now become a weapon for Li Hao to extract their energy.……At the same time. In the North.Deep in the chaos.Huntian Supreme Emperor's expression was calm, but there was a hint of unhappiness in the depths of his eyes.Li Hao ... In the end, he's still my enemy. When he said that he had high hopes for Li Hao, he was actually speaking the truth.Li Hao wanted to resurrect someone and break through the level 9 seal. He was actually willing to support Li Hao. The control of the order heavenly policy was not an ordinary kind of control. It only made Li Hao a natural guardian of order.Li Hao wasn't a complete puppet, but he had to bear some extra burdens.Anyone who broke the order would be his enemy. This was the core of the order heavenly policy.The chaos was huge and there were many experts. Huntian felt that there was no one else on his side who could help him deal with some matters. In his opinion, if they succeeded this time, Li Hao would be an expert in the order sequence only second to him.Be it identity, status, or strength ... They were all second only to him.He was the number two figure in the chaos Heaven system.He had even surpassed the commander of the ninefold guards!Wasn't this kind of sacrifice enough?Li Hao, you're not satisfied!He knew that Li Hao was unruly, so he had never thought of convincing Li Hao to submit to him. He had used the heavenly policy of order and his clone to make sure that nothing would go wrong, but he had failed in the end.BOOM!A loud sound reverberated as he took a step back. The power of order in his body had been completely drained.On the other hand, the chaos path master's expression turned grave.The moment all the power of order dissipated, huntian's body suddenly exuded an extremely evil power. It was chaos, darkness, decay, desire, greed ...All the bad things were gathered on huntian.Huntian was no longer the peaceful Daoist from before. His eyes were filled with killing intent, anger, and disgust as he looked at the chaos. At this moment, he looked even more evil than the chaos path master!"Chaos!"Huntian looked at him coldly."In this world, Dao is not the only thing. Under order, there will always be bad things hidden!" I will devour all the bad things and merge them into my body so that the others will only have the good. Do you think this is right or wrong?""What?" the chaos Emperor felt the boundless evil and the turbulence of his chaotic energy.At this moment, the Dao spirit of the chaos great Dao was even a little afraid and even retreated.The power of evil!Huntian!He looked at huntian and exhaled."I didn't expect this ... That's right. You're not the master of order. Since you want to unify the world, the power of Chaos and darkness can't just disappear. I thought you suppressed it and didn't ... Devour it!"He didn't expect that huntian would swallow it himself!Just like the cat of new martial, the evil power of new martial had been swallowed by the gray cat.As for the Western Region, countless unpleasant energies were actually devoured by huntian himself and suppressed by order. Normally, he was a cultivator of order, but once order collapsed, he ... Was the true evil order.The entire chaos seemed to be filled with chaos and evil at this moment!In the northern region, countless cultivators suddenly became agitated and restless. Killing intent emerged in their minds as darkness descended!This had even surpassed the effects of the Lord of Chaos.The chaotic energy in the North was also surging towards huntian instead of chaos.

The chaos path master sighed."You and the master of order ... Are different ... He is very domineering, but not evil. You have learned from his failure, and may be more successful than him, but you ... Are ultimately no longer the master of order!"Huntian did not say anything at this moment. His eyes were filled with coldness.The order had failed!What was the point of repeating the same mistakes?Only change!That was why there was huntian today and not the master of order.Li Hao and Spring Autumn were creating chaos in the West. He had no time to talk to chaos. Right now, he could only kill chaos, absorb its power, and devour its Dao spirit to become stronger!He surpassed everyone present in the primordial chaos, and could even truly stand shoulder to shoulder with those who had descended with their true bodies, and those who possessed the spirit of great DAOs, grade nine!And not a pseudo-rank nine!  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  A violent and chaotic aura appeared on his body. The chaotic power in the surroundings was surging toward him. He disappeared instantly like a Thunderbolt. At this moment, countless forces of calamity appeared around him.A weapon appeared in his hand ... And it was actually a book.The Book of Darkness!It was even more powerful than the heavenly policy of order-this was the bi an huntian Dao Scripture!The Dao of chaotic times!Countless chaotic forces exploded, and the surrounding chaos seemed to be directly blown apart. The great Dao of the chaos venerable sovereign trembled, and the chaos power began to flow away. The eyes of this rank nine venerable sovereign were also cold and serious.Originally, his speed of destruction had been faster than the other party's speed of establishing order, but now ... When the other party had also become the ruler of chaos, no matter how much he destroyed, the other party was stronger than him.However, the chaos path master soon revealed a smile.He looked up at the depths of heaven and earth and smiled."You've seen it ... He ... Is even more chaotic than I am ... I may not be able to match him at this moment."Huntian Supreme Emperor instantly appeared and used the huntian Daoist Scripture to suppress the chaos energy. He said in a low voice,""They won't be able to come. Even if they do, they're just ordinary tier 8 martial artists. Whoever comes will die. Do you think they'll come to save you?"The chaos Dao master retreated continuously as the chaos energy on his body dissipated. His powerful physical body shook the surroundings and shattered the void!A great Dao suddenly appeared above his head!The chaos great Dao!At this moment, it was as if he had completely awakened. The primal Chaos Dao appeared, and countless Primal Chaos energy surged over. The powerful Primal Chaos energy swept in all directions, shattering the seal of the huntian Dao Scripture!This was only a rank 9, a rank 9 that his true body had descended into.It could absorb endless chaos power from the chaos great Dao to maintain its strength. The more spiritual it was, the more it could absorb.At this moment, he didn't have much intelligence, but he had still absorbed a vast amount of Primal Chaos energy to prevent himself from being quickly destroyed!At that moment, the chaos path master suddenly looked towards the North. That was where the five elements realm was located.His eyes flickered, and then he suddenly chuckled, and boundless Primal Chaos energy began to shake the area. BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated throughout the world!The experts who were still fighting below suddenly felt something. In the next moment, their expressions changed. The chaos path master suddenly swooped down from the sky. When huntian saw this, he snorted coldly and also charged down. Chaos, no escape this time!As for the chaos path master, who was fleeing in front, there was a calm look in the depths of his eyes. His aura erupted and enveloped the surroundings. His voice was cold, as if it was sealed in ice."Five elements emissaries, Sky Gold ... Please help me!"The powerhouses 'scalps also turned numb at this moment!You, a tier nine, were actually forced to run by huntian. What was going on?Huntian, who was chasing them, had an extremely evil aura, which made their hair stand on end.Even though his scalp was tingling, chaos couldn't die right now. With a violent roar, sovereign Skygold unleashed a powerful force that forced the ninefold guards back. In an instant, he led the other rank eight venerable sovereigns and flew toward the chaos Emperor."Chaos Domain!" At this moment, the chaos Emperor's aura began to envelop the area, creating a domain of chaos that engulfed all the experts, including huntian.Huntian frowned slightly.The huntian Dao Scripture instantly exploded with an intense killing intent that enveloped the entire chaotic faction.……Outside the world of five elements.Yuan Shuo, who had been waiting all this while, suddenly had his eyes light up. They ... Were all trapped!A chance!Although the two sides had been entangled, there was a chance of leaving the battle at any time. However, at this moment, as chaos and chaos descended and joined the battle, even the masters of the world of five elements, Sky Gold and the others, could not escape.The opportunity had come!He was a little happy, but also a little nervous ...But at this point, he couldn't care about this. He instantly turned into a chaotic state. In the blink of an eye, he appeared near the realm gate of the five elements realm. There were still a few powerful cultivators guarding the gate. They were all extremely uneasy.At this moment, Yuan Shuo appeared on his Flying Tiger. A weak chaotic force exploded. Before the others could react, he quickly sent a message,""It's me. Let me in. Quick ... I'm going to contact the other grade-9 experts ... To suppress chaos heaven!"“……”Outside the realm gate, there were two type 8 powerhouses standing guard. They were not from world of five elements but from outside world of five elements.Their faces changed slightly.'Who ... Is this?The power of Chaos?Then, he suddenly looked at the battlefield in the distance. He was a little stunned and a little vigilant!Who was this?'If that's the chaos Emperor, then ... Who's this?'His aura wasn't too strong!

At this moment, there were still many Level 7s in world of five elements. One of them seemed to be a little hesitant and excited. He transmitted,""It's ... A Paragon's clone?"Some of the local experts still knew a little about the five elements realm.Last time, Li Hao had caused quite a stir.He then absorbed a large amount of great Dao power and left. Later, a message came, and he left with a clone.Previously, they had also tracked him down. It seemed that ... Some information had been sent back. The chaos path master's clone seemed to have brought along a Chaos Beast and was constantly absorbing the power of Chaos.At that moment, Yuan Shuo was riding a Flying Tiger.It seemed like ... It was that Chaos Beast!At this moment, Yuan Shuo heaved a sigh of relief. He was afraid that no one knew about the situation. Since they knew, it would be much easier to handle. "It's me. Let me go in quickly. Huntian suddenly exploded, and my main body hasn't recovered its full strength. I'm afraid I won't be able to match him ..." Zhao Feng's eyes flashed.The few of them were shocked.He couldn't even fight against a ninth-rank?The two grade-8 cultivators, who were tasked to guard the five elements, looked at the other grade-8 cultivators from the world of five elements and said,""This ... Is a venerable realm cultivator's clone?""It ... It should be ..."The five elements realm experts were also a little uneasy.

Even if it has some ideas, it shouldn't be able to change anything, right?"Then should we let him in?""This ... Why don't we ... Let them in? otherwise, we'll all be doomed if they lose. Perhaps we can really contact the other level nine venerable sovereigns ..."The two grade 8 experts were also panicking.In the distance, the chaos Emperor seemed to be at a disadvantage.They were also very worried!At this time, he could only hope that the clone of the Chaos Knight could do something to change the situation.In the next moment, the venerable sovereigns made way for the realm gate."Do you need our help, venerable one?" the two rank eights quickly asked.Regardless of whether he needed it or not ... One of the two level eights still followed Yuan Shuo. Although he was a little nervous, he still followed him. He was afraid that Yuan Shuo would do something after entering the five elements realm.​ At this moment, the flying Tiger that Yuan Shuo was riding on raised its head and puffed out its chest. It was actually not afraid.Because...This guy really couldn't tell anything.And now, he seemed to know who he had been carrying all this time. The chaos Supreme Emperor?Ninth-rank?So powerful!As for the chaos outside, it seemed to be at a disadvantage, but that was fine. From the flying Tiger's point of view, the chaos here was also very strong. It was just that they had not joined forces, or they would be even stronger!Huntian was probably not his match.What was there to be afraid of!Therefore, this person was also unusually bold and arrogant at this moment.""You're blocking my way! What can you do to help? Senior naturally has a way to deal with it ..." "Damn it!" The rank eight venerable sovereign cursed.A dog taking advantage of its master's power!This fellow was a mere seventh-tier Chaos Beast. If it was in the past, he would have slapped him to death if he dared to speak like that!As for Yuan Shuo, he also took a deep breath. How arrogant.This stupid Tiger has become so bold after following Li Hao for a few days. Don't cry when you're exposed!At this moment, he was also a little excited.As long as he entered the five elements realm and seized control of the realm, the five elements Overlord would not be able to return. He would then have the hope of controlling the power of the five elements in the realm and have the ability to suppress these people.Fortunately, everything was going smoothly.At this moment, he was rapidly flying toward the realm gate, extremely nervous!These people might not be able to sense anything, but as long as he seized control of the power of the five elements, the five-element Overlord would definitely sense it. At that time, as long as a roar was transmitted over ... He would be surrounded and killed!Even though he was uneasy, it might be very difficult for him to continue ... But he still chose to enter.This might be his only chance!Yuan Shuo quickly entered the realm. In an instant, he felt the extremely rich power of the five elements. He was overjoyed. What a strong power of the five elements realm. The five elements realm was known as the most powerful five elements realm in the chaos. It was indeed worthy of its name!At this moment, Yuan Shuo couldn't care less.In an instant, the aura God appeared.He merged into the void and began to plunder the power of the five elements.He wanted to take control of the entire world of five elements and the power of five elements.He was already prepared to fight and kill, but before that, he needed to seize more control ...The venerable sovereigns behind him were all slightly stunned.The two grade 8 experts rushed over and didn't know what to do. One of them couldn't help but ask,""Venerable one, this is ...""I'll borrow some power of the five elements to communicate with the other level nines. It won't take long ..."Yuan Shuo said, feigning calmness.At this moment, he didn't know whether the two rank eights were real or fake.The other seventh-grade cultivators from the five elements realm were also a little hesitant. They all looked at the void outside the realm gate. The chaos clone seemed to be snatching the power of the five elements ...This ... Would depend on what the few sector Lords said.……On the battlefield.A great battle broke out, and the chaotic venerable sovereigns retreated as they fought, but they still covered the surroundings.At that moment, Supreme Emperor Sky Gold's expression suddenly changed."Not good ... Damn it, someone is plundering the power of the five elements in our world ..."Who was it?He turned his head to look at the five elements realm in the distance and was about to roar. Damn it, those bastards. This time, he even specially left people to guard it. Why did they let people enter the realm and plunder the five elements without anyone stopping them?Once too much of the power of the five elements was plundered, it might even lead to some problems in the great Dao universe. Their strength would be greatly reduced!

3686 Chapter 596
At this moment, it was already extremely difficult!Just as he roared, his voice suddenly fluctuated. The great Dao was in chaos. In this chaotic void, it was instantly twisted by countless chaotic forces and dissipated.Supreme Emperor Sky Gold was stunned!On the other side, huntian Supreme Emperor heard the voice and raised his eyebrows. He looked at chaos, who had been silent all this time, and laughed."Chaos ... You ... You're ruthless enough!"The chaos Thearch didn't say a word. He just looked at him, and the power of Chaos erupted again!It swept across the entire world!At that moment, it was not just the voices of Supreme Emperor Sky Gold and the others that were blocked. Everyone's voice was blocked as the chaos great Dao surged with endless chaos energy! As for Supreme Emperor Skygold, he was also panicking.This was because he could feel that the energy of his five elements realm was going out of control. It was even affecting the few of them. He could not help but shout,"Venerable, what is this ..."The chaos Emperor remained silent.Until he felt something, he suddenly sighed,""I didn't mean to do this, but of course ... The current situation doesn't allow me to hesitate. You ... Should sacrifice some for the great cause of level nine!"The three didn't even have time to react before their power completely went out of control, and a weak chaotic energy suddenly appeared within their bodies.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  In the blink of an eye, the three of them began to burn violently!Supreme Emperor Sky Gold was shocked!The five-element emissaries "expressions changed as well."Chaos path master, you ...""It's nothing," the chaos Emperor said softly."You guys don't have to worry. I'll still give tianfang face. The three of them ... They have strength, but they won't control it ... Huntian is strong now. If this goes on ... I might be killed!"In an instant, the three overlords began to burn intensely. Countless amounts of chaos power mixed with the power of the five elements fused into the body of the chaos path master."Chaos, aren't you afraid of the five elements?" huntian Supreme Emperor laughed."If I'm killed by you, do I still need to be afraid of him? If I win against you ... I've taken such a big risk this time to kill a few grade 8 cultivators. What can he do?""Bastard ... Chaos! That's Li Hao's man! It's his master! He's snatching the origin of our five-element world ... You're helping the evildoer!"What helping the evildoer?The chaos path master didn't care at all!If the other party didn't seize your origin, it would be difficult for him to make a move. With the three of them working together, they were at the peak of level eight.As for enveloping them and dragging them into the battle earlier, it was all for this moment.As for Yuan Shuo, he didn't notice him at the start, but as the battle erupted and chaos spread, he had noticed him long ago. Huntian had probably noticed him as well, so it would be difficult to hide from them.However, even if he did, it was nothing.Even without Yuan Shuo, he would still attack the five elements Overlord just in case. Of course, if Yuan Shuo did not attack, he would have paid a greater price and might not have been able to seize a large amount of spirituality and power of great DAOs.At this moment, it was much simpler.The five elements envoy was terrified. In the surroundings, there were a few experts under the command of other Dao Masters. Their faces were pale and in chaos ... They were actually depriving Tian Jin and the others of their power of the great Dao to recover their own strength.Damn it!Huntian's expression changed slightly. In an instant, his powerful strength erupted once again, and chaos swept in all directions. He instantly attacked and punched out, turning the Book of Darkness into a seal.He enveloped everyone and punched out!BOOM!The sky seemed to be shattering.It was clear that chaos hadn't come up with this idea on the spur of the moment. Rather ... He had already thought of this plan. As long as he was no match for the others, he would kill the others to repair himself and recover his peak battle prowess."Let's go!" The chaos Emperor didn't say anything more. In an instant, the three burning rank eights suddenly released a powerful chaos will from their bodies, and a loud boom resounded through the world!BOOM!The three fireworks exploded the sky and the earth. The chaos Emperor took advantage of the chaos to retreat again, his face still cold.At this moment, Tian Jin and the other two were completely blown up. Their spiritual bodies appeared and they were wailing in pain!"Chaos ... You bastard ...""We've been helping you all this time, but you've stolen our DAOs and self-destructed our bodies to stop huntian. You're trying to cut off all of them, leaving them with no chance of survival.The Dao master of chaos was expressionless.Don't blame anyone for being ruthless. That day, those grade-9 experts let me descend because I was weak and could not pose much of a threat to them, right?If there's danger, it's me.If I had a chance, it wouldn't be me.A vast energy surged into their bodies, instantly rousing the chaos energy that had been flowing away and the suppressed intelligence. The three peak rank eights had a lot of intelligence, even though they didn't know how to use it.However, at this stage, one's body already had spirituality.At this moment, he had absorbed all of them. The aura of chaos Dao master instantly grew by a large amount. The huntian Dao Scripture that had been suppressing him cracked in an instant!A powerful force surged out of Dao master chaos 'body!At this moment, it was as if someone was cursing in anger ... It vaguely came from the void and the depths of the chaos great Dao. It was the five elements path master's angry cursing.However, the chaos path master didn't care at all!The shadows of the three experts were also burned to ashes.A sorrowful cry resounded through the heavens and earth!The five elements realm in the distance seemed to be collapsing.There was a look of despair on Empyrean exalt Skygold's face. They were the overlords of the North, yet they had failed time and time again. This time, they had been completely annihilated. They had been thrown into chaos right at their doorstep. The person they thought was one of their own had been sacrificed!

Chapter 3687 Chaotic Battle (Part 7)
At this moment, even the commander of the ninefold guards, the dark shadow, couldn't help but sneer.""Shameless!""Shameless?" the path master laughed. Ask huntian, who is more shameless? What a laughable fellow, you're all so slow-witted, yet you don't know it!"Can I still be as shameless as huntian?He was too lazy to talk nonsense. At this moment, his combat power had soared. Without saying anything, he disappeared from his original spot. He did not care about the five elements realm at all.As for Yuan Shuo who would benefit, he didn't care!Chaos, chaos!He still had many opportunities. It would not be easy for huntian to kill him. He had underestimated a true ninth-rank True Monarch. At this moment, he disappeared and huntian Supreme Emperor attacked the darkness!A moment later, a thunderous boom resounded through the heavens.The chaos instantly merged into the chaos great Dao. Behind them, the five elements emissaries and the other stage eight subordinates of the Dao Masters were all shocked. They were just about to do something when a chaos will suddenly erupted around them.The few of them were instantly disturbed. Their eyes turned crazy in the blink of an eye. The next moment, they burst out with all their strength and attacked huntian and the others!As for the chaos path master, he seemed to be mumbling to himself. Countless amounts of chaos power swept over the entire world. It would be better if chaos ensued, even though a large amount of chaos power had been seized by chaos heaven.But he still didn't care about these things.He reached out his hand and grabbed something. A spiritual energy appeared and he laughed coldly. He looked around and laughed,""Although I'm weak, I'm still a tier 9!"Do you think I'm an idiot?Tian Fang and the others treat me as cannon fodder, huntian wants to kill me to establish his might and strengthen himself, and even the five elements emissaries treat me as a Vanguard, thinking that I'm their Dao master's Vanguard official ... Have they underestimated the ninth-tier?In an instant, the chaotic Dao spirit suddenly collapsed!"Pfft!" The chaos Thearch suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood as the power of his great Dao spread out. He, who had been extremely powerful and had gathered countless amounts of chaos power, suddenly collapsed at this moment!Even huntian Supreme Emperor's body froze in that instant, and countless chaotic energies began to collapse!Without the restraints of the spirit of chaos, the power of the great DAOs exploded in an instant!BOOM!It didn't matter if it was the ninefold guards or the five Element cultivators. Even the countless cultivators in the world of five elements were affected. They all went crazy, and their rationality began to fade, turning into chaos!Huntian's expression changed slightly and he said in a low voice,""You ..."The path master of the path of chaos continued to fly backward as he laughed."Even if I fall to the type 8 realm, I won't let you guys have an easy time. You're not qualified to kill me. I escaped from countless powerhouses and advanced to the type 9 realm. The order in the dark ... What a joke!"BOOM!At this moment, the ninefold guards, who had been protecting huntian like shadows, suddenly lost control except for the commander. They all attacked huntian!Huntian's expression changed.Damn it!At this moment, he didn't expect that the chaos ... Would be so decisive that it would self-destruct all the chaos spirits, causing the power of Chaos to completely fill the world. It affected the group of experts, disturbed their rationality, and made them lose control!In the distance.The chaos Emperor kept coughing up blood, and the power of his great Dao was overflowing. However, his eyes were extremely calm.Since you all think I'm an idiot, fine, I'll be an idiot this time!The daosource was still there!This chaos will turn into chaos sooner or later. I still have a chance!He did not sacrifice the five-element tyrant to strengthen himself. There was a high chance that he would still be no match for huntian. Instead, he did it to strengthen his spirituality and cause it to explode so that the power of Chaos would go out of control.Without its spirituality and the connection to the chaos great Dao, even a tier 9 would find it difficult to lock onto my position!The chaos path master laughed. In an instant, he merged into the chaos and fled madly without looking back.You guys have fun!In the back, huntian Supreme Emperor's expression was slightly ugly. At this moment, he could go and chase after chaos, but ... The ninth stage guards who had lost control might kill each other and die.That fellow had clearly made all the necessary preparations.He took in a deep breath and the huntian Dao Scripture appeared. It absorbed the chaotic energy and expelled the chaotic energy in the bodies of the ninth-tier guards, allowing them to gradually wake up. On the other hand, the tier 8 guards were completely out of control!Huntian's expression was cold. He had failed to kill chaos, but chaos 'cultivation level had dropped. Now, he could only be considered an ordinary rank eight.It had lost its spirituality."In the chaos, he's not fighting against me. He's just trying to escape from the control of the other rank nines.He raised his head and looked at the great Dao of chaos that was vaguely appearing. Will you send more experts down?…… Deep in the chaos.The master of tianfang had an indifferent expression.The Lord of calamity's expression was slightly unsightly.The five elements path master looked ahead coldly as if he had seen everything. His voice was extremely cold."What a good" chaos "! He's willing to give up the power of a ninth-rank to get rid of everything. How can such a person be worthy of becoming a ninth-rank?"How hateful!When he sacrificed the five-element Overlord, he was not so angry. After sacrificing him ... If he died, then so be it. At least he would fight to the death with huntian!Regardless of the outcome, everyone had a deeper understanding of huntian's situation.However ... The chaos was not for killing, but for ... Spirit explosion!This bastard!The five elements path master was so angry that he was about to vomit blood. He had probably not expected this.He looked at Tian Fang from the corner of his eye. At this moment, the five elements had also lost control. Huntian was still here ... He was afraid that ... All of Tian Fang's experts would be wiped out.The master of Tian Fang was still calm.He was only deep in thought.He didn't say anything.Chaos fled, giving up his Grade 9 spirit and falling to a lower level. He had nothing to say. A Grade 9 gave up his Grade 9 Dao, what else could he say?He was just thinking, thinking about his next response.Consecutive losses!And now, the journey back seemed to be even more difficult."Li Hao, it seems that you've gained a lot of benefits in the West ..."He suddenly muttered,"at this stage ... He wants to go one step further. Perhaps ... He will split open the sky."  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  He smiled. The Western Region appeared in his eyes, but he didn't see it clearly.But ...He seemed to be able to predict what would happen next.The others were all silent.This was something they didn't want to see. However, if this caused conflict with huntian and the others, it might be a good thing.It all depended on ... Li Hao's choice!……The turbulent force spread wildly.At this moment, Li Hao also sensed some turbulence. He raised his eyebrows in surprise. Chaos ... Didn't die?Strange!In his view, chaos heaven was without order, so it must be extremely powerful. The chaos Emperor was not at the peak, so he was almost certain to die this time. However, the other party ... Actually did not die!He was really surprised!In the distance, Spring Autumn had just destroyed a rank eight world. He looked into the distance and was surprised."What a mess ... They actually escaped ..."Suddenly, he laughed. Huntian had actually failed to kill chaos!This was a huge blow to huntian, who had revealed its true colors. Otherwise, killing a Grade 9 would have established its might and countless worlds would have surrendered upon hearing of it. This would have laid the foundation for his unification!However, he had failed!Spring Autumn laughed. Failure was the greatest benefit. Even if chaos was not a good thing, so what?……At this moment, in the five elements realm, Yuan Shuo went from apprehension to surprise, from surprise to confusion, and then to seriousness. The entire five elements realm was in complete chaos!The world began to collapse, and countless chaotic forces swept out. The experts in the surroundings all went crazy!More importantly ... He could feel a boundless pressure!Someone had locked onto him.It was ... Huntian!

Chapter 3688 The Heavens Changed (1)
Chaos gave up on his rank nine power and ran away, throwing the world into chaos.This scene was beyond everyone's expectations.Today, everyone, including Li Hao, was confident that huntian had the ability to kill the chaos Emperor, but ... An interesting scene happened.Tian Fang and the others could even predict that when huntian revealed the power of darkness, it would surpass chaos. They also felt that chaos would fall and become the first tier 9 to truly fall.However, to their surprise, chaos ran away.It even gave up on its spirituality and ran away.At this moment, without any spirituality, the world was in turmoil. Chaos himself cultivated the power of Chaos, so if he hid in the chaos, unless he was close, who could find him?This was also the first expert to break free from all restraints, but the price was great ... He had fallen!At this moment, the crowd seemed to have no time to care about him. ……Huntian's aura locked onto Yuan Shuo, who was devouring the power of the five elements realm.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  As for himself, he had easily suppressed the confused minds of the ninth layer guards.In the next moment, the huntian Dao Scripture appeared. The five elements messengers, who were in a state of chaos, were locked by the huntian Dao Scripture. They woke up one by one and revealed a look of despair.Chaos ran away!Tian Jin and the other two were dead.Now, there were only five of them and four level 8 experts who had come to help. These people came from other realms, and the nine level 8 experts were very strong ... But their opponent was an existence that even the chaos Emperor could only escape by self-detonating his spirit.There was no way out!They had been expelled from the square region and then sent here. When the chaos descended, they saw hope ... But soon, that hope turned into despair.It turned out that ... Everyone was not a fool.It was as if they were the only Fools from the beginning.Everyone was a master of a region, but they were the only ones who worked for others, and their lives were not in their own hands. Even the invincible Daoist master Tian Fang had suffered setbacks time and time again.It was as if ... The times had really changed!Huntian looked at them with a faint smile on his face.""My fellow Daoists, are you willing to forsake the darkness for the light and make some contributions to the establishment of chaos and order?""And now, the chaos is in turmoil ..."Wu Xing's face was filled with despair.Effectiveness?Surrender?They were tianfang cultivators, and the moment they betrayed ... That was the strongest type 9 master, an unparalleled expert in the Dao of space.Huntian was strong today, but he was still far from the real Tian Fang.It was just a matter of dying earlier or later!If they didn't surrender, they would die now.If they surrendered, the other side would definitely have a way to control them. However, once Tian Fang descended, it would be difficult for them to escape death.If one died here, there was still a chance to be resurrected ... Even if the chance was slim.However, if they died at Tian Fang's hands, who would be able to revive them? At this moment, venerable fire Yan suddenly sighed.""After a million years of ups and downs, we entered the depths of chaos to resist the turbulence of spirituality. When the catastrophe descended, our bodies were destroyed. After a million years, we finally recovered ... In the end, all of this was for nothing!"It was just an empty match!It was as if tianfang's dominance over the world was just a dream.The messenger of light and darkness, the messenger of life and death, the Yin Yang Thearch ...Today, it's our turn.They were just chess pieces!The five elements overlords had dominated the North for millions of years ... But they were just pawns that could be discarded at will. In the eyes of the group of grade-9 experts, they were just a group of ants.Among the grade 8 ones, there were only a few that were worth their attention.The vast chaos seemed to be the world of these people, their stage. Everyone else, without exception, was just a chess piece.Then, he thought of Li Hao ...Over the course of time, he had made some favors, but in the end, they had all disappeared.It was like a golden millet dream!With a self-deprecating smile, he looked at the other four. He didn't make a decision for the others and only chuckled,""I'm tired. Brothers and sisters, if you still have the heart to gamble on your future ... You can surrender. As for the Dao master ..."He didn't say much.Putting aside the fact that the Dao master would not come now, in the future ... Would the Dao master resurrect them?The hope ... Was very small.Resurrection. They had already left the realm and entered the chaos. At this moment, their opponent was the extremely powerful huntian, but he had killed him. Perhaps ... They could only enter the depths of the origin of chaos like Li Hao and search for the origin to have a chance of resurrecting them.Would the Daoist master ... Do it?Probably ... Not.They were just a few grade-8 experts.Grade-9 was difficult to achieve, but grade-8 ... If he really put in a lot of effort, he could still cultivate many of them. Instead of resurrecting a group of old men who did not have much time left, it was better to ... Cultivate new people.He was tired.He had struggled, looked forward to it, desired it, and hoped that Tian Fang could return and dominate the chaos once more. Unfortunately, the era had really changed.Without saying anything, his body was ignited with flames.He burned himself and walked in the fire.The expressions of the four eighth-ranked emissaries changed. Huo Yan ...Daoist huoyan was still calm.He burned in the fire and gradually dissipated in the brilliance. He looked to the East. Perhaps, at this moment, he wanted to return to his hometown, not to see anyone, but to return to his roots.In the past, he had advised Li Hao once.If he borrowed the force, he would have to pay a huge price sooner or later.He was also the only one who had said several times that it was not easy to borrow the power of the past, and that the price would be hundreds or thousands of times more than that, and it would make you collapse ...In fact, he also wanted peace.However, his strength and status didn't allow him to.

Chapter 3689 The Heavens Changed (2)
He was from Tian Fang, the five elements emissary.At this moment, Huo Yan burned himself. There was no joy, no sorrow, no tears, no laughter, and no resentment.Who could he blame?Who did he hate?It was all meaningless!He had fought for tianfang all his life, and he was not a good person either. He had killed many people, destroyed the world, and massacred all sides ...His life was worth it.However ... At this final moment, I felt a little regretful. I ... Didn't die in tianfang world. This might be my only regret.On the opposite side.Huntian Supreme Emperor's body was covered in a dark aura, but his eyes were calm. He waved his hand, and the void trembled. A flame mixed with some dust drifted toward the east.Huo Yan had been set on fire.Cutting off one's own Dao source and burning one's body. This was perhaps the first rank eight to choose to end their own life in all these years.He fulfilled his wish and didn't stop him.Even though the flame burned the power of the great Dao, he didn't stop it.Even in his dark state, even if he looked extremely evil, he still maintained his Dao heart. As long as his Dao heart was still there, he was still himself, huntian!The darkness was only one of his means of control.It didn't mean that one's Dao heart would be contaminated.Strength was only about using it. Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ Huo Yan was dead.At this moment, there were still eight rank eights here. However, no one could resist, and they were powerless to resist. Even if they had eight rank eights, what could they do?Huntian alone might be able to deal with them.Moreover, they had just suffered a great loss of vitality, and there were still the ninefold guards on this side. There were as many as 10 level 8s and many Level 7s on the ninefold guards 'side. Dozens of ninefold guards had besieged them.There was no escape!Huntian was the true ruler of the number one power in the chaos. The number of level eights under him was beyond everyone's imagination.There were a total of six stage eight experts left in the huntian realm.The remaining eight tier 8 powerhouses looked at each other ...Even though the other four members of the five elements were somewhat sorrowful and somewhat helpless ... In the end, the metal-element cultivator, Paragon golden sun, sighed and said,""We ... Are willing to surrender!"Should he die now or in the future?When Huo Yan died, he said,"you can bet on huntian's future!"Obviously, they were also saying that they should surrender today.If they didn't surrender, they would die, they would really die.Huntian Supreme Emperor's expression was calm. It didn't matter if these people surrendered or not, they wouldn't interfere with the overall situation.This Hundun, other than those grade-9 experts, there weren't many people that were worthy of his attention.However, the chaos caused by the escape was actually ... Much more worthy of attention than them. After all, it was a ninth-rank!Moreover, he cut his losses short. Although he was chaotic, his thoughts were not chaotic at all. Such an existence ... How could he really underestimate him?He looked at the eight cultivators in front of him and said calmly,"Quit smoking, you deal with them!"The commander of the ninefold guards chuckled,""Dao master, I will do a good job.""Yes."Huntian didn't say anything else. He just looked to the West and quickly flew towards the five elements realm that was about to collapse.Yuan Shuo ... He was just a nobody.However, he had an apprentice who was not a nobody. On the contrary, he was able to escape from his schemes and walk out of the heavenly policy of order. Li Hao ... Was far more difficult to deal with than he had imagined.'He attacked huntian realm and didn't kill me. Maybe ... He was waiting for me?'Perhaps!Li Hao, how much is your master worth?……In the West.Huntian realm.Li Hao pierced the old man with his sword, but he didn't kill him.He turned around and stomped on the ROC that Peng Cheng had transformed into. Li Hao broke its wings, and the other four level-eights were also enveloped by the 5000 Dao domains and suppressed under the river.In the blink of an eye, he defeated six grade 8 experts.The power of Chaos, great DAOs, and order all surged into Li Hao's body.He did not open new realms, but strengthened the original small realms.His power was still increasing, but it wasn't as fast as when he opened new realms. However, Li Hao didn't continue to open new realms.Spring and autumn vented his anger after annihilating a level 8 world, and after observing that chaos was still alive, he was in a much better mood. He instantly appeared in the void and sat down barefoot, as if he was sitting in the void. He watched Li Hao suppress six level 8 experts and chuckled."Huntian is coming back.""Li Hao, why don't we take this opportunity to join forces and fight him? perhaps ... He's not as powerful as we thought. The heavenly policy of order is gone, and he didn't manage to kill chaos ..."Li Hao didn't say anything.An extremely thick chain locked the six level 8s. The power of the great Dao in their bodies was crazily extracted by Li Hao. The river of great Dao suppressed the six of them.Li Hao strolled toward the boundary.This was the first time he had truly stepped into the huntian realm.It was incomparably huge!A large number of venerable sovereigns in armor appeared around them. Even though they were scared, they still tried to stop Li Hao.Li Hao turned around and looked at the suppressed level eight venerable sovereigns.""Tell them to back off. I only came in to take a look and have no intention of destroying the chaos heaven realm ... But if they continue, I'll start a massacre!"At this moment, the old man also understood the situation. He knew that the chaos Faction had been defeated, and he was overjoyed. He also knew that it was best to preserve his strength at this moment. He quickly shouted,"All of you, back down!"As long as the path master returned, they wouldn't have to fear Li Hao and Spring Autumn even if they joined forces.Dao Masters were invincible in the chaos.At the very least, Dao Masters were invincible in the current chaos.
