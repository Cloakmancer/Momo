ime, he would be able to return to the main force with them.
 At this moment, Tiger soul hesitated again. He was hesitating whether he should send one of them to keep watch ... In case hei Teng didn't notice when he came. However, when he thought of hei Teng's footsteps, he felt that it was unnecessary.
 However, he had to be wary of some supers who might try to cut him off.
 However, the energy fluctuations were obvious ... Unless the swords gate martial masters launched a sneak attack ...
 However, the strongest Martial Master in the swords gate was Hong Yitang's daughter. Hong Yitang didn't even send a woman to lead the way. The other martial masters were at most in the early-hundredth level. Even if they were to ambush him ... He was just a sunshiny earth element user, why would he be afraid of an ambush from a Martial Master in the early-hundredth level?
 He laughed at the thought.
 It wasn't good to be too cautious!
 It was all because of the environment.
 "Then, the two of you must quickly control them later. Don't let the black armors fall outside my range, or it will be troublesome ..."
 "Also, control them for a minute. They must be within my range. Don't let them escape!" He warned again.
  The previous battle had made them understand that the one minute was the time when hei Teng would lose his ability to fight.
 Otherwise, there was still a possibility of a counterattack.
 "Also, suppress the ultra-waves to the minimum. Don't let out any light or sound ..."
 He looked at one of them."You are a fire type. Once you are in battle, the light will be the most obvious. You will be responsible for observing the surroundings!"
 "Yes, my Lord!"
 The two of them didn't dare to say anything more. Fire Mages indeed didn't dare to be too reckless in this battle, unless they were attacked by a large force.
 If it was a sneak attack, the fire element would be too obvious.
 The other one was a wind super, so he didn't stand out much in this battle.
 The three of them discussed their strategy and quickly chased forward.
 Black Phoenix usually didn't move very quickly, but he was extremely fast in battle. Even though he was a little behind, the three of them still caught up very quickly.
 Seeing the three black hou walking in a daze, the three of them smiled.
 ……
 In front of them, Li Hao and the others smiled under their armor.
 When the three of them stopped following them, they thought that the other party had given up on attacking them. They didn't expect that they would still catch up. This was good. Their discussion had not been wasted.
 Be it superpowers or martial masters, once they decided on something, they would be very decisive.
 Li Hao and the other two were still walking.
 Suddenly, a weak super fluctuation was felt.
 The three of them pulled out their black swords at the same time ...
 In an instant, it was as if their feet had sunk into a ball orchid. Layers of earth energy covered them, covering the three of them with a dense layer of mud-like things.
 As for whether it was effective or not, and whether it could cut off the energy supply ... How could Li Hao's group know?
 However, they had seen the reaction of the black Phoenix when they encountered such a situation.
 The three of them struggled to walk in the swamp. They pulled out the black swords from their waists and waved them quickly.
 At this moment, li Dahu and the other two quickly walked out of the darkness.  Mysterious energy seeped out from Tiger soul's body as he shouted in a low voice,""Quick, attack them and exhaust their remaining energy!"
 The wind-Elemental Expert quickly shot out wind blades.
 There was very little movement!
 Black Phoenix didn't make much noise to begin with, and Tiger soul and the others were also worried that they would make too much of a commotion and attract attention, so they subconsciously lowered their voices.
 Li Hao and the other two struggled madly!
 The strength of his struggle gradually became smaller.
 Seeing that he was almost out of the swamp ... At this moment, Liu Long felt a little regretful. 'Why am I struggling so hard?
 If he were to walk out, how would he pretend?
 He was regretful, but Tiger soul was even more frightened. Don 't, he realized that these three black Phoenix were struggling even more than the black Phoenix he had encountered before. He had dealt with the black Phoenix before, but they didn't have such strength.
 He almost made a mistake!
 He had no choice but to increase the strength of his earth energy and quickly suppress the guy with the biggest head!
 Could it be that the bigger hei Teng was, the stronger he was?
 He almost ran away!
 Tiger soul was also sweating from fear, and Liu Long also felt his strength increase. He secretly heaved a sigh of relief,"that was scary. If I really walked out, then the problem would be serious."
 If I don't get out ... If I walk to the edge and don't move, li Dahu is not an idiot ...
 Luckily!
 He didn't have much experience the first time, but he would know how to struggle the next time.
 The two of them were terrified!
 Liu Long and the other two's struggles became weaker and weaker.
 The wind blades collided continuously, and the three of them swayed from side to side. Gradually, they fell to the ground and were covered by a layer of earth energy in an instant!
 Tiger soul and the others still waited for a while. When they saw that hei Teng had stopped moving, the three of them were ecstatic!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It was a success!
  There wasn't much movement!
 Tiger soul grabbed the cage made of earth energy and quickly dodged to the side. The other two did the same, while Li Hao's group of three remained motionless.
 For no other reason than the sound of footsteps.
 At this time, everyone was praying for the black Phoenix to leave quickly.
 Tiger soul prayed that the other party would leave quickly and not discover anything unusual.
 Li Hao and the others were also praying for them to leave quickly. Otherwise, it would be difficult to make a move. If more people came later, it would be troublesome.
 "Da da da!"
 The sound of orderly footsteps gradually approached.
 A small team of Black Phoenix approached them with uniform steps. Then, the sound of the footsteps gradually faded away. Tiger soul and the other two didn't even dare to breathe. They were afraid that they would be discovered by these people and their teammates would be captured.
 Only when the footsteps were far away did Tiger soul let out a sigh of relief, an unconcealable smile on his face.

 Success!
 Three black Phoenix ...
 He had earned big!
 Even if they had to turn it in later, they would still be able to earn a lot of credit. Big organizations had some benefits and generally wouldn't take away one's credit. Otherwise, it wouldn't be good to make people work for them. Under normal circumstances, no one would erase the credit that should be yours.
 Unless the contribution was too great ... So great that the organization could not afford it ... That was impossible.
 At this moment, Li Hao and the other two, who had been captured, chose to attack at the same time without any discussion or conversation.
 Liu Long's nine forging force was directly exerted to the extreme, and the sound of waves could be heard.
 To deal with a sunlight like Tiger soul, even if it was right in front of him and was a sneak attack ... He had to go all out to avoid any mistakes.
 Li Hao directly picked up the starry sky sword and stabbed at the short man's wind super. This time, he even used sword force!
 Liu Yan, on the other hand, held a short blade and slashed at the throat of the fire energy powerhouse!
  The two of them were almost stuck together. In order to be discovered, Tiger soul had even retracted his earth energy constraint ... Because he knew that even if Black Phoenix was still in contact with the ground, it would not be as active as before. Instead, it would fall into a dead silence.
 This was something he had experience with before.
 However, he was really wrong.
 When Liu Long's punch came, Tiger soul was a Martial Master after all. Although he was only a 10th realm Martial Master, his reaction speed was still better than some ordinary sunlight superpowers. In an instant, an Earth Shield appeared in front of him!
 "What's the situation?"
 That was his first thought. At first, he thought that hei Teng had recovered, but he soon felt that something was wrong. It was only when a powerful force enveloped him that he realized ... That he had been ambushed!
 He was a Martial Master!
 A Martial Master with power.
 Who was it?
 Thousand-man combat?
 Yuan Shuo?
 How could Yuan Shuo need a sneak attack to kill him?
 Who was that?
 It was only when he felt the incomparably sharp sword energy beside him that he thought of a person. Li Hao, Yuan Shuo's student. He seemed to have used a sword when he was fighting against sun moxian that day.
 Li Hao ... The Silver City ...
 Liu Long!
 At this moment, he remembered who had punched him. It was Liu Long.
 That was impossible!
 It was impossible. Liu Long and the others were among the night patrollers, and the night patrollers were still behind them. How could they appear in front of them?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Bang! Bang!
 A loud sound rang out. At this moment, Liu Long and the others could no longer control their movements. If they didn't kill them quickly, they would be in even more trouble.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, was much more relaxed.  His opponent was only a Dark Moon superpower, and he had the sword aura. He was so close to his opponent, and he even had the starry sky sword ... With one strike, he instantly pierced through his opponent!
 The thin sword swept across and directly cut off half of the other party's body!
 On the other side, Liu Yan's saber also slashed across the other party's throat. The other party was still alive, and the fire energy exploded, illuminating a small area ... Liu Yan's second saber appeared, and with a heavy slash, she directly stabbed into the other party's temple!
 He had killed his opponent with two slashes.
 However, this place was also illuminated for a moment.
 There's a superpower fluctuation!
 There were also sounds ... If he wasn't wrong, the black Phoenix that had just left would soon come back.
 As for Liu Long, he had yet to finish off his opponent.
 He threw a punch. The ninth-refinement force was very strong, and it directly broke the earth Shield. Li Hao and the others all heard the sound of their ribs breaking.
 However, li Dahu was also a ruthless man. The moment the earth Shield was broken, not only did he not Dodge, but he also took the initiative to puff out his chest and take the heavy punch. The impact of the huge force seemed to have broken his internal organs, but he didn't care. He needed Liu Long's powerful strength to help him fly further!
 It might be too late for him to escape!
 This was the decisiveness of a former Martial Master!
 He knew that these people all wanted to kill him. They were his enemies, especially that hei Teng ... He was 99% sure that he was Liu Yan.
 At this moment, he chose to receive the punch even if he was more injured. This was his only chance to escape.
 Even if his internal organs were crushed ... It didn't mean that he would definitely die.
 ,m However, if he was entangled by them, he would die without a doubt.  Although his opponent's sternum was broken and almost pierced through, Liu Long subconsciously realized that this was bad. This guy was too ruthless. When Liu Long attacked, he had the intention of sticking to his opponent and wanted to throw a second punch.
 However, that li Dahu actually borrowed the force to fly out!
 Liu Long's punch was very heavy, but the force behind it was enough to send his opponent flying very far. His speed was very fast.
 Perhaps li Dahu would be heavily injured and killed by hei Teng ...
 But what if?
  He was extremely vexed, and could only watch helplessly as his second punch failed to hit the other party, and the other party was sent flying ... He was about to fly out of the attack range.
 Liu Long was so vexed that he wanted to vomit blood!
 At this moment, the ground trembled slightly, and the force of the earth exploded. Li Dahu, who was about to fly out, suddenly felt as if there was a wall behind him.
 With a loud bang, he smashed into the wall!
 That was impossible!
 When he was hiding, he had observed that there was nothing behind him. There couldn't be a wall ...
 At this moment, Li Hao's forehead was also covered in sweat, which was hidden by his armor. In a hurry, he unleashed Earth Force, causing the ground to shake. A wave of vibration spread out, forming an air wall.
 In the next moment, Liu Long's second punch landed heavily on his opponent's head.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, stabbed his sword into the man's heart.
 Liu Yan's twin daggers also quickly slashed over, cutting the other party's throat with a few plops.

 Li Dahu's eyes were wide open. Even though his face had been smashed by Liu Long's punch, he still stared at the few people with unwillingness!
 He was sunlight!
 He had never put these people from the silver Blizzard city in his eyes. Whether it was Liu Yan or Liu Long, they were all trash in his eyes. So what if they had broken a hundred?
 After he became a Yama, he became a Dark Moon within a few years. After another two years, he quickly entered the glorious sun, and it was the offensive heavy earth-type glorious sun.
 But here, he didn't even show his true ability ... And was instantly beaten to death on this unknown Street.
 He wasn't the sunshine of those small organizations. He was the sunshine expert of one of the three large organizations, Yama.
 He had also defeated the veteran Nightwalker, Huang Yun, who was also known as the wind Devil.
 He originally had a great future!
 The reason he was killed was because he had killed an engineer back then ...
 He opened his eyes wide. Before he died, he wanted to see their faces clearly ...
  However, the few of them did not fulfill his wish.
 Liu Long once again punched out, directly smashing his eyes out. He was a little annoyed and blamed himself, "I'm sorry!"
 Not only did he fail to kill his opponent with one punch, but he also almost let his opponent escape ... As the captain of a demon-hunting squad, this was the first time he had made such a grave mistake. If Li Hao hadn't used Earth Force at the critical moment and let his opponent fly away, he might have died, but what if?
 He had to be prepared for everything!
 At this moment, Liu Long realized that he had overestimated his ninth refinement force and underestimated his opponent. Li Dahu was harder to kill than the average Dayao!
 He had killed riyao before and had misjudged him.
 Li Dahu's defense was even stronger than some mid-stage solar glory cultivators.
 This was a fatal mistake!
 "Hurry up!"
 Li Hao didn't have the time to think about that. He instantly brandished his short sword and dismembered li Dahu's corpse!
 Liu Yan also held two blades and started cutting.
 Liu Long had also calmed down. Now was not the time to make a mistake in their discussion. They had to immediately cut up some pieces of the corpse, take away the mysterious energy, and then escape ... They could already hear the footsteps.
 It was obvious that hei Teng had discovered the abnormality of this place!
 Liu Yan didn't feel the joy of revenge, nor did she let out a long cry to vent her anger ... At this time, whoever called her a fool would be stupid.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com After killing li Dahu, she didn't even have the time to say a word.
 He cut it and stuffed it into the energy storage box.
 In the blink of an eye, the three of them quickly abandoned the corpses and fled.
 In the blink of an eye, he disappeared.
 The moment he disappeared, the black Phoenix unit rushed over. They could also sense the smell of blood and the fluctuations of power ... But they were at a loss.
 He was dead!
 After stopping in place for a moment, the team continued to move forward, and the footsteps sounded again.
 After a while, another superpower approached.
 The bodies on the ground had almost disappeared.
 The bloodstains were also devoured.
  However, there were still some clothes left.  Some of them saw the clothes and frowned slightly. Among them were members of Yama, and their expressions changed slightly!
 The Yama had a clear hierarchy.
 One of the clothes was obviously worn by the sun glory. A sun glory died?
 Who died?
 It was hard to determine who exactly it was, but there must be sunlit experts who died here, and there were also a few Dark Moon experts.
 There were only a few from the sun glory who came in to investigate.
 If he turned around and asked, he would probably know who had died.
 "Black armor killed them?"
 Other than Black Phoenix, it couldn't be anyone else, but ... Some of them had sensed it from afar and felt that it wasn't the style he had used to fight with Black Phoenix.
 Furthermore, hei Teng was a little stupid.
 As long as there was no commotion, no light, and no power, they would not be able to sense it.
 Were the Yama's people stupid?
 Could it be that he had taken the initiative to attack the 10-man squad of black-armored knights?
 At that moment, a few supers arrived. One of them squatted down to take a closer look and whispered,""Strange, there are some irregular tears on his clothes. Hei Teng uses a sword ... Could it be that he's not hei Teng?"
 It was li Dahu's clothes. Liu Long's punch had pierced through his chest, leaving a hole. Although his clothes had been cut into pieces, just like a sword, there were still some traces left behind.
 Li Hao's group was in such a hurry that they didn't have time to take their clothes or create a more realistic scene.
 As soon as he said that, all the powers around him disappeared.
 Because no matter whether these words were true or not, it meant that this place was getting more and more dangerous.
 Fake? that's nothing.
 Really ... Does that mean that there's an internal conflict between the supers?
 It was hard to say how these Yama powerhouses had died.
 Perhaps it was someone from another organization who had intentionally lured Black Phoenix here?
 Or if hei Teng appeared in an internal strife, they would all be killed!
  The observing Yama expert did not say much! He took a piece of clothing and quickly disappeared. He had to find Yaocheng immediately and tell him that someone had died, and it might not be hei Teng!
 In fact, he could vaguely sense the existence of some Shi!
 It could be the work of a Martial Master!
 Of course, he couldn't just say that out loud, because once he did ... The swords gate would be the most suspicious, but the swords gate had always been aloof from the world, and it wouldn't be a good idea to start a war with them.
 Besides, on the surface, swords gate didn't have any Martial Master that could comprehend [force]. Hong Yitang had, and he was already a super expert.
 The street gradually returned to silence.
 ……
 Meanwhile, in the alley.
 Li Hao and the others gasped for breath, their hearts palpitating.
 Liu Long repeated his previous words,"I made a serious mistake. The spoils of war have nothing to do with me. That's the first thing. Second, we'll lure the enemy. I'll act alone. You guys just have to hide!"

 Li Hao didn't say anything. This was the team's rule ... In fact, it was Liu Long himself who set it. If he wanted to follow it, Li Hao wouldn't object.
 Liu Yan was also panting as she said in a low voice,"I've taken my revenge!" I don't need the spoils either. Li Hao, they're all yours this time!"
 As she said that, she was a little happy but also a little helpless,"I killed li Dahu ... I ..."
 "Revenge my ass!"
 Li Hao lowered his voice."The King of Hell is the enemy. The King of Hell protected the Qiao family and Li Dahu. Do you think you can get your revenge by killing li Dahu?" You're so naive!"
 As soon as he said that, the joy of revenge disappeared instantly.
 The Yama ... Was like a heavy mountain pressing down on his heart.
 The relaxed feeling instantly disappeared without a trace.
 Yes, the Yama was the main culprit.
 But ... Li Hao was too annoying!
  At this time, it was too much of a blow to say such words.
 Liu Yan was speechless for a moment and no longer said anything. The joy of killing li Dahu disappeared in an instant."Forget it, just pretend I didn't say anything."
 Li Hao continued."Continue to keep an eye on him. I'll absorb some more mysterious energy. This time, I have some earth energy, wind energy, and fire energy. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to absorb water energy!"
 It was a little painful, his kidney was severely damaged!
 Among the five internal organs, he absorbed the most fire and earth energy, very little metal and wood energy, and water energy ... This time, he didn't absorb any at all.
 If this goes on, the kidney will be seriously imbalanced!
 The next moment, a person flashed through his mind. Middle stage of the three yang realm. Suck her. What imbalance? bullsh * t! At that time, the kidney was the strongest!
 At the middle stage of the three yang realm, 1500 cubic meters of water energy would not be a problem.
 Of course, this thought flashed through his mind. That person ... Was not easy to deal with.
 The middle stage of the three yang realm, even if he had been pretending to be a pig and became a pig after a long time, his instant reaction and defense might not be able to break through his hundred-fold defense. He could try to break through a thousand-fold defense, but with the starry sky sword and sword force, a thousand-fold defense might be able to break through it in an instant!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Thinking of this, Li Hao was a little anxious.
 When the two powers could merge, he would advance.
 As for the fusion of the five powers, he would leave it to his teacher to play with. He could just use the second power.
 As for the future, it wasn't that Qian combat could not comprehend force anymore, but the difficulty would increase. Who cared, he would think about it when he reached Qian combat.
 In this environment, it would be a problem to survive if one didn't reach the warrior of thousands.
 He began to absorb the mysterious energy crazily. The sword energy on the small sword was getting less and less. Li Hao was worried that the sword energy would not be enough to support him to advance to the Qian dynasty ... He had no idea how to replenish it now!  As he absorbed the energy, his organs, except for his kidney, were strengthened.
 Especially his heart and spleen, which had absorbed a lot of fire and earth energy. At this moment, they were clearly strengthened by a large margin.
 ……
 At the same time.
 Yama's Yao Cheng's expression was somewhat unsightly. He held a rag in his hand and frowned,"The Tiger soul is dead!"
 Tiger soul was a sunbeak that had advanced to Martial Master. Its combat strength was not weak, and it was also an Yama expert that Silver Moon had focused on nurturing.
 But now, the other party was dead!
 Earth energy was still very useful in dealing with Black Phoenix. The death of One Earth energy was a greater pity than the death of two or three fire energy. The fire energy was currently being severely limited.
 It was also because of the great use of earth energy that he wanted to let Tiger soul lead a team out to investigate. Even if they encountered hei Teng, the danger would be within a controllable range.
 But ... The Tiger soul still died!
 Yao Cheng's expression was ugly. Was the death of Tiger soul really hei Teng's doing?
 Why did it feel so different?
 Tiger soul wasn't stupid. Would he dare to provoke a 10-man team?
 Or could it be that someone didn't want the earth energy Tiger soul to live? after all, if he was alive, it meant that the Yama had a higher chance of capturing some black phoenixes.
 "How many people have died?"
  He asked, and someone whispered,""I'm not sure. Other than Tiger soul and the people he brought with him, we're sure that they're all dead ... There are also a few other locations that we've identified. At least five dark moons and one sunlit are dead!"
 Yaocheng's expression turned ugly.
 How long has it been?
 In the blink of an eye, six people had died!
 This was the least. At this moment, there were still some supers scattered outside, and it was unknown whether they were alive or dead.
 If this went on, wouldn't the people he brought in after exploring the nearby streets all be finished?
 He had only brought seven or eight of them in, and more had come later on, making it a total of more than ten. There were not many Yama to begin with, but now that so many had died, how was he going to explain it to the king of Samsara?
 When he thought of this, his expression turned ugly and he said in a low voice,""I'll go back and report to the reincarnation King first ... You guys be careful. Also, we can't be the only ones exploring. The danger is beyond imagination. We might need the cooperation of a few other families!"
 I can't let this continue!
 His subordinates had no objections, and soon, Yao Cheng disappeared from his spot.

 In the darkness.
 Outside the ancient city, there was an open space.
 At this moment, a large number of supers were gathered here.
 Hu dingfang looked around a few times, but didn't see Li Hao. His expression didn't look good.
 When the Yama's people came to question why he did not mention hei Teng, Hu dingfang coldly glanced at the Samsara King for a long time before he said coldly,""Are you willing to tell me how many benefits and dangers there are in the ruins that the Yama found?"
 "Is there something wrong with your brain, or is there something wrong with my brain?"
 The reincarnation King's face was cold,'Hu dingfang, do you really think you are invincible here? Late stage of three yang, do you think you're already comparable to sunguang?"
 Hu dingfang's strength was slightly weaker than theirs.
 In the end, this guy was unparalleled in his savagery!
 Not giving face to the purple Moon, not giving face to the Samsara King, did he think that the night patrollers were invincible?
  Fei Tian had always been mysterious and might not participate in the siege.
 However, it was hard to say for the purple Moon.
 It would be too easy for him and Ziyue to deal with Hu dingfang and Hao lianchuan. Did this guy want to die?
 Hu dingfang said calmly,"sure, I dare you to touch me!" The Tiger wing Army did not prepare many siege missiles, only 10. If I do not go out and am not the first one to go out ... As long as you can withstand 10 siege missiles, there will be no problem! Huanhuan, don't think too highly of yourself. Do you really think that I'm not prepared at all?"
 His eyes were cold as he glanced at them and sneered,""I don't think you have the guts! Or do you think that the people from the central continent can help you block the city-destroying bomb?"
 The reincarnation King's expression turned ugly!
 Not only him, in the distance, Zi Yue's face was also cold as she glanced at Hu dingfang.
 A city-destroying bomb!
 This was also one of the reasons why the military was so confident. Such weapons of mass destruction were top secrets. There might only be a few of them in a province, and they were all controlled by the military's higher-ups.
 The three major organizations were powerful, but they were not powerful enough to infiltrate the military.
 Of course, in some provinces, it was a different story when the military cooperated with the superpower organization.
 In Silver City, the only person who could control the city-destroying bomb was the commander of one of the three armies. Hu dingfang was one of them, and there were two other commanders, including the nominal commander of the three armies, who was in charge of the middle Army.
 ? As soon as Hu dingfang finished speaking, Zi Yue said coldly,""So, if you, Hu dingfang, die in the ruins, you'll have to use the city-destroying bomb? Are we supposed to protect you? What a joke!"
 "You're not here. Let's see who is qualified to wield the city-destroying bomb,"he said with a cold smile.
 "My wife!"
 Hu dingfang said lightly,"my wife is good at everything, but she can't see the big picture!" If I die and don't go out, she won't care about the so-called big picture ... If you don't believe me, you can try?"
 The moment these words came out, everyone frowned endlessly.  He did not expect Hu dingfang to have such an arrangement.
 However, after some consideration, they didn't say anything.
 Even if the city-destroying bomb was really thrown over, the others would probably die, but Zi Yue and the Samsara King still had a chance. With the origin divine weapon in hand and the strength of the peak three yang realm, they might not be in trouble if they fled at the critical moment. Of course, even if they didn't die, they would still be seriously injured, which was inevitable.
 Moreover, the people he brought in were all dead ... There was no way he could explain himself if he was alive.
 After all, they were only the division leaders, not the headquarters leaders.
 Hu dingfang sneered and ignored them. He looked around again, but still didn't see Li Hao and the others. He couldn't help but look at the town-like place in the distance, which was the outer city.
 Could it be ... That Li Hao's group had mistakenly entered the outer city?
 This was very troublesome!
 If he had come alone, he wouldn't mind going in to take a look. However, he had promised hou Xiaochen after all. There was a group of night watchers following him. If he left and Hong Yue and the Yama started to kill ... Hao lianchuan wouldn't be able to stop them.
 He was a little frustrated, but there was nothing he could do.
 Hence, he was even more displeased with Purple Moon and the Samsara King.
 If it wasn't for the fact that his strength was slightly weaker than these two ... He was still very confident. After all, he was a Martial Master and was proficient in the five birds technique.
 The five birds technique was not a secret, but under normal circumstances, without the breathing technique, the technique would be useless.
 However, he knew the breathing technique of five birds, so the technique would be very useful.
 Therefore, he wasn't afraid of either of them.
 However, if the two of them were to attack together ... They would probably be unrivaled.
  At this moment, a figure quickly ran out of the city. He was as fast as the wind and quickly exited the outer city from the square. When he was outside the city, he flew away without any restraint.
 In the city, even he, a wind elemental three yang, did not dare to fly.
 In the blink of an eye, he appeared beside the reincarnation King.
 He moved closer to the other party and whispered a few words.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com His lips moved, but no sound came out.
 Everyone looked at Yao Cheng. The Lord of Samsara's expression didn't change, but he cursed in his heart, trash!
 He was only scouting the path, and he already knew hei Teng's weakness, yet he still lost brilliant sun. If he wasn't trash, what was he?
 He glanced at Hong Yitang from the corner of his eye and was a little confused.
 Hong Yitang was a Martial Master, and there were many martial masters among his disciples. Of course, their strength was around ten or over a hundred. It was impossible for them to have the ability to kill Tiger soul.
 Then who killed Tiger soul?

 Did black armor really kill him?
 The reincarnation King did not mention this, but said,""Yaocheng has investigated thoroughly. There are a total of Nine Streets in the outer city, and every street is patrolled by black-armored soldiers. The maximum is ten people in a team, and the minimum is one person."
 "In the entire outer city, there are roughly a hundred or so black armors."
 "Once we make our move, the black armors will activate their superpowers. However, that's only in the outer city. Further in, closer to the inner city, Yaocheng only took a glance from afar and saw many armored soldiers! The ones we've killed before might have come from there. "
 He briefly introduced the situation to everyone and tried to rope in other organizations.
 Since the night patrolman is not willing to tell me, I'll tell you.
 As for these secrets, if he was willing to send someone to investigate, he would naturally be able to find out.
 "What I'm thinking now is that we should first clear out the black armors in the outer city and use the outer city as a stronghold. Then, we'll slowly remove the black armors between the inner and outer cities ... After we've cleared out these armorers, we'll have a chance to attack the inner city!"
 "Also, I'd like to ask the night patrolmen, why can't we enter the houses in the outer city?" What was inside? Several of our supers entered, but they all disappeared without a trace!"
 Hao lianchuan sneered,"you're asking us?" We don't know. You can't enter the houses in the outer city. If you go in, you'll die. If you have the ability, you can investigate it yourself!"
  The reincarnation King's expression turned ugly.
 At the side, Hong Yitang opened his mouth and acted as the peacemaker. He took the initiative to ask,""Minister kui, I have a question. Are those armored soldiers unable to leave the outer city?"
 "Not bad!"
 Hao lianchuan did not hide anything."I'm sure you've realized that their power comes from underground. The ground they've built only reaches the square at the edge of the outer city. Once they leave the square, those soldiers will lose their power and die!"
 "Is it possible to lure them to the square and then bombard them from a distance?" Hong Yitang asked."We'll kill them bit by bit like we're flying kites."
 If this worked, he could try.
 Superpowers were not martial masters.
 p They were all capable of long-range attacks.  Many people looked at Hao lianchuan when they heard this. Perhaps the night patrolman had tried it before. If it worked, they could try it.
 Seeing that they were looking at him, Hao lianchuan thought for a moment and said,""As long as we don't enter the outer city, they won't make a move. As for long-distance bombarding ... You guys can talk about it after you break their armor. Otherwise, it won't be of much use!"
 "Besides, they'll also evacuate!"
 It's not like I'll just stay there and be hit by you like an idiot.
 The crowd frowned again.
  "That means, if we enter the outer city, they will mobilize troops from the inner city to annihilate us?"  "That won't happen," Hao lianchuan laughed."As long as we don't make a sound, fly in the sky, or unleash our powers ... Those soldiers won't care about us! According to the judgment of the night patrolmen, the other party would only attack those who did not listen to them, or those who broke their rules! What was destruction? Those who don't follow the martial arts ban are all people who break the rules. The outer and inner cities are probably all against martial arts!"
 The crowd cursed again.
 Forbidden martial arts?
 Of course, the supers were not here for sightseeing. They had a purpose. They even wanted to invade the inner city and ban all fighting. What was the point of playing then?
 Someone said,"if we don't make a move and just get close to black armor, will they kill us?" They don't use their superpowers ... But approach them. Will that attract hostility?"
 These words moved many people once again.
 If he got close and the other party didn't care, then it would be easy to handle.
 Whether it was a sneak attack, an ambush, or a trap, they were all more convenient than a direct kill.
 "If the superpowers can't cover it ... What if a Martial Master gets close?"
 The man added.
 Hao lianchuan looked at the person who asked the question. It was actually someone from Feitian. This low-profile organization had finally spoken up.
 "Even if he doesn 't," Hao lianchuan said calmly,"if he gets close, the waves will be obvious. Black armor will think it's a provocation and kill him! As for martial masters ... They usually wouldn't be attacked! "However, if a Martial Master takes the initiative to attack, he'll also be counterattacked. Martial masters are strong in close combat, but it's difficult for them to break through the black armor. The damage they can do is limited, so I don't recommend martial masters to get close."
  Everyone thought about it carefully and agreed.
 As a Martial Master, he couldn't seal the other party. Even if he were to send the other party flying with a single punch, the commotion would be too great, and it would attract attention.
 The superwaves were obvious, which was also one of the disadvantages of being difficult to restrain.
 "There has to be a Constitution!"
 At this moment, the reincarnation King spoke again,""The night patrolmen have investigated so many times. I don't think they are just here for some black armor, right? This time, you've come with us, and you probably want to enter the inner city as well. We've really suffered heavy losses, but do you have the confidence to enter the inner city?"
 "Hao lianchuan, how do we get into the outer city and get rid of those black-armored soldiers? even the black-armored soldiers near the city gate are not prepared?"
 This question finally hit the nail on the head.
 The night patrolmen had put in so much effort, even not hesitating to explore with these guys, so they naturally wanted to enter the inner city.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The losses here were too heavy ... Who knew what other dangers were in the inner city?
 Now, there was no need to mention the battle before. Everyone had seen the hardness of the black armors and wanted to gain something. If it didn't work, they could bring a hundred armors out and it wouldn't be a waste of time!

 Be it superpowers or martial masters, they were all very realistic.
 If they fought now, it would only benefit those people from the central region. It was better to get some benefits first.
 Hu dingfang was not responsible for this.
 He was only responsible for protecting the night patrolmen. It was up to the night patrolmen to decide how to deal with things.
 Hao lianchuan had taken the initiative to reveal some information to them, so Hu dingfang knew that the night patrollers still hoped to enter the inner city.
 Sure enough, Hao lianchuan laughed and said,""The best way is to grind it bit by bit until the black armor is polished. That's the simplest way!"
 "As for the number of black armors ..."
 Hao lianchuan thought for a moment and said,"there are about a thousand people in the outer city and near the inner city gate. It might be a team of a thousand people!" However, there's only about 800 left now. After all, you've captured over a hundred. "
 As for where the other hundreds of Black Phoenix had gone ... They didn't need to ask to know that they had most likely been taken away by the night patrols.
 Of course, when he heard that there were still 800 ...
  Everyone was having a headache!
 That was too many. It was equivalent to 800 peak Dark Moon existences. Not to mention, there were also Centurions, which meant that there were at least eight sunlit existences. If there was another chiliarch ... Didn't that mean that there was an undefeatable three suns existence?
 The three suns were not scary. There were many three suns present.
 What was terrifying was that he had an endless supply of energy and an invincible three yang.
 "Are there any existences above bronze armor?" Ziyue asked.
 "I've never seen him before!"
 "No." Hao lianchuan shook his head."To be honest, if such an existence were to make a move ... We, the night patrollers, would probably be wiped out if we were to come alone, unless the Minister enters! We don't dare to rashly provoke such an existence ... Of course, according to our speculations, there might be one!"
 He still gave a heads up. There was an 80 - 90% chance that such an existence existed.
 " 800 people ..."
 Everyone frowned. Hong Yitang asked again,""How intelligent are these black-armored people? Will they move out together, or will they only come in teams like before?"
 "I need to judge and observe!"
 Hao lianchuan thought for a moment and said,"every time we enter, the number of black armors that appear is the same as our number. That is to say, if we send one or two hundred people in, the other party might only send this many people. It is possible that they have given the order to deal with the intruders as long as we have the same number of people!"
 "Of course, there's one exception!"
 "If all the black and copper armors die or are defeated, and we're still here, the enemy will send more black armors ..."
 He explained,"we defeated them once. We defeated more than 10 black armors. In the end, we didn't leave. After a while, more than 30 black armors and one copper armors appeared. Many people died that time!"
 "What about hunting alone?"
 "What?" Hong Yitang asked again,"will killing black armor alone attract their revenge?"
  "It depends on the situation. If you hide well, the other party won't be able to find you. Black armor's means of finding people are limited. As long as you kill black armor and quickly escape, they may not be able to find you!"  Many people were moved by his words.
 In that case, didn't that mean that he could go in and hunt?
 Remove the black armor bit by bit?
 Yue Ming definitely couldn 't!
 However, he still had some confidence in sunlight and three suns.
 "Why don't we let all the three suns and the sun Warriors enter and kill the hundred soldiers on the outside first?" someone suggested."We'll get rid of their power bit by bit!"
 Someone else asked,"can black armor be used?" If it's possible, we can also wear black armor, which will greatly increase our defense ..."
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He still couldn't open the black armor normally.
 They could only use brute force to destroy it. However, the black armor's defensive power would be greatly reduced after it was destroyed. The Yama, who had reaped the most benefits, was also unwilling to destroy it at this moment. It was too extravagant!
 Everyone took turns to comment.
 Of course, those who dared to speak were the sunlight and three suns of the big forces. As for Yue Ming, she could only listen in silence.
 They had no right to speak!
 At this moment, one of the cloaked men from the flying heavens spoke,""What are the night patrolmen's plans? We don't have much time, only three days. If we don't leave after three days, we'll have to wait until next month ... Can we still leave next month?"
 Hao lianchuan laughed and said,"plans?" Actually, I don't have a good plan. Three suns and sunlight will enter and kill the armored soldiers in the outer city one by one. It's actually a good idea. "
 "If all Nine Streets of the outer city are attacked at the same time, it will be very difficult for the enemy to react quickly. As long as we can quickly take care of them and retreat, we can easily deal with these one hundred soldiers. As for the inner city, we can try to lure them in bit by bit."
 Nine three suns.
  At this moment, there were two night patrollers, one red Moon, two Yama, two swords gate ... Of course, only one of them revealed to the outside world, and so did Fei Tian. Of the two three suns, only one of them revealed his strength.
 In addition to Zhang Ting, there were many three suns that came this time, a total of 10.
 If Yuan Shuo had not killed anyone before and killed two three suns, there would have been a total of 13 three suns, including Yuan Shuo himself.
 These people might not be the entirety of Silver moon's upper echelons, but they were at least half of Silver moon's high-end forces.
 On the surface, there were only 7 of the three suns.
 Everyone fell into deep thought.
 Were the words of the night patrolman reliable?
 If the other party didn't say anything, they would be worried.
 The other party had told them the plan, but they were worried.
 At this moment, another miserable cry was heard from the outer city. On the Yama's side, the Samsara King frowned slightly. Could it be that another Yama's man had died?

 The black armors in the outer city were all out in the open.
 As long as he carefully avoided them, it shouldn't be a big problem.
 How could there be more deaths?
 He looked at Hao lianchuan and frowned."Other than the houses and the black armor," he said,"are there other dangers in the outer city?"
 "There are!"
 Hao lianchuan did not try to hide it,"there's also the danger in the sky ... You know about this." In addition, there are some sudden dangers in the outer city. We don't know where they come from, but they often appear like sharp blades. They appear instantly, kill instantly, and then disappear in an instant ... It's impossible to guard against them!"
 "A sharp blade that suddenly appeared?"
 Everyone became even more vigilant. This was only the outer city. Was it that dangerous?
 At this moment, the flying expert spoke,""It's not good to drag this on. If we continue exploring, more people will die. We only have about 200 people here, and at least 40 have died ... That's a fifth of our losses!"
 Of course, most of them were Yue Ming and a small number of sunlit soldiers. The real elite forces were still there.
  "Nine Streets. I've observed for a moment. They are not the usual quartrum-shaped streets, but nine horizontal lines blocking our way. The most dangerous one is naturally the one near the inner sect. We can give up on it!"
 "We can clear the armorers in the other eight streets ..."
 The flying expert who spoke added,""I'm not asking everyone's efforts to be in vain. Those armors will be whoever gets rid of the armored soldiers! This is indeed a treasure. Even if we don't gain anything this time, I think this trip will be worth it if we can get these armors!"
 Hao lianchuan also nodded."I think so too. However, the Samsara King and Ziyue are the strongest here. I suggest that they take charge of the two innermost streets. What do you think?"
 “……”
 The Lord of Samsara sneered,"didn't hu dingfang claim to be the strongest?" Just let him go! If the night patrollers want to enter the inner city, they naturally have to pay a price!"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Hao lianchuan laughed."You can't say that ... How about this? we'll send two third Suns to take care of two streets. If one of the families is in charge of one street, they'll be in charge of the more dangerous places!"
 "Night patrol, Fei Tian, Yan Luo, Hong Yue, swords gate ... As for the others, we will not be counted. Five clans, they will be responsible for clearing eight streets. Night patrol and Yan Luo will be responsible for two streets, they can choose freely. As for the other three, is there anyone willing to be responsible for two streets? Without the three suns, with more sunlight, we can still quickly end the battle!"
 With this, the reincarnation King had no more objections.
 It should be like this!
 To contribute more, yet still be in charge of the dangerous areas ... Are you stupid?
 Besides, Feitian was very mysterious. Who said that there was only one three suns?
 As expected, the cloaked expert slowly said,""Then we're also willing to be in charge of two streets. Three suns aren't enough, but there are still a few in riyao. If we're careful, we can solve it!"
 The three guilds were willing to take charge of two streets.
 As for the remaining Red Moon, Purple Moon couldn't even say that she was in charge of two ... Red moon's losses this time were really not small.  As for swords gate, Hong Yitang was extremely low profile, he was in a difficult position but he still nodded and said,""Alright, I'm not as strong as the purple Moon leader, and the swords gate is just a small house. I can take charge of the third Street!"
 As for the first street, it was naturally the one that was closer to the inner city, so it was directly abandoned.
 Obviously, he hoped that zirai would take the initiative to clean up the second Street.
 At this moment, they all looked at the purple Moon. This meant that the other families had agreed, but the red moon had not.
 Zi Yue frowned slightly.
 She was at the peak of three suns of the lightning element, and she also had the origin divine weapon. She wasn't worried that she couldn't deal with those armored soldiers, but she was worried that if she got too close to the inner city, she would quickly attract a large number of armored soldiers to attack her.
 She didn't care about the black armor.
 However, what if an existence above bronze-armored appeared?
 "If an unparalleled enemy appears ..." The reincarnation King said,"for the sake of self-protection and for the sake of a smoother exploration, we will not let you be besieged!"
 The premise was that the other party was still in the three yang realm.
 If he did, he would kill Ziyue and everything would be in vain.
 Ziyue considered for a while and said coldly,""Good! However, I have a suggestion. Hu dingfang will be in charge of the fourth Street, and you will be in charge of the Fifth Street. Dingchen is the one in charge of Feitian now?"
 On Fei Tian's side, a cloaked man said,""That's me. I've embarrassed myself in front of the purple Moon leader for you to still remember me. "
 "You're in charge of the sixth Street, Hao lianchuan is in charge of the seventh Street, Yaocheng is in charge of the eighth Street, flying sun is in charge of the ninth Street ..."
  Such an arrangement could ensure that the night patrolmen were not at the outermost perimeter, and it would not be easy for them to escape at the first moment.
 Otherwise, she was also worried that she would be tricked.
 No one had any objections to this.
 The arrangement was fair.
 With a decision made, everyone began to discuss when to attack. They had to attack together. Otherwise, if one person exploded, it would easily cause the black-armored warriors from other directions to riot, and that would be troublesome.
 After confirming for a while, these powerhouses didn't say anything and started to advance towards the outer city. They were going to clear out a group of black-armored warriors first.
 ……
 Li Hao's group didn't know what was going on, nor did they know where they were. They were in the small alley between the so-called first and second Streets.
 Li Hao had absorbed a lot of mysterious energy.
 He felt that his spleen and heart were already full, but the balance of the five elements had been broken, which made him feel a little uncomfortable.

 Seeing that he had stopped absorbing, Liu Long quickly said, "It's been a while. Will the large organizations and night patrols enter this place soon? by then, it will be difficult for us to hide. There are too many people and we will be easily exposed."
 Li Hao nodded. This was also what he was worried about.
 Many people had come, and the three suns had also entered. The black armor was not a threat. At that time, if they wore the black armor ... It would be more dangerous.
 Just as they were about to speak, they heard footsteps again and chose to shut up.
 After a while, when the footsteps disappeared, Li Hao said,""There aren't many black armors in the outer city. We can't stop them. It's not like we have to stop them from entering the outer city. We don't have the strength to do so. The most important thing is to improve our strength and eliminate some enemies!"
 "Sister Liu, do you think you'll be able to sense force quickly?" he asked.
 Liu Yan was silent for a moment before shaking her head.
 Li Hao was a little disappointed. Sure enough, Shi was the greatest enemy that stopped martial masters.
 "Boss, do you still have room for improvement?"
 "Yes ... But it's very difficult. Your teacher suggested that I nourish my kidney first ... That requires a large amount of water energy, and it's best to cooperate with the blood God. We haven't seen anyone from the red moon, and water energy ... It doesn't seem like there are any water energy experts that can kill them!"
  "There are!"
 Li Hao laughed,"there is one, but ... He's not easy to kill!" Let's see if boss dares to kill him!"
 "Who is it?"
 "Zhang Ting from the night patrolmen ..."
 Liu Long immediately frowned. Even though his armor blocked his way, Li Hao could still sense his dissatisfaction.
 Clearly, Liu Long thought he was crazy to kill his own people in order to improve.
 The night patrolman was one of their own.
 "Li Hao!"
 "Boss, don't worry! It's not that I want to kill him, but Minister hou said so. It doesn't matter if I kill him or not ... Moreover, the other party isn't simple. He's a mid-stage three yang expert with an origin divine weapon!"
 ,m As soon as these words came out, Liu Long immediately took a deep breath.  Middle stage of three yang?
 He even had an origin god weapon!
 What a joke, how could he kill them?
 Even if the other party was a bad person ... He wasn't so arrogant as to think that he could kill an existence in the middle stage of the three yang realm. Even if he used all his strength with the nine refinements force, he might not be able to break through the defense of the three yang realm. He was full of confidence before, but now that he didn't kill li Dahu with one punch, he was a little more clear-headed.
 Li Hao said,"I also need water energy now. Boss, you need it too. Kill her. We'll be satisfied. There's still some left!" I have a feeling that if I balance the five elements, I might have a chance to enter the thousand warrior ..."
 He had a feeling that after the five elements were balanced, the terrain and sword power might have improved or even merged.
 It was a pity that the five elements were not in balance, which also caused his sword force to be on the weaker side and the terrain to be on the stronger side. Because the terrain had a great relationship with the earth energy, it was somewhat affected.
 He needed a large amount of water energy to balance this power.
 Liu Long frowned and said,"even if she's a bad person, since Minister hou has said so, no matter who the other party is ... We can kill them!" But, do you think you and I can do it?"
 It was impossible!
 "It's not impossible to ambush her ... Boss, it's hard for you to break through her defense, but if you use my sword and the ninth refinement force, there's still hope!"  Of course, Li Hao said, I need an opportunity! It's also difficult with the three suns by your side. "
 "Now, I hope that everyone will enter in large numbers. It will not be obvious if we are mixed among them. If everyone is waiting outside, we will not appear for a long time, or if we rashly walk out ... It will attract more attention."
 At this moment, Li Hao was in a dilemma.
 It was not a good idea to just stay here.
 If the three suns entered in large numbers, it would be dangerous.
 It would be fine if he encountered Hao lianchuan and Hu dingfang, but if he encountered anyone else ... Li Hao felt that anyone could kill him.
 Even if Hong Yitang seemed to be doing well.
 Don't forget, back then, his teacher had challenged him twice, and he was so scared that he shut himself up, embarrassing himself and being laughed at by the martial world. To a Martial Master, face was more important than the sky. Did he really not have any resentment?
 How was that possible?
 It was just that his teacher was powerful now, and the other party did not dare to show it in front of his teacher.
 As he said this, Liu Long's expression suddenly changed. He pulled Li Hao and Liu Yan, and the three of them instantly fell silent.
 The few of them did not move and held their breaths.
 After a long while, Liu Long let out a sigh of relief and said in a low voice, "Don't move. It seems like an expert is coming ..."
 He didn't need to say anything!
 In fact, Li Hao had discovered it earlier than him. It was just that Liu Long's senses were not weak, and he had made his move in advance.
 At this moment, Li Hao looked out of the alley.
 He felt a slight toothache!
 The three suns had really come!
 More importantly, the ball of words was too big and familiar ... Purple Moon?
 I'll go!
  There was more than one, and there seemed to be more on the streets nearby.
 This is troublesome, the three suns are really entering on a large scale.
 At this moment, his eyes were the best detector. These three suns were very close to him, so he could see the light balls. They were all extremely bright, so it would be strange if he couldn't see them.
 He saw that the ball of light that belonged to the purple Moon was not far away, motionless.
 Li Hao surmised...That it was very likely to be to hunt down the ten-man black-armored squad.
 And the nearby street seemed to be Hong Yitang 's. It was also possible that they were hunting ...
 So, these three suns were going to kill the black-armored man in the outer city first?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The one closest to the inner city was actually Zi Yue.
 This woman was willing to do this?
 They were not far from the inner city, and the gate of the inner city was on the other side of the alley. Li Hao and the others looked out and often saw a large number of black armors patrolling, which was not comparable to what they saw here.

 Li Hao didn't say anything. He quickly and quietly walked toward the inner city. Seeing this, Liu Long hurriedly followed him.
 The three of them were very careful and didn't dare to get close to 2nd Street.
 In their eyes, black armor was friendlier than the purple Moon. If they did not provoke him, he would not take the initiative to find them.
 When they walked out of the alley, Li Hao and the others carefully avoided some of the black-armored patrols. The patrols here were much more intense, and black-armored patrols would come over from time to time.
 Liu Long lowered his voice and said,"we ran here ... It's too dangerous!."
 "It's still better than the purple Moon next door!"
 Li Hao glanced over and saw that the purple moon's ball of light was still there.
 "Boss, do you still have sister yunyao's crystal ball?" he asked.
 The crystal ball was a super bomb made by yunyao.
 It wasn't big and was the size of a glass ball. It contained some mysterious energy and would cause an explosion when it hit the ground. Yun Yao had used a lot of it to deal with Hong Yue's men, but the effect was average. Even Yue Ming couldn't be killed.
  "I didn't bring it!"
 Liu Long shook his head. After he had entered the warrior of thousands, he no longer needed this, so why would he carry this around?
 The power was too small!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao was a little regretful, but Liu Yan said,""I have some!"
 Li Hao was surprised!
 Your relationship with yunyao is so bad, how could you have it?
 Liu Yan couldn't see the confusion in his eyes and said in a low voice,""When I was sparring with her, she kept throwing this at me, so I took some for myself. It's stronger than before. After she became a superpower, she made it stronger. It could even threaten Yueming's life ..."
 That was indeed not weak. It was even more powerful than before.
 As for how Liu Yan obtained it, whether she stole it or robbed it, he didn't care.
 "What do you want to do?" Liu Long asked in a low voice.
 "How about smashing the purple Moon?"
 As he spoke, he saw Liu Long's body trembling under his armor. He didn't know if it was from fear or anger, but the probability of anger was higher.
 Li Hao laughed and said in a low voice,"don't misunderstand ... I want to bury the thing in the path of the black armors. If they walk over and step on it, it will explode ... The explosion of superpowers will attract a large number of black armors ... As long as the location is set, the black armors will naturally gather at Purple moon's side without us having to show up. I'm not stupid. If I really throw it over, she'll kill me before I can escape!"
 After saying that, he looked at the city gate in the distance ... There were many black armors, and even a few copper armors.
 If a crystal bead were to explode here, it would quickly attract the attention of these guys.
 The closer they got to the superpower, the clearer they could feel the energy fluctuations. As long as the enemy was close to the purple Moon, they would be able to sense its presence. By then ... If eight to ten black armors were useless, what about a hundred?
 A few hundred?
 It would be even better if he could attract an existence above the bronze armor!
 Even if he couldn't kill Ziyue, he would at least make her suffer a great loss if she escaped!
 Without another word, Liu Yan took out something from her bosom ... After searching for a long time, she realized that it was armor and could only retract her hand to take it out. Very quickly, she threw out a few small glass balls from the broken part of the armor.
 Li Hao also reached out to take them. There weren't many, only seven or eight.
 He glanced at the patrol route of the black-armored guards, then at Ziyue's position, and smiled.  The purple Moon did not move. It seemed like she was waiting.
 I'll give you a surprise!
 He quickly crouched down and ran over, burying a few crystal balls across the alley from zirai.
 Based on his experience, a team of armored soldiers would pass by in about a minute or two and step on this thing.
 He quickly turned his head and gestured for Liu Yan and the other man to run with him.
 This place was likely to erupt into a great battle later.
 Escape as soon as possible!
 The further away, the better!
 With Li Hao's eyes and the fact that the black-armored man's footsteps could be heard, they could avoid both superpowers and the black-armored man. The three of them fled in places where no one was around.
 At this moment, although there were still some supers in the city, no one had encountered these guys.
 The few of them deliberately avoided these people, so it was difficult for those people to discover them.
 ……
 2nd Street.
 Ziyue waited silently for everyone to get into position and attack together.
 It was fast!
 She had already seen the 10 armorers in front of her. Although they were not weak, they were easy to deal with for an expert of her level.
 The most difficult part was to preserve the armor in its entirety.
 This thing would belong to the Crimson Moon after it was seized.
 At this moment, she saw a faint Starlight flickering outside the city. That was the signal to attack. It was not very bright, but they could all see it.
 In an instant, the purple Moon burst out and rushed toward black armor who was not far away.
 The power of Thunder exploded rapidly!
  With a bang, a black armor was sent flying by her lightning. It wasn't just one. A second, a third ... These black armors were too weak in her hands.
 In the blink of an eye, the 10 black armors were all struck by her lightning.
 In the air, she kept maintaining the power of lightning, striking them so hard that they couldn't land.
 As long as this could last for a minute, these guys would be finished!
 She began to reduce the range of her powers so that black armor would not be able to sense her.
 And at this moment ... BOOM!
 A loud bang!
 On the first street, a team of patrolling black armors was blown up. Although they were not injured, the explosion caused a huge commotion. It was a superpower explosion!
 That place was not far from the city gate.
 In the blink of an eye, a copper-armored man rushed over with some black-armored men. The black-armored man didn't sense anything, but the copper-armored man turned his head and looked in the opposite direction ...
