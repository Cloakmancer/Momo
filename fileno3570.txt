Li Hao didn't expect that the other party would mistake him for someone from the past.The master of order!In the past, there had actually been a master of order, the master of order who had established the nine Heavens. Unfortunately, the other party did not seem to have completely succeeded. Before he had completely established the order, he had been besieged and killed.At this moment, the group of grade-9 experts seemed to be slightly shaken.At this time, the master of tianfang shouted,""Stay calm! This is not order, order is dead, that is the era, and there is no time!"The crowd quieted down a little.That's right, there was no time in that era!How could he be someone from the past?That was ... The successor of order?Order, and a successor?Or could it be that a latecomer cultivated order?,m This group of people came from the future?At this moment, the Lord of calamity's expression was cold as he looked at Li Hao in the air. His temper was considered one of the most irascible among level 9s, and that was how it was.Li Hao waved the sword of order and cut through all the Tribulation lightning Giants, causing the Lord of calamity to be slightly frustrated.However, at this moment, he heard that the other party was not orderly, and he felt a little more at ease.If it really was order ... He was obviously no match for it.Order was an extremely ancient rank-9 in the chaos. It was an existence that created the nine Heavens. One must know that the chaos was so vast and there were so many rank-9s. Yet, someone wanted to create the nine Heavens and sort out the entire chaos ...Whether such an existence was strong or not, it could be seen with a glance.'Since it's not ...Then he had no fear! n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  Even though these visitors from the sky had powerful backgrounds and some of them had even mastered the terrifying power of time, as level nine venerable sovereigns, they were not afraid of the Tribulation."After order, the time cultivator, the dragon clan's venerable sovereign? And ... What!"At this moment, the Lord of tribulation suddenly rose into the air. It no longer controlled the lightning tribulation and crossed the void with a single step. The other nine stages wanted to join in, but after a moment of hesitation, they chose to watch the battle.This was a battle of the ninth-rank, a battle of dignity.The Lord of calamity did not gain any advantage when they fought with someone from the future. If they interfered now, they were afraid that the Lord of calamity would be dissatisfied and attack them instead.The master of tianfang wanted to say a few more words, but he didn't say anything in the end.This group of people seemed to be looking for him.At this moment, the Tribulation had arrived.He was giving him face, but he might also destroy some of his opportunities.Forget it! ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the void.Li Hao already felt that this trip wasn't in vain, even if he didn't fight Tian Fang or communicate with him.But at this moment, he felt that it was all worth it!The ninth heaven was established by the master of order, but order was dead. It was killed by a group of rank-9s. For some unknown reason, or perhaps they were unwilling to establish order ... So they were killed. Perhaps order's idea was to unify the world, just like huntian, so they were killed!"Secondly, a grade-9 Dao is indeed very spiritual. Spirit is the key to grade-9. In the past, it was very spiritual. However, this group of grade-9 DAOs have all integrated with the Dao of chaos and absorbed a large amount of chaotic spirit, causing the chaotic spirit to be completely withered. This might be related to long Zhan.In the group of five, two of them might have a grudge against this group of tier 9 experts.And these two were both thinking of establishing their own unified dynasty, which was very interesting. One wanted to establish order, and the other wanted to change the fate of their race.Just these points alone made this trip worthwhile!However, it was still not enough.Li Hao thought to himself.That was because he had not seen Tian Fang make a move. He wanted to see Tian Fang's Dao, the true Dao, the Dao in Dao chess. It was not enough.Seeing that the Lord of calamity had reappeared in anger and was charging at him, Li Hao frowned. You're an outsider, and we're from Tian Fang. Why are you interfering?Your relationship with Tian Fang isn't bad. Under normal circumstances, people with a normal relationship wouldn't stand up for others.Just like the cultivators who had attacked before, they were all cultivators under Tian Fang.You, the Lord of calamity ... Interfering in this matter would be a slight loss of face.And at this moment, in the void, the Lord of calamity took out a Lightning Spear. As the spear appeared, the surrounding space seemed to collapse, and countless disasters gathered.Mountains crumbled, the seas dried up, the rocks crumbled, the world collapsed, plagues and diseases fell ...A wave of tribulation Qi spread out.At this moment, the Lord of calamity seemed to have become serious. His voice was cold. "You're only level 8. You might be very strong in the future, and there might be no level 9 in that era. Or ... We're no longer in your era! So, you might not know this, but a ninth-rank beast ... Is not something you can defeat!""Today ... I'll show you what a true level 9 is!"As soon as he finished speaking, he thrust his spear forward!The void seemed to collapse with this spear. The power of countless great DAOs emerged. The great DAOs roared like dragons as if they had come to life. The surrounding space suddenly became a cage!They wanted to seal Li Hao's River and kill him on the spot.The long spear was the path of calamity. At this moment, it was incomparably sharp and powerful. Li Hao was about to use the sword of time when the human King suddenly shouted in his mind,""I'll do it!"The others more or less revealed some of their elegance.He had never shown his overbearing character.At this moment, countless thoughts appeared in Li Hao's mind. In an instant, a world seemed to appear around him. It was ... The manifestation of neo martial arts, a world of its own!

Chapter 3571 Return (2)
It was also the foundation of the inner world of a human King.Countless human figures appeared. They were all human Kings. At this moment, countless human figures were worshipping themselves. They were worshiping themselves. They were worshiping themselves as Dao. They were Dao sect! The surroundings seemed to have turned into a neo martial world. As soon as Li Hao's long sword was drawn, the thousands of figures instantly gathered. Dao for me!BOOM!The spear stopped. The next moment, Li Hao approached the spear and swung his fist. Within a square inch, the human King was invincible ... Of course, the human King said it himself.Like thousands of Buddhas greeting their master, countless afterimages appeared in his hand as he grabbed the spear directly as if he was capturing a Dragon of the great path. Li Hao's qi and blood soared to the sky, and he was extremely ruthless. With a crack, marks were left on the spear of the great path. The great path roared!The Dao of calamity was roaring crazily at this moment!Close combat!The Lord of calamity was furious. It kept its spear and madly attacked Li Hao. At the same time, a child-like laugh echoed in all directions. Li Hao's expression changed again!Suddenly, his body burned and time passed!The long spear in front of him seemed to wither and die.The chirping of cicadas came out of Li Hao's mouth. Time withered and withered, and everything around him seemed to be annihilated in an instant. Even Li Hao himself was annihilated. In an instant, everything turned into ashes!Li Hao was turned into dust, and the spear was also shriveled. The Lord of disaster's expression changed greatly!The Dao of life and death?How could he be so strong!As for the other party ... In just an instant, Li Hao's figure reappeared, and the voice of the Overlord of spring and autumn rang in his mind. "I've been dead for 800000 years. Let him kill me 800000 times!"Otherwise, I'll never die!Li Hao was speechless. Really?Of course, the next moment, he realized,'what are you bragging about?' he couldn't help but curse inwardly. 'One Nirvana took up 30% of my power. What are you bragging about? but I have to say, it's terrifying!'Spring Autumn, you have to kill her at least three or four times. Otherwise, you can't kill her!She could be revived in an instant!This seemed to be even more powerful than the Dao of life and death.At this time, the great Dao of tribulation had directly withered a section. The Lord of tribulation was furious and had hurt the foundation of the great Dao. He had not expected that the person in front of him would have so many means, and ... Such a poisonous one!"You're looking for death!"The spear, which had shriveled a bit, was still pressing forward. The cultivators all displayed their powerful great DAOs, but Li Hao was still the one controlling the main body.  Best novel online free at ùô£Oùô´ùôöùô°ùôóùôûùô£ At this moment, Li Hao took a deep breath, and the world suddenly began to spin.The long river of realms appeared, and the great Dao circled.Countless Dao domains appeared in an instant. Four great experts stood guard in all directions. At this moment, Li Hao suddenly slashed his sword, not at the catastrophe, but at the chaos in the void, as if he was slashing at the Dao of chaos."Open!"This was also the first time he had made a sound. It was like a great Bell that shook the heavens and earth. The sword seemed to have opened up time. With a loud rumble, it was as if it had cut into the Dao of chaos.Time trembled once more, as if ... Chaos was about to be opened up here, and the heavens and earth were about to be separated!Boom! Boom! Boom!The entire chaos great Dao seemed to shake in an instant, and countless spirituality frantically overflowed. The Dao of calamity in front of him suddenly trembled.The level 9s were all stunned and then enraged. Even Tian Fang frowned and suddenly disappeared as if the sky had been separated from the earth. In just a moment, the space where Li Hao was seemed to be completely isolated.The chaos crack left by the sword that slashed at the chaos great Dao was also quickly repaired by him. At this moment, Tian Fang frowned at Li Hao and said calmly,""Fellow Daoist, you're from the future? No matter where it came from, why destroy the Dao of chaos? the Dao of chaos, the source of chaos, the source of life...It is the very Foundation of chaos. Even if chaos is re-established, it is still dependent on the Dao of chaos. How can we destroy it as we please?"He did not appear overbearing, but his tone was slightly dissatisfied.Li Hao's sword and time were supposed to be unable to harm the Dao of chaos, but time seemed to be one with chaos. In an instant, chaos was injured.At this moment, Li Hao was very satisfied!As expected!"I've long guessed that if chaos also has an origin of life, it should be related to the chaos great Dao. I didn't dare to try it in my era, but it doesn't matter here.He was really there!With a sword strike that shook chaos and even made Tian Fang stop him, Li Hao knew that if he didn't run now, he wouldn't have an easy time.However, the Lord of calamity in front of him seemed to be unwilling and very unhappy ...At this moment, Li Hao chuckled.You're such a busybody, customer.Tribulation?It just so happens that I can also test my tribulation!Suddenly, a piece of Holy prose appeared. In an instant, the time star entered, and even the four great masters entered it. The Tiger took the lead, and anger burst out in an instant. The ultimate power of desire emerged in an instant.Desire!In an instant, a special power appeared in front of the Lord of calamity. It was an extreme desire. At this moment, a few of his great Dao of calamity suddenly collapsed!The other party was startled. How could this be?Even if this person also cultivated tribulation, if one person walked the same path, it would be different ....But now ...He suddenly understood something!"Your tribulation ..."He roared!Your calamity comes from me!Was it?This is my disciple?That was impossible!Who was this person?Li Hao's path of calamity was exactly the same as his. It was not a self-cultivated path, but a kind of inheritance ... Therefore, he thought that it was different when they were identical!At that moment, the great Dao actually crumbled a little.

Chapter 3572 Return (3)
Disturbed by the path of desire, he was so furious that he lost control of himself for a moment. A level nine shouldn't be like this, but Li Hao's path of desire was not weak.In addition, he had destroyed some of the other party's Dao of calamity. In an instant, the sword was drawn!With a cracking sound, the long spear was shattered!The sword stabbed out!It pierced through the other party's chest. The Lord of calamity grunted, and his face turned green. With a violent roar, countless power of the great path emerged. With a boom, the long sword exploded!Just as he was about to attack again, Li Hao's voice suddenly echoed.""I've seen enough of my seniors. Time can't be extinguished. In the future, you'll still need me ..."As soon as he said that, he wanted to ignore the Tribulation, but Tian Fang master's face suddenly changed. He shouted,""Stop!"The Lord of calamity's expression changed slightly, and he stopped erupting again.As for Li Hao, he smiled. At this moment, time was seriously disturbed. He did not say anything more. Instead, he looked at Tian Fang and the venerable sovereigns around him. He laughed and instantly retreated into the river!The entire River began to flow backward.The tianfang master's expression changed, while the Lord of calamity was furious. Suddenly, he punched out, and the surrounding void exploded with the power of tribulation lightning. He was furious,"bastard!" For the rest of his life, when time appeared, he would be struck to death! With the appearance of time, my tribulation will descend!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùWords of law!In an instant, it was as if the great Dao in the void had a law. Grade 9 DAOs all had spirituality.The master of tianfang frowned slightly.Very quickly, he felt at ease again.If he couldn't even survive the Tribulation, he wouldn't be worthy of controlling time.The Lord of calamity was extremely angry and would naturally be angry.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.A million years later.In the real world.Deep in the chaos.The statues on the ground where countless DAOs stood suddenly opened their eyes at the same time. Something seemed to have appeared in everyone's memories. At this moment, the Lord of calamity suddenly shouted in a thunderous voice,""I see!"At this moment, he seemed to have more memories!Yes, it only happened at this moment.The Lord of calamity couldn't help but curse in a low voice,""I see, no wonder ... In the past, I would let the lightning tribulation test time for no reason ... I thought ..."At this moment, he was also a little solemn.Suddenly, he looked into the distance and frowned,""Their heavenly Daoist Rite ... They actually ... Actually gathered together and turned back time, returning to the past ..."   Best novel online free at ùô£Oùô´ùôöùô°ùôóùôûùô£ It was unbelievable!Also, he thought of something and said in a low voice,""Huntian ... Order?"At this time, venerable sovereigns from all directions said,""Very bold. The second generation can't be tamed!""This is crazy! They dare to turn back time and go back to the past!""Order ... Chaos heaven is actually related to order!""The Dragon War might be related to the spirit of chaos ...""It's still alright to cultivate the Dao of desolation in spring and autumn ..."Although they had always been observing the chaos, they had some guesses in the past and were not too sure. Today, they seemed to have confirmed many things.In the crowd, the eyes of the giant statue glowed. After a long time, it said calmly,""Calm down! Order, chaos, chaos ... Everything we do is for Dao, for survival, for the chaotic future ... Now, all we need is time ...""But the second generation is obviously not very obedient. Tianfang and the third generation ... Must be put on the agenda!"They actually dared to turn back time and return to the past.At this moment, the Lord of calamity suddenly stretched out his hand and touched the chest of the statue. There ... Seemed to be a sword mark there. His voice was as loud as a Bell,""Li Hao, you learned my Dao of tribulation, but you used it to hurt me!"At this moment, he was a little angry and annoyed.In the past, he didn't know, but now he knew very well that Li Hao, who learned the way of calamity from the lightning territory, also originated from himself. He actually used the way of calamity to hurt him!The master of tianfang did not say anything. He only looked into the distance and said softly,""Reversing spacetime ... What courage! The heavenly Daoist Rite ... They've actually gathered a few of them, and they're actually working together ..."This was also something unexpected.The cultivators of this era were quite bold."However, you have turned back time. Do you really think that we don't know?"When it comes to the past, we'll have more memories. Although it won't affect the overall situation, it's true that there's an additional part of the past in their memories. It changed some of the past events of the rank nine experts. From this, you can imagine how terrifying time is.Of course, that was all there was to it. The main storyline would not be affected.Before it could affect them, they had already died from the exhaustion of time.The master of tianfang was silent for a while, then suddenly said,""Tian Fang is about to officially return! But long Zhan is occupying tianfang ... If it was in the past, it doesn't matter, but this time, I'm afraid there will be some changes ..."Long Zhan occupying Tian Fang was actually not scary. What he was a little uneasy about right now was ... These people actually joined hands this time. Would there be any accidents?The distance was too close!This was especially true for the human King of new martial arts and Li Hao of Silver Moon, the second generation time cultivator.These people were too close to the four-sided domain."Didn't the second generation owe you a favor?"Someone said in a deep voice,"if he doesn't pay back the debt of time ... It'll be disadvantageous to him. He should be very clear about this in his heart!" You have to return everything you borrow ..."

Chapter 3573 Return (4)
Since that was the case, he might as well make use of it.The master of tianfang did not say anything more. He only glanced at the Lord of calamity. This time, he might need the help of the Thunder region.The Lord of calamity's expression was still ugly. After a long time, he seemed to have understood something. He looked at Tian Fang and said in a deep voice,""Don't worry. With Tian Fang's return, the Thunder region will take action and seal off Tian Fang, not allowing outsiders to enter!"Tian Fang nodded his head slightly. This was about right.Without anyone interfering, long Zhan alone ... Could not stir up too much of a storm.These people were a little unexpected, but everything was still under control."Then, on the order side, huntian ..." Someone added."Don't worry about it for the time being! He can't establish a new order, and spring and autumn and the others won't let him do so. So ... He won't be a second order!"Everyone nodded in agreement. The chaos would probably never be able to unify again.Huntian's path had already been cut off!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.They quickly traveled through time and returned to the present. Li Hao's face was pale, and the others 'spiritual bodies were extremely unstable."They know something now," Li Hao suddenly said."Of course, we also know something about them. I'm afraid ... We'll be in trouble."The few of them didn't say anything. They were already prepared for this long before they made the decision.Huntian said calmly,"don't worry, they can't come back. If they could, they would have come back a long time ago! They don't have enough spirituality in the chaos to support their powerful great DAOs. Even if they do return, their great DAOs won't be stable and their spirituality will be destroyed. In reality, they'll only be on par with me at most!"At this moment, he had also understood many things. This trip was not in vain. As for exposing some things, what was the harm?It was more dangerous to worry too much.Li Hao nodded slightly.He took a look at long Zhan ... This time, he suddenly went to tianfang. Tianfang ... His return might be in the near future. This time, there probably wouldn't be any more accidents. The master of tianfang would definitely return.Just as he was thinking, his eyes suddenly changed. In front of him, on the path of return, suddenly, waves surged!Vaguely, it seemed like someone was riding the wind and Breaking the Waves.The others were also surprised. Li Hao's expression changed. He looked into the distance. A young man seemed to have appeared. Li Hao had been the one to find him the last two times.And today ... The other party had actually come to find him and reverse time to return to the past?Yes, at this thought, Li Hao was stunned. We just reversed time and returned to the past. Why ... Are you here?The young man who had just appeared also looked at the end of the river. He saw a few vague figures, but he immediately saw Li Hao.Indeed, the time King was reversing time in the river!He had also taken advantage of this opportunity to arrive at this place.As time and space intersected, there was some turbulence, which gave him the chance to reverse time.But ... It seemed like there was more than one person.Was there an enemy?Countless thoughts flashed through his mind, but he didn't know or care. Now that he had reversed his direction, he stopped and looked at Li Hao. The next moment, he suddenly slashed at Li Hao.He didn't say anything.Li Hao quickly caught the sword, and the sword Qi collided with the river.In an instant ... He seemed to have realized something. He raised his eyebrows slightly, and that person instantly retreated, leaving without looking back. "What's going on?"the human King was puzzled."The future!""Tsk tsk!"The human King laughed."We haven't settled the past yet, but the future has come ... This era is really interesting. The past, the present, and the future. Are the three of them one? What does this guy want to say?""Let me hurry up."Li Hao understood this. He raised his eyebrows and chuckled.Interesting!That's right, the other party's sword was incomparably fast, and it only had one meaning ... Hurry up!Hurry up and do what?Opening up the false chaos?Did he ... Figure it out?Of course, at this moment, he couldn't care about this. He sensed his body's condition and quickly said,""Immediately return!"If he delayed any longer, he wouldn't be able to take it. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The harvest this time was incomparably huge!However ... It also carried a sense of danger.He was exposed to the eyes of the grade-9 experts.However, it was nothing. Those people had been watching the chaos from the beginning and had never shifted their attention away from the chaos.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The group of five quickly returned.BOOM!A wave suddenly rose in the heavenly Daoist Rite.The long river shook, causing the spiritual bodies of the venerable sovereigns to tremble slightly. At this moment, the shadow of the chess piece appeared. It looked at the five people in front of it, and its expression had completely changed.Yes, they had forgotten one thing.Dao chess ... Was also an existence of that era.Therefore, at this moment, Dao Qi had actually seen some things and remembered some things. He had a look of disbelief on his face. These few people ... Had actually ... Returned to a million years ago!They were so bold!The surrounding venerable sovereigns didn't know about this yet. At this moment, they were all very curious. Who had won first place?Their hearts were itching, and they wanted to know immediately.Dao Qi was so shocked that he had forgotten about it. Li Hao felt countless eyes on him, but he remembered it. Before he could speak, he suddenly heard the human King laugh. "I'm too lazy to walk any further. It's only 8999 squares, barely first place ... Li Hao, I'm leaving now. Talk to you later!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù" 8999?""First place?""The human King actually won first place. How is that possible?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùMany venerable sovereigns were surprised that the human King had won first place.

Chapter 3574 Return (3)_5
At this moment, Li Hao and the others were speechless.We ... What should we say?The few of them wanted to save some face ...Besides, there was actually nothing to fight for. Everyone's goal was not this, but ... If word got out, it would not be good.At this moment, Li Hao said,""Dao chess is only at the eighth level, after all, and there are some flaws. There are some restrictions for 9000 squares and above ... The few of us have all reached the 8999th square ... The seniors of the human King, seeing that I'm still young, specially asked me to arrive first. Similarly, Dao GE and the other seniors have the air of an Overlord, so ... This time, I arrived first, so ... I might be able to obtain some benefits. Thank you for your generosity!"Li Hao laughed heartily."In terms of strength, I'm not as good as you, seniors. This place is not a place to judge strength. It's just a place to discuss Dao. Unfortunately, Dao chess is not perfect enough. It can't be displayed for anything above 9000 squares ..."To put it simply, I was young, so everyone gave me the first place. I won!In fact, it was a draw.It's not wrong for the human King to say that he's first, but the human King is the second youngest ... So, according to age, he's only the second. Don't think too much about it.The stakes are all mine!Spring Autumn and the others didn't say anything. They were too embarrassed to say anything. Since Li Hao had said so ... The actual situation was similar.Huntian didn't stay any longer and laughed."This time, we've gained a lot from the Dao discussion. Fellow Daoist Hao Yue, if there's a chance ... You can come to my West to have a look! The heavenly Daoist Rite is a good thing. It can also enter the West. I will definitely open the door of convenience. As long as it fulfills the rules of the Western huntian ... The location of the Daoist Rite will be the Holy Land of Dao discussions ... No one will stop you!"Many people were shocked.Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't say anything.Huntian had also said that it was in line with his rules ... What rules?In fact, it meant to be incorporated.Li Hao simply smiled."Thank you for your support, senior. I'm not strong enough right now. I'll consider it when I'm strong enough!"Chunqiu also chuckled,"I'm also supportive of you coming to the South ... Just ... Don't cause any trouble!" Hehe ... Haoyue, let's go. This trip wasn't in vain!"As soon as he finished speaking, the shadow suddenly disappeared.Long Zhan didn't say anything more and left directly. Only his voice sounded in Li Hao's ears.""Tian Fang is about to return ... You know a little about Tian Fang's situation. I will give you face and make those three stay! As for the others ... Li Hao, if you come to cause trouble, I won't hold back!"The experts quickly fled.Li Hao, on the other hand, sighed and suddenly said,"Thank you for your support, seniors! Dao Masters huntian and spring and autumn, 20 billion great Dao crystals, and an avatar. Don't rush to give them to me. Just send them over within three months! Senior long Zhan, 10 billion crystals, one clone ... It will be delivered within a month! Senior human King's ten billion great Dao crystals ... Can be used to write an IOU!"None of you want to say anything, right?I say!We're not really a family.Everyone still had to admit their mistakes!Why were they all running so fast?Not acknowledging? Bah!There was no possibility! This time, I've also exhausted a lot of my energy."Although the harvest is great, I'm poor too. I'm probably the poorest right now. I'm too embarrassed to go and destroy worlds every day. You've killed many people and seized many worlds. Can you help me a little?All the emperors present were stunned. There was a clone?Additional stakes? no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  These people really dared to gamble!All of them were speechless. Didn't the Dao Lords of the various heavens earn a lot this time?60 billion great Dao crystals at once ... It was terrifying just thinking about it. With a few avatars, how could that be?Of course, he also thought about how this group of people were the overlords of chaos. They were all able to reach the 8999th square and were all at the 9th rank ...Come to think of it, even huntian Supreme Emperor couldn't make it to 9000 squares?Or was the limit of Daoism go 8999 squares?They didn't understand, but they were greatly shocked!At this moment, someone in the crowd suddenly snorted. Then, he turned pale with fright. The next moment, someone roared,""Neo martial arts attacked our Jie ..."‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao glanced at them and cursed in his heart. When did Zhi Zun and the others run?It was really ...It had to be said that this time, new martial arts had schemed against everyone again.Of course, it had nothing to do with me.Neo martial arts was aiming to unify the East, and today's timing was indeed very suitable. The Supreme martial artist did not even participate in the Dao discussion. Obviously, he had other plans. Sure enough, he ran to attack some large worlds!At this moment, many people were shocked."Path master Hao Yue ... Neo martial's move ..." Someone couldn't help but shout.Li Hao sighed."The dojo only talks about Dao. I can't interfere with the unification of the heavens. Not only new martial arts, but also the Dragon field, huntian, spring and autumn will likely expand in the future. The heavenly dojo can't interfere with the overlords!"After saying that, he added,"of course, I'll try my best to mediate ... The destruction and seizing of realms are too sinful, so we should try to avoid them!" Unfortunately, my strength is limited. In this Dao discussion, the overlords are all at rank 9 and are very strong. There's nothing I can do!"The truth.I can't do anything if they want to fight for hegemony.Moreover, huntian and long Zhan would have a battle sooner or later, and it was even more unavoidable.It's useless to look for me.As soon as he said that, countless venerable sovereigns were silent and sighed.Even though this person was strong, he had only killed Samsara. However, Samsara was clearly no match for those few people. What could he do?

Chapter 3575 Return (6)
At this moment, Li Hao had many thoughts. After a long time, he suddenly said,""For now ... It's best to avoid the square region ... There might be some unrest there. Tianfang is about to completely recover, and tianfang might return ... A war is inevitable, and one side can't have two lords. Even if silver Moon and neo martial occupy the East, Silver Moon has given up on fighting for the position of Overlord ... So the square region might be facing a war ... Everyone, please avoid it as much as possible!""Thank you for the reminder, Dao master!"Many venerable sovereigns were shocked. Was the four-sided domain going to war again?It was truly terrifying!Tian Fang had returned. This was a level 9 world of the past.Li Hao was just giving a reminder. He didn't care whether they would listen to him or not. At this moment, he had many thoughts and ideas. Moreover, he had gained a lot this time. Several experts had integrated their DAOs into his, and he had gained a lot.Regardless of whether it was the Dao of life and death, the Dao of order, the Dao of the physical body, or the Dao of all DAOs for me, they were all special great DAOs, and he had some feelings for them.This time ... For Li Hao, it might be a huge opportunity.Of course, the current chaos would probably be much more chaotic.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Outsiders were just watching the fun of a Dao discussion in the heavenly Daoist sect.But for Li Hao and the others, it was the beginning of a drastic change.At this moment, a storm was coming!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Four regions.Tianfang world.At this time, tianfang world seemed to have more vitality than before. When long Zhan returned and took a look, his eyes changed.Tian Fang was about to awaken.On Tian Fang's side, there were quite a number of grade-8 experts. They had already fought a few of them before, and that was a million years ago. It was impossible for these people to be in a deep sleep all this time.It was also possible that he had participated in a great battle, or he could be comprehending Dao ...This time, there might be even more grade eights, including those from the five great sects, the Coiling Dragon envoy, and the others. They might have all reached grade eight.In addition to Tian Fang himself ... Perhaps a clone would descend.Long Zhan frowned slightly.‚Äã They might even be stronger than expected. More importantly, Li Hao had to protect three people!This was even more troublesome!He looked around and saw that there were only a few grade-8 and grade-7 cultivators. However, compared to them, they were probably much weaker. The light and dark emissaries and life and death messengers of the past might have had the power of 4000 to 5000 Dao laws.Many thoughts appeared in his mind. He shouted,""Prepare for battle!"Prepare for battle?Everyone was stunned.Long Zhan's voice rang out,"after today, the war will continue on for my chaos race! The new martial in the East, the Silver Moon, the huntian in the West, and the coming tianfang ... Everyone, whether we, the chaos race, can establish ourselves in the chaos is not something that needs to be said, but ... To be built with blood!""If anyone is afraid, terrified, they can choose to leave. There's still time! Those who were unwilling to leave, those who were willing to fight, were all prepared to die! That includes ... Me!"Long Zhan's voice reverberated in all directions."The reason why my Primal Chaos race has fallen to where we are today is related to the ninth-rank and also to Tian Fang! The destruction of our sentience will leave us, the primordial chaos race, with no one to rely on, no longer having any sentience to speak of ...""This is a life and death enemy!"Long Zhan's roar resounded through the heavens and earth,"the chaos race's ability to rise ... Depends on now! If we, the chaos race, are still unable to rise to power in this era ... We'll never have another chance in the future!"His voice trembled, but his heart was filled with despair.Did he still have a chance?This Dao discussion had actually made him a little depressed and desperate.The ninth-rank is at harmonious spirit realm, and huntian is trying to establish order. These are all obstacles to our race, and they are our great enemies.And this group of people were all ridiculously strong."Li Hao is also dissatisfied with the chaos race for killing humans, so he has a grudge against me. Spring and autumn may not care, but new martial arts has occupied the East. How can they let us go? He looked around ... And saw enemies in all directions!And my clan only has a few grade 8 ones?Long Zhan had always been incomparably confident. But today, he was somewhat dejected. The endless pressure made him somewhat unable to breathe.Looking at Tian Fang, perhaps ... Only by completely breaking through and taking down Tian Fang will our race have a chance of survival!"Otherwise, if this continues, when the sentience of the primordial chaos completely dissipates, our race ... Will no longer have a chance. In fact, the primordial chaos will no longer give birth to the chaos race.This was a battle of fate between the races. Even if it was a battle of life and death, if someone were to extract the spirituality and life force from the chaos bed, there would be no chance of giving birth to the chaos race again.He then thought of the person from the future ...Will the chaos race still exist in the future?Will there still be a place for us, the chaos race, to stand?It's a pity that we didn't have the time to talk. Of course, even if my clan is gone in the future, I still want to fight against the injustice of fate!Long Zhan suppressed everything and quickly mobilized his troops, preparing to encircle and suppress Tian Fang.This time, he had to completely annihilate Tian Fang!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.All parties were also preparing for something.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the North, a few powerhouses were also discussing something.All of a sudden, a ray of light appeared in a Hall inside. The next moment, the venerable sovereigns were overjoyed and disappeared one after another.Soon, Emperor gold spirit appeared.He looked at the crowd and smiled.""The three elements have been gathered!"Everyone was overjoyed, and the water spirit monarch quickly congratulated,""Big brother has become even stronger! It's a pity that we're a little late. Earlier, the people of huntian gathered at the heavenly Daoist Rite and were apparently discussing Dao ..."Jin Ling sneered,"sparring?" They've reached a bottleneck, so they need to do this, but we don 't. As long as I can combine the five elements, even huntian won't be my opponent!"What's the point of discussing Dao?"They have no other choice. I'm different. I've only combined three elements into one. Right now, I'm even stronger than the previous reincarnation cycle. I have more than 6000 DAOs of power. With four elements as one, I'm even stronger than long Zhan.If the five elements truly combine into one, only huntian in the entire primordial chaos can fight me ... I don't need to participate in this boring Dao discussion.The venerable sovereigns also nodded quickly.That was true!Moreover, this group of people would not really discuss the Dao when they gathered together. At most, they would just have a simple exchange and say a few harsh words. Who would really reveal the core of their great Dao to the outside world?That would be too stupid!"Big brother, then what should we do now ..."Sovereign Gold spirit looked to the South and then to the East. He snorted."The East! He killed my brother. That Li Hao...Is courting death!" no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  Didn't he come to the South to take my life?Alright, I'll come find you!I'd like to see what qualifications you have to be so arrogant to me!"But ... Huntian and spring and autumn ..."They were still worried that if they caused too much of a commotion, they would attract the attention of the two sides and cause them to invade the North."Don't worry. Soon, they won't have time to care about me!"Jin Ling suddenly laughed. Her laugh was filled with deep meaning.Chaos was about to change.

Chapter 3576 A Storm Is Coming (1)
The heavenly Daoist sect.In a small domain below, Li Hao sat cross-legged, surrounded by venerable sovereigns.The level 8 lightning Emperor, Wu Shan, and the others were all present.At this moment, Li Hao said, the chaos is going to be chaotic!Everyone was puzzled. It had always been chaotic, so why did he still say this?Li Hao said calmly,"the chaos this time is not just about a few overlords. It also includes some level nines who have disappeared, worlds that have disappeared ... And ... I'm going to open a pseudo-chaos. I might attract everyone's hostility!"That's right, he had realized many things from the previous test.Everyone would not allow him to split open the sky!This was because he wanted to re-open chaos in the Dao of chaos. Breaking the Dao of chaos and absorbing the power of Chaos would cause his spirituality to dissipate. This was the first reason. The second reason was that he had extracted too much power of chaos ... Only today did Li Hao know that the power of tier 9 all came from the Dao of chaos!Who would allow it?Once Li Hao used the Dao of chaos to split open the sky, he would strip them of their source of power!Everyone's expression changed slightly.Li Hao laughed again."There's good news too. The good news is that the current level 8 experts won't stop me from opening the sky!"Everyone was stunned. Why?"That's because splitting open the sky and weakening the level 9s, or rather, cutting off their source of backup power ... It's a good thing for the current level 8s. Although they may also be troubled, it won't be as great an impact as level 9s!"Thus, Li Hao was certain that huntian and the others wouldn't interfere with him opening the sky. This might be a blessing in misfortune.However ... The grade-9 great Dao would interfere, which was more troublesome. Fortunately, at this time, because of the lack of spirituality, these people might not return. Even if they did, the grade-9 great Dao that had lost enough spirituality ... Might not be so difficult to deal with.Naturally, in huntian's words, even if it had lost its spirituality, it was still not weaker than him.At that time, there might be many chaotic heaven realm experts coming!To stop Li Hao from opening the sky.But was the sky ... Going to be opened?Of course!If I don't open it, how can I perfect my Dao?As for them being unhappy that I did it ... Then I'll have to do it too!"If you're unhappy, that's your business."Chaos will definitely be in turmoil next ..." Then, Li Hao continued,"tianfang and the other worlds will return one after another. There might be many more. Their powerhouses might all return. They probably left in the past for spirit, strength, and stability ... And not for anything else!""There's a high chance that they're not dead!"At this point, Li Hao said softly,"as for me, I actually don't have any great enemies ..."Everyone nodded. Because this time, it seemed that Li Hao and the few Chiefs were actually communicating quite well. Of course, there was enmity on long Zhan's side, but in order to rise, long Zhan might not deliberately provoke Li Hao, who was already not weak.But soon, Li Hao said softly,""But I ... Pursue freedom and Dao. But now ... Perhaps, I'll be in some trouble."No matter what those grade-9 experts wanted him to do, or what they needed time to do with the strengthened time ... He would be in trouble.Someone was eyeing his time Dao.No, he was targeting Shi Guang, who was fighting against the heaven Thearch.At this moment, Li Hao felt helpless. Zhan, what did you see?Why did he commit suicide?Or perhaps, he saw the future. He didn't expand his time, perhaps ... Because he didn't want to satisfy some people's desires?That was because ... The time star was only a level 6 star at the moment. However, it was growing rapidly and was almost at Level 7. During this period of time, the time star was actually growing.Once it grew to level 8 or 9, perhaps it would be what some people wanted.Fighting might not be fear, maybe ... It was just disdain, disgust! no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  Just like that year, he had seen the future of some new martial arts and the future of the celestial Emperor. He despised and hated them, so he was unwilling to care about it. He only left some arrangements for future generations to solve it.Just like now, perhaps ... Tier 9 really needed his time to stabilize something. And he had also seen the battle. Thus, he might as well abandon time. Whoever inherited it would be the unlucky one.Who would deal with it!It's mutually consensual, and time has given you a lot of convenience and benefits. But for every bit of it, you have to pay a price.Currently, the most difficult one is actually not me, but long Zhan."Li Hao continued,"now, he is truly surrounded by enemies!" "With Tian Fang's return, the first one to be impacted will definitely be him. With Tian Fang's return, the battle for hegemony in the four regions and the battle for hegemony in the East will become a big problem ... Long Zhan doesn't dare to step out rashly at this moment. If he steps out, it will also be troublesome ... If he doesn't step out, he will have to face Tian Fang's struggle ..."Thinking of long Zhan, Li Hao also sighed.He didn't like long Zhan. This was a fact, not for any other reason, but because he was unhappy when he saw long Zhan's people massacring a large number of humans in the Dragon field. Although it wasn't long Zhan himself, he did tacitly agree.If it were Li Hao's men massacring chaos beasts, long Zhan would also be unhappy with Li Hao.This had nothing to do with anything else, it was just a personal grudge between them.However ... Long Zhan had led the race to rise up and was determined to change their fate. This was very difficult. The chaos race was born from the chaos great Dao. Therefore, if one wanted to really change their fate, first, the chaos great Dao had to be full of spirituality again.Second, the ninth-rank would no longer merge with the Dao chaos and seize the spirit of the great Dao.

Chapter 3577 A Storm Is Coming (2)
Third, there had to be other ways to accumulate spirit, or simply leave the chaos great Dao. The chaos race had to find their own ways to be independent of the chaos great Dao ... It was as difficult as ascending to the heavens!His path ... Might be even harder to walk than the road to great unification.Of course, he was also a little unlucky ...Li Hao felt that he had always been kind to others, but now, those level 9s seemed to have their eyes on his time and wanted to stop him from opening the sky ... This was inevitable.This also caused ... I'm friendly to people, but I may be like long Zhan, very unlucky.I clearly don't need to lead my race to go against the heavens ... But the people I've offended might not be less than long Zhan. This is unfair.Yes, Li Hao felt that he had been wronged.Unless ... He abandoned Shi Guang?Don't care?That won't do either!He had controlled time. Even if he threw it away now, no one would believe it. If they believed it, they might even kill him to silence him?"Time ..."Countless thoughts ran through Li Hao's mind. He then thought of the person from the future. It was said that time was the only thing ... The person from the future seemed to major in divine text instead of time, but he was born in time ...If I opened up the primordial chaos and the other party walked out to control the river of time, then ... Did that mean that he was the true master of time?Li Hao's eyes flickered.What about me?Can I still cultivate time?Time was the only ... How could there be two time Kings in one era?He had countless plans in his mind, but ... It was a little tricky. Of course, the one who was the trickiest was not him, but the future person. If that were to happen ... That person might come out and face countless troubles.'No wonder ... He said that I left him a whole load of trouble ...'Don't tell me he's talking about this?Li Hao thought to himself that if he left Shi Guang to that person, and all the level nines had their eyes on that person ... That little guy who had yet to appear in the future might become The Public Enemy of the chaos the day he came out. What a tragedy!"No... If that's the case, there's no difference between me and fighting!"Li Hao suddenly shook his head and muttered to himself.I can't do this.Even if he were to throw it to the other party, he had to do his best to resolve some problems. Otherwise ... It would really be too much of a scam.I can't live with my conscience!I still have some conscience.At this moment, he felt that battle had no conscience and the great Dao was heartless. Indeed, a person without any desire is even more heartless than me. At the very least, I still have some desire and silver Moon ... I'm much better than you.At this moment, there were numerous thoughts in his mind.He was too weak!Everyone was stronger than him. His future path would actually be very difficult to walk. Even if the resources of the few overlords were in place, it would be too difficult for him to catch up to them quickly, unless ... He split open the sky!However, splitting open the sky would mean facing great trouble ... This was an endless cycle!To rope in a group of people?A few overlords?They were not on the same side as those grade-9 experts from a million years ago. However, everyone had enmity.Li Hao was silent.The venerable sovereigns all frowned. They could sense that Li Hao was in a difficult position. After a long time, Li Hao spoke."You've all been trying to understand the Dao. Dao chess has been accepting everyone's understanding of the Dao. Do you have any ideas?"The illusionary figure of the chess piece appeared with some apprehension.""Clues?"Ninth-rank? p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Don't mess around! Li Hao was speechless."I mean, senior. You don't have any idea about my Dao domain?" he asked.At tier 8, without opening a Dao domain, it would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens to become a top tier 8!One path dominating?That was a possibility!The great Dao of the human King was actually somewhat moderate. It could be considered to be dominant, but this Dao was very special. It had all the DAOs, and all the DAOs belonged to him.Can your Dao chess be the same as the human King?If you can, you don't need to open a Dao domain!"This time, it's not just me. You've also received the comprehensions of several rank eight overlords. Don't you have any clues at all? is a Dao domain that difficult to open?Sword Saint and the others had opened their Tao domain at rank seven.However, it was indeed a Dao domain!You can 't?Dao Qi heaved a sigh of relief. He was subconsciously a little afraid of Li Hao at the moment ... Not because Li Hao was powerful, but because ... There was something new in his memory. This group of people dared to turn back time and go back to the past to provoke a ninth-rank existence!This was awesome!"I ... I'm pretty good, right?"Dao Qi didn't give a definite answer and explained,"I'm an Artifact Spirit after all, it'll be difficult for me to break through the restrictions of a monarch weapon ...Li Hao nodded in understanding.He then looked at the others, Thunderlord and Wu Shan.Wushan was a little mysterious. Seeing Li Hao look at him, he sighed."Fate is unpredictable ...""Senior, can you open a Dao domain?""Truth in the dark ...""Senior, can you open a Dao domain?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùWushan was speechless. After a long while, he helplessly said,"Almost, but ...""It's good that senior can drive it!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùWu Shan was completely speechless. This fellow ... Forget it.Thunderlord, without waiting for Li Hao to speak, immediately said,""I'm almost there, right? It should be ... Mm, almost like that!"Li Hao looked at Kong Ji again.Kong Ji's face was conflicted,'why are you looking at me? "I've already reached level eight, but ... I've been improving too quickly recently. Life, death, Nirvana, revival, light, and darkness have all been stagnant. I already have a Dao domain, but it's not considered powerful. I'm only a weak level eight with a strength of over 2000 Dao laws. "From being strong at the same level to being a weakling at the eighth step now, he actually felt a little uncomfortable.Of course, no matter how weak it was, it was still stronger than before.But it was uncomfortable.In the future, he wouldn't be able to raise his head among the grade-8 experts.

Chapter 3578 A Storm Is Coming (3)
How embarrassing!Li Hao didn't say anything. He looked at Qian Wuliang who had reached Level 7, who was much calmer and stronger than before. Seeing Li Hao looking at him, Qian Wuliang said carefully,""My daoless domain only has the river of the great Dao, the great Dao universe ..."Would this work?"You ..."Li Hao was silent for a moment."You should cultivate your Dao first. Try your best to help Heibao. Give him a chance to reach Level Seven ..."At this point, he suddenly thought of something and threw a divine rune onto the Black Panther.""Comprehend the 'calamity' character and quickly enter Level Seven ... Tian Fang has returned, and there might be some movement in the lightning territory. Now, they know that I've mastered the Dao of calamity, but I don't like it when others know everything! You're in charge of this Dao, so you can pretend to be me at the critical moment!"Everyone knew that Li Hao had mastered some ways of tribulation, so they were more cautious.But now, Li Hao didn't miss it at all. He threw it to Black Panther. Under Li Hao's training, Black Panther had been steadily advancing. He wasn't too outstanding, but Black Panther didn't mind being Li Hao's shadow.This was also what it had been looking forward to.This was because, in the eyes of others, Li Hao could be a path master or a realm Lord, but in its eyes ... He was its master.It was different!It didn't matter if it was mediocre, incompetent, or not having its own path. As long as Li Hao was strong, it was fine as long as it could help him."By the way, Heibao," Li Hao added,"in the next few days, you and ... You and ... Hu Qingfeng, that guy, should get in touch!"Li Hao's eyes flickered."Qian Wuliang, help Hu Qingfeng. Make him stronger. Even if he can't reach Level 7, he must reach Level 6. Tell me if he needs any resources."Qian Wuliang's eyes flickered!Hu Qingfeng.A weak fellow ... Of course, he was still okay now. He was close to a fourth-rank venerable sovereign, so he was not too weak.The only thing that stood out about him was that he made people not know whether to laugh or cry.He could summon Li Hao!p Of course, it was just an illusion, but ... It really looked like the real Li Hao. Sometimes, even Li Hao himself couldn't tell which one was real and which one was fake. Except for the difference in strength, the one Hu Qingfeng summoned was even more like the real Li Hao. It was perfect!He was the perfect Li Hao that Hu Qingfeng had imagined!At this moment, everyone had some speculations. Black Panther had mastered the path of calamity, and Hu Qingfeng could summon a fake Li Hao ... Was he going to pretend to be Li Hao?Clearly, Li Hao was plotting something again.Was it related to Tian Fang's recovery?"Lord Marquis, be at ease. I know what to do.""Master hou, professor Yuan has gone to the North ... And there's no news from him ... And ... And Dean Hong ..." Qian Wuliang nodded and continued."What's wrong with martial uncle Hong?" He hesitated for a moment, but he still said,""Dean Hong has gone to the four-sided domain!"Li Hao frowned slightly. He wasn't sure about this."Did he say what he was going to do?""He said ... If there's any change in the square region, he wants to bring back some humans ... The other places are fine, but the chaos race is in charge of the square region, and the chaos beasts are too cruel to the human race ..." p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  She was a little too saintly.However, he couldn't be blamed for this. Back then, he had integrated the beliefs of billions of humans for the sake of his side's victory. It could be said that the current Hong Yitang ... Was actually very miserable in Li Hao's eyes.Li Hao had always regarded this rubbish Dao as the Dao of puppets."I have to find a way to extract it ..."Li Hao murmured, but Qian Wuliang interrupted him,"Director Hong ... I think ... I think he's actually sober!"He looked at Li Hao and said,""He ... He's not being controlled by the great Dao! He had always had a compassionate heart and sympathized with the human race's plight. In the past, when he was in Silver Moon, he did not actually know those unfamiliar children and orphans, but he was willing to save them! Now, in his eyes, the humans in the four-sided domain might be the same as those who were displaced by Wars in the past!""He is the earth-shrouding sword. The earth is all-encompassing and carries all things!""Therefore, I think that Dean Hong is more than willing to merge the path of the human Sovereign this time ..." Qian Wuliang continued."It might not be a desperate move, as you think!"Li Hao frowned, but didn't say anything.Virtue and tolerance ...Hong Yitang!This Silver Moon Martial Master that he had known for a long time had always been a kind person. In the martial arts world, he could be considered one of the few kind people, right?As for the others ... They weren't bad, but they weren't too good either.Killing and plundering was something that everyone had done before.It wasn't the first time that the southern style didn't return the money they owed.Back then, Thunderbolt kick was used to looking for women ... It was impossible to find out whether he had done anything like that. Anyway, he was not a good person.Hou Xiaochen and the others had their hands stained with blood.On the other hand, Hong Yitang ... Was indeed more honest.After thinking for a while, Li Hao said,"let's not care about senior uncle Hong for now. He went to the square region ... Even if long Zhan saw it, he won't do anything. He's in a difficult situation now. Although he has a grudge against us, he won't offend me rashly. He even hopes that I can help and take three people away to reduce some trouble.""Our strength ... Is not enough. Of course, I'm not talking about you, but me!"Li Hao exhaled."At the current stage, without more than 6000 great Dao, it's difficult to establish a foothold and truly control one's fate. I've filled 2000 realms, and my strength is only 3000 to 4000 Dao laws ... I'm still far from it!"

3579 Chapter 579
"Qian Wuliang! Continue to spread the divine text technique and make all Silver Moon cultivators cultivate it!"Qian Wuliang kept nodding.Li Hao thought for a moment, and a book appeared.""This is the divine text Scripture. Pass this book down and integrate it into the great Dao universe so that all cultivators can comprehend the Dao of the divine text. The Silver Moon comes from the same source. At a critical moment, I might use the divine text to nurture my Dao spirit ... You can pass on these words and tell everyone!"Qian Wuliang didn't say anything, as no one would have any objection to this.At this moment, Li Hao looked at the low-profile second cat.‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù"Why are you looking at me like that?" second cat seemed helpless.Why are you looking at cats?It now somewhat understood what the big cat meant by cats don't fight. At this moment, it really wanted to say, cats don't work!I'm also a cat!I don't want to work.Don't bother me!"Senior second cat ..." Li Hao smiled."I'm not your senior. I'm a cat!"Second cat complained,"don't call me senior, I'm very miserable.""Senior second cat, please don't say that."Li Hao smiled and said,"senior, you have an independent personality. You are an independent creature ..."Second cat rolled its eyes.It's here!"Therefore, I would like to trouble senior to help me replicate ... The Dao of the four Emperors!""Who is it?""The four venerable sovereigns who entered the game this time, besides me ..."Go to hell!Second cat wanted to curse.Even though those people aren't ninth-rank, they're still top-tier eighth-rank powerhouses."I'm a rank 7 cat!"Therefore, I can't replicate a rank eight Dao.Don't even think about it!Li Hao nodded."I know. That's why this time ... I want to raise you to level 8!""Senior, it's Dao Ling," Li Hao said."I didn't know how to upgrade Dao Ling before, but now I know ..."'I ...'Second cat wanted to die!It looked at Li Hao, and Li Hao looked back at it. ""Dao spirit, devouring a Dao of the same element can actually strengthen you. I've already verified this! 'There must be more Dao of the same type and Dao of replication ... In addition to a large amount of source of life, senior is much simpler than others. As long as you strengthen your core Dao, you can reach level eight!' So ... I want to ...""Don't even think about it!"Li Hao sighed,'senior, this era is so difficult! Even if you don't work, you might be killed. ""Let me die!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao was speechless. You cat, why are you learning to be a big cat now?He's not obedient!"Senior ...""It's very difficult to copy their Dao!" "With a clone, it won't be difficult for senior to reach rank 8!""Alright then!""When will this really be your last time?" second cat was dejected.I don't believe you anymore.Why did you resurrect me?He might as well die.It was too tragic."Soon ..." Li Hao said awkwardly.It's fast?Second cat was completely speechless. The others also laughed dryly. This ... They really had no choice."In short," Li Hao continued,"it's rare for the heavenly Daoist Rite to be quiet. This is an opportunity for everyone. No matter how strong or weak the emperors are, they all have their merits! Of course, try not to leak the DAOs of others to others!"Everyone nodded.Now was indeed an opportunity."Then ... When will Tian Fang return?""We're almost there,"At this moment, Li Hao merged with the chaos and looked at the hidden dimensional gateway. After a long time, he said,""There's some fluctuation. At most three months, at least a few days ... It's coming soon!"As he said this, he suddenly frowned and looked at his own time star, saying in a deep voice,""They might ... Use me as a transfer point!"What?Everyone was stunned. As for Li Hao, he looked at the space-time star. At this moment, the space-time star seemed to be fluctuating. In the past, Zhan seemed to have made some connection between the space-time star and this teleportation channel. Thus, when Tian Fang returned, perhaps ... He would have to pass through the space-time star.Why so?The dark passage around neo martial was also related to the time star in the past, and the teleportation passage seemed to have been connected by Zhan. Zhan ... Why did he do this?What's the use of walking over here?Thoughts kept appearing in his mind."Let's go through time ..."Li Hao was a little confused. Can I keep the three of them here during the process?This way, he might be able to avoid some trouble.However, what if the three of them were unwilling to stay?A debt of favor must be repaid, this was the rule!However, if these people wanted him to pay a high price for the favor he owed in the past, it probably wouldn't be enough. He thought about the day he entered the tianfang great path universe, and the other party seemed to want him to control it ... If he accepted it that day, he shuddered at the thought! n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Then today, it wasn't a favor from three Grade 7 experts, but a Grade 9 expert!If that was the case, there was really no way to repay him. Fortunately, he was wise back then and did not make such a choice. Otherwise, even though he would have become an expert early on, he would not have so many choices like he did today.At this moment, Li Hao's mind moved!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Li Hao instantly appeared outside Alliance City 9.At this moment, a kun Peng was flying towards them with the wind.Seeing Li Hao, he was a little afraid, but he quickly regained his calm.""I'm here on orders. 20 billion great Dao crystals and ... One of my main avatars!""My master has said ... You can use it, but you must not ... Insult it!"Insult?Li Hao was stunned. Then, he laughed."Thank you, fellow Daoist huntian ... It's just ... An insult. Do I have to hang him up and whip his corpse?"
