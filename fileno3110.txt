If it was second cat, it felt that it would first upgrade itself to the sixth rank.However, if it weren't for Li Hao's personality ... How could he have gathered four level Seven venerable sovereigns at this moment?He didn't know if it was right or wrong to drink and Peck.As for Li Hao, he took the Dao crystals and looked up.""Senior daoqi!"A moment later, the shadow landed.He was a little nervous and hesitant.This time ... It failed to suppress the world origin. It failed to fulfill its promise to Li Hao, so now ..."Now, I'll give you five billion great Dao crystals. Previously, you said that you would need to pay about a seventh-level great Dao universe to borrow power once. Five billion great Dao crystals aren't too much. If you exchange a seventh-level world for great Dao crystals, it'll be worth at least ten billion! "At least ... Even if I return the 15 billion great Dao crystals this time, I still owe Senior 10 billion great Dao crystals, right?"The chess figure was a little embarrassed."This ... You don't have to do this. That day, I only ...""No, I really like one thing about the human King, and that's ... Separating public and private interests!"Li Hao sighed."At the very least, the human Emperor will convert some things into numbers. It's hard to use numbers to replace favors. However ... I, Li Hao, rarely fail to pay back the debts I owe!"He smiled,'today, I owe the human King a seventh level world! I owe Senior 10 billion great Dao crystals ... And I owe Tian Fang's Daoist Coiling Dragon, Daoist Firesmoke, and Daoist water element a favor each. ""The others ..." He said softly as he looked around."I should be done paying off my debts."I don't owe the master of Tian Fang anything.I've already paid what I owe."As for the Nirvana sky recipe, it was done by Kong Ji. Even if it's me, it's also my ability. You've stayed. If you can't do it, you can descend. If I don't have the ability, I naturally won't come to your world to destroy you.In addition, Li Hao didn't mention the time star in his hand.This could have been left behind by Zhan Tiandi.In the future ... He might have to return the favor.He had always been like this. He didn't like to owe others. Even if he suffered some losses, it was nothing.The Dao chess Phantom looked a little embarrassed, but Li Hao gave him a Dao crystal.""Senior, please accept it!"The origin of the world had left about six billion great Dao crystals. Five billion were given to Dao chess, and the rest were given to Kong Ji to go through life and death. There were still some that the Lord of the cloud world had given him. Li Hao calculated that he could give them to powerhouses who had comprehended some great Dao.Let the entire Silvermoon step into the fifth step as soon as possible.The virtual chess figure seemed to let out a breath and said,""Then ... Many thanks!""Senior is too polite!" The Dao chess Phantom didn't say anything else and swept away the great Dao crystals. A square of Dao chess floated between the heaven and earth. Countless great Dao crystals were instantly absorbed into the Dao chess. In the blink of an eye, a powerful aura appeared on the Dao chess board.This was a treasure refined by an eighth-tier universe!It was personally refined by a rank nine venerable sovereign!After burning so many great Dao crystals, the Dao chess seemed to have recovered a lot. After a moment, the Dao chess Phantom said,""After absorbing the power of these great DAOs, I'll be able to unleash even more power in a short period of time ... If you need anything, you can come to me! Even if I'm borrowing power, I don't need to borrow from nothing like before, I ...""Many thanks, senior. If there's a need, I'll ask!""That's good!"The Dao chess virtual shadow no longer said anything. It glanced at the escaping origin of the world and did not say anything. The master of Tian Fang's virtual shadow did not appear. The Dao chess virtual shadow might have realized something, or perhaps ... The other party had been paying attention to Tian Fang.In that case, it didn't say anything.……The next moment, Li Hao moved again and instantly arrived in front of Kong Ji.At this moment, Kong Ji's face was deathly still. Seeing Li Hao, he was a little embarrassed. "I'm sorry, I ...""There's no need for that!" Li Hao smiled and said, one billion great Dao crystals is enough for you to walk the path of life and death! However, there's a small favor I need your help with. Take it as a form of repayment for all the work I've done for you ..." n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  "What's the matter?""When you revive heaven and earth ... Kill all the cultivators of Silver Moon before reviving them! 'Let them experience what it feels like to be resurrected by a rank six venerable sovereign. When they're walking on the path of life and death, show Lin Hongyu ... I want her to walk on the path of life and death with you!' A real life and death!"Even though Lin Hongyu had cultivated the life and death doctrine, she had never truly walked the path of life and death. As for the time when she advanced to venerable sovereign, it could only be said to be an imitation and attempt.At that time, she didn't even understand life and death.This time, Lin Hongyu more or less had some enlightenment. Perhaps ... It was time to go again. There should not be any difficulty in reaching level three.Kong Ji thought it was something else and laughed,""Simple!"This was too simple.Li Hao's voice shook the heavens and earth,"I'll have Daoist forsaken desolation cast a Nirvana resuscitation on the cultivators of Silvermoon!" "Destroy all of you, and walk towards recovery from the destruction! We will die together with the rank 9 world, and we will revive together with the rank 9 world!""Whether you can gain any enlightenment or gain anything ... It's up to you! If Silvermoon is still unable to step into the fifth step, we won't be able to stay here for too long. It'll be difficult for him to step into the fifth step!"Originally, he had even hoped to step into the sixth step, but now it seemed that he was only at the fifth step.

Chapter 3111 The World's Recovery (7)
The advancement of the entire world, the rapid advancement, was even more difficult than expected!That's good. It'll be the same as me. At that time, I'll be at level five, the world at level five, and the great Dao universe at level five ... It'll be compatible.A fifth-tier double-Dao universe should not be weaker than an ordinary sixth-tier universe.If the two Dao Masters reached level five, they would be able to fight against a level six if they worked together. In this way, if they were to encounter any danger, as long as they were not facing a high level venerable sovereign, they would have the power to fight!"Many thanks to Lord Marquis for granting my wish!"At this moment, shouts came from all directions. There was not much pretentiousness, only solemness and solemness.This time, after eating so many resources, they were still unable to enter the fifth-tier universe. The two Dao Masters wanted to commit suicide.……And this moment of silence could not be delayed.The power of Nirvana spread out once again. Without the world Origin's obstruction, the entire Nirvana world expanded to its limit. From the outside, the entire sky turned gray!Outside, the light Emperor was a little nervous.He was afraid that his son's revival would fail ... Failure was nothing. More importantly, if he failed, it would mean that there was a problem with the Dao of the two extremes, which would be a huge blow to Kong Ji.The entire tianfang was destroyed!Everyone, everything, even the escapeed source of the world, was being destroyed at this moment.Li Hao sat cross-legged in the air, allowing the destructive power to sweep past him. He did not block or resist it, but the destructive power could not destroy Li Hao. He seemed to be immune to it, or perhaps he was also a practitioner of this technique, so he did not feel much.The nearby Silvermoon cultivators, on the other hand, entered a state of Nirvana.At this moment, there were only six people left in the entire Tian Fang.Four seventh level venerable sovereigns, Li Hao, and Kong Ji.Of course, there was also a cat hiding in the river.BOOM!The loud sound reverberated through the entire tianfang world. The tianfang world that was originally rotating suddenly stopped. The huge centrifugal force seemed to want to throw the heaven and earth out!As for Kong Ji, he was sweating all over. A sixth rank venerable sovereign had really destroyed a ninth rank world!At this moment, the Flower of Life in front of him even gave birth to a fruit, and its fragrance permeated the world. It was as if one could instantly attain Dao and become an immortal if they ate it.Kong Ji suppressed his anger and started sweating. He looked at Li Hao, then at the surroundings, and roared,""Revive!"BOOM!The flower and the fruit shattered. Endless life force, extremely dense life force, began to explode with him as the origin!The entire world seemed to have woken up from a deep sleep in an instant!A wave of life force swept across the entire world. Wherever it went, birds sang and flowers bloomed. Green grass began to grow, the sun began to appear, rivers began to flow, and mountains began to ripple ...The Silver Moon cultivators also began to walk out of the silence. Even if it was only for a moment, it felt like a lifetime ago!In that instant of silence, they seemed to have fallen into an absolute silence, an absolute silence.And at this moment, after experiencing the feeling of recovery, it was as if his life had been given a new life.Li Hao felt so comfortable that he wanted to moan.Kong Ji's body erupted with two bursts of energy and intertwined with each other. At that moment, a wave of pressure appeared. It was the pressure of a rank seven ... He had not really reached rank seven, but he had erupted with the pressure of a rank seven.The void was also feeling it silently. His world of destruction was dissipating, and a world of recovery was being born.Within the realm, a flower appeared once more.This was the Flower of Life that belonged to him!As for the Flower of Life, black and white suddenly intertwined. Light and darkness intertwined. Life and death, quietness, light and darkness ...At this moment, he felt like he had entered a special state.His domain started to expand rapidly.Closing his eyes, his hair began to grow black and white. At this moment, he felt that he could step into the seventh step with one more step!But ... Life and death had not yet left!A star appeared, and he stepped onto it. Li Hao didn't say anything, and a long river was revealed. In the distance, venerable the sword also formed a sword realm, relying on the river of great Dao and the sword realm.At this moment, Kong Ji walked towards the river. After a few steps, he started to lose his life and his face started to age. He reached out and Lin Hongyu appeared in the distance.He was a little shocked.Li Hao glanced at her, nodded, and said telepathically,""Follow him! To experience a different Dao of life and death ..."Lin Hongyu's expression changed slightly, but she did not say anything.Soon, he walked along the path of Kong Ji, along the river, step by step towards the Bridge of Life and death built by Kong Ji.The whole world had just been in the recovery stage, but at this moment, life and death appeared! All of a sudden, everyone seemed to have sensed something.Kong Ji, on the other hand, aged rapidly. When he reached the end of the river, he suddenly turned around and glanced at Li Hao."In this life, you ... Are my only friend ... I hope ... I won't forget you!" He said.He had met Li Hao at the fourth step, and today, he had walked the path of life and death. Even if he couldn't reach the seventh step, he could at least rival one!It was only a few years!"I've lived for a thousand years, but the past few years have been the most interesting. I hope ... I won't forget this memory. ""I hope not!" Li Hao smiled and nodded.Lin Hongyu, who was following behind him, felt a little helpless. Suddenly ... She squeezed forward as if urging him. The long river rippled. Kong Ji seemed to want to say something more, but he was instantly squeezed out of the long river. His physical body began to dissipate and fell into the life and death Star, walking towards his next life!Lin Hongyu did not even turn her head. She was also extremely old at this moment. Suddenly, she transmitted a message,""I'll walk the path of life and death. Let's go again. I ... Am younger than you!"Li Hao was stunned! What did that mean?'Younger than me ...Oh!He was somewhat enlightened.Right, that's true.An old lady in her 30s ... If she were to walk the river of life and death, he didn't pay much attention to it the last time. This time, she would be 18 years old?Li Hao couldn't help but laugh!A woman, even at this point, still did not forget about her age.I didn't say you were old!At least, compared to the venerable sovereigns I know, those women are younger. Hong Qing and the others who were younger than you are now more than 500 years old. You may be the youngest woman I know so far.In the next moment, the sound of crying filled the air.Li Hao waved his hand and blocked Lin Hongyu ... As for Kong Ji, so be it if he was naked!Along with this cry, the world was being reborn as if a new life had been born in tianfang world. Suddenly, spring returned to the earth, and the world seemed to be recovering again!At this moment, the destructive source of the world also throbbed slightly.Everything seemed to be different!Li Hao silently felt all of this. This was Kong Ji's opportunity and also Lin Hongyu's ... Of course, Lin Hongyu only took advantage of Kong Ji's opportunity.Li Hao seemed to have gained nothing.But at this moment, Li Hao chuckled.In the river of the great Dao, realms suddenly appeared.The realm of life, the realm of death, the realm of destruction, the realm of recovery ... The stars that the power of these great DAOs had attached themselves to suddenly collapsed and split into four major realms.These four boundaries were spread out on both sides of the river in pairs.Li Hao's strength didn't increase, but he had separated the four boundaries.The water of the long river flowed ... Suddenly, there seemed to be more vitality.At this moment, the entire sky became much clearer. Li Hao's eyes glowed as he looked at the origin of the world in the distance. The origin of the world seemed to be Reborn!That beating heart ... Seemed to have a double sound.Li Hao laughed!Tian Fang...Is probably stronger than I thought.What was the master of tianfang doing?At this moment, in the distance, the two Dao rivers began to roar wildly. A Black Dog howled at the sky! n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  The Silver Moon world that was floating in the air seemed to expand once again!At this moment, Qian Wuliang, Hong Yitang, and Black Panther's auras were all changing rapidly as if they had been reborn. With the throbbing of the world origin and the empty cry, Tian Fang, who had swallowed countless resources, finally stepped into Level 5 officially!Li Hao chuckled,"those who can vindicate Dao can vindicate Dao now!" Now that the world has been upgraded, the position of venerable sovereigns will be vacant again. The rank five world, Silvermoon world, can accommodate about 50 venerable sovereigns!"This was Silver Moon. Previously, it had only been able to accommodate 30 people. This also meant that there would be another pile of slots.When it reached the sixth rank, perhaps it could accommodate more venerable sovereigns than an ordinary seventh rank world.At this moment, waves of Qi rushed to the heaven and earth!The experts who had not been able to advance the last time were all ecstatic. One by one, they charged towards the river of the path and began this round of advancement.Tian Fang, the land of Silver moon's opportunity!

Chapter 3112 Harvest (1)
The baby cried, and the world recovered.Life and death, the revival of Nirvana, light and darkness appeared between heaven and earth. In the sky, the Silver Moon world began to advance. One by one, those who were not venerable sovereigns were proving their Dao.It was as if everything had started. In this silent tianfang world, a new light was born.Tian Fang, who had been silent for many years, seemed to have truly begun anew at this moment.In the past, although there were living beings living there, they seemed to be out of place with the world.But this moment ... Was different.It was as if the world was accepting them.They bathed in the sunlight and life.The origin of the world was also beating slowly. It was no longer as rapid as before, as if it had obtained a new life and adapted to the New World. In the sky of the world, in the universe of the great path, other than the stars that had been taken away, some extremely weak stars seemed to be born at this moment.They blinked like naughty children, giving off a faint light in the dark Universe.Li Hao, on the other hand, closed his eyes and sensed the recovery of the myriad DAOs in the world.Nirvana. The Dao was also Nirvana.At this moment, the great Dao seemed to be recovering.This was a newly born type 9 world! n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  At this moment, Li Hao's River of Dao had more and more weak boundary domains. From the previous 600, the number gradually rose to 700,800 ...Li Hao actually knew many of them.However, it did not condense into a world.At this moment, as everything was recovering, he turned these DAOs into worlds. He had to conjure 1000 worlds first. As for how to fill the new worlds, that was his problem.That would be trouble in the future!When a thousand worlds turned into a real world, level six was more or less enough. There was no need to really go to the infinite worlds. If he really did go to the infinite worlds, it would not be level six, but Level Seven, level eight, or even ... Level nine!A thousand realms, a thousand DAOs!In fact, according to the distribution and arrangement in Dao chess, walking a thousand squares was actually only at the level of a first stage venerable sovereign ... But that was the Dao, and the Dao was only a line. What Li Hao walked wasn't the Dao, but the Dao as a boundary!Jie was a big net!Li Hao expanded each Dao into a huge net. Therefore, even if it was only a thousand worlds, if he could manifest all of them into worlds, he would be a genuine sixth level venerable sovereign, and one of the top ones.At that moment, about 400 new realms had been born. To fill these small realms, one had to have at least 10 million great Dao crystals. 400 was actually not a lot. It was only about 4 billion great Dao crystals.The key was that the first 600 worlds also needed to absorb energy and replenish the power of great DAOs. Some worlds were even developing into medium-level worlds.As a result, the consumption was even greater.Moreover, due to the different attributes, the great Dao crystals had been slightly consumed. Li Hao estimated that it shouldn't cost much ... At most, he could double it, and eight billion was definitely enough.That's not too much, right?Li Hao's lips curled up. Was it a lot?In the past, he had thought that this was simply an astronomical figure, too many, and too terrifying. But now that he thought about it ... It was still alright. It was only the power contained in a seventh-tier universe. A seventh-tier universe contained at least 10 billion great Dao crystals.When he thought about it this way ... It didn't mean anything.If he had not given Dao Qi, void, or Silvermoon the replenishments, he would have had a chance of reaching rank six.It was just that ... A debt free body was light!He had paid off a lot of debts.It didn't matter if he advanced a little later. The key was to take the opportunity to comprehend Dao and comprehend more Dao. This was the foundation.Now, facing Kong Ji, he could only say one thing ..."You'll have to think of a way to enter Level Seven. I've already tried my best. For a rich kid like you to officially enter Level Seven, it'll be an astronomical figure."A six-DAOs three-pole venerable sovereign would be embarrassed to say that he was a six-DAOs three-pole venerable sovereign if he didn't devour a seventh-tier universe!Venerable the sword, Lizhu, and the others had almost used up this much.Of course, for Li Hao himself ... It would be an astronomical figure if he wanted to reach Level Seven. He didn't know when he would be able to do so.Level Seven required thousands of worlds to manifest?Two thousand?Three thousand?4,000 ... A world was comparable to a world. If he devoured all the worlds in the four-sided domain, would he be able to reach Level Seven?Of course, there was no need to do so.As long as he continued to fill up the little world, he would naturally continue to accumulate energy. Although there would not be a qualitative change, there would be a quantitative change. At that time, a sixth-rank killing a seventh-rank, a sixth-rank killing an eighth-rank, perhaps, it would all become a reality!Perhaps, he had conjured 9000 worlds and was still at level six.However, a rank six venerable sovereign who had accumulated the power of 9000 worlds ... Could he really still be called a rank six venerable sovereign?Li Hao smiled again.It was interesting just thinking about it.With the appearance of the myriad worlds, he would use them as a Foundation to create a myriad world Dao net. Perhaps, this was his path to Grade 7, turning it into a myriad world Dao domain.Ordinary seventh rank venerable sovereigns only had a net formed from their DAOs.As for himself, he was the wall formed by the infinite worlds.In this way, he might be considered to have truly stepped into the advanced level. The road ahead became clear again.Not far away, the void was growing rapidly. Li Hao threw out some mantras and a large number of great Dao crystals to replenish the void and Lin Hongyu's energy.The two of them were growing up rapidly.As for the recovery of his memory, Li Hao had done it through Yuan Shuo ... He had been beaten up, but in fact, Li Hao had a better way now. He had experience.

But ...In the next moment, he appeared in the empty realm again. He grabbed the empty realm and beat it up. This was also a rare pleasure.As for Lin Hongyu ... Li Hao chuckled. He was too embarrassed to attack her, so he used the Dao induction technique to bring her memory back!……At this moment, the entire Silver Moon was improving.Another person had proven his Dao as a venerable sovereign.The Silver Moon martial masters who didn't vindicate their DAOs last time were quickly vindicating their DAOs.Jin gun, Yu Luosha, Wang Ming, Hao lianchuan, Thunderbolt kick, mountain splitting axe, Hong Qing, as well as the ancient Sage from Zhang family's ancient city on neo martial arts 'side, as well as Jiang Yingli, li shengzhang, who had long joined Yuanping martial arts university, were all vindicating their Dao!This time, everyone had no scruples.The first batch of Dao vindication cultivators had all vindicated Dao. Now, whoever vindicated Dao didn't count as snatching spots. Furthermore, there should be enough spots.20 spots! n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  ,m In the crowd, the young Dao Jian, who had always been low-key, also began to vindicate his Dao. His sword intent was abundant, similar to li daoheng 's. Because of li daoheng's influence, he didn't dare to vindicate his Dao on his own, in case he was targeted.Now that everyone had vindicated Dao, he also vindicated Dao.Hong Yitang's family was considered lucky. They had three venerable sovereigns and Hong Yitang, a rank five Dao master.Next, Liu Long's family, Liu Yan, was slightly more eye-catching. Although her aptitude was not very good, she had also started to vindicate her Dao with the continuous accumulation of her Dao accumulation.Their son, Liu Yin, had actually reached the ninth level of the Dao integration realm as well. However, he seemed to be still a distance away from Dao vindication. This new Silvermoon expert had given up on Dao vindication in the end. Even if he had succeeded, it would have been extremely difficult. Since he couldn't use his spear technique to achieve Dao vindication, he might as well wait.This time, some of Li Hao's close friends had the upper hand, too.Several members of the demon hunting team, including Wu Chao, Chen Jian, and Yun Yao, had all obtained an opportunity during this promotion. They had all stepped into the ranks of venerable sovereigns.They hadn't left the Silver Moon continent earlier and had only managed to catch up to Nan Quan and the others after 500 years. Although many of them had been at Dao integration stage eight or nine and had even reached a higher level than Nan Quan, they had been the first to vindicate their Dao in the end.The second time, with the help of tianfang world's countless Taoist connotation, this group of people barely entered the venerable sovereign level.In the future, it would probably be quite difficult to step into level four.As for people like Southern Fist, their chances of entering the 4th rank in the future were far higher than theirs.In addition to them, there was also the Empress Dowager shuiyun, the officiant Jiang Li of the Li Dynasty, and the princess of the great desolation dynasty, Yi. At this moment, they had all proven their Dao, but the Queen of the West and the king of the Li Dynasty were missing.At this moment, some people sighed in their hearts. These two had actually disappeared!Otherwise, with their foundations, they should have been in the first batch of Dao vindication even earlier than the others.Unfortunately, the two of them had disappeared.Now, even Jiang Li and the others had vindicated their DAOs. These two ... Might even be half-step sovereigns. He didn't know if it was a blessing or a curse. After all, Silver Moon and the others had to borrow a lot of external forces to vindicate their DAOs. If the two of them vindicated their DAOs, they would have to rely on themselves. ……In the crowd, there was a special person.Perhaps it was the few remaining, rare few of the older generation, or even those who should not have vindicated Dao, who were looking at Yuan Shuo at this moment.Old demon Yuan, who had once been the leader of the Silvermoon 36 heroes, was still at the peak of the ninth level of the Dao integration realm.Even Liu Long's son was about to vindicate Dao!He, on the other hand, had already reached the same level as Liu Yin.There was even a new batch of people who were trying to catch up to him. In terms of age and seniority, Yuan Shuo was the oldest among them, and he was also Li Hao's master. At this moment, many people were also confused.Why had Yuan Shuo not vindicated Dao?He didn't vindicate Dao last time, but this time he didn't vindicate Dao.20 spots were a lot ... But not many. Jiang Li and the others had all completed their Dao vindication, so the spots were almost full.There was one last spot left ...At this moment, something unexpected happened.One of the guys who had been silent suddenly shouted,""Lord Marquis is unparalleled. Number one in the chaos. Believe in Lord Marquis and become a venerable sovereign!"“……”Even Li Hao was surprised.An extremely fanatical belief appeared!In the great Dao River, above The Phantom Dao River, a great Dao appeared and grew rapidly.Li Hao turned his head and was a little stunned.The master of void Dao, li Wuliang, was also dumbfounded.There was someone ... Who was better at shooting than him?Celestial pole, Huai King, and the others were all shocked. They all looked at the young man and saw that he was smiling obsequiously. He didn't look like a venerable sovereign at all. He looked humble and wretched.In the distance, hou Xiaochen couldn't help but take a few more glances.Hu Qingfeng!He was a sunrise-level expert who only knew how to suck up to others. He was also considered a genius among the night watchers, second only to Dao Jian and the others. When he went to Silver Moon to cause trouble, he was almost killed by hou Xiaochen.But now, only Dao sword had been proven, while big eyes, long saber, and fierce spear had not. Even Li Hao's junior brothers and sisters, Hu Hao and Li Meng, had not been proven, but this person had won the first place in a very special way!

Chapter 3114 Harvest (3)
In front of many people's incredulous eyes, he had actually ... Vindicated his Dao!He was the guy who had almost been killed by Li Hao's group.In the headquarters of the inspection Division, Chen Zhongtian had proven his Dao. Even his son, Chen Yao, and the Minister had not proven their Dao yet, but Hu Qingfeng had!Qian Wuliang couldn't believe it. "What ... Dao is this?"As the master of Phantom Dao, he could sense it. At this moment, he sensed it ... And was dumbfounded. There were ... All sorts of DAOs in the world. This Hu Qingfeng's main Dao ... He didn't know how to describe it. He only felt fanaticism, humility, flattery, and flattery. It was a Dao similar to faith, and the faith was Li Hao 's!Qian Wuliang was speechless.'F * ck, I've learned something new!This works too?Li Hao was also stunned. This works?There were too many great DAOs in this world, and they were too strange. Even Hu Qingfeng could vindicate Dao?To be honest, he had thought of many people for the last person. Hu Hao, Li Meng, Chen Yao, the big eyes, frenzied sword, Changdao ... A group of people. All of them were possible, although they all seemed to be lacking.'But ... No matter what, it's not your turn, is it?''Even a group of monster plants from neo martial arts, some regimental commanders in the heaven battling Army, and a group of students from Yuanping martial arts university ... Are more reliable than you, Hu Qingfeng?'If it really doesn't work out, the new generation's Liu Yin also seems to have a higher chance than you, right?In the end ... You vindicated Dao?Even Li Hao couldn't help but laugh!He, who had been calm all this while, couldn't help but take the initiative to speak up. He looked into the distance and chuckled."Hu Qingfeng, you ... Interesting!" Hu Qingfeng was all smiles!He hurriedly shouted,"Marquis Wushuang!" It's all thanks to Lord Marquis's promotion. Believe in Lord Marquis, it's a piece of cake for you to become a venerable sovereign ..."King Huai glanced at the celestial pole. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  Heaven's Fate glanced at King Huai.At this moment, the two new martial arts venerable sovereigns who were good at sucking up, especially King Huai ... Were somewhat ashamed of their inferiority. Although his reputation was bad, it was not to the extent that even the great Dao had become a way of sucking up!King Huai still had some real ability.And this person ... Had refreshed everyone's bottom line. The entire branch of the great Dao was now rippling between heaven and earth, and even the great Dao looked a bit like Li Hao!è‰¹!Was he sucking up to her?Even the great Dao had become Li Hao's appearance!Li Hao was also a little helpless. At this moment, the void had just recovered to its peak. Hearing the shout, he couldn't help but be stunned. He looked in that direction ... And almost laughed out loud!Was this even possible?"What ... Is this?" His aura skyrocketed. Although he hadn't truly reached the seventh stage, Li Hao felt that he wasn't far from the sword venerable of that time. He could truly rival an existence at the seventh stage. Of course, he would lose in a one-on-one battle sooner or later.Li Hao helplessly shook his head, not knowing whether to laugh or cry."I don't know. I've never comprehended this Dao in Dao chess. I don't know if it's a new Dao, or perhaps even the master of tianfang has never comprehended it behind Dao chess. Because ... How could a true Overlord ... Comprehend this kind of Dao?"An Overlord wouldn't be able to sense this kind of Dao, right?If the master of Tian Fang were to obtain this Dao, would he be considered to have reached the perfection of 10000 Dao?He was a venerable sovereign after all!Even if King Huai's great Dao was a little gloomy, it was definitely not this kind of open and aboveboard. He was just short of telling the whole world that he was a venerable sovereign who had succeeded in proving his Dao by flattering!How do I use this Dao?Was there any power to speak of?Li Hao didn't know whether to laugh or cry. At this moment, Lin Hongyu, who had transformed into clothes, couldn't help but look over and chuckled."Hu Qingfeng ... I haven't really met him before, but every time he sees me, Yuan Shi, and hou bi, he's always so enthusiastic that I can't help but feel overwhelmed!"The kind that really couldn't be blocked!He would madly kiss the ass of anyone he saw, the kind that would make your scalp go numb."He wasn't like this in the beginning ..."At this moment, Li Hao recalled. Although it had not been many years, he still sighed."At that time, he was representing the night patrolmen headquarters. He was acting like a tyrant in Silver Moon province and was almost killed by us! Later, hou Busha wanted him to go to the night patrolmen's headquarters as a vanguar...This guy was tactful, but I almost forgot about him. I didn't expect this!"Although 20 slots were a lot, and Li Hao felt that it was not a loss for others to vindicate Dao, he felt that it was a loss for this guy.Was this considered a waste of a spot?After saying a few words, he suddenly laughed and said,"forget it, that's good!" Hong Yu, you've also entered the 3rd rank, congratulations!"Lin Hongyu had also put aside Hu Qingfeng's matter. She laughed and nodded."Rank 3 ...""According to my current age, I should be ... 18 years old in this life!"Li Hao was dazed for a moment before he burst into laughter.You really think you're 18 years old!Lin Hongyu, on the other hand, did not care. She still could not forget what Li Hao had said that day."You're thirty years old, ten years older than me. You're a little old!"Old?Li Hao was probably the only person who had ever said this in his life.Someone actually thought she was old?It was simply unbelievable!If he was old, then what was that old witch Yi?Hong Qing was now more than 500 years old. What was he?Aren't they all old demons?Kong Ji was a little puzzled. In his eyes, all of the Silvermoon people, except for the neo martial artists, were young. Why did he care about their age?

Even for him, not counting now, just in the past, 1000 years old was already extremely young!Was there a need to mention age?Women were really unpredictable!Kong Ji didn't care about this. He looked at Li Hao and said regretfully, "I'm sorry. This time, the heaven's side quest was originally prepared for you and silver Moon. In the end, it was mainly for me, and you ended up with nothing!"At this moment, he was only one step away from rank seven, just like the sword Saint.If he devoured a Grade 7 world, he would definitely reach Grade 7!Li Hao, on the other hand, seemed to have gained nothing and even wasted a lifetime. In his fourth lifetime, he was still at the fifth step.From this point of view, he had been a little selfish when he had encouraged others to help Li Hao obtain the heaven's path. The others were all serving him.More importantly, even the energy for this advancement had been provided by Li Hao.As for Silver Moon and the others 'improvements, they were all from Li Hao's own reserves. Instead, he had invested all his gains from seizing the four major worlds. It was as if Li Hao had gained nothing from conquering the four major worlds.This time, everyone had earned big! n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  From the four Grade 7s to Silver Moon and the others, they had all profited greatly.Only Li Hao ...Li Hao shook his head and smiled."No, I've gained a lot from your destruction and revival of tianfang. Tianfang's Dao has been comprehended in daoqi to begin with. Today, a new world has been born. For me, it's also an opportunity to comprehend the Dao and study it. I've condensed many small worlds."What was the use of that?He didn't get any energy to recharge!Kong Ji still felt embarrassed, but Li Hao chuckled.""Alright, brother Kong Ji, why are you so wishy-washy today?""No...""Then we'll stop here!"Li Hao didn't say anything else. He shouted,""Everyone has just advanced, or have other gains. At this moment, return to the Silvermoon world! Stabilize the realm, stabilize the universe of the great path, and stabilize the river of the great path!""As for the others who haven't advanced ... They'll first Polish their foundations and wait for an opportunity. It'll be difficult for Silver Moon to reach the seventh step, but it won't be difficult for him to reach the sixth step! "As long as everyone works together, more than 50 venerable sovereigns will absorb Primal Chaos energy and fill the great Dao universe. This might be the medium-sized world with the most venerable sovereigns. I, Silvermoon, will be able to step into level six very soon!""Once Silver Moon advances to a Tier 6 world, we'll have at least 20 more venerable sovereigns, or even more ... Everyone will have a chance!"Some of the people who didn't advance to venerable sovereign felt a little regretful.However, at this moment, he felt at ease.Silver Moon had advanced too quickly. From level three to level four, level five ... In the blink of an eye, 50 venerable sovereigns had been born. It was simply unbelievable. Since Li Hao had said so, everyone naturally believed him!……At this time, the four seventh rank venerable sovereigns also projected their images."Light Thearch is still outside ... Kong Ji, do you want to go out and meet him?" venerable the sword asked.Kong Ji took a deep breath and thought for a while,"Forget it. I haven't entered the seventh level today. Senior revered sword artist, please tell my father ... To go back first! I'm fine now and I don't want to have too much to do with Guangming ..."It wasn't that he didn't want to acknowledge her, but ... If they met, whether it was his father or himself, there might be some problems with their standpoint.New martial arts was a big problem, but he and Li Hao were good friends. He couldn't stand on Guangming's side and see new martial arts as a big enemy.Right now, he was only at the sixth step and didn't have much say.In front of his father, he was still a child.Only when he reached the seventh rank, the third level of the six paths venerable sovereign, would he be second only to his father, even in the divine light plane. Only then would he truly have the right to speak.Even his father had to respect a rank seven venerable sovereign with three extremes of six paths!Li Hao laughed,'why don't you tell him yourself? Isn't it good to be able to meet your father and have a chat?"Kong Ji was stunned. He glanced at Li Hao for a long time before shaking his head. "I've seen too much, it's also annoying!"Li Hao's parents seemed to have died early.However, Li Hao was skilled in the way of time and life and death. Why didn't he choose to resurrect his parents?He was slightly puzzled.Of course, he didn't know that Li Hao's parents were ordinary people who didn't even have a Dao Meridian Star. It wasn't impossible for them to be resurrected. By reversing time, intercepting the past and projecting it into reality, they could naturally be resurrected, just like two cats.But ... Li Hao couldn't do that at the moment.Furthermore, even second cat had yet to truly appear in the real world.It would have been easy to create a pair of parents, but this was not the result Li Hao wanted. He wanted to cut out the past directly, just like Zhan Tiandi. Of course, it might not be exactly what he wanted.However ... It was better than making it up out of thin air.Seeing that he was unwilling to meet him, Li Hao smiled and said nothing more. He looked at venerable the sword and said,""Then, I'll have to trouble uncle li to help me pass a message ... Whether it's me or loneliness, I don't represent neo martial, and loneliness doesn't represent light! It's just a pure friendship. Whether light chooses to be an enemy of neo martial, unite with other tier 8 worlds to encircle and suppress neo martial, or unite with neo martial ... It has nothing to do with us!"Venerable the sword was speechless and didn't know whether to laugh or cry. "I'm a new Martial Emperor!"This guy, saying this in front of me ... Fortunately, I'm not old Zhang. Otherwise, he would have dragged Guangming in.

3116 Chapter 509
Of course, since he wasn't a Supreme martial artist, he didn't feel much. He smiled and said,""Alright, I'll pass on the message!"……Outside the realm.When venerable the sword conveyed his son's and Li Hao's words, the light Thearch was silent for a while.Her son said that they would not meet for the time being.The Silver Moon King had said,"your choice of position has nothing to do with them. Even if you go against neo martial, it will not involve loneliness ..."How should he choose?Neo martial was bound to be the source of turmoil.As a Lord of the eighth step, who didn't have the heart to fight for hegemony?If the neo martial really entered the eighth rank, who could match them under the Joint Forces of the human king and emperor Cang?The light ... Where would it go?Should he join forces with the red moon, cloud sky, and red sun families to encircle and suppress neo martial, or ... Should he really join forces with neo martial? with Ren Wang's character and brightness, he could only be second in the end if he won.At his level, how could he be willing to be someone's concubine?He was very complicated! If his son had simply made a few friends, it would not have affected his decision at all, but ... The people his son had made friends with included the revered Sword Master of neo martial, and the Silver Moon King, who was only at Tier 5 but was not someone to be underestimated.There was Wu Shan who had left the clouds, and Sen LAN who had advanced to the seventh step ...Son, the person he befriended was not an ordinary person.Instead, it was a group of geniuses who could influence the entire situation of the chaos in the future."I know."After a long time, he looked at venerable the sword."I am me, and the sacred central crypt is the sacred central crypt ... Since venerable the sword knows him and has made friends with him ... If I, Guangming, really stand against the neo martial artists, I hope ... He won't be involved!"Venerable the sword frowned and said,""Of course! "Let's not talk about anything else. When Li Zhu and I advanced to the seventh rank, Kong Ji was also involved. As a neo martial artist, we ... Still have morality to our friends! "If you and I are enemies on the battlefield ... No matter if you win, light, or I, neo martial, win, I can even represent the human King and tell you here that as long as Kong Ji doesn't take the initiative to deal with neo martial, we, neo martial, will never point our swords at Kong Ji!"The light Thearch laughed."You're the mentor of the human ruler. You're also a top-tier existence among the rank seven venerable sovereigns. Of course, I trust you!" I also hope ... That we can live in peace with new martial. I hope ... That there will not be a day when we meet on the battlefield!"After saying that, he stepped into the void and entered the great path universe. The brilliant sun Thearch quickly followed him and the two of them disappeared together.At this moment, the light Thearch's back was facing the sword. He had mixed feelings.Neo martial ... Was too big a threat!Am I willing to yield?The human King is too overbearing. I don't want to be his underling, but should I let that incomparably arrogant human King be my underling?As for splitting heaven and earth in two ... He had to ask new martial if it could agree. At this moment, he disappeared from everyone's sight with extremely complicated emotions.……At the same time.The news also started to spread.Kong Ji had not advanced to rank 7. This made many people feel at ease. They smiled. This was good!If Kong Ji reached Level Seven ... Tian Fang would have five Level Seven venerable sovereigns.As for the radiant sovereign, he had left the Outlander domain as well, and had not come into contact with the void. This was a good thing.This meant that the Lord of Light might not really be standing with neo martial.Otherwise ... He would have entered the heaven, but he didn 't.The other party had always been waiting outside Tian Fang.……On this day, the name of Silver Moon King Li Hao began to spread in the chaos.This was because, according to the observations of some powerhouses today, this Tier 5 silver Moon King seemed to ... Have more than a simple subordinate relationship with neo martial. The relationship between light and neo martial came from his friendship with loneliness.The neo martial Swordmaster and the others were not the ones in charge of this place. The one in charge was the Silver Moon King, who had been ignored by everyone. This was truly shocking!For example, forest orchid master, venerable Wushan, and the others had only come into contact with new martial because of the Silver Moon King's favor.It was even more surprising!A mere venerable sovereign from a small world ... Well, they now knew that Silver Moon actually had a universe of the great path, but even so, it was just a newly born world. In such a weak world, this Silver Moon King was not weak, but it would not be easy to make friends with a group of Level Seven experts, right?……In the cloud world.In the huge Hall, there were only four venerable sovereigns, two at the eighth rank and two at the seventh rank.They were also discussing Li Hao.Cloud Master was a little curious,'this Silver Moon King isn't weak, and his Dao seems to be similar to Supreme sword's 10000 DAOs return to one! Of course, I'm more curious about one thing. Does neo martial not have any control over it? A large amount of resources were wasted on a bunch of weak Silvermoon people. He even handed over the control of tianfang universe ... Brother Red Moon, do you think you can do something about this?" n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  "Previously, conquering the four great cosmoses should have satisfied the cultivation of venerable sword, the catacombs King, the Senlan sector Lord, and Wushan. This time, the Nirvana square is to satisfy the cultivation of the sacred central crypt. There are some gains for the new martial arts ... But the human King's appetite is big. Is this enough?"He looked at Red Moon master. Red Moon master raised her eyebrows slightly."Brother Yunxiao ... Are you trying to drive a wedge between them? Silvermoon is weak, so what's the point of trying to sow discord?""You can't say that!"Supreme Emperor Yunxiao laughed,'the other party is on good terms with the sacred central crypt. If the sacred central crypt really enters Level Seven, it will have a say in the world of light! In addition, Senlan and Wushan are both overlords. If silver Moon can really pull them into a camp ... At the very least, it can weaken the power of the new martial artists!"

"Otherwise, as far as I know, the human King, Emperor Cang, sun god, martial King, sword venerable, catacombs King, and even the blood Emperor and the king of earth all have the hope of reaching Level Seven when they seized the scorching sun World! If that's the case, neo martial will be too difficult to deal with!"If there were the five high level venerable sovereigns from the world of light, if Kong Ji had also advanced, then there was the traitor Wu Shan and the master of forest orchid ...That would be too troublesome!Red Moon master nodded slightly."I know. However, neo martial and silver Moon are deeply connected. Human King must have met each other before and tacitly agreed that the other party occupied the sky. It's obvious that both sides have some tacit understanding! It won't be easy to drive a wedge between them. ""Then let's kill the Silver Moon King!"At that moment, the Lord of the clouds spoke,"he is the key to contacting both sides! After killing the Silver Moon King ... Wu Shan and the others might lose contact with new martial! "Without this relationship, the radiance Supreme Emperor will also make the right choice. At this moment, because of the relationship between the sacred central crypt and Li Hao, there are signs of a Union between the radiance Supreme Emperor and new martial arts. This is not a good thing for us!""I have an idea," he said."I wonder if brother Hongyue would like to hear it?""Just say it.""I want ... Brother Red Moon to go to the Scarlet sun region and join forces with venerable Imperial master Scarlet sun and the others to encircle and annihilate new martial. We'll put pressure on new martial so that venerable sword and the catacombs King will retreat from Tian Fang. I'll contact some people to attack Tian Fang and kill Li Hao!"Red Moon frowned.I'm going to encircle and annihilate neo martial?Of course, if they joined forces with Chi Yang, it was not impossible. The key was ... He said,""The Dragon Master hasn't expressed his stance. The disaster of neo martial isn't just one family's disaster. Even with me, the hope of encircling and annihilating neo martial in chiyang is not great. But if the Dragon Master and the others are added ..." n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  His eyes turned sharp and he sneered,"Dragon Master is a giant Beast of Chaos. He can also shift worlds. Although he may not be comparable to Emperor Cang, he has the geographical advantage!" At that time, we can bring the world to battle. Neo martial will definitely not be able to escape death!"Today's neo martial was very difficult to deal with because no matter where it was, the other party would be fighting on their home ground.In the entire chaos, only chaos beasts had such an ability, and only a high-rank Chaos Beast Emperor could do it. The key was that it was not that easy to drive the world, but Emperor Cang did it extremely easily!However, if a type 8 Dragon Lord brought the dragon world to the battlefield, the type 8 world would be their home ground. At that time, fighting would be much easier.Then, he added, I'll go to the Dragon field in person, and I still need to reach some agreement with these chaos beasts! As for the Silver Moon King ... With brother Yunxiao here, it wouldn't be difficult to kill them once they left! The key is still the light ... If the light Thearch doesn't interfere, Senlan and Wushan are nothing!"Supreme Emperor Yunxiao nodded."That's right. The key now is the sacred central crypt. I'll have a talk with the light. The sacred central crypt is only a member of the light. Does the light really want to drag the whole world into the abyss?"Speaking of this, his eyes turned cold."Neo martial is nowhere to be found, but ... Light is standing in the same place. He, light, is not an eighth-rank Chaos Beast!" If Guangming is stubborn, then we can put neo martial aside first and get rid of Guangming, this shit stirrer ... First!"Every time, it was the light Thearch who was involved, causing everyone to be wary. After all, the light world was not weak.If this continued, everyone would be in a very passive position.It didn't matter if he couldn't find a new martial artist ... It would be the same if he removed the unstable factor of light first. Red Moon master smiled and nodded.He also agreed with this point. At this moment, he smiled and said,""I also hope that the families of the four-square region can unite and fight against the outside world together! Whether it's new martial, Silver Moon, or Wushan ... These guys are either the root of the new rise or traitors to the world. They all deserve to be killed!"Supreme Emperor Yunxiao nodded slightly.Wushan ... He had always wanted to kill him.To him, being alive was also a form of torture. Every time he saw Wu Shan, he felt very uncomfortable and always felt that it was a source of disaster.The two seventh rank venerable sovereigns beside him did not say anything.They also had a friendship with Wu Shan.However, the current Wu Shan had already completely broken away from cloudsky and even killed Deepsea ... To cloudsky, the turmoil caused by Wu Shan was too great. Perhaps ... The next time they met would be the time to kill Wu Shan.……On this day, all parties were discussing.As for tianfang world, Silvermoon's experts had already returned to Silvermoon.The vast tianfang was filled with birds chirping and the fragrance of flowers. The world had been reborn, but there was no one left.The places of Taoist connotation in the past had been consumed at this moment, and there were no more places of Taoist connotation for people to comprehend opportunities.At this moment, Li Hao was also about to leave.The illusionary figure of the chess piece appeared again and said with a sigh,""Then I'll enter the Dao universe again. It'll be hard for them to find me ... Besides, I'm not weak! But ... Are you sure that this time, you're not going to seal the Silver Moon, but rather take it away?"Li Hao had decided to take Silver Moon away this time! This was a little unexpected.Li Hao nodded and said,"take him away!" Silver Moon is already a rank five world with dozens of venerable sovereigns. If we Seal Silver Moon now ..."Li Hao smiled bitterly."Let's not talk about whether I can do it or not. Even if I can seal off a Tier 5 world, a large number of powerhouses have appeared in Silver Moon. I ... Really can't afford to raise them!"He had wanted to seal off Silver Moon before, but now, he could forget about it.Let's not talk about whether he can shut himself off. Even if he can, hundreds of years will pass in an instant. I can't afford to support so many people even if I sell myself!

3118 Chapter 509
There were both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage was that with so many venerable sovereigns around, even if they encountered a sixth-rank, they could still kill each other if they swarmed together.The disadvantage was ... If he brought Silver Moon along, the Black Panther would not be able to hide so easily. Its abilities were not as strong as Emperor Cang 's, and even though it had already stepped into the fifth step, it would still be difficult for it to bring Silver Moon around.The speed would not be too fast.The Dao chess shadow nodded."Then ... I can only say that you have to be careful. Also, I promised Kong Ji last time that I could teleport you back. He didn't use this condition ... I left a mark in your Dao River last time. You can ... Teleport back at any time! I have enough energy this time!"After absorbing countless great Dao crystals, the chess piece had recovered a lot. Previously, it would be difficult to teleport experts who were too strong, but now it could."Many thanks, senior!""No, I should be the one thanking you!"The Dao chess Phantom sighed."If it weren't for your help, I would've wanted to recover. Billions of great Dao crystals ... Let's not talk about whether they can take them out. Even if they can, perhaps ... Their goal is to refine me! Li Hao, have you never thought about refining me? Before this, I was actually quite weak ... Your previous strength was enough to suppress me. "It was a ninth-rank sovereign weapon after all. But before this, Li Hao's people were all strong, and no one had thought of forcibly refining Dao chess or an eighth-rank great world. To be honest, Dao chess itself was depressed.I ... Am I being despised?Now, his strength was not weak. He had the power of the seventh step, but before, he was at most at the sixth step.This group of people could easily suppress him.Li Hao laughed,"is there a difference?" Moreover ... The chess pieces are not offensive weapons, but auxiliary ones. Senior has also gained intelligence and is not much different from ordinary cultivators. Refining senior ... Also needs to be raised, and selflessly raised. Now, we can consider it a deal, and with a little friendship, isn't it better?"If you get the go piece, don't you have to keep it?The chess figure was still a little puzzled."But at that time, I completely belonged to you. Even if you wanted me to self-destruct, I would have done so. But now ..."Li Hao laughed again,'it's time for you to self-destruct, senior. Under such circumstances, it'll be difficult to turn the tables! It's the same. If senior is looking forward to finding a master, I think brother kongji is quite suitable. When he has no hope of advancing, senior can join forces with him and try to become one with the weapon ..."The chess figure smiled but didn't say anything. He was still very regretful.Were time cultivators ... That proud?Really, he had already made it clear that if you wanted to take me away, I would actually ... Agree.In the end, Li Hao rejected her again and again.F * ck!It's a ninth-grade sovereign weapon, I've offered to go with you, but you don't even want it?The Dao chess Phantom was also a shameless Artifact Spirit!,m At this time, he couldn't force his way up, right?He could only smile."Then I look forward to the day we meet again. The day the universe recovers. I believe that you will return ... At that time, it might be even more lively!""Now, the Dao stars have been taken away and nurtured by the various great worlds. They will definitely recover to their peak very soon. When that time comes, if we can return to tianfang, tianfang ... Might officially recover!"Dao Qi looked at Li Hao. Is this your goal? Now, all the families must be nurturing their Dao stars. They were actually clear that the Dao stars had returned, and tianfang universe might officially recover!But who wouldn't be happy?If it didn't recover, then what was the use of keeping the stars of the great path?Li Hao smiled."It should be. It's not difficult for a universe to raise one star ... But it's too difficult to raise all of them!" After all, they're all high-level venerable sovereigns 'great Dao stars. I can't afford to raise them!"After saying that, he waved his hand."Goodbye, senior. You can enter tianfang universe now. I will temporarily seal the universe ..."Damn, so urgent!Dao Qi was speechless, wishing that I would disappear immediately.Bastard!He didn't say anything else and felt a little regretful. However, he still floated up into the air and left with a message,""The master of Tian Fang ... Might be able to spy on Tian Fang!"As soon as he said this, the other party had completely disappeared.Li Hao raised his eyebrows slightly and smiled, but didn't say anything. He had already guessed it. However, it was interesting that Dao Qi had taken the initiative to tell him.Looking out of Tian Fang's direction, Li Hao let out a breath. 'I should go now that no one is paying attention.'If we don't leave now, someone might come and attack us!He looked at venerable the sword, Li Zhu and the others in the distance. This time, they might have to part ways. He would leave first, and the level Seven experts would follow. Everyone's eyes were focused on the level Seven experts. It would be much easier for them to leave.He looked at Kong Ji again ... This time, perhaps only Kong Ji would leave with him.On the day this fellow reaches tier 7, he should also get lost as soon as possible!Kong Ji sensed something and turned to look at Li Hao.""Where to?"The new martial arts were in the chiyang region, the Redmoon region was almost crippled, and the tianfang region was extremely dangerous ..."To the Dragon field!"Li Hao sent a voice transmission,"we'll fight whoever fights neo martial!" "If you want to fight new martial arts, the Dragon field might participate ... Even bring the world to participate. At the same time, I'll experience the Dao of the Chaos Beast. I haven't seen much of the seventh-rank Chaos Beast DAO ... I'll go and broaden my horizons." n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  He had seen many DAOs of humans, but he had not seen many of the DAOs of these chaos beasts.Perhaps, there would be some gains.As for Black Panther, he was also a Chaos Beast. He was not too conspicuous when he went there, as there were chaos beasts everywhere.Otherwise, it would be too eye-catching to see a fifth-tier Chaos Beast running around here. It was rare to see one in other places except the Dragon field.Kong Ji nodded. He didn't really care. He could go anywhere, as long as he didn't fight light.

Chapter 3119 Parting (1)
Tian Fang.Li Hao was going to take Silver Moon with him this time. The four seventh rank venerable sovereigns would not leave immediately. They would stay here to provide cover for Li Hao and the others before they left.……East realm gate.The Dragon field was in the East.Li Hao didn't know much about the Dragon field, but he did have a map. Venerable the sword and Li Zhu didn't know much about it either, as new martial arts had only risen recently.At this moment, it was the Senlan realm Lord who had lived for many years. He was a veteran rank 6 venerable sovereign and had some understanding of the Dragon field."There are two major forces in the Dragon field. Second, the demon race!"He looked at Li Hao and gave a simple explanation.""Chaos beasts and demons are different, did you know that?"The demon race was the demon race, and the beasts of primordial chaos were the beasts of primordial chaos.The demon race was considered a mutation that occurred after the chaos beasts entered the world, or an animal that was born in the world.Li Hao looked at Sen LAN. Sector Lord Sen LAN continued: "The biggest difference between the two is that chaos beasts can store worlds in their storage, while chaos behemoths almost all have an innate ability to devour worlds!"He looked at the Black Panther: "the black leopard realm Lord shouldn't have been a Chaos Beast. Of course, he should be considered a descendant of the Chaos Beast ... His ancestor is said to be the new martial's Supreme Emperor Tian Gou. Tian Gou ... Could be the same as Emperor Cang, a type of Chaos Beast."Li Hao was puzzled."That's also a Chaos Beast that has entered a world. It should be considered a demon, right?""Apart from this, there is another difference between the demon race and chaos beasts ... The Dao laws!"Sector Lord Sen LAN didn't say much. He wasn't in a good position to distinguish between the heavenly dog, Azure Emperor and the others. He explained once more,"Chaos beasts, even if they reach the seventh or eighth level, are usually dominated by the Dao of chaos ..."Li Hao was stunned for a moment. The Tao of chaos as the master?"The chaos Dao...That's not something that can be used to enter the great Dao universe!"Sector Lord Sen LAN nodded,"that's true. However, these Level 7 and level 8 beasts are all a little different. Let me put it this way. In the Dragon field, all the worlds occupied by the chaos beasts were all seized!"Li Hao frowned.Seized?  p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Chaos beasts don't cultivate the Dao of a world, so they're born in chaos. They can't merge with the great Dao universe and can only grow outside the chaos. When they reach a certain level, they'll seize a great world! Or, they can live in the great Dao universe or the world and pretend to be a demon ... In short, chaos beasts can't give birth to a great Dao universe on their own. They can only snatch!""As for the demons, they can integrate into the world and grow with the world, giving birth to their own great Dao universe ... Therefore, the world that the demons live in could be created by themselves."This was the biggest difference between the two. Chaos beasts did not have the ability to give birth to a great Dao universe. They could only give birth to similar Dao domains like Swordmaster and not a great Dao universe.Li Hao understood this time and frowned.""Senior, are you saying that in the Dragon field, the worlds dominated by Beasts of Chaos were all born by others ... This means that the Beasts of Chaos are very powerful. Otherwise, how could they have taken over an entire universe?""Right!"Sector Lord Sen LAN nodded,"they were born and raised in the primal Chaos. To us, the Dao of chaos is very chaotic. But to them, they are used to it. It has been like this for many generations. On the other hand, the Dao of chaos is extremely strong. When battling against those of the same cultivation level, most Primal Chaos beasts are stronger!""If they can reach Level Seven ... You've seen venerable the sword. They have their own Dao domain and are actually very powerful. If we don't have the advantage of being native and don't have a world, we are generally not their match.""It's the same for chaos beasts. Once a level Seven master leaves their native world and encounters them in chaos, they're often unrivaled ... This way, it's easy for them to kill them, deprive the world, and let them occupy it!" Li Hao frowned."I don't know much about the Dragon field," sector Lord Sen LAN continued."I'm not too sure how many worlds there are in the Dragon field. However, there are quite a number of them. A large number of monsters and chaos beasts are gathered there. Over there, the dragon world is occupied by the dragon clan. It's the most powerful type 8 world!""However, there's also a relatively strong great world over there. It's at the peak of the seventh rank. Moreover, there's more than one seventh rank venerable sovereign. It's said that there are three to four seventh rank venerable sovereigns. It's considered a quasi-eighth rank world controlled by the demon race!"Sector Lord Sen LAN thought about it,"it should be called the iron-eating world, it's a group of iron-eating beasts that are native to the demon race, they're quite strong!" There are also some disputes with the Dragon race ... Chaos beasts are usually seizing worlds, while native demons are more concerned about the strength of the world itself ..."Iron-eating race?Li Hao was stunned. He glanced at venerable the sword.A Panda?There was no such creature in Silvermoon world, but he had traveled to neo martial and it seemed like there was such a creature in neo martial.Venerable the sword saw Li Hao looking at him and smiled.""It might not be a Panda. Don't think too much. Chaos is too big. There are all kinds of creatures."Okay.The forest orchid continued,"the Dragon region isn't too peaceful. The local demons and the foreign chaos beasts had frequent battles in the early years. After that, the Dragon Lord stepped into the 8th stage and suppressed the local demons. Both sides maintained a temporary state of balance.""Over there ... There are actually worlds occupied by humans, but ... They are usually very low-key and don't even show themselves. Once a world dominated by humans appears, it's very easy for it to be devoured by chaos beasts!"
