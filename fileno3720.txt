With Shi Guang as the bait.Who could refuse?At the very least, chaos would not do.Perhaps chaos could still refuse, but when the time that these level nines were after was right in front of him, and he was just one step away from controlling time ... Chaos knew that Li Hao was using him, but he accepted it.He picked it up! Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  This was an open scheme.This was also what Li Hao was best at. An open scheme that you couldn't resist. He had used conspiracies, but in the end, he would let people know that it was a trap, and you ... Had to step into it.Everyone present knew that this was Li Hao's plan.Fishing for chaos into the game!First, he recovered his chaotic spirit and battle strength. After that, he gathered time energy. No one would dare to let a tier 9 expert control time. They could control the new time King.However, once a veteran tier 9 expert controlled time, they understood each other too well.Everyone knew about all the plans against time, so all of them would be for naught. Chaos controlled time and had the ability to overturn the chessboard, but Li Hao did not.Huntian asked,'why don't you talk to me?'Why did Li Hao want to talk to him?Was he a ninth-rank?Huntian was very powerful, but that was only because he had not used his full power when he was at level 9. It did not mean that he could kill a level 9, nor did it mean that he was 100% sure that he could reach level 9.Since that's the case ... Why did I choose you?You have too many uncertain factors!Chaos, on the other hand, was a 100% certainty. A genuine rank nine venerable sovereign knew Tian Fang and the others very well. Similarly, Tian Fang and the others also knew chaos.If I don't choose such a person, why would I choose you?At that moment, the entire western border was in complete chaos. The aura of a large number of experts fluctuated. The grade 9 experts had not planned to descend at this moment. Their avatars were not strong, and if they were killed, it would be a huge loss for them.In addition, if too many of them descended, more of their spirituality would be extracted, and it would be even more difficult for their true bodies to descend.Therefore, they were not willing to descend at this moment unless they had no other choice.But now ... Who could tolerate this?In the distance.The chaos Emperor's aura burst out as he roared,""Since someone must master time, why can't it be me? Everyone, does my control of time necessarily mean that it will be disadvantageous to you?"Even now, he still wanted to struggle.Since everyone felt that Li Hao wasn't suitable, and Li Hao was given to me ... I'm the most suitable!Just give it to me!At this moment, everyone from Tian Fang was extremely cold. No matter who they gave it to, they would never give it to you."You're a Grade 9 with chaos as your core. It's your nature to create chaos, and that's just one of them. Now that order is starting to collapse and chaos is no longer restricted, it's the biggest threat.Then, you controlled time ... Do you still want to let everyone live? If you don't give us a way out, do you think we will let you succeed?Tian Fang's voice was cold."Chaos! Don't make a mistake. For something you can't get, you've gone astray. You've even destroyed the relationship that everyone has had for many years!""Cripple Shi Guang and let her return to Li Hao's body ... Otherwise, you won't be able to escape death today!"Tian Fang's clone instantly tore through the void.At this moment, his clone wasn't weak either. It instantly disappeared.The other rank-9 divine abilities were also unleashed. Although they were only avatars and were not as singular as chaos, they were all rank-9 avatars that controlled the great Dao.In addition, there were many people, so in an instant, the chaos was surrounded.In the void, lightning appeared.It was a calamity venerable sovereign.The five elements surrounded him like a cage. This was the five elements path master.The Yin Yang grinding disc appeared, obliterating the heavens and earth. That was the Yin Yang Thearch.Light and darkness flickered, day and night in an instant. That was the light and dark path master.……The level nine venerable sovereign avatars were all extremely cold.Chaos, you became an Emperor on your own and you weren't too strong. It wasn't easy to become a Grade 9, so why ask for more?As for the chaos Emperor, his mind was spinning with thoughts.He had thought of giving up!He wasn't someone who couldn't let go. Just like before, he could even give up the chaos Dao spirit and escape.However, at this moment, even though he knew that he had been tricked by Li Hao, he still chose to persist. He gritted his teeth, and a fierce light appeared in his eyes. 'I know that this is a trap. I'm the scapegoat, but I ... Am willing!' He thought.Only after entering the ninth rank would one understand that even at the ninth rank, if one was not at the top, one would still have no say.Only by becoming a time controller would he have a chance of suppressing Tian Fang and the others.He roared,"everyone has the right to be powerful!" You're just my clones, it's impossible for you to stop me! Today, I will control time. Even if I die in battle here, you won't have an easy time!"Go all out!"You're so stubborn!"p Tian Fang instantly disappeared. The next moment, a cold voice rang out,""He can't resist the temptation of time and has already lost his mind. Everyone, break his Dao and let him wake up!"A great battle instantly erupted.As for the chaos Emperor, he was the original body after all. Moreover, he had recovered a large amount of intelligence. Coupled with the collapse of order in this place, the chaos ruler was also extremely powerful at this time.Tian Fang's spatial travel was very difficult to break. If his true body was here, it would be impossible to break through the chaos.But now, a clone was just a clone.Last time, Li Hao's group found it difficult to break through, but that didn't mean that chaos was difficult to break through. With a punch, the space trembled and trembled. Tens of thousands of streaks filled the air, sealing all the space. With a crack, the space shattered. Tian Fang frowned and was forced to escape.A tier 9 was still a tier 9, and it was still different from those tier 8.

This time, he had descended in a hurry. In reality, he was not as strong as the previous clone, but now, he had no time to care about that!……On Li Hao's side.Huntian Supreme Emperor's eyes were bloodshot as he looked at the human King and Spring Autumn. "That's the Dao of time ... I can't let a rank nine take it! Do you still want to besiege me? Join forces and kill the chaos ..."F * ck, you still want to hit me?Fight, my ass!Let's seize the time Dao first.If it really didn't work ... As a last resort, they would ... Break through time and kill Li Hao. In any case, they couldn't let a tier 9 master time. If Li Hao did, it would be difficult for everyone to deal with him, let alone a tier 9 master.That would be too terrifying!Time wasn't something that just anyone could control. However, the master of time of this generation had actually passed down the Dao of time to chaos ... This was something that no one had expected.Are you sure you can get it back?If you can't get it back ... Then you'll be in big trouble.At this moment, the human King smiled brightly.""Tell your ninefold guards to back off. I'm not interested in killing you anymore. What do you think?"Huntian's eyes were cold and he didn't say anything.The human King ... Was unwilling to retreat.At this moment, Spring Autumn was also at a loss. He looked at Li Hao, then at huntian, and said after a long while,""He's so vicious ... But ... So brave. "She didn't know how to describe Li Hao.In fact, there were too many unexpected factors involved in the sky-opening at this moment.Tier 9, chaos heaven, chaos, dragon battle ...All of this was actually a variable.He could attack at any time!However, in the end, all the variables were thrown into the battlefield at this moment. The tier 9 divine Emperor had hurriedly sent a clone, and it would be difficult for his true body to send another. His spirituality was insufficient, and even if he did send another clone ... It might not be much stronger than the clone.At that time, he would probably not dare to descend!All the variables had become a part of the battle, and there were no more variables.A grade 8 cultivator used the way of time as bait and used such a unique method to pull everyone into this trap, the trap of opening the sky. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Li Hao ... Was really a madman!It was as if he had never placed his fate on the possibility of someone not helping him or someone helping him. Perhaps, at this moment, he and the human King had retreated from the battlefield, or perhaps ... Li Hao had a way to deal with it.No, even if he really backed out now, someone would stop huntian from killing Li Hao.Yes, there will be!He ... Always seemed to only rely on himself. In fact, he didn't even have any hope for the human King. He didn't place his hopes on them at all.At this moment, the human King also understood.Other than the day when Li Hao left Silver Moon and had to borrow some strength, he had always had his own plans. Without absolute confidence, he would rarely take risks. Whether it was today or in the past, he might not have failed without him or anyone else.Including the establishment of the battlefield of the heavens. If he had not stopped the tier 8s from the East on that day, would Li Hao have been confident in resolving the crisis brought about by Samsara? Perhaps ... There was.What a lonely fellow ... At this moment, the human King could tell that perhaps the only person this fellow trusted was actually ... His own master, who he had forced to die.Yes, it was only at this moment that he could see clearly.He would rather force his master to die because he believed that at this moment, only his master would be willing to die. He didn't seem to trust anyone else.At this moment, the human King felt some sympathy for him.Li Hao didn't seem to trust anyone.He had so many Silver Moon martial masters, and they were all fine. However, he didn't seem to have a deep relationship with them, nor did he trust them that much. Or rather, he believed that they were willing to die for him.As for his own neo martial art ... It wasn't just his own, but everyone's neo martial art.Only silver Moon was Li Hao's ... No, Silver Moon was Silver Moon. Li Hao was only Li Hao. He had always been alone, never staying behind.……BOOM!The dragon's tail pierced through the void. At this moment, Li Hao was extremely weak, and a fierce look appeared in long Zhan's eyes.He was afraid.Yes, he was afraid of Li Hao at this moment.He was afraid that Li Hao would recover again. He was afraid that Li Hao would really succeed in splitting open the sky. He was also afraid that after chaos died, time would return to Li Hao, and Li Hao would become an unkillable monster again.Perhaps, this was the only time he could kill this terrifying young man.He didn't want to kill Li Hao, but Li Hao made him more and more afraid.In fact, it had even left a mark in the depths of his heart.Li Hao ... Couldn't be matched.This person's combat strength might not be strong, but he was too willing, too vicious, too independent!He was willing to give up everything!He could even give up time ... Give up his master. On this point, long Zhan felt that there were still people who could do it. Giving up time, he felt that ... He could not do it himself.At this moment, behind them, the three Shadows were getting anxious. Someone roared,""You dare! Long Zhan, stop! If you dare to kill him, I'll exterminate your entire Primal Chaos race!"After killing Li Hao, chaos took complete control of time.Most importantly, he didn't dare to kill chaos so easily. At that time, he would have to consider whether chaos could continue his legacy after he died and had just gained control of time.Wait another million years?Time would definitely still exist.However, they had waited for a million years the last time. How many more million years could they wait?No more!

3722 Chapter 602
Another million years, even if they were tier 9, without sufficient spirituality to maintain, they would die of old age too.BOOM!Three auras burst out in an instant. The three ninth-order clones attacked long Zhan at the same time. The powerful aura swept across the world. The power that the three of them unleashed at this moment was only 7000 to 8000 rays, which was slightly weaker than long Zhan 's.But under the three people joining hands, their auras burst forth. Long Zhan also felt an endless danger.His dragon eyes were filled with anger and indignation!"My chaos race has yet to step out of the tier 9 realm, so no one can help him at this moment. However, any tier 9 chaos race member might be able to help him at this moment and reverse the situation!However, he did not."Get lost!"Long Zhan coiled his body and turned to fight back. He had wanted to kill Li Hao, but the threat of the three people was something he couldn't ignore.BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated through the heavens and earth. The three illusionary figures trembled slightly and took a step back. On long Zhan's Dragon Tail, there were also burn marks.The power that burst out from the three of them was enough to distinguish their identities.Since he cultivated the Dao of corrosion, he should be the legendary Dao master of the Dao of corrosion.One of them cultivated The Way of Shadows and hid in the void. He should be the path master of the dark sect. It was said that he had once fought with the path master of the light and dark sect. Of course, that was a legend from many years ago.One of them was cultivating the power of the hurricane. He should be a wind-elemental Dao master. The Dao of the hurricane was not considered strong among the other DAOs. However, there were very few people who cultivated it. It was considered a rather special system because it was difficult to get started. It was very difficult to comprehend the power of the hurricane.It wasn't like the five elements, which were easier to sense.Although the three rank-nine Dao Masters were only avatars, they were still extremely powerful. The Dao master of the decay path had a cold expression."Long Zhan, don't be stubborn! Li Hao can die, but not now. It's not easy for the chaos to survive. There's no need to ask for trouble!"Long Zhan's tone was also cold."He's a threat that's even greater than chaos. Are you all blind?" You really can't tell? "Everything today is within his calculations. We are all just his chess pieces. You all claim to control the world, but what about now? His battle prowess might not be unparalleled, but he can easily drag everyone into the battlefield. Do you still hope that he can bring you hope?"At this moment, he no longer had any hope for Li Hao ...Hope that Li Hao can resist a ninth-rank magical beast?Forget it!He was afraid that he would be completely killed by Li Hao before the level 9 demon beast arrived.Li Hao wouldn't say that he wouldn't kill you, let you go, or grant your wish just because he admired you.He wasn't that kind of person!Today, everyone stopped him from opening the sky and forced his master to die ... Although it was Li Hao's own scheme, it was obvious that Li Hao was prepared to fight to the death. Whoever stopped him would be his greatest enemy!He would definitely take revenge a thousand times over!He was like this, huntian was like this, and these tier 9 experts were all like this.Could Li Hao stay?Absolutely not!"Cough, cough, cough ..."On the other side, Li Hao continued to retreat. His laughter was somewhat ear-piercing."Long Zhan, I merely killed your Dao companion. Moreover, you have many Dao companions, it doesn't matter if you lack one. Why do you keep on being my enemy? I still respect you as a man ... In fact, if you don't look for trouble with me, I'm too lazy to look for trouble with you, and I'm not prepared to kill you ... Why bother?"These words were exceptionally ear-piercing in long Zhan's ears! Li Hao!He regretted it. He regretted that he should have chased after Li Hao and killed him when he had fled in all directions!He didn't say anything more. Even if three tier 9 experts stopped him, it wouldn't work! They were just clones, and there were only three of them ... It wasn't as if he didn't have a chance of killing them.In an instant, the chaos great Dao shook! Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  At this moment, a spirit seemed to have emerged in the surroundings. The silhouettes of ferocious beasts appeared one after another, as if a myriad of beasts had descended."Roar!"The howl shook the heavens and earth. In the distance, the cries of a Phoenix and a Dragon could be heard.The beasts roared!Long Zhan's combat strength seemed to have improved. A thick and huge rule power of the great path appeared above his head. As if it had a mind of its own, it turned into a giant dragon and charged straight at the three tier 9 experts.Not only that, but his main body actually didn't go. Instead ... He once again charged toward Li Hao.The three tier 9 experts were also furious."I told you to stop and you still insisted. Do you really think you're a tier 9?"The three of them attacked at the same time, and the great Dao boiled.Countless great DAOs were entangled together and crazily shattered.……At this moment, time had dissipated for Li Hao, and his body was severely injured. The only thing that appeared in front of him was the fake time star. The Holy prose that was meant to be used as the source of life had been scattered all over the West.At this moment, he was probably at his weakest.The shattering of the heavenly policy of order had also dealt a heavy blow to his spirit.Li Hao was too weak at the moment.It was precisely because long Zhan saw all of this that he insisted on killing Li Hao. This was the best opportunity.Seeing this, the three rank nine experts became anxious. The dark path master shouted,""Bastard, do you really want to annihilate your entire clan?"The three of them were also fighting with all their might.BOOM!Long Zhan's entire body trembled, and his great Dao collapsed. However, he gritted his huge teeth and persevered as he pounced towards Li Hao!Annihilate the entire clan?If he didn't kill Li Hao, he suspected that Li Hao would exterminate his clan before the ninth-rank came.Your threats are nothing!He wasn't afraid of their threats at all.If you have the ability, descend with your true bodies and exterminate my race. Otherwise ... It doesn't matter who comes here today.The dragon's tail was like a sharp blade as it attacked Li Hao, as if it wanted to nail Li Hao to death in the void.

Li Hao kept retreating. Without order, time, and a large number of divine text realms, he was very weak at the moment.He only retreated!His feet moved, and as if the void was changing, he barely avoided long Zhan's powerful attack. He looked at the three venerable sovereigns behind him, who were entangled in a frenzy, and sighed,""He's exhausted quite a bit. All three of you are at the ninth step. Even if you don't kill him, can't you stop him? Do you really want me to be killed by him and become the master of time chaos?"艹!The three of them were furious!If you didn't mess up time, you wouldn't be here!How strong could a clone that descended in a hurry be?Without sufficient preparation and spirituality, how could he fight against an expert with an extremely powerful fleshly body?F * ck!It's easier said than done!The three of them were extremely furious."We're not your slaves. We're only protecting you now in the hope that we can preserve time after killing the chaos. We don't really want you to live."The dark master said in a low voice, long Zhan, you can seriously injure him, but you must not kill him! If you kill him by force, you'll be forcing your ninth-rank true body to descend. Do you really think you can fight against a ninth-rank?"The three people were somewhat unable to stop long Zhan and had no choice but to threaten him again and again!Long Zhan turned a deaf ear!Li Hao, on the other hand, was still smiling. He said playfully,""Long Zhan is very strong. The Dao of the fleshy body is unparalleled in power! "However, the chaos race is almost entirely dependent on the chaos great Dao, which is why they are where they are today ... As a tier 9, guarding the depths of chaos, long Zhan can restrain you, and you can also restrain him ... If you really want to protect me, why don't you use your tier 9 true body to shake the chaos great Dao ...""Roar!"Long Zhan's roar reverberated through the heavens and earth! At this moment, he roared,"do you think everyone is a fool?" Shaking the chaos great Dao can hurt me, but it will also cut off any hope of them coming. Once the chaos great Dao is shaken, there will be no more threat after he splits open the sky. Your true bodies will not be able to descend, and with your avatars shattered, it will have nothing to do with this split open!"Yes, Li Hao's method worked.Both sides were injured!These ninth-grade true bodies were stirring up the chaos great Dao, causing the entire great Dao to go into complete chaos. Long Zhan was injured, and their true bodies would not be able to descend before the chaos ended.That also meant that ... He had completely given up on the idea of descending with his true body.How long would it take for the turmoil to subside?It might take a year or a month. It definitely wouldn't be that fast. It was impossible for him to recover in an instant.Li Hao suddenly vomited blood and couldn't move. After being hit, his entire body exploded again. At this moment, he was covered in wounds and was sent flying. His bones were broken, and a part of his flesh had been completely turned into powder.The incomparably weak Li Hao looked at long Zhan charging over again and said with some regret,""Everyone is wise. They know that I'm a great threat ... It seems like I'm going to die this time ..."Struggling, he looked in a direction and smiled.""Chaos ... All the best. When I die, you'll have complete control over time. It'll only take an instant ... And you ... Will help me take revenge!"In the distance, the chaos Emperor was fighting madly!When he heard those words, he couldn't help but curse in his heart!艹!Li Hao, you can die.Where did you get all that nonsense from? In the distance, Tian Fang's clone also sensed Li Hao's weakness. Li Hao's life was like a flame that could be extinguished at any moment. He knew that Li Hao was forcing everyone.But ...The master of tianfang was also a little angry,'Li Hao, you must have other tricks up your sleeve! Long Zhan won't kill you so easily. Don't use this to threaten everyone!"He actually used his own life to threaten everyone!Damn bastard!Li Hao's face was covered in blood. At this moment, he gave up struggling and sighed."What other methods do I have? I'm not the human King, and I can't just destroy the Silver Moon to strengthen myself ... If you don't want to save me, then forget it!"“……”BOOM!Long Zhan did not want him to continue talking. If he continued, there might still be an unforeseen event.The dragon's tail transformed into a huge sword and directly slashed at Li Hao's head!At this moment, the Lord of Tian Fang's clone looked at the three rank 9s and was unable to stop them. He cursed in his heart and was extremely furious.He felt that Li Hao might have other tricks up his sleeve.Of course, it was also possible that there really wasn't any.Everyone knew Li Hao's plan. If he let them shake the chaos great Dao and seriously injure long Zhan, it would also make it impossible for his tier 9 true body to descend again in a short time!An open scheme!This was a real plot. Everyone knew it. Be it his enemies or his own people, they all knew what Li Hao was thinking. It was just not written on their faces! Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Are you in turmoil?If there was no turbulence, I would have died.But ... He really had no other choice."Chaos great Dao!" Tian Fang master's clone roared."Stir the chaos great Dao!"F * ck, he was about to go crazy from anger!At this moment, the other level 9 existences were also aggrieved and helpless, but they could not let Li Hao die. In an instant, the chaos trembled. In the depths of the chaos, the true emperors 'great DAOs and spirituality emerged, stirring the entire chaos great Dao!A method that would cause both sides to suffer!Boom! Boom! Boom!At this moment, it was as if the great Dao of chaos was about to break. It was as if the world was about to split apart. The entire chaos seemed to be trembling.In the distance, all the beasts of primordial chaos suddenly let out painful roars.The great Dao of chaos was too closely related to chaos beasts.It also had too much to do with the ninth-rank!Their DAOs were all within the chaos great Dao.At this moment, the entire chaos great Dao trembled violently. While it hurt the chaos beasts, it also hurt the cultivators who had fused with the chaos great Dao, including Li Hao, the Queen, and of course, the core was still long Zhan!

He was the spirit of the chaos great Dao!This was also the key to why long Zhan was able to master so many great DAOs. It was actually very difficult for chaos beasts to learn DAOs other than the physical body Dao. Even if they did, it was very rare. Long Zhan, on the other hand, had truly mastered the power of nearly 8000 great DAOs.At this moment, long Zhan's body was trembling, and cracks appeared on his body. Just like the chaos great Dao, it was also splitting apart!Long Zhan roared in pain!His eyes revealed a touch of helplessness and grief!This was the human heart and human nature.He looked at Li Hao, who was not far away, with a hint of helplessness in his eyes. He knew that he ... Probably couldn't kill Li Hao. It was as if Li Hao had already calculated all this.He seemed to have prepared for everything.You want to kill me?That was impossible!It was because he always seemed as if he had more cards up his sleeve, making you feel that he was unfathomable. Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  Behind him, the three Shadows took advantage of this opportunity to beat long Zhan until he was bleeding all over. At this moment, Li Hao slowly stood up and recovered from his injuries, watching as if he was an outsider.The chaos great Dao was still shaking violently. In the distance, the shrill roars of chaos beasts could be heard.New martial and Silvermoon had seized the opportunity to kill the experts of the chaos race while the chaos great Dao was shaking.Long Zhan also sensed it.He might be able to withstand it, but the other cultivators of the chaos race could not. If this continued, the entire chaos race might really be exterminated today!At this moment, Li Hao's voice faintly echoed in his ears.""The current situation is unstable. If you die, the chaos race will no longer have a place to stand. Have you ever considered entering the false chaos to develop? Perhaps lying low is the best chance!""I'm still lacking in many areas when I split open the skies, especially my life force. Furthermore, I'm still lacking in the Dao of a powerful physical body to support the Foundation-laying Dao of a cultivator! The physical body Dao is not strong enough to support the development of the nomological Dao ...""In the pseudo-chaos, you have to start from scratch. Perhaps ... This is an opportunity for you, the chaos race. Of course, it might not be!""So many humans have risen up here. Long Zhan, even if you are extremely talented, so what? Could they turn the tables? It was impossible! Long Zhan, you are a hero, at least the hero of the chaos race ... But ... There is no hope! You know that there's no hope. You want to kill me, but ... Because you can't bear it, and you're not willing to bear failure ..."Li Hao finally revealed his true purpose.Killing long Zhan was not the goal.His goal had always been to split open the sky.However, splitting open the sky was too difficult.He needed someone to pay, such as long Zhan!He had to pay with his powerful fleshly body great Dao to support the entire pseudo-chaos, and he had to pay with his blood Qi, flesh, blood, energy, and life force ... It would be very difficult!How could an Overlord be willing to give up everything?He had completely fused an Overlord into the pseudo-chaos. Only in this way could the world he created have a possibility to develop into the future. Otherwise ... It would be very difficult to count on Li Hao alone.Today, all the people who had died in battle, their Dao, their flesh and blood, their everything, would become the nourishment of the entire new world!Li Hao smiled.My future little brother, how am I?"I'm worried that you won't be able to reach the point where I can see you. You're close to 5000 Dao laws, comparable to me right now. You're also on the Dao of laws and are very powerful. Unless I give you everything I have ... It might not be enough!Furthermore, he would not be the only one in the future. There would be other powerhouses.The Dao laws were not strong enough to be distributed.How could he forge a strong foundation for the future!Only today, when he had enough resources and capital, would he have a chance to develop the future as he had seen it.Long Zhan ignored him!Li Hao sent another voice transmission."Your subordinates are probably going to die, but ... You can rest assured. If I succeed in splitting open the sky, they'll die, and their spirits will fuse with the new Sky, just like my master!" "I may trick you, but I won't trick my master. Your spirits may lose their memories when they merge with the new Sky, but they won't lose their origin. In the future, when you walk out of the pseudo-chaos, perhaps you can return to your memories!""Everything will be Reborn! "Today, your Primal Chaos race will not stand a chance! "Enter the fake chaos. If you can build a good relationship with the future leader of chaos, perhaps ... Your totem plan can be realized! Of course, if you're lucky, your chaos race might even be able to lead the future ... Long Zhan, what do you think?"At this moment, long Zhan's physical body was shaking violently!He gritted his dragon teeth and did not make a sound!Delusional!He wants me to integrate into his new world. He actually wants me to ... Integrate into his new world willingly. How is that possible?p "Sigh ... If you hesitate any longer, it'll be too late. If you hesitate any longer ... You'll really have no more chances when you die. If you die, I might fail to split open the sky, but I won't die. Your chaos race will really be exterminated!"BOOM!A loud sound reverberated through the heavens and earth. In the distance, the figure of a Black Tiger appeared. Its roar reverberated in all directions. Hong long ... The black Tiger exploded. At this moment, the black Tiger was still roaring madly,"Dragon Lord ... Kill Li Hao ... Even if your clan is annihilated ... You must kill him!"The black Tiger had been killed.Long Zhan's heart trembled!The black Tiger was dead. His general had died at this moment when the great path was in turmoil.

A fire Phoenix soared through the sky.Feng Yan's body was also cracked at this moment. It appeared between the sky and the earth, and the Phoenix's cry was mournful."Father ...""Run!"​ Let's go!She didn't want to take revenge anymore. At this moment, she saw her father being surrounded and killed. He was covered in blood and could possibly die.This was supposed to be a war between huntian and Li Hao, but now, it was a crisis of extermination for the chaos race.Long Zhan, this Overlord, had yet to walk out of the four regions, had yet to bring the chaos race to rise, but today ... He had brought them to a dead end."Roar!"Long Zhan howled madly, shrieking in agony.Was there really no hope for the chaos race?They had merged into the chaos great Dao, but they were restricted by the tier 9. The tier 9 could severely injure them if they paid a price. They might be completely annihilated today!This Overlord was the only and final Overlord of the chaos race ... His eyes were filled with sorrow.There was no way to reverse the situation!"Huntian!""Get your men to save them!" He roared.Huntian, I'm only stopping Li Hao because I'm helping you today. There are still experts in the ninefold guards. Ask them to save Feng Yan and the others!Li Hao's cold voice was like a poisonous thorn that pierced his heart.""How can there be an Overlord who places their hopes on others? so ... You've never been an Overlord. Long Zhan, you're just ... A pitiful worm who seeks survival!""All your tyranny and unparalleled are just pretense. In fact, you already knew that your chaos race could never rise. You knew all too well that your race's Dao is integrated into the chaos great Dao, and the tier 9 is in the depths of the chaos great Dao ... You want to use this against them? what a joke. Can you ... Fight against dozens of tier 9 experts?"Was that even possible?It was impossible.So, from the beginning, long Zhan was in despair. He had actually been in despair all along. He actually could not see the way out. So, he hesitated, wavered, and could not determine a clear goal.How should he go?He actually had no other choice!The sorrow of The Last Emperor, the sorrow of not being able to reverse the situation!In the distance.Huntian frowned slightly. Save the chaos race?How?They were there to stop their addiction, but since they couldn't save them, it meant that it was difficult. Perhaps with the collapse of order, these people ... All had some problems. He was in trouble himself!It wasn't that he didn't want to save him. If possible, he was willing to help long Zhan at this moment and obtain a helper.But he ... Was also powerless."Hang in there! Long Zhan, it's impossible for them to maintain their peak state forever ..." Huntian shouted."They'll be weakened very soon ..."Long Zhan completely gave up all hope!He knew that huntian wasn't just trying to shirk responsibility, but at this moment, he was filled with hatred!He was also furious!From the beginning to the end, I've paid more than you in this battle. In the end, all you've given me is to hold on?[My clan will be annihilated today!]All you can give me is perseverance?What about withdrawal?What about the many ninefold guards?Why couldn't he stop the new martial artist Silver Moon and the people of spring and autumn?Why?The fire Phoenix soared into the sky, its body cracking. It was his daughter, her mother. For the great cause of the chaos race, she had already died at Li Hao's hands. Was she going to die today ... Too?The Nine-Tailed Fox, the Lord of Qing Qiu, had lost its elder a few days ago. The black Tiger Imperial Emperor had lost his Dao companion not long ago, and today, he had also fallen here ...He was powerless!When he was born, the world had already been divided. The chaos race was destined to decline.His fate had been decided a million years ago!After a million years of struggle, other than allowing the primal Chaos race to gain a few more rank eights, nothing else seemed to have changed!In the end, he was still a chess piece in the eyes of the human race, an ant!"I ... Failed ..." He said.In this life, he was actually a failure.He was born with a mission on his shoulders. The spirit of chaos had chosen him as the key to reviving the chaos race, but he had failed to live up to the expectations and expectations of the chaos race.His fate ... Seemed to have been decided long ago.The chaos race only had a tragic ending.Start over?A new world, a new beginning?At first, he had been disdainful of Li Hao's suggestion. Li Hao was an enemy, an enemy he wanted to kill. Li Hao was a human, and Li Hao was not a good person ...You want me to die willingly?Help you split open the sky? You must be joking!At this moment, long Zhan's heart wavered. He saw the decline of the chaos race, the extermination of the chaos race. He saw too many things, saw how unreliable everyone was. At this moment, he was slightly distracted.Among the people he knew, Li Hao was the most vicious and ruthless, but Li Hao's viciousness carried ... A trust that could not be ignored.He seemed to have never broken his promise.The people who followed him were more fortunate and stronger than those who followed neo martial arts.Moreover, Li Hao almost never brought these people with him to a battle to the death.Maybe he didn't trust her, or maybe ... He felt that his death was better than the death of others.Thunderlord, Wushan, Kong Ji, Sen LAN, Dao Qi ...These people who followed him were all living well and had become much stronger. None of them ... Had died in the war.That was because someone was in front.Li Hao!At this moment, he had actually thought of this. Start over?Fighting for the future from the pseudo-chaos?He had once seen that the future would be dominated by humans. Yes, the future seemed to have been determined, and human cultivators would be the strongest. However, in the future, he seemed to have seen ... The existence of the chaos race!It seemed like ... There were also Dragons.The chaos Dragon race!And the chaos Tiger Tribe ...He was stunned for a moment and allowed the three experts to attack him. Was the future ... Certain?He suddenly turned his head and looked at Li Hao, his dragon eyes bloodshot."Li Hao, the future ... Is the only one?"Li Hao shook his head,'there are thousands of future possibilities, how can there be one? The past was unique, the present was unique, and the future ... Was ever changing! Without a definite future, time would not dare to say that the future is the only one ..."The future was uncertain!Long Zhan's eyes were filled with red, somewhat crazy. The future is not the only one?Then I'll ... Take a gamble!Li Hao, at this moment, in the entire chaos ... Only your words make me believe. How laughable and pathetic!"All of you, go to hell!"Long Zhan roared and his body expanded to its limit. With a loud boom, his tail broke off and his powerful flesh exploded. His three clones were directly blown apart!"Race of primordial chaos, fight!"Long Zhan howled mournfully,"fight to the death! My race ... Will not be destroyed!!" Since Hundun has no place to stay, then ... He shall die in battle here!""Fight to the death!"The cries of phoenixes, Dragons, and foxes reverberated in the air once again. One after another, powerful figures appeared in the sky.Since there was no way out, then ... He would just die Here!Long Zhan cut off his tail and exploded his three clones. He instantly returned to his human form and punched out. His fist was exploding and directly shattered the Dark Lord's clone into pieces and completely exploded!Countless dark energies appeared in the world.The remaining two tier 9 experts revealed looks of shock. Long Zhan ... Was going all out. Was this fellow really going to bury the entire chaos race here?How could this be!He still had a chance to escape ... And even if he did, the others might not chase after him.Why ... Was he so determined?BOOM!At this moment, long Zhan seemed to have gone completely crazy. He punched out again, and the roar of a Dragon resounded through the world. With a boom, the second clone was directly blown up. The Lord of decay also exploded!The third grade-9 cultivator, the master of the hurricane path, couldn't help but roar,""We're just clones. You're the original. If you die ..."BOOM!The sound of an explosion rang out again. Long Zhan's qi and blood exploded. At this moment, he overdrew everything, as if he no longer had any scruples.Without any scruples, he was terrifyingly powerful!A punch!The sky was shattered, and the hurricane was torn apart.The sound of an explosion reverberated through the air, and a hurricane swept through the entire chaos.Long Zhan's fist blew him up. His body exploded, and blood flowed out. He turned around and looked at Li Hao, not saying a word.In the distance, Tian Fang's clone's eyes flickered and he shouted,""Two more people ... Save Li Hao!"Damn it!Why did this long Zhan go crazy too?It's better to run than to fight to the death. This group of people, this group of beasts, why have they all gone crazy?What was Li Hao's demonic nature?Everyone who came into contact with him seemed to have gone completely crazy!Why was it like this?Long Zhan would rather annihilate his clan and actually also want to fight to the death here ... Tian Fang's head was splitting. Really an Unreasonable Group of guys!Only Li Hao smiled. 'I've said it before. Long Zhan who has nothing to worry about will be stronger!'

Chapter 3726 Dao Tapir (1)
The situation changed rapidly.Just like the human heart.This was chaos!There were no eternal enemies, and there was no eternal stand. There were only the situation, interests, and future ...Here, don't make friends.That was because everyone would not be your friend. Friends were too rare. In the vast chaos, who was friends with who?It was a rare sight!At this moment, long Zhan's aura exploded to the extreme. Even if the great Dao was still shaking and chaos was still suppressing him, his aura was high and he returned to his human form. Perhaps it was to cover up the broken tail.That was no longer important!He let go.Long Zhan's restraints were too great.Even Li Hao could threaten him with the future of the chaos race and force him into a corner time and time again. Today, the chaos race had no way out. A tier 9 had casually suppressed his great Dao and the future of the chaos race ... Leaving him in complete despair.I have no other way out!Today, Li Hao was the one who opened the sky and schemed against the myriad worlds. In the end, the only ones injured are us, the chaos race, because ... We are weak.How unfair it was!,m "The great Dao is unfair ... No, this great Dao, this chaos ... It has never given us, the chaos race, any fairness!"He was depressed and desperate!Why did the ninth-rank Dao integration mean that he had to integrate the Dao of chaos?Why are we, the chaos race, born from the primordial chaos?Why was it that the chaos race had never controlled the world and could only rely on plundering?Why?It was the world that was unfair, the great Dao that was unfair, and the strong that were unfair!Since it was so unfair ... Then he would open up the world again!He finally understood.Or rather, in his despair, he had no other choice. If he didn't agree to Li Hao's request, what could he do?Escape?But the chaos race was still restricted by the chaos great Dao. If they escaped today, what about tomorrow?What about the day after tomorrow?Now, there were endless battles, and tier 9 experts kept descending, but did he ... Still have a way out?The power of 8000 great DAOs?Very powerful ... But what could it change?He knew that the future in Li Hao's eyes might still be controlled by humans, because Li Hao had once summoned the future emperor. He was a human, but the future was changeable!"Since that's the case, I, the chaos race, will merge the Dao into the heavens and merge the spirit into the heavens. I, long Zhan, will merge the Dao, body, and spirit into the new heavens with my rank eight strength. Can I reverse the universe?"I don't know!"But I know that there is still a choice in the future!Unlike now, where there was only despair and unwillingness!"Fight!"Long Zhan was high-spirited, his qi and blood rushing to the sky. He roared,""You rank nine are only so-so! What can a mere clone do to me? You fused my Dao of chaos and stole my spirit of chaos. I will never forget this hatred!""Kill!"The sky was broken! It was as if chaos was spurting out blood. Like a mad demon, he soared into the sky and leaped out. His fist was like a Golden Dragon, exploding the heavens and earth. He actually took the initiative to fight the type 9 avatar!The chaos great Dao above his head shook, but he still refused to retreat.This was crazy!Another one had gone crazy!At that moment, the grade-9 cultivators could only sigh with emotion. The chaos that had been raging in the battle also revealed looks of joy. Good, this is crazy!These people were crazy, killing, and fighting. Some people died, and the world shook, but it made him stronger.The more chaotic the world, the better!He also roared and laughed,""You want to stop me? dream on!"BOOM!The power of Chaos swept in all directions, forcing the rank nine doppelgangers to retreat. Some of them were slower, and the chaos Emperor suddenly froze the world as if it was his first time using time!In his hands, time seemed to be more powerful than Li Hao.In an instant!Time seemed to have stopped. Chaos was overjoyed!This was flowing time!His sideburns were slightly white, but he didn't care at all. What was this?What was the cost of some lifespan?I will be invincible in the world!I'll be unparalleled!BOOM!His hands tore through the sky as he held down a ninth-rank clone. In the blink of an eye, he tore it apart, and blood splattered through the sky.The battle broke out in a frenzy.The master of the tianfang sect shuttled between heaven and earth. At this moment, his expression was extremely ugly. Not good. The chaos was actually starting to use the power of time. If this continued ... If he continued ... He could very well ... Kill all of the grade 9 clones!More importantly, the chaos great Dao was shaking violently, and his true body could not descend.It was more troublesome!"Stop hiding!" He shouted."Everyone, including the experts under your command, come out of seclusion and suppress the chaos!" Do we have to wait for him to control time and kill all of us?"Chaos descended. Other than the five elements emissaries and five elements overlords, only a few level eight venerable sovereigns had come.There were more than 20 level nine venerable sovereigns, but only four of them were level eight?It was impossible!Even though millions of years had passed, most of the level 8s were still dormant. It was impossible for all of them to have died. That day, there were twenty to thirty level 8s in the Eastern Region.Even Extreme Ice Emperor could gather more than a dozen level eights to besiege the new martial artists.In the entire primordial chaos, were there only so few level eight experts?Only these few sides had grade 8 experts?There were more than 20 level nine venerable sovereigns. Even if one of them was left behind, there would be more than 20 level eight venerable sovereigns.At this moment, some of the venerable sovereigns 'expressions changed. The more chaos fought, the stronger he became. Three of his rank nine clones had been torn apart by long Zhan. Now that chaos had killed one, there were only about 20 rank nine clones left.But ... They were all just clones!The more they fought, the weaker they became!"Summon my life and death masses to suppress the chaos!"  n0vel online free at 𝓷0𝓿𝓮𝓵𝓫𝓲𝓷 Someone in the crowd shouted in a low voice. In the dark, it was as if the world had emerged, as if the world had been revived, as if life and death had been opened ...

Chapter 3727 Dao Tapir (2)
In the distance, darkness and death appeared.There was an explosion of vitality!In an instant, a world seemed to emerge from hell. Ancient existences seemed to be waking up rapidly.In an instant, the Dao of life and death filled the world.In the distance, several cultivators appeared, and the power of life and death roiled. An ancient chant sounded,""Life and death, welcome my Dao master, the life and death realm appears!"A world of life and death appeared between heaven and earth. It was in the East, near the former world of reincarnation. It was incredible.The Dao Spirit of life and death seemed to pierce through the chaos.At this moment, several powerful cultivators crossed through time and space in the distance. They seemed to ignore the chaotic distance and followed the life-and-death coordinates provided by the path master of life and death. Some were full of vitality, while others were like ghosts. They crossed the distance of space and rushed over.The speed was very fast.However, it was still not enough.At this moment, Paragon sky square hollered, and space rippled. Amidst the chaos, it was as if a teleportation channel had been established."Also! I'll build a space tunnel and teleport here quickly to face the chaos!"The chaos Thearch threw out a punch and was about to kill the second Dao master's clone. Seeing that these bastards were still summoning his subordinates, he gritted his teeth!F * ck!If you can't beat me, you're going to call for help?At the same time, when the other level nine venerable sovereigns saw that the life and death path master had called for them, they also shouted,""Everyone, at this time ... It's better to work together!"As soon as he finished speaking, someone called out in a ghostly voice,""Yin and yang are separated, and the Dao of yin and yang appears!"In the distance, another great world seemed to have appeared. The path of yin and yang appeared, like the eight trigrams of Tai Chi, hell, and heaven.The human King next door was crying!He instantly looked at the great world, then at the Yin Yang path master, and his saliva almost dripped out. 'F * ck, the Yin Yang world. I know that there's a Yin Yang path master, but I didn't expect that the Yin Yang world actually still exists!'A level nine world!He was really going to cry!If neo martial ate yin and yang ... Oh my God, that would be too happy. He didn't even dare to imagine it. It would be super delicious. At this moment, he didn't care so much and suddenly roared,""Emperor of neo martial, stop them, cut off the yin and yang, and eat them!"“……”Huntian Supreme Emperor's face turned ugly. The human King swallowed his saliva and begged,""Let's stop fighting. Brother, you go deal with chaos, and I'll deal with Yin Yang. If we change opponents, you kill me and you get nothing, and I kill you and I get nothing. If you kill chaos, you might be able to get time. If I kill Yin Yang path master's clone and world ... My neo martial will be rich ... Huntian bro, let's change?"Huntian was stunned.Spring Autumn wanted to curse!"Old sister Spring Autumn, go and fight the life and death Dao master!" Li Hao roared."The life and death realm has life force. Your spring and autumn clan has rich life force. Perhaps ... You have a chance!"Change opponents! 'There's no point in beating huntian to death. Why don't we switch? huntian wants to seize time, I want to devour yin and yang, and spring and autumn can also snatch life and death. 'Huntian was slightly stunned ... To be honest, the human King's words did make sense. He had long since lost his patience to fight with these two. It was meaningless. But ... At this moment ... He felt like he was about to break down.F * ck!We're fighting to the death!You actually want to change your opponent!Yes, I'm fighting Chaos because I might have a chance to seize time. You're fighting Yin Yang. It doesn't seem like there's anything wrong with that. It's good for everyone, but ... This is the process of a big battle!Human King, are you joking?The human King bared his teeth."Hurry up. Tier 9 beings are all bad things. Kill one of them. If we don't do it now, when?" Don't worry about Li Hao for now ... It's already chaotic, so why don't we ... Fight a chaotic battle? it's more important to eat your own fill!"He was really about to cry. F * ck, huntian, are you going to change or not?Huntian hesitated for a moment, then gritted his teeth and turned to leave. He roared,""Ninefold guards, follow me and destroy the chaos!"Forget it!  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  The battle with the new martial artist Silver Moon was not the most important thing now. The key was time.The human King clearly didn't care about the others. He bared his teeth and charged at the Yin Yang path master."Old yin-yang thief, take this! I won't rest until you die!"He really wouldn't stop until he died!If he didn't kill Yin Yang, he wouldn't be satisfied. Such a big piece of fat meat.If they ate it, the new martial arts would grow stronger, and everyone would improve. Big cat and the others would become stronger. This was big meat!Venerable Emperor spring and autumn had been confused by the sudden change in these people, but she gritted her teeth ... The human King's words actually made sense. She gritted her teeth and rushed toward the venerable Emperor of life and death."Old thief of life and death, eat my palm!"The two Dao Masters were so depressed that they almost spat out blood!艹!Were they a match?One-on-one, the probability was not. Long Zhan fought one against three and killed three. The two of them were not weaker than long Zhan. Spring Autumn was even stronger.Now, the two of them were going to switch opponents and they were chosen ... How unlucky.As for Supreme Emperor Tian Fang, he only took a glance and didn't care.That's good!It might not be a bad thing for huntian to join them. He was also a top existence. The result would be the same if he was entangled by these two. He couldn't care too much. He maintained the teleportation and continued to shout,"Is there anyone else? Yes, summon them all. Do you expect a group of tier 8 experts to conquer the world?"These grade 8s were only for them to gain the upper hand.In this situation, whoever could seize time would be the one who truly had the upper hand.

Chapter 3728 Dao Tapir (3)
There was no need for him to say anything. At this point, seeing the two Dao Masters summoning their troops, the other venerable sovereigns couldn't bear it anymore. One by one, the venerable sovereigns activated their great DAOs and their spirits emerged. While Tian Fang was still maintaining the teleportation, they quickly summoned the experts from all sides!The entire chaos was in turmoil.Some of the uninhabited places were peaceful in the past, but today, a world appeared out of thin air. The world that had been dead for many years was starting to recover.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  A majestic force appeared in all directions.The eighth level venerable sovereigns walked out one by one.The entire chaos was shaking violently.Today ... How many people would die?Countless venerable sovereigns were so frightened that they did not even dare to watch the battle. On this day, the number of powerhouses gathered in the West was beyond imagination. There were more than 30 level 8 powerhouses in Li Hao's party.Including the ones killed by Li Hao and the others, there were more than 40 of them.Following which, 20 type 9 clones appeared.And now, a large number of rank eight venerable sovereigns had emerged from the Nirvana lands ...In the entire West, the aura of a rank eight venerable sovereign was rising crazily.It was as if all the experts of the primordial chaos had gathered here.At first, it was just a battle between a group of stage eight experts, but at this moment ... It had already evolved into a great battle between the entire chaos. Other than the stage nine true body, which had not arrived, almost all the experts hidden in the chaos had come out to kill.A monstrous aura swept out in all directions.……At this moment, Li Hao, who had stirred up a storm, seemed to have really become an outsider.He only looked on silently, his eyes cold.It was pretty good!The more that came, the better. The more that died, the better. If they died, their great DAOs, spirituality, and life force would scatter. Then, his splitting open of the heavens would be even smoother.At this moment, he was still extremely weak.While long Zhan did not care about him anymore and headed straight for the two powerhouses 'clones that came to help.Long Zhan probably could not last for too long either.Since he didn't care about him, it meant that he silently agreed. In this battle ... Long Zhan must die.It would have to depend on how many powerhouses long Zhan could kill.At this moment, the two Grade 9 avatars who had come to help called for their subordinates. With Tian Fang's cooperation, the experts were quickly teleported over.He didn't summon the previous three, and he didn't have the time to do so. Tian Fang didn't say anything, and he didn't have the chance.Even if he did, he wouldn't be able to come for a while.At this moment, they were all going all out.Chaos and long Zhan were both experts at killing strong enemies. Li Hao had specially chosen these two fighters. They were not bad and did not disappoint him. In just a short while, they had killed four level nine clones.From the looks of it ... He would soon kill even more!As for the human King and spring and autumn, he didn't know if he could kill a few of them. Even if he did, it didn't seem like the human King would leave anything for him. At this moment, a person appeared beside Li Hao.The Queen.At this moment, the Queen's entire body was trembling. It was unknown whether it was out of fear or the chaos great Dao's tremors that had injured her.He was so scared!A group of powerhouses were fighting here, and she, a Tier 6, was also on this battlefield ... And she had actually survived until now. She had to admit that she was getting arrogant!"Lord ... Li ..."At this moment, she didn't dare to call Li Hao by his name. She had always known that Li Hao was brutal and calculative.But today, he actually ... Actually stirred up the entire Primal Chaos!A large number of experts had fallen!As for Qian Wuliang himself, he was sitting there leisurely, while the Queen was afraid of him. At this moment, he finally understood why Qian Wuliang was so afraid of Li Hao and never thought about taking control of the Silver Moon ... If he had that thought, he might as well commit suicide. It would be more comfortable.Li Hao was a true demon!Li Hao turned his head. It was necessary for the Queen to be here. There were too many humans in the divine Kingdom. They were all useful for splitting open the sky. Li Hao looked at her and sent a voice transmission, when the world is opened, you can place humans in the false chaos! There's no need to say anything, just say that someone created a new world and let them return to chaos!"The Queen was a little reluctant, but she quickly nodded.Countless humans had provided her with the power of faith.However, these humans had also become machines of faith. In fact, if this continued, these humans would die sooner or later, and they would die in ignorance.Li Hao glanced at her."The world has opened. Do you want to go in?" he asked.The Queen shook her head frantically!Forget it, I'm not going!Who knew what would happen?At this moment, the star in Li Hao's hand flickered with radiance and began to absorb the life force and the power of great DAOs from the surroundings. This fake star, the fake time star, would become the core of the entire world!It was the source of life, and even the source of time!As for the one in chaos's hand ... Once chaos died, it would naturally lose its effect and time would return.Would chaos kill?At this moment, chaos was unparalleled in his courage and ferocity. He was beating the rank nine avatars and forcing them to retreat. He was fighting dozens of them at once, but he was still beating them until they were scattered everywhere. It seemed like he had a chance of winning!But ... Li Hao knew that it would be too difficult for this guy to win.Li Hao slowly retrieved the divine runes and fused them with the star in his hand. The surrounding spirits, the overflowing spirits, also began to gather toward the star. The world was about to be opened up inside the star!In the distance, the group of heroes who were fighting seemed to have sensed something.But now ... When Tian Fang saw it, he didn't say anything.Li Hao wanted to split open the sky, and he knew that at this stage ... Helping Li Hao split open the sky might be better.So, he didn't say anything.

Chapter 3729 Dao Tapir (3)
Huntian, on the other hand, was in a chaotic battle and couldn't care less about Li Hao splitting open the sky. Long Zhan was madly fighting the two ninth-rank avatars and didn't care about Li Hao. At this moment, everyone on the battlefield knew what Li Hao was going to do, but no one stopped him.Those who wanted to stop him would probably be in chaos!In fact, he wanted to break out of the encirclement and kill Li Hao. If he killed Li Hao, the others might not dare to kill him. However, he was surrounded and huntian had joined in. He was suddenly somewhat frustrated!Chaos gritted his teeth and cursed,""Why would you rather give it to Li Hao than me? If he kills me, will Li Hao really pass time to someone else? He's even more vicious than I am!"F * ck!This was a vicious person.If I'm chaos, then Li Hao is a true demon of chaos!They watched helplessly as Li Hao absorbed the power of great DAOs and the power of life. None of them stopped him.Since that's the case ... Why did you all start this?He really wanted to cry, but he couldn't bear to give up time. At this moment, he actually still had a chance to give up. As long as he destroyed the time star, he ... Would still be as chaotic as before, and no one would attack him again.But who could bear to do that?Li Hao ... Why did you leave Shi Guang to me?At that moment, he thought about how powerful time was. Gritting his teeth, he said no. In the next moment, he activated time and froze the world, freezing the grade-9 expert in front of him. Gritting his teeth, he roared and smashed down with his fist!Die!It felt too good!'This is time! In my hands, it's only just solidified, but it's already so powerful. Once I push time to the extreme, how powerful will it be?'BOOM!Yet another ninth-rank one exploded. However, the more powerful he was, the more everyone feared him. Many people roared,"We have to kill him. Time has just been formed, and Li Hao hasn't strengthened time much. Once he strengthens time to level 9 ... We'll all be dead!"The current Shi Guang was not strong.Of course, it wasn't weak either. In the beginning, it was only level six time in Li Hao's hands. But now, the entire time star was overflowing with Level Seven time power. This also meant that ... Chaos had been integrated with the power of great DAOs and his own life force, madly urging and strengthening time.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  In Li Hao's hands, not to mention freezing a level 9 martial artist, even a level 8 martial artist would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens.However, in the hands of chaos, a Grade 9 clone could actually be forcefully frozen.One could only imagine how powerful time was. The first Dao of 10000 Dao was not an undeserved reputation.Boom! Boom! Boom!The battle was going on all around.Li Hao was absorbing all kinds of powers and fusing them into the Star in his hand. This pseudo-time star was also growing crazily, and its aura was getting more and more powerful.Long Zhan's body had already started to crack, but his roar was extremely loud. With a loud boom, his arm exploded. He had smashed an avatar on the spot!At this moment, he was like an ancient giant demon, incomparably powerful. His body was extremely powerful, but it was also getting more and more shattered as the chaos great Dao continued to tremble!Today, if the ninth-rank did not shake his Foundation, long Zhan would go all out and use all his combat strength. Even if he could not defeat huntian, he would probably be at the level of spring and autumn.Further away.The Phoenix roared, soaring through the heavens and earth. Suddenly, a sorrowful cry rang out, and flames burned the sky. Long Zhan raised his head to look ... There were some tears in his eyes, but they quickly dissipated.Feng Yan had died in battle!  His daughter ... Had died in battle here.The people from the chaos race were currently engaged in a fierce battle with the new martial, Silver Moon, and spring and autumn. As for who had killed them, he did not care at this moment. It could have been Silver moon's experts, or a great demon from spring and autumn.It's good that he's dead!If he's dead ... We'll all go to Li Hao's pseudo-chaos!Perhaps, there might still be a chance for our chaos race to rise again.There were battlefields everywhere, and people were constantly bleeding.One after another, powerful figures collapsed and were killed on the spot. Some were killed by chaos, while others were killed by the human King and Spring Autumn!The entire West was like a purgatory!The so-called order had completely disappeared in the West at this moment. The order that huntian had established for many years was completely broken.The chaos in the West far surpassed the chaos.Li Hao was still calm and continued doing his own thing.Right now, it was only the preparation stage.Splitting open the sky, if there wasn't much movement, could it still be called splitting open the sky?If I don't kill until corpses lie all over the field, can I still be called splitting open the sky?It doesn't need energy?Don't you want the power of great DAOs?One that doesn't need life force?I need both!Killing one or two weaklings, casually slashing with a sword, and opening up a space, was this called splitting open the sky?It definitely wasn 't!Only by killing, killing people, killing a large group of people that he didn't like, killing a large group of experts, killing a large group of people with incomparably dense life energy, could this world gradually become perfect!Only then would he have potential!A new world was forged with blood.Since I'm going to do it, of course I have to do it perfectly. That future person once said that I seem to have left him with a lot of trouble ... Bullshit, I stuffed a group of spirits to death and fused into them to fight for the power of Overlord.No matter how big the trouble was, could it compare to the present?Close to a hundred level 8s fought against the heavens and earth, leaving corpses strewn all over the land!How many experts does your tiny Primal Chaos have?You dare to say that I've left you with trouble?Besides, you should have some helpers in the harmonious spirit realm, such as my master ... He should be close to you.Of course, if long Zhan and the others were harmonious spirit realm cultivators, perhaps ... There would be some disputes.
