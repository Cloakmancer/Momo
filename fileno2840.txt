How ruthless!At this moment, he was certain of his thoughts. 'I must leave. I can't become Hong Yu, a seventh level venerable sovereign, a Supreme existence in the eyes of outsiders. Because I'm not a realm Lord, I'm not the master of the great Dao. I can't be abandoned at the critical moment!'The power of extraction!Even if Hong Yu had a chance of survival, it was now completely gone. Under the sneak attack of a peak rank seven, it was hard to fight against him even if he went all out, let alone having 50% of his power drawn away.BOOM!With a loud sound, the red universe was torn into pieces. At this moment, Dao marks appeared and a Red Moon was extremely weak, carrying some unwillingness and resentment!He did not know who he should hate!Neo martial human King?Wushan?Or ... The red moon Lord.He could understand Red Moon Lord's thoughts. I'm dead, and he can't save me, but ... You can't take away my last chance of survival just to stabilize the world!If I go all out, there's a 90% chance that I'll die Here, but what if a miracle happens?What if I can escape?But now ... It was gone.There was no chance at all!In the red moon, the advanced venerable sovereign smiled sadly. He didn't know if he should hate her or not.A rank eight world had been killed by advanced venerable sovereigns one after another. He had even been abandoned by the realm Lord!Wu Shan's huge palm instantly pressed down!BOOM!The red moon exploded, and Wu Shan's somewhat hypocritical voice of fake mercy came. Perhaps it was not mercy, but a feeling of sympathy for the Fox when the rabbit died."So ... I'm going to kill you. I'm going to leave the great cloud world! Brother Hong Yu, it's not that I have to kill you ... But ... I don't want this day to come!"The red shadow shattered and looked at him.Leave?That final look seemed to be filled with admiration and ... Disdain!You're thinking very well!But you're at the peak of the seventh rank, would cloudsky let you escape?Unless you don't want any energy, you can simply strip it and leave. However, as a seventh rank venerable sovereign, who doesn't have a bunch of enemies? without strength, you will die very quickly!However, if he took away the energy, would the type 8 world Lord allow him to take away a peak Type 7 energy?What a joke!Even if you kill me, it won't be enough to make up for it. After all, half of my great Dao's power has been drawn away. Also, the power of the Crimson Moon and the power of the clouds don't match well.Would Yunxiao be happy to do so?If he was willing ... He would have to admire the Lord of the clouds."Wushan ... Perhaps, I'll be waiting for you!"Hong Yu transmitted the last sentence with a hint of ridicule.It's not Red Moon master who will kill you, it's not neo martial artist king who will kill you, it's ... Cloud sky Master!Why do you have the thought of leaving?How many seventh rank venerable sovereigns could escape from this huge chaos?Whether it was the Crimson Moon, the light, or other macro worlds, when you reached Level Seven, if you wanted to leave ... Did you think that the master of the great Dao was running a charity? Wushan didn't speak.With a bang, he crushed the Crimson Moon and swept away the power of the Crimson Moon.The mountains of clouds and seas of mist dissipated!Everyone looked again ... At this moment, Hong Yu had died, and the neo martial King ... Had disappeared. However, a voice came at this moment,""Yunxiao and new martial will destroy the red moon. Let the red moon Lord clean up and wait!"He had disappeared!If he didn't run, what was the point of staying?If he was forced into a corner and attracted a few grade 8s who saw through the situation, wouldn't he be finished?This man from Yunxiao really dared to kill the red moon sovereign. He was really bold.And in that macro world, within the regional wall, a person silently looked in the direction he had escaped in. He smiled and muttered,""It's been so many years, but it's still the same!"One look and one could tell that he was powerless."Otherwise, Wushan or Wushan, we'll kill them all. Wushan, you killed Hongyu. If you don't hand over the power of the great Dao, I'll kill you until your parents can't recognize you.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  You still want to take advantage of me?What a joke!Lizhu didn't make a move. There were many level-Sevens at the moment. Moreover, those who died were all level-Sevens from level-eight worlds. They weren't the kind that the great path universe could seize. There was no point in killing them. Even if he did, he wouldn't be able to enter Level Seven.However, this guy was nearby ... There would be more opportunities in the future.He smiled. There was no rush!He could endure, endure, and wait. Since that guy was nearby, there was a chance. Moreover, Wu Shan had killed the red moon sovereign. There might be a big battle in Tian Fang!This was interesting!Some of the major cosmos absolute beings in the surroundings fled at that moment.The sky had collapsed!Not long ago, two seventh rank venerable sovereigns had died. Today, two more had died. The point was ... If they were all killed by the neo martial human King, it would be fine. But one of them was killed by Wu Shan, who was venerable sovereign Yunxiao.This also meant that cloudsky might be participating in the battle!The heavens were about to change!The chaos was about to be shaken. A second rank eight major world was about to join the war!……Wu Shan didn't say a word. He collected the power of his great Dao and looked around silently. Soon, he entered the Outlander grand world.Had the sky collapsed?He did not know.However, he knew that a half-crippled red universe might not be enough. Realm Lord, are you really willing to let me go?As for the new martial artist King ... He didn't care about him.Since the neo martial human King was not a fool, he would not attack him at this moment. There was no other reason. His existence would kill Hong Yue's seventh level venerable sovereign and drag Yunxiao into the war. The other party would be happy to see it.……At the same time.The Crimson Moon world.The sky collapsed and the earth caved in. Heaven and earth shook and the sky cracked as if thousands of stars had fallen.

The experts looked up at the sky in shock.The venerable sovereigns 'perception of the great Dao trembled, and their faces paled.Why ... Did the heavens suddenly change?It was as if many advanced venerable sovereigns had died in an instant, not just one!At that moment, the red moon master's figure appeared and covered the world. Her might suppressed the world, and her voice was calm."The danger of the Crimson Moon is here! New martial and Yun Xiao joined forces to kill many of our venerable sovereigns!""However, I, the Crimson Moon, have been in the chaos for countless years. I'm not afraid of any challenge!""From today onwards, select a few rank six venerable sovereigns to receive the power of the great Dao. Those who have enough luck can enter rank seven!"The great world, which had been in a state of panic, felt a little more at ease when it saw the red moon sovereign.When they heard that he was going to select a sixth rank venerable sovereign to advance to the seventh rank ... All of a sudden, some of the sixth rank venerable sovereigns were no longer afraid, only endless greed and desire!Red Moon Master's Voice rang out again,"the great Dao is limited, and the status is limited!" If someone died, someone would definitely advance! When the sixth rank advances to the seventh rank, there will definitely be a middle-stage venerable sovereign. When the initial-stage advances to the middle-stage, there will definitely be new people who will advance to the venerable sovereign level!"As soon as these words came out, the entire world suddenly shook, and countless power of desire overflowed.The originally turbulent universe of the great path actually stabilized a little.Just like how Silvermoon cultivated her myriad DAOs, the power of desire was also the source of great DAOs. The death of a few venerable sovereigns and the abdication of their positions had ignited the desire of all cultivators in the world!Suddenly, the fear and sorrow from before disappeared!There was only excitement and greed!Red Moon master watched silently. This was the result he wanted. The facts proved that the red moon's Dao was unimaginably powerful. Outsiders would never understand that it was because several venerable sovereigns had died and a lot of the power of desire had been deprived.So what?As long as living beings still have desires, I, the Crimson Moon, will not go extinct!"A few rank 7s have died, and these people are all greedy. It won't be long before I, Hong Yue, can return to my peak!Neo martial, Yunxiao, if you think you can defeat me, Red Moon, with this, you're too naive.Human desire was the greatest motivation!The shaking heaven and earth began to stabilize.Countless cultivators were excited, greedy, crazy, and even impatient.Many venerable sovereigns appeared from all over the place.The mid grade wanted to become high grade, the low grade wanted to become mid grade, their eyes were filled with eagerness.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  Red Moon sovereign did not say anything.At this moment, he would not help these people.Wait!As time went on, as long as it didn't drag on forever, these people's desires would be endless and would always be in an extremely exuberant state.At that time, if someone could advance to the seventh step ... It would trigger the others to go crazy again!After a few times, Red moon's losses could be completely compensated!Or even ... ​ He glanced outside. Perhaps he could give his rank seven position to some outsiders. A rank seven world was good, but it was no longer safe in this era. Would anyone agree to exchange a rank seven venerable sovereign position for a rank seven world?The seventh rank was no longer safe.It had only been a short while, but five rank seven venerable sovereigns had already died.Perhaps, even the major cosmos absolute beings were afraid.If he brought the great path universe and joined Red Moon directly, giving him the position of a high-level venerable sovereign ... Perhaps he could still earn some money.For example, the weak and small great world, the world Lord, was only at the sixth level, but he controlled the great path universe. If he was promised a seventh level position and allowed to directly integrate with the great world and the great path universe into the Crimson Moon ... The other party might agree.As for forcefully merging, that would not be good. There were a few rank seven masters nearby, and if he tried to do so, he would fall out with them. He understood the principle of the Fox mourning for the death of the rabbit.As these thoughts emerged in his mind, he looked in another direction.His eyes were cold!Over there, the yin-yang world, has it really descended?Why didn't she feel anything at all?However, he had seen the book of great Dao of the new martial Supreme and Emperor Cang ... It was just that his aura was slightly weaker. However, he was too far away and he could not tell whether it was his real body or his avatar.However, at that time, he had to do so just in case.At this moment, the world was stable. The heaven and earth were stable.He waited in silence for a while.After a while, outside the boundary, a seventh rank venerable sovereign quickly returned. His aura was extremely strong. It was the seventh rank venerable sovereign who had been patrolling outside. At this time, his face was a little pale.He was also shocked by the unforeseen event that had just happened!Red Moon master didn't say much, but her voice was heavy.""You just need to defend here for a while. You are not allowed to go out! I want to go and see ... See if the yin-yang world has really entered the range of my Crimson Moon!""Alright!"The rank seven venerable sovereign nodded and did not say anything.Red Moon master waited for him to recover before tearing open the void and stepping into the great path universe. He moved forward and quickly landed in a broken area.He looked at it silently. Soon, he tore apart the great path universe and instantly descended.It was the place where the battle had taken place!Red Moon master stood in the void and examined the place. She frowned slightly. There was no aura of the great path universe or the world. This place had been cleaned.He didn't gain much ... But he sensed some key points.He had actually died under the sword!How was that possible?Also ... There could be some Primal Chaos lightning tribulation here ... Could it be the Silver Moon King?This was not unexpected.However, the Silver Moon King was nothing to be afraid of. Could the sword Saint really defeat a rank 7?

His expression turned grave!It's still fine now. If revered sword enters the seventh level, wouldn't he ... Be able to fight against an eighth level?This was impossible!Even the neo martial King couldn't do it!"The yin-yang world didn't come?"He mumbled. If that was the case, he might have been intimidated. Of course, in that situation, the human King had suddenly attacked. Even if he knew he had been intimidated, he couldn't take the risk to leave.Otherwise, once the other party really broke through their homeland, that would be the greatest danger!"Revered sword ... Martial King ..."She mumbled and looked around. After a while, her figure slowly disappeared.He must kill this group of neo martial artists!Their existence is a great threat to me, the red moon!……At the same time. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Deep in the chaos.An old man grabbed two people and fled frantically. Li Hao didn't know how long he had been running for. Just as Li Hao was about to speak, venerable the sword raised his finger and shushed him.Li Hao didn't say anything. He glanced at Kong Ji, but Kong Ji didn't say anything either.At this moment, he was still a little shocked.All three of them had used up a lot of energy. Li Hao looked much older. He was able to use time this time. He reversed the venerable sword's sword will and the void two times, but the total amount was not as good as the level 7 FIRE movement he used last time.Last time, he had borrowed strength from his own body.This time, it was only a reversal, not a borrowing of power ... Of course, energy couldn't be created out of thin air. This time, the three strikes of venerable the sword didn't consume Li Hao's energy, but the power of recovery and the power of emptiness.In other words, the energy that Kong Ji had recovered twice had to be taken back from Li Hao. Li Hao had used his life force to offset half of it, and the lightning tribulation had offset the other half.Even if there were some problems in the future, they wouldn't be too big. This time, he had gained a deeper understanding of the power of time.This time, it could be said that he had used the smallest price to do something even more terrifying.While Li Hao was still thinking, the old man gently exhaled and smiled.Suddenly, he patted Li Hao and Kong Ji heavily!"Not bad!" He nodded approvingly."You two are great!"“……”Li Hao didn't care. After thinking for a while, he slowly said,""This junior is a thousand years old!"Venerable the sword nodded and smiled,"not bad, old man, you're good!" I'm 1300 years older than you. At this age, I'm old enough to be your grandfather!"“……”Li Hao couldn't help but want to laugh. After a while, he said softly,""His father is probably over a million years old?"Kong Ji nodded.That's right!The sword Saint said that he would be a grandfather ... That was for ordinary people. My father is a million years old. Are you sure you can be my grandfather?Venerable the sword was a little embarrassed, but he recovered quickly. He patted the two of them again, and the two of them almost fell into chaos. He laughed and said, "It's fine. Don't mind the trifles. A man doesn't care about trifles!"He was indeed bigger than Kong Ji, but at this moment, he was glad that it was still okay!If this old man was older than me, I wouldn't be able to keep up the act!1,000 years old ... I'm at least 300 years older than you. 300 years old is enough for an ordinary person to pass on their legacy for ten generations.After rejoicing for a while, venerable the sword sized up the two of them and laughed,""I'm very pleased to have met two interesting young men! You're quite bold and powerful. Are you interested in doing some big business with this old man?"“……”The two of them looked at him and didn't say a word. What was he doing?Didn't he just kill a seventh-rank?This ... What did this mean?"Not interested?" venerable the sword was a little disappointed. It was a pity that the red moon had changed drastically. A seventh rank venerable sovereign had died. It might be in turmoil for a while. Weren't there a bunch of worlds nearby? There are big and small ones, let's join hands and do a big one ..."These words sounded like a bandit 's!In fact, neo martial ... That was the impression it gave, and the fact was the same.Li Hao had experienced neo martial arts before, so he knew.But ... Kong Ji was really at a loss.This ... Is this neo martial?They had just killed a seventh-rank, and this person didn't stop and wanted them to continue?"How is it?" venerable the sword asked quickly. Are you interested? How about 532?"“……” Kong Ji didn't understand."Not satisfied?" venerable the sword asked again. I can kill a tier 7, so I'll get 50%, and you're still not happy? How about this, I want 40%, will you two split it 30 - 30,40 - 20, or how you want to split it, and I won't participate, how about it?"Kong Ji instantly understood!He opened his mouth ... But he held back the word 'F * ck'.You're talking about splitting the spoils?I ... I haven't even said anything, and you've already mentioned splitting the loot?I'm the son of the God of Light. I'm only here to cultivate. I don't lack money."I don't lack resources ..."Just as he opened his mouth, venerable the sword frowned and said,"four-six is the limit. You want more?" You're only at the sixth rank, and you've just entered it. Your recovery power is impressive, but ... You might not be more useful than this Li family junior. This is the fairest price I've given!"“……”Kong Ji looked at Li Hao, feeling a little ridiculous.Am I conversing with a powerhouse of the sixth step that can fight against a powerhouse of the seventh step, or am I conversing with a chaos Bandit?A sixth-rank expert killing a seventh-rank expert ... Why didn't you sigh, brag, and marvel at yourself first ... The moment you stopped, you were talking about splitting the spoils with us?Li Hao rubbed his temples and didn't say anything.I knew it!It's just that, in the past, it was separated by a layer, so it wasn't very clear. Today, I saw it with my own eyes. It turns out that what Zhang an knew, heard, and saw were not fake. These neo martial artists were all ... Bandits!Of course, they were also robbing the enemies ... In their opinion, those who had migrated to the Crimson Moon were all enemies.Li Hao looked at loneliness."Brother loneliness ... Are you interested?"Are you interested in being a Bandit?You don't lack resources.Kong Ji was stunned. Am I interested?I ... I don't know!I've never thought of being a Bandit in my life, but ... Wouldn't it be more exciting to be a Bandit?Fight with more experts?He had just killed a level 7, so exciting!Wasn't he always looking for excitement?"I ... I can try. As for the distribution of resources, I don't lack ..." He hesitated.Venerable the sword nodded instantly."Alright, I'll take 50%, and Li Hao will take 30%. Since you don't lack it, you can take 20%. I'm just giving it to you so that you won't feel that it's inappropriate. This 20% is for your consumption. You can't pay for it yourself, right?"“……”Kong Ji was in a daze, where am I?In ... The market?Speaking of which, was a market like this?I've never been there in my life.He had nodded his head in such a muddled state. For a moment, he had forgotten that he had only come here to broaden his horizons. Now, he seemed to have joined a gang without knowing it!No, a thieves 'lair!"If my father knew that I, the son of a rank eight venerable sovereign, had abandoned my family's rank eight great world and come here to Rob with others, would he personally come and kill me?The divine light realm...Was just!It was bright!By the way, I don't seem to be a cultivator from the divine light plane.Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't care too much. He was quite interested. They were enemies, anyway. Besides, the others had escaped earlier and were all nearby. He still had to find them.It wasn't impossible to do something else along the way.Moreover, he also wanted to have a chat with venerable the sword. At the very least, he wanted to ask him some questions about sword principle.Venerable the sword smiled when he saw the two of them nodding.He revealed a kind expression!The two little fools ... No, the two young men were both very good and promising!"In the past, I brought out the human king who ran amuck in all directions ... This time, I might even bring out two little bandits ... No, two little geniuses! He patted the two of them again and smiled."Follow me. Let's find a quiet place first. We'll dig a hole and use it as our base ... As for the rest, we'll talk later!"The two of them looked at each other and suddenly felt that ... They might have really entered a Wolf's Den.Dig a hole and use it as a nest?These words were really full of the flavor of rivers and lakes!

Chapter 2843 The Technique Of Digging Holes (1)
The chaosverse had not been quiet for long. On this day, news swept through the major worlds like a hurricane.Everyone had thought that Tian Fang's change was the whole story.However, very quickly, another piece of news spread out from the red moon region.Red moon's third rank seven venerable sovereign, venerable sovereign awakening God, had been killed in the red moon world.This was even more terrifying!  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  Red Moon Lord had killed this seventh level venerable sovereign right under her nose, within the coverage of the enemy's universe.One had to know that at such a close distance, it was actually very simple for the other party to descend.However, he did not.The red moon master seemed to be trapped, suppressed, or ignored all of this. The other party did not make a move and allowed the powerful people of this world to be killed at the door of his house.After this battle, three seventh level venerable sovereigns of the Crimson Moon died in one day!There were only five high-level venerable sovereigns in the entire Crimson Moon world. Now, the remaining two could only defend their homeland. The Crimson Moon, which was mainly aggressive, had fallen from an aggressive state to a defensive state in the confrontation with neo martial in less than fifty years.Up until now, the main forces of both sides had not come into contact on a large scale.Other than the sun god who had a brief fight with them, the rest of the senior venerable sovereigns of new martial arts had not officially fought. As a result ... The Crimson Moon world, which was one of the top rank eight worlds, was instantly at a disadvantage.Although there was still an eighth-rank venerable in charge, which was also extremely powerful in this world ... There was only a seventh-rank venerable sovereign left in Hong Yue's mobile power, which was a high-level venerable sovereign. He could not leave easily.Otherwise, he would most likely be killed.For a time, the chaos was shaking.The emergence of the tianfang great Dao universe also made many experts pay attention to it.Neo martial human King, cloud and Mist Mountain, and brilliant sun. These top powerhouses were all in tianfang.Wushan had even killed Hong Yu, possibly joining forces with new martial.On the same day, the cloud world also made a statement that Wu Shan's killing of Hong Yu might have been bewitched by the neo martial artist King. It was not the original intention of the cloud world, and it did not represent the attitude and position of the cloud world.These words ... He didn't know if he should believe them or not.If it was true, then it meant that there might be some estrangement between Wu Shan and Yun Xiao.If it was fake, it meant that the cloud world might covet the red moon.No matter what, it was a major event that everyone took seriously.As for the divine light plane, it was incomparably quiet. It didn't say anything.The Crimson Moon region and tianfang region were in chaos.In the surroundings, experts from the Scarlet sun region and the Dragon region, which were relatively further away, were also approaching the sky. Large regions usually had rank eight major worlds. Some, like the red moon region, only had one rank eight world.As for Tian Fang, there were two.For many venerable sovereigns, the four-sided domain was the entire chaos.The four regions covered a large area. A first level venerable sovereign could spend his entire life in one region and never leave.Now, some of the advanced venerable sovereigns had set out and gathered in the tianfang world. The target of the high-level venerable sovereigns was the tianfang world.In the chaos, there were obviously more than just advanced venerable sovereigns.There were also some chaos Rangers, Masters of small and medium worlds, and low-to medium venerable sovereigns of great worlds, who set off for the red moon region.One of Hong Yue's seventh level venerable sovereigns had died, and the remaining two were defending their homeland.No one dared to touch the Crimson Moon world, at least not these chaos Rangers.No one dared to touch a great world. The Lords of a great world were all seventh level venerable sovereigns. If they defended their homeland, like the Lord of Darkness, even if a human King wanted to kill him, they would have to borrow Emperor Cang's power and combine them to kill him.However ... Some people still remembered the great world.A great world that was not considered too strong to begin with, a great world that had only been born a few years ago with a great path universe, had two level six top venerable sovereigns in charge. In addition, it had the advantage of having a native world and a great path universe, as well as many middle-stage venerable sovereigns in the world ...As a result, even a tier 7 attack would find it difficult to break through Senlan, which gave Senlan a chance to gain a foothold.Who would have thought that the master of the great Dao of the forest world would actually have the intention to deal with neo martial?As a result, the last time the new martial human King dealt with The Dark World, he killed the other party along the way, causing the Senlan great Dao universe to shake and the master of the great Dao to fall. Now, although the master of the Senlan great Dao was overseeing the great Dao and could even merge the great Dao to become the combination of the Dao master and the world Master, he had not succeeded.He wouldn't be able to succeed so quickly!For a time, a large number of middle-stage venerable sovereigns had an idea. While Hong Yue was busy with her own affairs, perhaps ... They could get their hands on Sen LAN.In the primordial chaos, there were also great worlds where rank six venerable sovereigns were in charge.However, these experts were usually guarded by Dao Lords and world Lords, and they usually wouldn't leave. Before reaching Stage 7, these experts wouldn't easily leave their own worlds.Everyone knew that the great Dao universe was the easiest way to enter Level Seven.As for why Senlan Dao master dared to leave the world and deal with neo martial ... It was hard to say.And so, the quiet chaos was no longer quiet.Some advanced venerable sovereigns even swept across the world and headed straight for Tian Fang.The other group of experts headed towards the Crimson Moon.In particular, some middle-stage venerable sovereigns, sixth-stage venerable sovereigns, and many medium-level world Lords even controlled their worlds and went straight to the red moon!

Chapter 2844 The Technique Of Digging Holes (2)
Seizing the great Dao universe!He would help his world advance to a great world.The advancement of a world was something that all factions in the primordial chaos sought.Over at tianfang, the level of chaos was too high.But as for Crimson Moon ... As long as Crimson Moon didn't interfere, they could still try.……The primal Chaos began to get lively.It was no longer a pool of stagnant water.Some venerable sovereigns, who had not gone out for a long time, were tempted this time. They began to leave their worlds and even took their worlds with them. Although the speed of taking their worlds with them was very slow, with the addition of the world power, they could often erupt with more powerful power.A sixth-order medium-level world Lord, along with a medium-level world, was almost invincible among the sixth-order world Lords, although it was difficult for them to fight against a seventh-order world Lord within the coverage of the world.If a rank seven world Lord brought a great world with them, they could even compete with a rank eight world Lord in their own world, provided that the rank eight venerable Emperor was far away from their great world.……At the same time.In the red moon region.In the dark, chaotic void, Li Hao and Kong Ji watched in silence as the old man dug a hole.Could holes be made in the chaos?It can not be!Chaos was a large space. How could a hole be made in a complete large space?Li Hao couldn't do it, and neither could Kong Ji.However, the old man in front of him seemed to have done it.He had really torn apart a small part of the void in the chaos. It was not a hole. For Li Hao and the desolation, it was a Dao!A true Dao art!The old man chuckled and explained as he punched holes into chaos,""The primordial chaos can't tear open space. It is one body. Who can tear open the entire primordial chaos? Maybe a ninth-rank can, but most people can't do it. "That was what he said, but in front of him, a void really appeared."This isn't a cave, this is ..." The old man continued.Li Hao sighed and added,""This is the embryonic form of a world!""Right!""That's right!"The old man laughed. The chaos could not drill holes, but the chaos could give birth to worlds! Before the birth of every world, it was actually shapeless, incorporeal, and without a trace. It was concealed by chaos ... It was equivalent to a fruit growing out of chaos! That's why we called the world the seed world and the fruit world! A mature world can be seen, but can you see an immature world?"Kong Ji and Li Hao listened attentively. They were not ignorant people.They were very knowledgeable!One of them was the son of a rank eight master, while the other was a cultivator who had been passed down by many high-level venerable sovereigns and had mastered the Dao of time. They might not have seen it, but how many venerable sovereigns in the chaos had seen it?They all knew about seeds and fruits.However, today ... He had a different understanding.The old man continued,"how was the world born?" Originally, I didn't know either! That was until the birth of the Silver Moon ..."Li Hao's heart moved.The old man continued,'back then, neo martial went through hardships and finally resolved the strong enemy! In order to resurrect some dead cultivators, the human King chose to enter seclusion to comprehend yin and yang and resurrect the netherworld cultivators! During this process, the human King went into seclusion for many years and didn't care about the world. Emperor Cang was also lazy and slept soundly without caring about it ... Then, some energy flowed out of the new martial and silver Moon was born near the new martial!""The birth of the Silvermoon ... In the beginning, I didn't understand either, until I went to the Silvermoon to take charge ..."The old man continued to dig, and Li Hao silently observed. As he watched, his eyes flickered.This wasn't a hole!This was a world ... Even if it was just a Foundation, not even the embryonic form of a world, and only the foundation of a world, in reality, this was the process of the birth of a world.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  Venerable the sword was not simply digging holes for chaos. He was farming!If this cave had enough luck, perhaps ... It would be a world in the future.Venerable the sword continued,"there are many conditions to create a world!" There were a few key points. First, the Dao must be complete! It was like building the foundation of a house. If you didn't even have the basic materials, how could you lay the foundation? Second, it had to be able to grow. In fact, it was the source of energy ... The birth of a world consumed a lot of energy, so how could it produce energy? This requires drawing from chaos, and you have to prepare the facilities to draw energy. Otherwise, how can a world be born without energy?""Third, the origin of life!"At this point, the old man shook his head."I can't do that. I've only accomplished the first step. My Dao is still considered complete, so I can dig a hole and use it as the foundation of a world ... In reality, I can't create a world out of thin air!" Even if it was only the first step, it was shocking!Li Hao didn't say anything.At this moment, Kong Ji was also a little shaken. He said softly,""Senior, what do you mean by complete Dao?"What was a complete Dao?Who could be certain of this?"Everyone has their own standards," venerable the sword explained."However, I've observed many worlds. At the very least, the most basic elements must be the five elements, light and darkness, life and death, yin and yang ... These basic elements must be present!"Venerable the sword laughed,""Are you trying to say that I know all these? I know yin and yang? Will he die?"Kong Ji nodded.Yes, that was what he wanted to ask.You said that you have a complete set of DAOs. Doesn't that mean that you know all of them?

Chapter 2845 The Technique Of Digging Holes (3)
Venerable the sword continued,"I know a little, but I don't have a deep understanding of it. However, this is not important. My goal is not to really create a world!" I'm just concerned that if the foundation is a little weak, it might affect the future development, the potential of the world, and the difficulty of its creation ... However, I only need to understand a little, and I don't need to go too deep, and I can dig holes!""Then ... Then my father never mentioned this. Is it because my father doesn't know how to do it?"Kong Ji suddenly felt that this Level 6 cultivator, who was at the same level as him, knew more than his father."Definitely not!"Venerable the sword did not boast this time. "It's just that your father ... Doesn't need to do this! What's the point of digging a hole in the primordial chaos for your father? He wouldn't be able to escape from the person who can kill him, even if he were to dig a world out, let alone a hole!"He knew Kong Ji's identity and that his father was a level eight venerable sovereign.To such a person, wasn't digging a hole ... Embarrassing?"An existence at your father's level would definitely know how to do it. His control over the myriad DAOs wouldn't be too bad."Venerable the sword explained,"it's just ... Do you guys need these?" Do you need small worlds or even unranked worlds? With a single command from you, many small and medium worlds will fight to the death to submit to you. In that case ... Was it fun to dig a hole in the chaos? Don't you feel embarrassed?"“……”Kong Ji had nothing to say. He thought for a while and said,""But according to what senior said, this is the foundation for the creation of a world. To cultivators, this is very important!"Venerable the sword shook his head again,"no, it's not important to create a world!" For most cultivators, it's enough to be proficient in one Dao. Why do you want to dabble in so many? do you think that everyone needs to be proficient in 10000 DAOs to become a powerful expert?""Then why waste your energy to set foot in the myriad DAOs?""But senior ..." Kong Ji continued.Venerable the sword laughed,"why do you think I'm involved in the myriad DAOs?" I have no choice, I'm poor!"Poor?Kong Ji was startled. What did this mean?"In the yin-yang world, the neo martial world, there have been several rank Sevens," venerable the sword explained."Do you think a new rank seven can be born in the neo martial world?"I can 't!  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  "Since we can't ... We're still young. Do we have to wait? "Or should we just focus on invading, devouring other worlds, and strengthening ourselves? when our new martial arts become a level eight or even a level nine world, then a level Seven or level eight world will be born? How long would he have to wait? How many worlds would we have to destroy?""If that's the case ... We have to find a new path for ourselves," Sword Saint said."We have to open our own world, open our own heaven and earth, and create our own Dao. This may be the way to get out of neo martial arts."Leave?"You ... You want to leave neo martial?" Kong Ji was a little shocked.Didn't they say that the people of neo martial were very United? "Why not?" venerable the sword nodded. Do we cultivate our entire lives just to be stuck at a single point, unable to advance an inch for the rest of our lives? "Neo martial has a master now, and Fang ping is the master!""If that's the case ... We can only leave in order to have hope of a New Year. Are we supposed to kill Fang ping and replace him?"“……”Even Li Hao couldn't help but laugh and say,""Then what senior is doing is to leave neo martial and make preparations to open a world of your own?""Yes,"Li Hao hesitated for a moment, but still said,""Silvermoon is an extremely good foundation. In fact ... I also know that the birth of my great Dao is closely related to you, senior. Why don't you just take Silvermoon? why go through so much trouble?"Silvermoon's great path universe had too much to do with venerable the sword.He should know that the Silver Moon might be able to give birth to a great Dao universe very soon. Since you're pursuing this, why didn't you take the Silver Moon away earlier?Or is it because of the bloody moon's attack that you don't have time to care about this?Venerable the sword was still digging. He laughed,""It's different!""Different?"Li Hao was puzzled. Venerable the sword laughed and said, Why don't you take down the Silvermoon great Dao universe?"Li Hao was stunned and didn't say anything. "Right?" venerable the sword chuckled. You also know that other people's things may not be useful! I'm actually the same. I wasn't in charge of the Silvermoon world's birth. Simply put, I didn't build the house! And what I want is a house that is completely built by me. I want to master every blade of grass, every piece of wood, every brick, and every tile! And not ... A second-hand house!""Even if it's a new house, it's built by someone else. How do I know if the foundation of the new house is solid? How would I know if there was a bomb buried under the new house? How would I know if a new house is suitable for me ... I want to build it myself! Not only do I have to build it myself, I even have to make my own materials!"Kong Ji and Li Hao were both shocked.I even have to make my own materials!"What I want is not a new house, not a second-hand house, but a house that I've built from the beginning to the end. Whether it's nice or not, whether I can build it or not, it's completely mine!Li Hao was silent.At this moment, his thoughts were very complicated.At this moment, he thought, didn't I have the same idea when I gave up the great path universe?However, I don't think that I've thought as much as you have. I have a lot of ideas, but my real goal is not very clear. I've thought about building my own house, but it's not as clear and direct as yours.

Chapter 2846 The Technique Of Digging Holes_4
 Building a house, I want to build everything, including the materials and everything needed to build a house, by myself!It was no wonder that the sword Saint had given up on the Silver Moon.After all, he was not the one who had built Silver moon's Foundation.Li Hao's previous thought was that it didn't matter if the foundation was built by others, he would build the upper parts ... But today, someone told him that he didn't want the foundation. He wanted to build his own house from the beginning!It was no wonder that a sixth rank sword venerable was not good at any special great DAOs, such as life and death, yin and yang, but could counterattack a seventh rank!This was because he had built his own Foundation.His Foundation, his Foundation of ten thousand DAOs, was very solid.Kong Ji was also shocked and couldn't help but say,""Senior, I've seen many venerable sovereigns, and they know that the great world restricts some venerable sovereigns. But why do you have such a thought, while they don 't?"Including myself!'I've also thought of leaving the light, but why have I never thought of forging a world that belongs to me?'I just thought ... I'll just open the boundary, and maybe I can become Level Seven or eight of chaos ...'Venerable the sword laughed,"there are countless living beings in the world. Everyone wants to transcend. Who doesn't have such an idea?" There are still some ideas, but some people don't know how to do it, some people just think about it, some people are used to peace, and some people want to do it but fail!""There are too few people who are truly determined to do it without knowing what the future holds. And I ... Am just one of the people on this path, not a winner!""Just because you don't know, it doesn't mean there isn 't!""Will the other venerable sovereigns tell you the truth?" venerable the sword continued. If I tell you, Scion of light, that I'm going to run away and open up my own world, and no longer work for your family, do you think I'll tell you?"Kong Ji was a little embarrassed.Right!I'm the son of the God of Light.If the venerable sovereign of the world of light really wanted to run away, would he have told me?Li Hao tried to help."Senior, when the venerable sovereigns of the great worlds leave, they'll take away part of the power of the great DAOs. Many world Lords won't agree to it. Doesn't the human King have any requirements in this regard?" Or is it because senior has a close relationship with the human King ..."Venerable the sword shook his head,"no, even if I leave, I still want to fill in the void left by neo martial!" "This is equivalent to us using new martial's money to start a business. If the business is successful, we have to return the capital! "After all, neo martial arts is the foundation. Under normal circumstances, no one wants their hometown to be drained of blood by you and become poor ... So, if possible, we will return the principal. If we have the ability, we will give some interest ... This is called repaying a favor." "However, it's difficult for you to start your own business. You barely succeeded. If you give the capital, you won't be able to live. You can put it on credit first ... The human King is okay. He can put us on credit first because he is also making money."Li Hao finally understood!The human King's thoughts were clear. You can take the power first because I trust you. I'll put it on credit. I can earn it myself, so I'll just write you an IOU. But if you have the ability, you'll have to pay me back!"Won't that cause the power of the human King to decline?"Kong Ji asked again. This was a common problem for many great worlds.He frowned and said,"for example, there are many high-level venerable sovereigns in the world of light. If they all leave with the energy, according to what you said, I should pay them on credit. My father will be weakened. Once he is weakened, he may face great trouble!"Venerable the sword nodded and said,"the situation is different for each clan." It doesn't mean that we are right. We can only say that the human King has a close relationship with us. He believes in us and hopes that we can succeed. It's normal to fail when it comes to starting a business. Therefore, the human King is also earning money now and working hard to develop. He can help us a little ... As for how your family will be dealt with, that's your father's choice! I don't think it's a problem whether your father wants to borrow money or not. Besides, those advanced venerable sovereigns in your family may not necessarily want to start a business. This thing is also very risky!"Yes, the risk was huge.Not everyone was willing to do so."What if there are people who are willing to go out?" Kong Ji asked."The support for the neo martial arts meet ... There are some tests on the premise. Not everyone can go out and start a business ... It depends on your ability, effort, and contribution!"Venerable the sword explained again,"if you make enough contributions and are capable enough, I'll support you if you have the chance to make money!" But you're a waste. You'll definitely lose money if you take away the capital. Why should I support your business?"He chuckled,'the world Lord knows this! "Of course, there are also some world Lords who might be afraid and even don't want people to leave. It's normal. I've said that each family has their own choices, and it's not good to say right or wrong."Both Li Hao and Kong Ji were listening attentively.The young man before them had used the simplest of words to let them sense the thoughts of some of the higher-ups.Looking at the hole that was getting bigger and bigger, he wondered if it was a hole.It wasn 't!This was the foundation for starting a business. With such a Foundation, the sword venerable dared to say that he wanted to create his own world and then earn money to pay back the money.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  However, in the entire world, out of the countless venerable sovereigns, only a few ... Could do such a thing!Those who could really do it might not need to start a business.

Chapter 2847 The Technique Of Digging Holes (3)
They already had their own Foundation.After a moment of silence, Li Hao continued to observe and comprehend. He realized that the hole was actually a domain. A domain that was rooted in the depths of chaos and expanded the chaos on a small scale!This wasn't a Bandit cave. This was a small world ... Although it was only the foundation.As expected, one could not look at the surface of the path of cultivation.To venerable the sword, it was just a hole, but to Li Hao and Kong Ji, what kind of hole was this?This was telling them the nature of the world!Did the Lord God of light know this?There was a high probability!  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  However, the Lord God of light might not teach Kong Ji this. Would a rich generation teach his son how to be a good employee?You have such a huge family business to inherit, why are you being a basic level employee?You were born to be a noble!Of course, it was also difficult for Kong Ji to inherit the family business. Although his father was a million years old, would he die of old age as an eighth level venerable sovereign?It won 't!Unless he was killed, it would be very difficult for Kong Ji to inherit the family business. There was hope for him to reach the seventh level, but it was almost impossible for him to reach the eighth level, just like his father.For the Lord God of light, rank seven was enough.One day, if he really encountered a crisis and died in battle, he would at least have hope of letting his son inherit it instead of being directly destroyed.Although his son was quite talented and had a strong heart for cultivation, to the Lord God of light, he was a top tycoon and one of the tycoons in the universe. Could he really expect his son to build a large consortium?If he couldn 't, then he might as well wait to inherit the family business.At this moment, the two young cultivators no longer looked at venerable the sword like he was a Bandit. Instead, they looked at him like he was a high-end cultivator.Even though this person's words were a little rough and his actions were a little wild.However, the other party was indeed a rare cultivator.Not only him, but Lizhu, whom he had met last time, was also one of them.These people ... Were all different.Perhaps other worlds also had them, but they didn't dare to show it. For example, Wushan actually had his own goal, but he didn't dare to show it too obviously. This had to do with the general atmosphere of the world."Some major cosmos absolute beings don't support you in doing so. If you show it, it means that you're ambitious and might die!At this moment, the two of them were just silently observing and watching.What the sword venerable had said before was full of Jianghu spirit and Bandit spirit. There was no need to care about it or learn it.However, this person's usage of Dao, comprehension, and understanding were all worth learning. Li Hao looked at the small hole that appeared out of thin air. After a while, he suddenly said,""Senior, can I enter and comprehend it?""Of course!"Venerable the sword laughed. He couldn't tell that this was the overbearing and sharp swordsman from before.Kong Ji was a little embarrassed, but he also opened his mouth,""Then, I ...""Just come in!"Venerable the sword said,"we're here to build a nest. If we don't come in, are we supposed to wait outside?" It's just that it hasn't been completed yet ..."It was precisely because it was not completed that they wanted to personally enter and take a look. Without saying anything, Li Hao and Kong Ji entered the not-so-big and incomplete cave. It was the first time they had seen and experienced a cave in the chaos.The moment he entered, it was as if space had changed.It felt like he had entered a small world ... But there was a huge difference.Strong winds swept across, and the air of chaos overflowed. Space became unstable, and turbulence cut ...Anyone below venerable sovereign would die if they entered this place!When Sword Saint saw the two of them enter, he followed them in and blocked the entrance of the cave. Soon, the small cave disappeared in the chaos.Unless a top-tier venerable sovereign could search the area bit by bit, where else could they find it in the vast chaos?Venerable the sword sealed the hole and continued to stabilize it. He used the power of his great Dao and said,""In the chaos, I can build more of these caves. Who knows, they might come in handy one day.""Of course, it's a little tiring. But it doesn't matter. Every construction is actually a sorting out of the great Dao!""Many of the caves I built in the past have collapsed, but some of the ones I built later are still intact. If you encounter a strong enemy in the chaos ... You won't be able to hide or escape. At that time, you'll be happy to meet your safe house!"Venerable the sword chuckled, while Li Hao and the other man silently comprehended.The space in the cave wasn't stable, and it didn't have the stability of a small world. Li Hao pondered for a moment, then said,""This space, can it move?"Sword Saint nodded."Actually, chaos is moving. But it's very slow. So don't worry. As long as it's not tens of millions of years, you won't notice it moving.""Then is the flow of time the same?"Venerable the sword nodded."It's the same. It's not isolated from the chaos. This is not a small world. It's just a hole. It can't be completely sealed like a small world!" If it was completely sealed, there would be some time difference! In the past, there was a legend that said that a day in heaven is a year in the human world ... In fact, it is a time difference formed by the intersection of two different spaces and different energies!"Li Hao, who had gained some insight, looked at venerable the sword.""Senior, you also have some understanding of time?""Not really," venerable the sword laughed,"just some basic ideas."Li Hao didn't ask any more questions.As for Kong Ji, he was also very curious and even a little impatient.""Senior, then this world ... No, this hole, is it in a state of Nirvana?"

Chapter 2848 The Technique Of Digging Holes (1)
"No."Sword Saint shook his head,"it's active, not destructive. It's just that it doesn't have life!" On the whole, chaos was active and full of vitality. Otherwise, how could it give birth to worlds? Don't be fooled by its quietness. You're just in your original state. Chaos is not a destructive chaos, but a large, active space!"Venerable the sword's comprehension of Dao was extremely clear.Li Hao was amazed and touched. No wonder the Silver Moon could give birth to a great Dao universe.If venerable the sword had stayed in Silver Moon, he might have already become a seventh rank venerable sovereign!At this moment, both he and Kong Ji felt that they had not made a wasted trip. Even if they did not get a single bit of the energy they had seized from the seventh level venerable sovereign they had killed, they did not feel that they had suffered any losses.Li Hao no longer spoke. Instead, he fell silent and his Shi merged into the small cave.Since the sword venerable had allowed them in, he wouldn't stop them from comprehending. At this moment, Li Hao also wanted to see the difference between this cave and the river he had created.It was the consolidation of the Dao!Why couldn't the river he formed become a small space hidden in chaos?Kong Ji was the same. The two of them fell silent and fell into deep thought.Venerable the sword continued with his work and did not care about them.Digging holes was a technical job.These two kids did not understand these things yet, but they had the potential to do so. Not everyone could dig a hole in the chaos. Even some seventh level venerable sovereigns might not be able to do it, because those guys might not really have a deep understanding of the great Dao.It was very tiring to dig a hole alone.Ever since Fang ping had run away, he had been the one to dig holes. These two little fools ... If the young man could master it, he could use it as labor and would not need to dig holes himself.Just like that, it lasted for about three days.Li Hao opened his eyes. In his eyes, life and death, Nirvana, and resurrection were in turns. When he looked at the small cave again, it was different.The weaving of Dao!It was the feeling of playing Dao chess.This cave, the so-called burrowing and the so-called Foundation, was actually a kind of weaving technique of Dao. In the chaos, a cage was woven and this cage was embedded in the chaos!This was the cave in the chaos!In his eyes, the essence of the cave appeared. The Dao formed a domain, and this domain supported the cave.He observed silently. This arrangement seemed to be a little different from the Dao chess.Li Hao didn't say anything.When Kong Ji opened his eyes, Li Hao looked at venerable the sword, who was sitting cross-legged and recovering his energy. Li Hao said,""Senior ..." "It's too distant to call you senior. Are you a descendant of the Li family of sword city? If you are, you can call me ancestor. If not, you can call me old Li!"“……”Li Hao felt strange. After a while, he said,""I don't know if it's true, but it's been a hundred thousand years since senior left! 100,000 years is too long, so I'm not sure if I'm a descendant of the Li family. But before that, I considered myself a descendant of the Li family. ""Oh!"Venerable the sword nodded his head and said nothing. He smiled and said,""Then call me old man Li, uncle li, or uncle li, whatever you want!"  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  Li Hao was speechless. He actually wanted to say that the Li family ... Had been destroyed!,m However, he didn't know how to describe it when he looked at venerable the sword.He thought for a while and realized that the sword tree cultivators were still in his River. Just as he was about to speak, venerable the sword said, "Let's catch up later, let's talk about business first. "Li Hao put this matter aside for the time being and asked,""Uncle ... Uncle li ..."This form of address was a little awkward.Li Hao didn't say anything else. He quickly said,""I once comprehended in tianfang Dao chess that the order in which thousands of DAOs can be weaved is different from the order in which senior maintains this cave ..."Venerable the sword laughed,"understood!" "Actually, it's normal for the order to be different. You have to understand that be it combat techniques or DAOs, their essence is actually a series of finely divided DAOs, vitality, and energy. If your structure is different, it's actually a different substance, a different Dao, and a different domain! Dao was not the only one!“"In other words, the different weaving order will produce different great DAOs as the main DAOs, great Dao worlds, great Dao domains, and great Dao universes! For example, light is the main force, darkness is the main force, space is the main force ... This is the difference in the order!""My Dao is naturally the sword Dao!""The prerequisite is that it must be stable!"Venerable the sword explained,"as long as you don't weave it randomly, it's up to you how you weave it." What you're learning ... Should be the sky-stealing sun-changing technique, right? He's also weaving Dao, and different Dao domains have appeared. Your domain and this young man's Nirvana world are actually the same in essence, but the cores are different!""Have you ever played with building blocks?"He suddenly laughed. Li Hao nodded, and venerable the sword continued,""You should know that you can build a castle with building blocks, and you can also build other things with them. Dao is made of building blocks, but it is also a brick. Who set the rule that it has to be a building?"He could build whatever he wanted, as long as it didn't collapse!Li Hao was touched again. He said,""So, the ten thousand DAOs are bricks and building blocks?""Right, it's such a simple logic!"Was it simple?Perhaps!The words of the sword venerable reminded Li Hao of his teacher. His teacher had once told him that some things were actually very simple in their eyes.

Chapter 2849 The Technique Of Digging Holes (3)
As long as you could think about it, it was just a basic thing.However, the key was ... How many people could jump out?Li Hao looked at his own River and the stars. His stars were arranged according to the order in the game. According to li Changsheng, it did not have to be so.It didn't mean that they had to be the same.Instead, it was because different weaving methods could succeed.However, you may fail during this period, and if you fail, you'll have to start all over again.At this thought, Li Hao said, I'll try different methods to weave it ... If I succeed, it might be a different little realm! If I use light as my master, I might be able to weave a divine world of light. If I use darkness as my master, I might be able to weave a divine World of Darkness ... If I fail, I'll be able to create a collapsed major world ...""That's true, but it's too complicated, too troublesome, and too time-consuming!" Normal people wouldn't do such a thing. "Li Hao chuckled.At this time, he fell into deep thought. I have learned a lot, but there are very few things that can be put into practice.'What if ... I'm willing to try?'Constructing a different system, creating his own myriad worlds, perfecting his own great Dao system ... Could he copy the chaos and create an internal greater world?"I can use different methods of weaving to create different worlds. Some might be very strong, some might be very weak, some might succeed, and some might fail .... But in the end, will I be able to come up with the most suitable and most compatible method to fuse 10000 DAOs?However, this was too difficult.Many conditions were required, one of which was unlimited energy. Without enough great Dao power and energy, how could one do it?Chaotic energy?One thought after another instantly filled his mind.The sword saint's words made him a little more impulsive. Maybe I shouldn't just think about it, but try it out. No matter how nice it sounds, no matter how much I've comprehended, how can it compare to personally trying it out?However, his current Foundation wasn't too stable.It needed to be more stable. It needed other great DAOs to be more stable and perfect so that they could truly bear the role of a brick.Now, his own Dao was just a small stone. Even if it was created, it would only be a tofu-like project.Perhaps ... I should tear down the great Dao universe and see how the other great Dao universes are organized ...Thinking of this, he was stunned and looked at venerable the sword,""Uncle li, have you torn down the great Dao universe before?"Even Kong Ji was stunned.As for venerable the sword, he laughed and said,"yes, I did. Why? do you want to try it?" It's actually very fun ... Of course, the last time I tore down the martial arts origin world, I was almost bitten to death by the blue cat. I don't recommend you to try it unless it's a last resort. "“……”Li Hao was speechless.You ... You're dismantling the origin of neo martial arts?It's really not easy for you to live to this day. It's only because the human King is protecting you, otherwise ... You'll be hacked to death when you tear down the great Dao universe! As for Kong Ji, he couldn't help but ask,'are you going to tear apart the great Dao universe and distinguish the different weaving methods? Or was it because the order of the fusion of various DAOs was different? It sounds pretty good ... But it's hard to restore it, right?""Very difficult!" Venerable the sword nodded. "The last time I dismantled new martial, I almost couldn't restore it. Fortunately, I found old Zhang ... I mean, the Supreme one in advance and made a copy. He helped me restore it. If you want to dismantle the divine light plane, I suggest you ask your father to keep a copy first ..."“……”Kong Ji looked at him in a daze.'Is this person instigating me to die?'If I dared to tear down the great Dao universe of the world of light, would I still be the Lord God of light if my father did not beat me to death?Was this person still considered a normal person?He was a little helpless, but a thought arose in his heart ...'If I really tear down the world of light and study it, will my father ... Really kill me?'Would he?I can't ... I can't think about it!He quickly suppressed the thought. This person was too terrifying. He was a devil. He had never thought of tearing down the world of light in his life. Why did he have such a thought now?But what Li Hao heard was that the Supreme martial artist had restored the great Dao!His heart moved slightly, and he was also a little shocked.Lizhu, venerable sword, Supreme ... Why did these people have such a deep understanding of the Dao?Just because ... He was poor?Could being poor really make one work hard?I'm also quite poor!As for venerable the sword, his devilish voice was heard again,""We didn't have many opportunities in the past, but since the two of you are interested ... Next, we'll tear down our houses together. There are many great worlds here in the Crimson Moon, and we can tear them down as much as we want ... We'll tear down a few more houses. At that time, the seventh step will be officially open to US!"Her heart was beating rapidly.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  It wasn't just one person, but three.The three of them looked at each other. You look at me, I look at you ... Is this ... Appropriate?Wasn't it too dangerous to tear down someone else's Dao universe?That was too much!Venerable the sword laughed. His smile was extremely bright."Why are you looking at me? you said you wanted to tear down the house first, and then I suggested it. I didn't say you wanted to tear it down."Li Hao looked at Kong Ji, who swallowed his saliva. After a while, he nodded reluctantly.p I ... Must not expose my identity!Otherwise, he would not be able to live!
