ere's some connection ..."
 As Li Hao thought of this, he tightened his grip on the small sword at his waist. If it was related, the small sword might be of great use.
 As the eight types of energy entered the wall, the entire cliff seemed to be affected.
 After a while, the cliff seemed to have turned into a mirror.
 It was a little transparent!
 At this moment, some of the supers were also in awe, and they all had a surprised expression.
 "Ancient civilization ... It's unbelievable!"
 Someone exclaimed in surprise. The technology of the ancient civilization was a little too advanced.
 In today's era, many things were discovered through the exploration of archaeological ruins.
 Even the path of martial masters had a lot to do with the ancient civilization.
  The superpower that had only risen recently was also related to the ancient civilization. And not only that, there were also a large number of advanced technologies, such as the cars of today, the helicopters of last night, and many other aspects that were related to the ancient civilization.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The star dynasty's rapid advancement from an Agricultural Society to today's half-high-tech, half-superpower society was all related to the ancient civilization.
 The Silver City's Silver City ancient Academy was also specially established for ancient civilizations.
 Yuan Shuo had been teaching there.
 It was said that the star dynasty was able to unify the world because of the ancient civilization. The royal family of the star dynasty might have excavated a huge ancient relic and obtained many high-tech items, including some so-called city-destroying weapons.
 It was precisely because of this that such a large star dynasty could be unified. Otherwise, with the social standard of that year, you could lose a province in a few days. The key was that you might not even know if you lost it.
 At this moment, the supers and Li Hao were amazed.
 Behind the cliff, there was actually another cave.
 If that was the case ... Did it mean that the transverse Canyon had existed since ancient times?
 Otherwise, the entrance wouldn't be on the cliff of the canyon.
 If the cross-section Canyon had existed since ancient times ... Was this city really buried and not built underground?
 Building a giant city Underground!
 Just thinking about it made the ancient people feel that it was unbelievable!
 Slowly, the cliff began to calm down. Hou Xiaochen looked at it and spoke again,"You can enter now. The entrance will remain open for half an hour. "Everyone can enter together or one after another ... In addition, it will close in half an hour. The earliest it will open is 12 tonight. In addition, it will open at 12 every night for the first three days. However, if we miss these three days, we can only wait for next month ... Next month ... We probably won't be able to come out alive!"
 Everyone was shocked.
 "Has any of the night watchmen lived in there for a month?" the Samsara King asked with a frown.
 "No, I didn 't,"
  Hou Xiaochen shook his head,"it's very dangerous inside. Let alone a month, it'll be good enough if you can come out alive before the third day." Let's put it this way, we've only been exploring the outer city, and this underground city is divided into the inner and outer city. There's actually nothing good in the outer city, and only by entering the inner city can we possibly obtain great benefits. That's why we've asked everyone to enter together this time, hoping that everyone can work together to enter the inner city!"  After saying this, he smiled."Alright, let's not talk about other things. You know what you don't know. It's not like you haven't arranged for people to go in. Why are you asking so many questions?"
 How could the large organizations enter without any preparation?
 You must be joking!
 After all, there were quite a number of night watchers, and not all of them were loyal. There were also spies who had already leaked the news of the exploration.
 As soon as he said that, Hong Yitang explained,""I really don't know much about it. Minister hou, please don't misunderstand."
 Hou Xiaochen smiled but didn't say anything.
 Was it?
 If you say so, then so be it.
 At this moment, as the waves calmed down, the large organizations stared at the entrance. Should they enter together or one by one?
 Also, would it be dangerous inside?
 With that in mind, they looked at the members of the small organizations who were eager to try. Suddenly, Ziyue said coldly,""You guys go in first!"
 As soon as he said that, the members of the small organizations were a little hesitant, but some were excited.
 They knew that this meant that they were asked to Scout the way.
 However, since he was already here, why would he be afraid of this?
 Those who dared to come were either not afraid of death or hoped to make a fortune.
 It was dangerous to enter first, but it also meant that there might be a greater harvest.
  Even though the night patrolmen had already explored the area a few times, so what?
 Without needing Zi Yue's urging, three to five figures instantly burst out and crashed into the wave-like cliff. In an instant, as if a drop of water had fallen into it, the few of them disappeared before them.
 In the crowd, there was an expert who used a special ability. His eyes shone as he looked at the cliff, but he quickly frowned and couldn't see anything.
 As expected, just like the information he received, he lost contact with the outside world after entering.
 Even if they were only separated by a wall, they would not be able to see what was happening inside.
 With someone taking the lead, the experts from the small organizations didn't care too much anymore. Someone shouted in a low voice,""Let's go in. We're here to take a gamble. There's no need to hesitate!"
 As soon as he finished speaking, another group of people rushed in.
 It might be safer to rush in first.
 Those who entered later would have to be careful of the large organizations ambushing them from behind. That would be dangerous.
 In the blink of an eye, thirty to forty members of the small organization had all entered.

 Seeing that they had all gone in, the night patrolmen were not in a hurry.
 "Let's hurry up!"Hou Xiaochen said.
 Seeing that everyone was worried, he smiled and said,""How about this, the swords gate will go first, then Fei Tian, the Nightwalker, Hong Yue, Yama ..."
 On the Yama's side, the Samsara King frowned and looked at him.
 Why were they the last?
 Hou Xiaochen laughed,"you guys can do whatever you want. We'll just stay in the middle. That's to prevent you guys from entering first. Once you're inside, you'll quickly join forces to surround us. This is also for the sake of peace."
 The reincarnation King thought for a moment."Fei Tian was the last to enter. He didn't come halfway up the mountain. He has no right to make irresponsible remarks!"
 As for swords gate, it would be good for him to enter first.
 If there was danger, they would bear it first.
 Without danger, these guys wouldn't be able to do anything.
  Hong Yitang didn't really care. He listened to the arrangement and smiled."Then we won't stand on ceremony. Everyone, we'll meet inside!"
 After saying that, he was the first to step into it.
 Soon, the others entered one after another, including his daughter. As for the danger ... If he, Hong Yitang, really died inside, his daughter wouldn't have a good end either. These old martial masters were very clear about this.
 He might as well keep his daughter by his side, in case she became a tool for others to threaten him.
 After swords gate entered, the Samsara King did not hold back, he immediately brought the Yama's men and followed them in.
 Feitian didn't say anything against it.
 These cloaked men were shockingly low-profile.
 When the Yama's people had entered, it was time for the night patrol.
 At this moment, Liu Long was pulling Li Hao and Liu Yan with his other hand. He said in a low voice,""Come with me, be careful not to separate!"
 As for Wang Ming, he didn't need his care.
 Wang Ming knew a lot of people here.
 Li Hao didn't say anything. He just looked around, feeling a little strange. Heibao still hadn't come out today. Could he have been killed and eaten?
 It can't be!
 Black Panther, that dog, was still very smart.
 Now that he was about to enter, it didn't appear. Was it not willing to enter?
 It didn't matter if he was unwilling.
 It was definitely dangerous inside, but outside ... It might not be safe either. When they entered, who knew how many experts would come? if they encountered a dog that was about to become a spirit, wouldn't they kill it and eat its meat?
 Li Hao didn't have time to think about this, nor did he care.
 At this moment, Hu dingfang was the first to step in, followed by Hao lianchuan.
 There were still some people in front of them. After they had all entered, Li Hao and the other two rushed into the cliff.
 Following that, the people from the red moon and the flying heavens entered one after another.
 ,m Not long after, only a few night patrollers and a few members of other organizations were left outside the arena.  Hong Yue and the others didn't all enter, but left some Yue Ming behind.
 It was not a pity to be killed. If he was not killed, he could wait for the arrival of the strong ones. This time, because of Yuan Shuo, the strong ones from all the large organizations would come. However, they would not come so quickly and would need some time.
 The people who had stayed behind quickly disappeared. Each and every one of them was trembling in fear, afraid that hou Xiaochen would kill them.
 As for hou Xiaochen, he didn't even look at it.
 There was no point in killing them.
 He just watched silently, watching as the wall was about to turn back into a cliff ... At this moment, a Black Dog suddenly rushed over from a distance and crashed into the wall in an instant.
 Just as Chief Steward Yu was about to stop him, hou Xiaochen gently shook his head and chuckled,"Let it in ... I think I've heard of it before. It's yuan Shuo's dog."
 "Yuan Shuo ..." He said.
 Chief Steward Yu looked around and frowned slightly.""Is Yuan Shuo still around here?"
 Yuan Shuo was a Martial Master, so it would be easy for him to hide his identity.
 "It's hard to say. It's normal for Yuan Shuo to do anything. Who knows if he's hiding somewhere to recuperate or not hiding at all?"
 "Let's go,"hou Xiaochen said with a smile," the entrance's sealed. We'll come back tonight. We'll go up and wait. I don't know if anyone will arrive today. If we're fast, the people from the central continent might not arrive, but the neighbors might. "
 The central region was far away, and it might take some time.
 However, it was not as if there were no other provinces near Silver Moon.
 The large organizations might transfer some powerhouses over at the last minute, or the night patrolmen next door might also come. Who knew?
 Chief Steward Yu helped him out and said softly,""Will they start fighting as soon as they enter?"
 "No, they will at least understand the situation. They are all supers. Although they are impulsive, they are not fools. They will start killing as soon as they enter. Whether they can come out alive is a problem."
 ……
 At the same time.
 On the cliff of the transverse Canyon.
 A figure appeared and coughed lightly. His face was slightly pale as he looked at hou Xiaochen from afar, then back at the sealed cliff, and smiled.
  "You're on your own!"
 He looked into the distance. Soon, there would be experts coming.
 After walking into the distance for a while, a person suddenly walked out from behind a huge rock.
 Yuan Shuo coughed and looked at the person in surprise.""What are you doing here?"
 "Master!"
 The person who came looked very young and delicate, but he was dressed in a capable and experienced manner. He had his long hair tied up in a ponytail and was somewhat complaining."I came with dingfang last night and got off the plane first. I knew you wouldn't have left!"
 "What?"
 Yuan Shuo frowned.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Little Junior Brother is here. If you didn't see him enter the ruins and hou Xiaochen didn't hand him over, would you have left?"
 Chen Yuhua grumbled,"I already told you that you were seriously injured, but you were still loitering around. I knew that you would only be at ease after seeing Little Junior Brother enter the remains with your own eyes. As expected, I found you here!"

 "Why are you squatting down?" Yuan Shuo frowned.
 After he finished speaking, he walked away.
 Chen Yuhua quickly followed."Master, are you seriously injured?" Now everyone is looking for you, come back to the White moon City with me. The military camp is the safest, no matter how bold they are, they wouldn't dare to trespass the garrison!"
 "The encampment of the Tiger wing Army is the most suitable place for master to recuperate ..."
 "Get lost!"
 Yuan Shuo seemed to be a little impatient, and Chen Yuhua was a little sad.""Master!"
 Yuan Shuo said coldly as he walked,"who's your master?" Back then, I took you in because I wanted you to inherit my legacy. You are my last disciple in martial arts, and Li Hao is my inheritor of knowledge! Five birds technique, five birds breathing technique, which of them have I not taught you? I was thinking that if you were able to enter the thousand warrior realm, you would be able to strengthen the Dao of five birds ... But you're good. After you go to the White moon City, I don't care whether you join the military or the night patrollers ..."
 At this point, he was somewhat annoyed and angry.""How dare you teach Hu dingfang my breathing technique of five birds!"
 "If it was 20 years ago, I would have killed you with one palm!" You're betraying the sect! Otherwise, with Hu dingfang's aptitude, how could he be worthy of today's achievements? You bastard!"
 He was furious!
  The woman in front of him was the last disciple he had planned to pass on his martial arts to. Li Hao's incident was an accident, and he had no intention of learning martial arts.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, this female disciple, the youngest disciple back then, had secretly imparted martial arts.
 ? Therefore, when Li Hao asked about his Senior Sister, he rarely mentioned her.
 Even if she did, she would be like the last time, an old hag with a yellow face, and there was nothing to remember.
 It was obvious that Yuan Shuo was still angry.
 And according to his own temper, if it was a few years earlier, he would have really cleaned up the house!
 "Master, I know I'm in the wrong." Chen Yuhua's face was filled with sorrow. "But you had so many enemies back then. Dingfang is already a general in the military and he's also very talented. When he becomes strong, he can also protect master ..."
 She only hoped to protect her master better, but it was indeed a great taboo in the martial arts world to secretly pass on martial arts.
 It was just that at that time, Wu Lin ... Had almost disappeared.
 Yuan Shuo's face was cold. He ignored her and walked away.
 Chen Yuhua kept following him."Master, look. Dingfang's strong now, so he can protect little brother. Hou Xiaochen's an old fox. Little brother might not be safe with him. With dingfang around, he might not care about you, but he'll have to consider dingfang's feelings ..."
 "Get lost!"
 Yuan Shuo was furious, but he couldn't be bothered with him.
  Chen Yuhua continued,"master, it's okay if you don't want to acknowledge me. But you're in danger now. Also, when Junior Brother comes out, he'll be in danger too. I hope that he can join the Tiger wing Army. That way, he'll be safer than the night patrolman."  Yuan Shuo turned around and glanced at her, frowning.""If you dare to make any random arrangements and interfere ... Not only you, but I'll also kill Hu dingfang! Was the late stage of three yang very strong? And you, look at you after you enter the thousand warrior class. Are you even qualified to call me master? A warrior like you can't even compare to Liu Long! Don't call me master, you're not qualified!"
 He was extremely angry."It's a good five birds technique and five birds force. It's difficult for me to let you gather Five Forces to advance, but I said that you need at least two or three forces to advance. You advanced with one force!"
 He was in a somewhat berserk state,"it'll be more difficult to comprehend force after entering the warrior of thousands!" Why are we still unwilling to step into the universe ocean tier? You're very capable? You're a good-for-nothing Qian Dou! You secretly passed on martial arts to Hu dingfang. Fine, I won't talk about this. You actually advanced to the thousand-man combat stage in advance for that dog. Do you even have me as your master in your eyes?"
 Chen Yuhua was silent.
 Back then, in order to save Hu dingfang, she had indeed advanced in rank. She had only comprehended one force, and it was the relatively weak deer force. As a result, although she was also a warrior Qian master, strictly speaking ... She was not very strong. She was not much different from an ordinary superpower.
 Even though he had been in the warrior dimension for a few years, he could only fight with some in the middle and late stages of the sun glory realm. He was probably no match for those in the peak of the sun glory realm.
 This was clearly not in line with Yuan Shuo's expectations.
 "You ..." Yuan Shuo was going crazy."You're extremely talented and have comprehended force long ago. Therefore, you're the greatest hope of my Dao of five birds. But what happened in the end?" If you were able to fuse the five Forces, I would forgive you even if you secretly taught me a secret technique, but for him, you crippled your own martial Dao.....I will kill him sooner or later!"
 This was the true last disciple he had accepted.
 If they were not talented and had poor comprehension, would he, Yuan Shuo, accept them?
 Good Lord, a trip to the White moon City and he's gone, the secret technique is gone, and even his martial path is half-broken.
 Deer power?
  You'd rather not advance!
 No one had expected that Yuan Shuo's disciple had already entered the warrior dimension. Everyone had thought that Silver Moon martial forest had long lost its warrior dimension.
 As for Yuan Shuo, he had never publicized it, praised it, or even showed it off.
 In his eyes, this was not an honor, but a disgrace.
 A douqian who had only comprehended deer force?
 For what?
 Was it for escaping?
 My strongest inheritor of the five birds technique is just this?
 Chen Yuhua was speechless. She lowered her head and didn't say anything."Master, let's go to the military camp. It's safer there. By the way, I've prepared a lot of wine and meat for you. I've also informed people to hunt down Crimson Moon experts and see if they can extract the blood God's clones to help you recover ... Also, before dingfang went in, he said that he would bring some blood gods out when he came out ..."
 "Get lost!"

 Yuan Shuo scolded again.
 Chen Yuhua continued to follow him."Master, don't be angry. It's been so many years. Besides, didn't Shidi break through a hundred perfection now? You yourself have also stepped into the spirit accumulation stage, and the five birds sect's reputation is flourishing. After all, I'm only a woman, so it would be a disgrace to say that I'm your last disciple ... I think that Junior Brother is quite good. You see, it's not convenient for you to show your face now, but I can ask his brother-in-law to take care of him ... Otherwise, how can you expect me to take care of him? I'm just a cheater, how can I take care of him, isn't that right?"
 "Dogshit!"
 Yuan Shuo cursed again.
 "Master, we can't stay here for too long, be careful of the enemy!" Chen Yuhua comforted. Come with me first. By the way, I contacted eldest senior brother the year before last ... Eldest senior brother is doing well now. Let's go find eldest senior brother for a drink and a chat tomorrow ..."
 Yuan Shuo stopped in his tracks and frowned.""He's not dead yet?"
 "Master, don't hold grudges," Chen Yuhua consoled."Eldest senior brother did it to protect you back then ..."
 "Nonsense!"
 Yuan Shuo snorted,"he's not my disciple. Li Hao is my only disciple!" F * ck, what right does a guy who just cut ten states have to call himself my disciple? I asked him to break through 100 States, but he insisted on breaking through 10 states ... Tell him to get lost!"
 He did not stop his disciples from becoming supers, but for his eldest disciple, he hoped that he could break through 100 before he became a super. In the end, his eldest disciple could not take it and became a super after cutting ten pinnacle stage, which made him angry for a long time.
  Chen Yuhua whispered,"master, don 't! For Little Junior brother's sake, you have to!" He's in the central region and has joined the star Army formed by the military law Division. He's the main superpower of the military law Division and has now advanced to the three suns ..."
 "Hehe!"
 Yuan Shuo ridiculed again,"what's wrong with the three suns?" I've killed a bunch of three suns! If he had listened to me and broken through 100 levels, he might have become a three yang and above superhuman by now. Three yang ... What a disgrace!"
 “……”
 Chen Yuhua was helpless."Master, not everyone is like you. You can merge the five Forces. Otherwise, there would be more than one Grandmaster in Wulin."
 Yuan Shuo's face was ashen as he looked at her.
 What did she want to say?
 Old demon Yuan?
 Is it something you can shout?
 "Hu dingfang, right?"
 "Did you learn it because Hu dingfang calls you that every day?" he looked at her coldly.
 "...No!"
 Chen Yuhua quickly shook her head.
 If he really admitted it, dingfang would definitely be finished.
 "I'll get even with that dog sooner or later!"
 At this point, Yuan Shuo snorted coldly,"I'm in a good mood, so I won't argue with you guys over this." And don't tell others that you're my disciple ..."
 At this point, he snorted and continued,""You've fused with deer force. Deer mainly focuses on the liver, which is wood. You can try to nourish the five internal organs. Deer force fuses with the liver and contains the spirit of the wood deer!"
 He briefly explained and finally said,""Don't try it rashly ... If you don't understand anything, you can ask Li Hao. "
 "Master!"
 Chen Yuhua looked excited. Master seemed to be ... Not angry anymore?
 Yuan Shuo sneered,"don't tell anyone that you're my disciple. You're no longer!" I'm just telling you that a Martial Master has a much better future than your Hu dingfang!"
 As soon as he finished speaking, he stomped on the ground, rose into the air, and quickly disappeared.
 Chen Yuhua quickly gave chase, but she couldn't catch up.
 Yuan Shuo had long disappeared from the wilderness.
 Previously, the old man was so angry that he wanted to shake her off ... But he was only walking, not really shaking her off. If he really wanted to shake her off, with his current strength, he would have long since left her behind.
 He walked and dragged for a long time before finally mentioning the method of accumulating spirit energy.
 Chen Yuhua had been by his side for ten years, all because he wanted to see his disciple more.
 It was much longer than Li Hao.
 However, she was indeed heartbroken.
 But now, after stepping into the spirit accumulation stage, he felt a little more at ease.
 This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Chen Yuhua chased after him, but she could no longer see Yuan Shuo. She suddenly felt sad and sad.  Her master's temper was too stubborn. All these years, she had gone to the Silver City several times, but she had been driven away directly. Things had been smashed, and Yuan Dada had been so angry that he had not allowed her to go back.
 He was a little better now. He didn't know if it was because he had taken in a new disciple, but the little Junior brother's performance in martial arts was not bad. It made his master's dusty heart shine again.
 Chen Yuhua couldn't catch up with Yuan Shuo. She sighed a little, but she quickly became excited again.
 This time, his master had even passed on the method of accumulating spirit energy, which meant that he was sentimental. It was just that the old man was too stubborn and was unwilling to say it.
 This was a good thing!
 The premise was that nothing happened to his Little Junior Brother. Otherwise, with master's temper, if his Little Junior Brother died and he didn't have much achievement in martial arts, his good face today would probably be frozen in an instant.
 "Dingfang, you have to protect Little Junior Brother ... If he really dies in the remains ... Master might really kill you!"
 Chen Yuhua started to feel nervous again.
 This time, Hu dingfang led the team in.
 Any injury to his Junior Brother would be a huge problem. Hu dingfang would never be able to get past his master in this life.
 ……
 At the same time.
 In the ruins.
 On the edge of the huge outer city wall, Hu dingfang felt a splitting headache, as if his head was about to explode!
 "Where's Li Hao?"
 His head was really about to explode!
 Where was Li Hao, whom his wife had told him to protect?
 That stubborn old man, Yuan Shuo, had always wanted to kill him ... He could only hope that he could protect Li Hao this time and resolve the conflict.
 But ... Where was Li Hao?
 Hu dingfang panicked!
 We're finished!
 They had come in together, but when they counted the people, Li Hao, Liu Long, and Liu Yan had disappeared.
 It's fine if those two disappeared, but Li Hao can't be harmed.
 He was on the verge of tears. As the commander of the Tiger wing Army, he really wanted to find a place to cry.
 "My life ... Is so F * cking bitter!"
 He looked around. The people who came in before him had already left, and the people who came after him had also quickly disappeared from the entrance. Only the night patrols were all looking at him.
 The other three suns, Hao lianchuan, did not have much of an expression on his face. He was just a little confused."Li Hao and the others are gone? Is the location of the teleportation different?"
 After saying that, he didn't pay much attention and casually said,""It's fine. There have been some in the past, but it's very rare. Three of them disappeared at once, even fewer. They might have been teleported to another place."
 "Really?"
  Hu dingfang seemed to have seen hope. He grabbed his arm and said anxiously,""He didn't die?"
 "You're sick!"
 Hao lianchuan cursed. What was he doing?
 What's with you, a commander, instead of exploring the ruins?
 It was just that they were not teleported together. Although it was rare, it was not as if they had never been teleported together.
 At this moment, Hu dingfang wasn't angry. Instead, he was overjoyed."It's good that you're fine, it's good that you're fine. Hao lianchuan, you're fine even if you die, but Li Hao can't die. If he really dies and goes back, don't even think about living anymore."
 "Let's go and explore the ruins!"
 Hu dingfang waved his hand and set off quickly. He had to find Li Hao as soon as possible. Although he might not die after being teleported, it would be troublesome if he lost the teleportation.
 "If I'm not careful and run into danger ahead of time, and I'm not around, I'll be killed ... I'd rather be in despair now.
 [PS: tomorrow's Saturday. Tomorrow's 1pm, and the weekend's 3pm.] He had something to do tomorrow, so if he changed it, the total update would still be the same. As for whether it would be in the morning or at night, it was not certain. If they woke up early, it would be in the morning. If they woke up late, they would finish their work and come back to update.

 In the darkness, there seemed to be a light flashing in the distance, like the eyes of a wild beast in the wilderness.
 This was what Li Hao was feeling at the moment.
 The surroundings were silent.
 It was as if he was stepping on hard stones, as if he was walking in an empty alley.
 Until he heard a slight panting sound beside him.
 Li Hao finally realized that he wasn't alone.
 Liu Long turned his head and saw that he was very nervous.
 He couldn't see very clearly, but with the eyesight of a Martial Master with over 100 cultivation, he was able to make out a rough outline even in the dark. However, he was still affected by some interference.
 On the other side, Liu Yan was also a little flustered as she looked around.
 He had just broken through to the late-stage of the 100-level cultivation realm. In this quiet environment, it was indeed a little suffocating.
  He seemed to hear the footsteps of other people.
 However, the feeling of being separated by a layer was not that clear.
 The sound of footsteps!
 At first, they thought it was the night patrolman, but soon, they realized that it was not the night patrolman.
 The sound of the footsteps continued to ring out, but it did not get closer.
 It seemed to be lingering around you, but it didn't get close to you.
 At this moment, Yuan Shuo's words resounded in their minds. In this ancient city, one would hear footsteps. When one heard footsteps, it meant that danger was approaching!
 However, Yuan Shuo had also said that he had heard the footsteps from the last place he had entered.
 He entered through the outer city gate and explored all the way before he heard footsteps.
 At that time, they seemed to be close to the inner city.
 "Gulp!"
 It was the sound of saliva being swallowed.
 Li Hao didn't know whose it was. If it wasn't his, could it be Liu Yan 's?
 Or ... The captain 's?
 Even the captain was afraid?
 To be honest, Li Hao was also a little scared.
 Where was he?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com What about the others?
 According to what hou Xiaochen had said, they would all be together at the entrance.
 But why were there only three of them here?
 "Boss ..."
 Li Hao shouted in a low voice. The next moment, a voice suddenly echoed from where they were,""Boss ..."
 The few of them were shocked!
 It turned out that martial masters weren't all that bold. At this moment, the three of them subconsciously moved closer to each other, wanting to warm each other up. This damn place ... Was so eerie and scary!
 The three of them got closer to each other and felt a sense of security.
 The footsteps by her ears never stopped.
 When Li Hao shouted "boss," the footsteps seemed to stop for a while, causing their faces to turn pale. Had they been heard?  The few of them looked at each other. Liu Long was the boss after all, and he was also a warrior. At this moment, he forced himself to pull himself together, but he was cursing in his heart.
 I knew it was dangerous to come in, but I didn't know it would be so terrifying!
 "Don't be afraid!"
 He said in a low voice. If a Martial Master didn't have good hearing, they wouldn't have heard him.
 When he said this, he felt a little guilty.
 Fortunately, there were three of them ... If only one person had suddenly appeared here, he would probably have been terrified.
 Liu Long looked around and found that they were indeed in a small alley. There were high walls on both sides and there was a faint light in front of them. The light that looked like a will-o "-the-wisp seemed to be coming from the end.
 The few of them looked at each other. What should they do?
 Forward, or wait?
 For a moment, the few of them were in a dilemma.
 In the end, it was Li Hao who was more courageous ... He had no choice but to be connected.
 When he first saw the red shadow, he felt the same way.
 At that time, he was the only one who could see it. It was actually even more terrifying than now. Now, there were three of them.
 He gestured and pointed to the front.
 Go over!
 Since he was already here, he couldn't just stay here forever.
 The alley did not look very spacious.
 Once the enemy came, there would be no place to escape under a pincer attack. Moreover, they did not know how high the walls on both sides were. It was hard to say whether they could break it. Anyway, they did not dare to try it rashly.
 Li Hao squatted down and touched the ground. It was hard and felt cool.
 Sensing it carefully, it made one's heart palpitate.
 The bricks on the ground ... It felt like ... It felt like there was a terrifying power inside.
 There seemed to be something hidden inside, but he did not feel any cracks. He touched along the way and touched the walls on both sides. His face gradually became stiff and ugly, as if ... They had been integrated!
 There were no cracks on the ground or the walls.
 It seemed to be a complete body!
 His teacher had told him not to leave the ground rashly. At this moment, Li Hao swallowed his saliva. He didn't dare to leave the ground. He felt that it was very terrifying.
 What the hell was this place?
  The three of them didn't say a word. Liu Long was also feeling the ground. It seemed that there was a gap on the ground. After touching it carefully, he knew that it was not a gap. It was probably a decoration that made the ground not so smooth.
 At this time, the three of them carefully walked forward.
 Her movements were as light as a kitten 's.
 The further they went, the clearer the footsteps became.
 The lights were also getting brighter.
 The sound of the footsteps made them a little frightened. Every step seemed to be stepping on their hearts.
 When they approached the end of the alley, Li Hao suddenly felt his arm being grabbed. He almost screamed out loud, but his strong endurance forced him to endure it. When he felt that Liu Yan was holding him, he almost wanted to curse!
 Why are you pinching me at this time?
 Go pinch Liu Long!
 In fact ... Li Hao quickly discovered that Liu Yan had pinched both of them, one in each hand.

 This woman was actually quite bold. She could kill people without blinking.
 But at this moment, she was really afraid.
 She trembled as she looked ahead. Li Hao and Liu Long also looked in the same direction. They didn't have time to pay attention to the situation just now, but when they looked forward ... Their bodies instantly stiffened!
 At the end of the path, where the light was, he could vaguely see a figure pacing back and forth.
 "Pa pa pa!"
 It was the sound of footsteps.
 And the footsteps were actually coming from under the figure's feet.
 The footsteps that teacher mentioned, the person that might be in the dark!
 Ancient people?
 How was that possible?
  It was impossible for there to be any living person in this place. This place had been sealed for who knew how long. If there were people here, what would they eat, what would they drink, and how would they pass down their legacies? that was impossible.
 But in fact, they really did see a figure.
 Moreover, the figure seemed to have sensed something as he suddenly stopped at the end of the alley.
 They seemed to be looking in Li Hao's direction.
 They were so scared that their hearts almost stopped beating!
 They weren't afraid of the enemy's strength, they were afraid of the unknown. If the other party were to announce his background at this moment, saying that he was the three yang or even the rising light above the three yang, they wouldn't be so afraid.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com But the other party ... Didn't say a word!
 This was the scariest part. Think about it, in the dark, in an ancient city that had been sealed for countless years, suddenly someone was looking at you in the dark, and you even saw the other party ... What kind of feeling was that?
 If the enemy did not move, he would not move.
 The shadow didn't leave, and the few of them didn't move, as if they had been hit by a stop spell.
 He didn't know how much time had passed. It might have been a minute, three minutes, five minutes ...
 When the figure at the end of the corridor disappeared, the sound of footsteps could be heard again. The few of them heaved a sigh of relief. At this moment, they felt much more at ease when they heard the sound of footsteps. What they were afraid of was that the sound of footsteps had disappeared again.
 The few of them bent their backs and continued to move forward carefully, their movements extremely light.
 The short journey took them dozens of seconds. After a while, the three of them reached the place where the shadow had stopped.
 He poked his head out of the alley.
 At this moment ... Li Hao's scalp went numb!
 His body was also extremely stiff!
 Liu Long felt Li Hao's stiffness and also looked outside. The next moment, he felt his scalp go numb!
 Following that, Liu Yan also carefully stuck her head out to take a look ... The moment she saw it, all three of her heads stiffened and didn't dare to move.
 At this moment, there seemed to be a big road outside the small alley.
 And on the great Dao ... There was not just one shadow, but many.
 On their left was the black shadow that had just walked past, and on their right ... There were many more black shadows!
 In an instant, the three heads retracted.
 Because at this moment, a series of footsteps gradually approached.
 "Da da da!"
  The uniform footsteps sounded like it came from one person, but in fact, they could see clearly that it was a small team ... There was more than one person, at least seven or eight people, but they didn't dare to see how many exactly.  "Da da da!"
 The footsteps continued, getting closer and closer.
 Li Hao wanted to retreat, but Liu Long pressed on his arm, shook his head, and held his breath, indicating that he couldn't move at this moment, as it would attract too much attention.
 The three of them waited stiffly.
 A moment later, a small group of black shadows approached.
 It was not until the black shadow approached and the first one passed by the alley that they saw the black shadow clearly.
 Soldiers!
 At this moment, everyone's hearts trembled. This wasn't a black shadow, but a soldier wearing black armor. The armor was even one piece, and even the helmet was one piece. The entire person was covered in black armor.
 Black Phoenix was also equipped with weapons.
 This was actually a small team dressed in ancient soldier attire. One by one, the black figures stepped across the alley they were in with neat steps. No one looked at them, no one paid attention to them, or did not notice them.
 "Da da da!"
 The sound of footsteps continued, as if they were one.
 And this was a well-trained and extremely elite team of soldiers.
 They seemed to be on patrol, their daily patrol.
 Day after day, year after year!
 Liu Long and the others were extremely shocked.
 Was this ... A living person?
 Patrolling soldiers?
 They couldn't imagine it. Could it be that there were still a large number of living people in this ancient city?
 But soon, Li Hao's expression changed slightly. He shook his head, and when the footsteps were far away, he said in an inaudible voice,""He ... He doesn't look like a living person!"
 A Martial master's senses were still very sharp.
 Under the armor, he did not feel any breathing or heartbeat. He did not even feel the existence of the light.
 What the hell was this?
 He didn't believe that anyone could survive in an ancient city that had been sealed for countless years.
  "A puppet?"
 Li Hao thought for a moment and gave such an answer.
 He had memorized many ancient books. Some of them recorded that there were puppets in the ancient civilization. Sometimes, puppets were no different from real people. However, they weren't real people after all. They could only be made to look like real people through some techniques and methods. Besides having no consciousness, they could even simulate flesh and blood.
 Could this be a group of puppet soldiers?
 Were they the puppets used to guard and patrol the ancient city?
 He couldn't see through it, nor could he understand it.
 To them, the ancient civilization was too far away.
 The three of them were hiding at the entrance of the alley. They didn't dare to go out and only stuck their heads out to take a look. They had been too scared to show their faces when they saw the soldiers. Now that the soldiers were far away, they continued to look outside.
 With one look ... The few of them were somewhat shocked.
 About 100 meters in front of them, there seemed to be a tall wall.

 The 100-meter distance between the wall and the alley was a big road.
 It was an extremely wide road!
 This was the ancient path?
 Such a wide ancient path?
 This wasn't the reason why they were so shocked. They followed the wall and looked up ... What they saw was the reason why they were so shocked. This wall was very, very tall.
 After a long time, Li Hao finally saw the top of the wall.
 It was almost a hundred meters tall!
 A hundred-meter high wall?
 It was more than thirty stories high!
 Was this the wall of the ancient people?
  What a joke, the city wall was almost the same ... The city wall was not that high!
 The next moment, Li Hao's eyes narrowed. He looked carefully and saw that on the high wall ... There seemed to be shadows and puppet soldiers.
 There seemed to be a Watchtower on the high wall.
 He saw a black shadow.
 Soldiers?
 Liu Long also followed his line of sight and seemed to see the black shadow. He swallowed his saliva again. What the hell is this place?
 "The inner and outer cities ..."
 Li Hao seemed to have thought of something. Slightly shocked, he said in a low voice,""It seems to be the border between the inner and outer cities. Teacher said that it was also here that he heard the sound of footsteps ... Here, he saw a city gate with a turtle imprinted on it!"
 Could it be that they were currently in this place?
 The alley was located in the outer city, and the wall in front was the wall of the inner city?
 According to the night patrolman, after they entered, they would enter the outer city, which was probably the outer city gate area.
 There were also some residential areas in the outer city.
 They would only appear outside the inner city after passing through the layers of danger.
 Could it be that they had directly arrived here this time?
 Why wasn't he with the others?
 Li Hao fell into deep thought. He touched the small sword in his pocket. Could it be related to the starry sky sword?
 But ... If it's related, can't you just teleport me into the inner city?
 What was going on at the border between the inner and outer cities?
 Unable to advance or retreat!
 If they retreated now, they might be in the outer city. It would be fine if they met the night patrolmen in the outer city, but what if they met Red Moon and Yama?
 However, entering ... What a joke.
 These Shadow Soldiers did not seem to have any fluctuations, but according to his teacher, in the dark, there would often be the sound of footsteps. When they appeared, it meant that there was danger. A sunlit soldier had been killed with a single strike.
 Swords ... They were probably the weapons that the shadow Soldiers carried.
 In other words, these soldiers without energy fluctuations might have the strength to kill sunlight with one sword.
 This was too terrifying!
  His teacher had only explored the vicinity of this place back then, but he had not been able to enter the inner city.  Li Hao didn't know anything about the inner city, so he didn't dare to explore it rashly.
 Just as he was thinking about all this, he vaguely heard a sharp cry from behind him.
 Just as he was still thinking, the group of soldiers who had been walking suddenly disappeared one by one at an extremely fast speed, running towards the source of the cry.
 Not only that, under the horrified gazes of Li Hao and Liu Long, black-helmeted soldiers suddenly appeared in the darkness and quickly disappeared, running toward the outer city.
 Clearly, the cry had alarmed the soldiers.
 "The people who entered!"
 The few of them quickly made a judgment. It was the person who had come in. From the sound, it didn't seem too far away, but the sound was very soft and faint. Even if it wasn't far, it couldn't be seen in a short time.
 And they had alarmed the soldiers!
 These were probably soldiers who had been patrolling this place for countless years.
 "They're very fast ... The speed of those black helmet soldiers just now gave me the feeling that they're no slower than breaking a hundred ..."
 There were at least thirty to forty soldiers running over.
 The patrols here did not seem to be disturbed.
 The black shadow on the city wall was still there.
 In the surroundings, it seemed as if more soldiers had appeared. Team after team, they continued their patrol as if the shouting from the outer city had never happened.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Elite!"
 At this moment, Liu Long whispered in Li Hao's ear,""These soldiers, if they are not puppets ... Then they must be the elite of the elite! Even though Hu dingfang's Tiger wing Army is said to be the most elite force in Silvermoon province ... But ... But compared to these soldiers, I feel that it's far too inferior!"
 His temperament, efficiency, speed, reaction, and even his defensive system were impeccable.
 When something happened, people quickly went there to deal with it, but the necessary patrol, Sentry, and defense system were not in chaos at all.
 At this moment, Liu Long was also thinking that if these soldiers really had the strength of a sun glory ... It was simply unimaginable.
 With such a well-coordinated Army, even if they were only at the early stage of the sunlit realm, a 10-man team might be able to fight against a three-Sun Expert. Under normal circumstances, 10 early stage sunlit realm experts would still find it difficult to fight against a three-Sun Expert.
 In the middle and late stages, that was not a big problem.
 "What do we do?"
 Li Hao wasn't in the mood to care about this. He looked at Liu Long and asked.
 What do we do now?
  He felt ... In a dilemma.
 They didn't dare to move forward, nor did they dare to retreat.
 Just wait here?
 Wait for the others to explore this place and then follow them?
 Don't joke around!
 Liu Long also looked at Li Hao and complained in his heart. What should he do?
 I don't know.
 He didn't know anything about this, so how would he know what to do?
 If they advanced, they would be able to see as far as the eye could see. There were even sentry towers above them. Would they be discovered quickly? if they were discovered ... How would they be able to fight against so many soldiers when they appeared?
 Even though they did not see the soldiers attack, but ... Just by looking at their speed, they knew that these soldiers were not useless.

 Liu Long complained incessantly. The next moment, he kicked the ball to Li Hao,""What do you think we should do? Aren't you a student of the ancient civilization Exploration Department? You should be more aware of this situation than me, right?"
 “……”
 Li Hao was speechless.
 That makes sense!
 But ... But I didn't come across any historical remains with soldiers. The ancient academy didn't teach them either.
 They taught him about positioning, Feng Shui, identifying historical sites, finding water sources ... And other such things.
 If only teacher was here!
 Li Hao missed this moment.
 If the teacher was around, he would just listen to him. He was still too young, too inexperienced, and too inexperienced. At this moment, he was actually a little flustered.
 However, hearing Liu Long's words ...
  In the end, Li Hao decided to make his own decision.
 The captain is right. I'm from the ancient academy, and my teacher is an Explorer. How can I embarrass my teacher?
 'I can't grow up if my teacher is gone?
 A moment later, Li Hao suddenly took out a small disk-like object from his bosom. Under Liu Yan and Liu Long's dumbfounded gazes, he held the disk and quickly fiddled with it.
 Then, Li Hao plucked a strand of hair and blew on it.
 In the blink of an eye, the hair began to spin on the disc.
 Gradually, the hair stopped.
 The two ends of the alley were facing each other. At this moment, Liu Long seemed to be able to tell that Li Hao was trying to determine the direction of the alley. But ... Wasn't it a waste of effort to face two ends of the alley?
 As for Li Hao, after carefully observing, he said in a low voice,""Go, go from the back, you can't go in front!"
 "Why?"
 Liu Yan asked in a low voice. Li Hao said in a low voice,""This is the force field method. The root is facing the inner city, which means that the force field in the inner city is stronger and more dangerous ... So, let's go to the outer city to take a look first. I don't know why we are here, not with the others ... Maybe we have the upper hand, but we don't know anything about the inner city. It's more likely that we have become cannon fodder!"
 There were many good things in the inner city, that was a hundred percent.
 If Li Hao had the strength of a teacher, he could have gone to the inner city and saved a lot of trouble. But the problem was that he didn 't.
 Now that it had appeared here, it seemed to be of little value.
 Or go to the outer city!
 He didn't want to be someone else's Pathfinder. It was too dangerous.
 Moreover, it was a good opportunity for them to appear in front of the others. If they found the right time, the right time, there might be unexpected benefits.
 "The treasure in the inner city ... Let's not think about it. Kill more bad guys and take away some superpowers. If we can kill some of the red moon guys and get some Blood God, it might not be worse than entering the inner city."
 What was in the inner city?
 So what if they had a bunch of origin God weapons?
  Can you take it away?  Can I bring it out?
 At this moment, Li Hao's mind became clear again. Nothing was more important than increasing his strength. He had not yet entered the Qian warrior realm.
 At this moment, Liu Long and Liu Yan didn't say anything. In an instant, Li Hao had the final say.
 He was a student of the ancient academy's Exploration Department.
 His teacher was also a well-known expert in the exploration Department.
 At this moment, Li Hao turned around and walked toward the other side of the alley with a few people. His movements were still very light as he said in a low voice,""Try not to make any noise, and speak less later. Those soldiers seem to be trying to determine their position by listening! "The scream from before drew away quite a number of soldiers. We were hiding right beside them, so they didn't see us ... If these soldiers are puppets, they might have some voice control system ..."
 The two of them just listened and didn't ask anything.
 At this moment, he just had to follow Li Hao obediently.
 The alley wasn't too long, about 500 meters in length.
 Li Hao's group of three moved at a moderate pace. After a while, they approached the other end.
 At this moment, they heard footsteps again.
 Li Hao held his breath and waited for a while. A moment later, a black figure walked past the alley. It was still a black-armored soldier, but this time, there was only one.
 After the black-armored soldier left, Li Hao craned his neck to look outside. He finally realized what this place was.
 It seemed to be a Street in the outer city.
 Ancient Street!
 Outside the alley, there seemed to be an ancient shop. He also saw some very distinctive flags with some different fonts on them. But Li Hao was a professional. Even if he had dropped out of school, he could still be considered a professional.
 He barely managed to make out a word ... Tea!
 In front of them, there was a place where a flag was hung. It might be a tea shop.
 At this moment, time seemed to have returned to countless years ago. People were jostling around on the streets of the outer city, eating snacks that were being sold, shopping, drinking tea, and having a meal ...
  Li Hao was slightly dazed.
 This was also the first time he had seen an ancient city's ruins that were so well preserved!
 In the past, he had seen some information, but they were all signs of destruction and were buried in the earth. He had never seen it like this, where he was in it.
 He was in a daze for a moment, but he quickly came back to his senses.
 This was not a place for archaeology.
 It was dangerous!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com His teacher had said that this place was extremely dangerous. There were sharp blades that came out of nowhere, footsteps, and even things that could instantly burn people like flames. Danger was everywhere.
 At this moment, another shriek seemed to be heard from afar.
 He seemed to be in pain!
 Li Hao's ears twitched. It didn't seem too far away from them. It might be behind this Street!

 Indistinctly, the sound of weapons clashing could be heard.
 Could it be that the black-armored soldiers were fighting with the supers?
 "Let's go!"
 Li Hao walked out of the alley. With agile movements, he quickly ran to the opposite side of the street. Liu Long and Liu Yan hurriedly followed.
 Although they didn't know what Li Hao's goal was ... They just had to follow him.
 They didn't know anything here.
 ……
 Just as Li Hao was approaching ...
 It was a place that looked like a square.
 At this moment, a battle was taking place.
  As Li Hao had guessed, there were thirty to forty black-armored soldiers on one side of the battle.
 On the other side of the battle were the members of the small organizations and the lone wolves who had come in first.
 At this moment, the ground was covered in blood.
 The black-armored soldiers suddenly appeared. Although they were accompanied by the sound of footsteps, the light seemed to have disappeared. Li Hao and the others could still see light and see something clearly.
 However, at this moment, the place was frighteningly dark.
 ? It was only when a fire-type super ignited his power that everyone could see clearly that a group of black-armored soldiers had appeared around them. Many of them were so frightened that their faces turned pale.
 How could there be people here?
 "It's the night patrolman!"
 Some people were shocked and furious. Only the night patrollers had explored these ruins, so their first thought was that these people were all night patrollers!
 It was left behind by the night patrol!
 When that person finished shouting, a black-armored soldier appeared beside him in an instant. The sound of footsteps could be heard, but it did not seem like he was flying or stepping in the air. He was just walking. A little lower, the sound of a sword being drawn could be heard.
 Puchi!
 The sound of flesh being pierced rang out as the sword decapitated him!
 The person who shouted was beheaded by the black-armored soldier.
 The person who shouted wasn't too weak. He was at the level of a full moon. Of course, he was considered weak in this operation.
 Even so, a full moon of a Dark Moon was considered an expert in Silver Moon.
 However, a black-armored soldier had killed him with a single strike.
 Not only that, but at this moment, the bright fire power also exclaimed in surprise. The sound of footsteps rang in his ears. In the blink of an eye, three swords came from the sky, top, middle and bottom, sealing off the space.
 In the blink of an eye, with a "PU Chi" sound, as if they had struck at the same time, this person was directly split into three.
 Instant kill!
 As for the fire elemental powerhouses, they were at the Dark Moon and full moon level, close to the sunlit realm, but they still couldn't block the attacks of the black Phoenix.
 The flames dissipated.
 In the crowd, someone was so scared that he wanted to scream, but someone's expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly said,""Don't make a sound, don't give off any light ..."
 As soon as he finished speaking, he felt a sense of danger.
 However, he had to remind her!
 He didn't make a sound, but punched out, trying to escape into the ground. But the next moment, his face was filled with horror.
 No!
  He couldn't burrow underground!  Damn it, he couldn't escape into the ground in this place. He didn't expect that there would be any ground that could block the earth element expert's earth escape.
 He punched out. His strength wasn't weak, and he directly forced a Black Phoenix to retreat a few steps. However, because he couldn't burrow underground, a sword appeared in the next moment and stabbed into his heart.
 A powerful earth energy burst out, and a defense was presented.
 But ... In the blink of an eye, the sound of footsteps rang out in his ears. In the blink of an eye, four to five swords appeared and struck at the head, throat, temple ...
 A sword stabbed at every vital part of his body.
 A huge force came from the sword!
 A sword pierced through his throat, and the next moment, a second, a third ...
 All the swords had pierced into his body.
 The earth element expert slowly fell to the ground.
 He was sunlight!
 But here, the earth escape technique didn't work, and he was still killed. He died without knowing why.
 The surroundings fell silent once again.
 Everyone was terrified, but they didn't dare to make any more sound.
 The darkness enveloped them, making them feel fear and terror.
 Regret!
 They should not have come.
 What were these black-armored soldiers?
 Night patrolman?
 What a joke!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com If the night watchmen had such a force, they would have used it long ago. Some of the soldiers had already tested their strength. They were not too strong, probably at the Dark Moon level. However, they did not have any energy fluctuations, just like martial masters.
 At least the martial masters could still hear their breathing and heartbeats, but the black-armored soldiers seemed to be completely fine.
 Their sword strikes were very organized, not random.
 They had a tacit understanding with each other, to an astonishing degree.
 You can Dodge the first sword, but not the second. If you don't die, there are still the third and fourth!
 There were not many people from the small organization who had entered. There were about thirty to forty of them, which was about the same number as the black-armored soldiers.
 But before that, a few of them had already died.
  Now, a few more had been killed.
 Even though there were many sunlit cultivators among them, none of them dared to make a sound.
 He didn't even dare to use his powers too much.
 When supers did not even dare to use their powers, their reaction speed, ability to react, and even night vision were far inferior to martial masters. Martial masters were strong in their own body. Even if they did not use their inner strength, their physical fitness was still extremely strong.
 Therefore, martial masters had good night vision, but supers had very poor night vision unless they had superpowers.
 In the dark, they could only see a few outlines.
 Someone wanted to activate their superpower, but the next moment, the sound of a sharp sword piercing through the darkness could be heard.
 At that moment, the supers who were still alive knew that the waves of power, sound, and light would all attract the attention of the black Phoenix.
 If he didn't move ... He might be safer.
 These black hou didn't look like living people.

 They were more likely to rely on things like sound and energy fluctuations to determine their location.
 'So, I'll be safe ... If I don't move?
 Some of the experts who could fly felt a black shadow approaching them in fear. They didn't dare to stay any longer and quickly flew up into the sky to escape from this place!
 Being able to fly in the sky was often the greatest life-saving asset.
 Just as this person rose into the air, he was still fine at first. He thought that he had escaped and was still rejoicing. Suddenly, a ray of light shot out from the sky. In an instant, this person had no time to block or dodge. In the blink of an eye, he exploded into pieces as if he had been hit by a cannonball!
 The light even illuminated the place.
 All of a sudden, the supers who were hiding were revealed. These people were cursing in their hearts, and their faces turned pale.
 What was that?
 A flying expert was actually directly smashed into pieces by a beam of light!
 More importantly, the light had illuminated the place.
  All of a sudden, the black-armored soldiers who were still searching suddenly attacked.
 "Ah!"
 The screams were heard again!
 The black iron swords pierced through the heads of the experts one after another. Some of them couldn't bear the pressure and roared. Fire energy burst out and heaven-burning flames shot out.
 BOOM!
 A black-armored soldier was sent flying and fell heavily to the ground.
 The black armor wasn't destroyed, but the soldier still fell to the ground and struggled to get up ...
 This time, the powerhouses in the crowd saw hope.
 All of them revealed looks of joy!
 Even though they were powerful, these black-armored soldiers did not seem to be invincible. They could still be dealt with.
 In an instant, a few more sunshine powerhouses rose up to fight back!
 As expected, there was a limit to the black-armored soldiers 'strength. Even though they were well-coordinated, there were still many black-armored soldiers who were sent flying. Since some of them had resisted, they didn't care about the sound and hurriedly shouted,""That armor seems to be an extraordinary item ... It's hard to destroy! They were sent flying, and the air vibrated! Also, you can't fly. There might be a no-fly mechanism here ..."
 There were also knowledgeable superpowers who quickly pointed out the taboos.
 I can't fly!
 After flying past a certain height, they would encounter that light, which would directly kill a sunlit expert ... Who would dare to fly again?
 They began to resist with all their might!
 Some people also took the opportunity to escape.
 The sunlit cultivators cursed under their breath and fled while fighting. There were still people behind them. They found the large organizations that had three suns experts and even origin divine weapons ... They didn't want to die anymore!
 As for the black-armored soldiers, even though they were still powerful and had killed many people, they could only watch as a few experts fled the battlefield.
 Some of the soldiers who had fallen to the ground stood up after a while.
 They chased and chased all the way to the end of the square ... After those people fled madly, these soldiers seemed to have received some orders and after a moment, the whole team began to return.
 In the darkness, the black-armored soldiers disappeared one after another, heading in the direction of Li Hao's group.
 The sound of footsteps gradually faded away.
 After they left, on the other side of the square, Li Hao and the others finally took a deep breath, their foreheads full of sweat.
 ܳ!
 It was so scary!
 These soldiers seemed to only have the strength of Yue Ming, but they were all immortal. Those who had been knocked down earlier actually stood up and walked away as if nothing had happened.
 Among those supers, there were at least a dozen sunlit ones, but a few of them were killed in the blink of an eye. More than a dozen of Yue Ming's were killed, and more than half of them were lost. However, they did not even manage to kill a single black Phoenix.
 This was too terrifying!
 Among the three of them, only Liu Long could really deal with someone in the early stage of the solar glory realm. Li Hao might be able to resist, but Liu Yan couldn't even resist.
 If the three of them were to encounter three to five Black Phoenix, they would be finished.
 It was too terrifying!
 And only a few of such black Phoenix had come. Li Hao and the others knew that there seemed to be many of them near the inner city.
 ܳ!
 Was this ancient city a place that humans could explore?  "Let's ... Let's go ..."
 Even Liu Long was a little timid. There was still a difference between being brave and courting death.
 If he were to encounter those black hou, he felt that three to five of them would definitely be able to join forces and kill him, a Qian warrior.
 The key was that the enemy could not be killed.
 That would make people despair!
 Li Hao licked his lips and said, leave? Boss, are you crazy?"
 Boss must be crazy!
 Where to?
 "So many people died in front of us. They were all mysterious energy!"
 Boss must be crazy. He was such a mysterious person, but now he actually saw it and wanted to leave?
 Liu Long looked at him with a dumbfounded expression. You're the crazy one!
 What will you do when the black Phoenix comes back?
 This guy wanted money more than his life!
 "Boss, they're only killing the intruders. Light, sound, and flying sky will attract their attention. It's not a big problem if we keep it quiet. They must be back in the inner city now. Hurry, in case someone comes over later and attracts them again ..."
 At this moment, Li Hao had a bold idea: "Boss ... Let's ... Let's just follow these Black Phoenix!"
 If they didn't make any noise, didn't shout, didn't create any light, didn't fly ... These black phoenixes might not be able to discover them.
 And those guys from the outside world might not know.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com There might even be a battle!
 Does that mean I can pick up the corpses?
 There were many mysterious energies, which he lacked. The five elements were the best, and wind and thunder would do too.
 Liu Long and Liu Yan were both dumbfounded. Wealth was obtained from danger, and they were also very courageous. However, they had watched helplessly as the black Vatican slaughtered in all directions. The other party had not even gone far, and they had already dared to go up and loot the corpses ...
 They were indeed a little timid.
 "Let's go!"
 Li Hao didn't care about them. What was there to be afraid of?
 These black puppets didn't seem to be living humans. If they were puppets, there must be a special order. As long as they didn't violate it, there shouldn't be any problems.
 This was also recorded in some ancient books.
 Boss and the others didn't understand. They only knew how to be afraid. If that was the case, it would be more dangerous for them to run around.
 At this moment, Li Hao cast his worries aside.
 What could be more fragrant than these mysteries?
 He quickly ran to the previous battlefield. With one look, he instantly paled. The flesh and blood on the ground ... Seemed to be being devoured by the ground!
 Not only that, the mysterious energy seemed to be being absorbed by the ground.
 Li Hao swallowed his saliva.
 The ground!
 He had already felt that there was a special energy on the ground. At this moment, his heart palpitated. This ... This can even devour corpses and superpowers?
  Oh my God!
 This city ... It can't be that it's alive, right?
 His face was covered in sweat, but he couldn't care less. He gritted his teeth and began to pick up some large pieces of the corpse.
 It was no wonder why the black Vatican didn't clean up the battlefield or pick up the corpses ... There was no need to do so. After a while, the corpses would all disappear as if they had never appeared in the first place.
 This ancient city was filled with demonic and evil energy!
 It was horrifying!
 Li Hao quickly collected some pieces of the corpse. Soon, he filled the storage box and fled.
 It was too F * cking scary!
 The ground would eat people!
