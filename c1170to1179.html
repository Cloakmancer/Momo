        first, there would be a second.
         A moment later, the second expert walked out. It was a delicate-looking woman who forced a smile. She seemed to know Nan Quan and wanted to greet him, but Nan Quan only looked at her coldly.
         The woman's heart turned cold and she knelt down as well. However, her heart was filled with fear.
         Royal family?
         Or ... A demonic sword?
         Did the southern Fist and the demonic sword also come into contact?
         She knew something about the situation and that the demonic sword had disappeared, but ... Where did Li Hao get so many helpers?
         And ... He actually attacked an Island in the four Seas!
         Many people trembled and trembled.
         The third sunguang, however, did not walk out.
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At this moment, Li Hao descended from the sky with a bronze mirror in his hand. His eyes were like torches, and the bronze mirror also showed a person. At this moment, in a corner, an old man was squatting on the ground with his head lowered. The next moment, he seemed to have sensed something.
         He suddenly raised his head ... BOOM!
         The sword light soared to the sky!
         Li Hao's voice was calm."I told you to come out. You didn't come out. Do you think that you're very powerful?"
         "Or do you think you can escape my search?"
         The sword light was everywhere.
         The power of the five elements was integrated by sword intent and enveloped the old man. Li Hao moved extremely fast and appeared in front of the old man in the blink of an eye. He slashed his sword again and again. The next moment, his qi and blood erupted as he slashed out!
         BOOM!
         A loud sound reverberated in all directions. The old man's face was filled with disbelief as he was split in half by the sword.
         All around, the people who were squatting on the ground were terrified.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't even look at it. Frowning, he instantly disappeared and reappeared in front of a giant bird. The giant bird seemed to have recovered a lot.
         The giant bird looked at Li Hao with fear in its eyes. "I'm the messenger of Phoenix Mountain ... You ... If you kill them, we can work together. Phoenix Mountain is one of the seven sacred mountains, and the mountain Master is the great Phoenix ..."
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He looked at the bloody skeletons around him and then glanced at the big Bird."You eat people?"
         "No, no, no, I don't eat people. It's blood food ... It's also what the four Seas Chamber of Commerce offered ..."
         The giant bird seemed to have sensed danger and said with a mental wave,""They're just servants, not supers ..."
         Servants ... Were not human.
         Perhaps this was what the demons thought. They didn't eat any superpowers and only ate the blood and flesh that humans offered. It was just a normal dessert.
         This shouldn't be a problem, right?
         "A servant?"
         Li Hao looked around and suddenly stomped his foot. The ground cracked open, revealing a huge cage. There were still some people inside, but they were all numb. They were all women and some children, all of whom were young.
         "Is this what you're eating?"
         "It's these blood food ..." The giant bird did not deny it. "They have no powers and are weak. They are the trash of the human race. They are extremely weak ... Eat them and they can even help you clean up some trash ..."
         He didn't think there was a problem. In fact, the demons didn't think there was a problem. In their own race, the weak would be abandoned or even eaten.  Of course, the giant bird didn't eat it.
         It had only asked the four Seas Chamber of Commerce to prepare some food, which the Chamber of Commerce had brought to it. It had eaten it once and felt that it tasted good. After that, it had continued eating.
         "How long have you been here?"
         "How long?"
         "According to you, it's been three years ..." The giant bird pondered.
         "How many of these people have you eaten?"
         "Not a human ..."
         The big Bird still wanted to explain."I will only eat blood food once a month. Each time, I will only choose 10 of the most tender ..."
         "That means 120 people a year, 360 people in three years ..."
         "Oh?" Li Hao understood and smiled."An envoy from Phoenix Mountain?"
         "Right!"
         "What is the content of the cooperation between you and the four Seas Chamber of Commerce?"
         "We'll help them monitor the surroundings and provide long-range flight. We'll be the liaisons between Phoenix Mountain and the four Seas Chamber of Commerce. We'll trade for some special demon Race Products and provide Phoenix Mountain with some items we need ..."
         The giant bird knew that the person in front of it was not to be trifled with, so it did not dare to hide anything.
         Just as he finished speaking, his mental energy fluctuated violently."What are you doing?"
         BOOM!
         Li Hao's sword was filled with intense killing intent. The sword pierced through the surroundings and cut off half of the bird's head. This was a big Bird at the late stage of the rising light realm, but in Li Hao's hands, it was still extremely fragile.
         With one sword, he was severely injured and dying.
         In the next moment, Li Hao didn't say anything. He just slashed again and again ...
         In the end, all that was left was a bird's skeleton, and all the flesh and blood had been removed by Li Hao.
         "You're also very young!"
         Li Hao smiled and turned to look at Nan Quan,"kill all the guards here!" Don't leave a single one!"
          BOOM!
         The guards on the ground were instantly terrified.
         However, the strongest among these guards was only three suns. How could they match an expert like Nanquan? Nanquan knew that Li Hao was angry. Without saying anything, he punched out, creating a huge hole in the ground and killing dozens of guards!
         "Senior yang, kill all the demons on the island!"
         "Yes, sir!"
         With a low shout, the next moment, Saber Light flashed.
         "Everyone on the island, gather here. Within five minutes, those who don't arrive ... Kill them all!"
         Li Hao hovered in the air, his armor flickering with silver light.
         He held the bronze mirror in his hand and looked at it silently.
         He then looked around,'if you think you can escape, you can try! I'm Li Hao, the Vice Governor of Tian Xing, and I'm also the demonic sword you're talking about. Today, the four Seas Chamber of Commerce colluded with Pirates and demons to slaughter humans and feed on them. You've all seen it with your own eyes! If you continue to run, you can try to see if you can survive. "
        
         A series of moans and sobs came from the surroundings.
         No one dared to move.
         The nobles who had been clamoring just now were now unkempt and kneeling on the ground. Some of them were so frightened that they even wet their pants. The stench was also coming from them.
         Someone was shocked. Hearing Li Hao introduce himself, he said carefully,""Governor, I'm a night patrol ..."
         Puchi!
         The sword pierced through his head.
         Li Hao looked at the corpse and then at the crowd.""I told you to gather here and not make a sound. If you speak again, you'll all die!"
         Seeing this Demon King kill even his own people, these people were completely terrified. Even more people wet their pants.
         Li Hao said calmly,"night patrolman?" There might be some among you, but ... Don't say it now. If you say it, I'll feel disgusted. I'm actually a night patrolman ... How embarrassing!"
         "Perhaps, when I calm down, I will spare you on account of being colleagues. Do you understand?"
          No one dared to make a sound.
         On the island, many people began to gather.
         In other places, Nan Quan was killing the guards who were trying to escape. Some of them ran to the edge of the island but were blocked. Sunguang could not stop them, but some of these guards were only Yue Ming. How could they escape?
         In the blink of an eye, wailing sounds continued!
         "Magic sword ... We are the financial division's people ..."
         "Ah!"
         "The Financial Secretary will not let you go!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com “……”
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He only counted the time.
         A moment later, he rose into the air.
         In an instant, hundreds of sword rays shot out in all directions. BOOM!
         One by one, the buildings were destroyed, and screams could be heard!
         "Be it a Martial Master or a superhuman, do you think you can hide from me?"
         Li Hao couldn't see the Martial Master Halo, but he had the bronze mirror in his hand. He could detect any signs of life within the Halo's range. Where could he escape to?
         The next moment, a Martial Master shot up and fled into the distance.
         Li Hao's sword energy was shattered by his opponent's punch!
         A strong Esper!
         He was an expert in the path of martial masters.
         "I'm from stupa mountain!" The man roared.
         BOOM!
         An extremely thick sword light directly fell. Li Hao pounced like a bird, punching and kicking. In the blink of an eye, the man was heavily injured and fell. Li Hao's claw reached out and broke his throat with a crack.
         "Your mountain chieftain's younger brother ... Was killed a few days ago. We were the ones who killed him too. Your mountain chieftain doesn't seem to be on good terms with my master. Stupa mountain, are you trying to scare me?"  He was a Martial Master who was not weak. In fact, he was not weaker than Jin gun.
         But now, in this place, when he encountered Li Hao, he would only be killed in an instant.
         The surroundings became even quieter.
         Li Hao looked at the place where he had just been. At this moment, thousands of people were prostrating on the ground. It was a spectacular sight, but the stench was extremely strong.
         Li Hao's voice resounded again."Everyone, write down your identity and level. Hand over your storage rings. You can write your name. Those who hide it will be killed!"
         "Don't think that you can escape by writing a fake identity ... Try it!"
         In the next moment, thousands of white papers and pens fell in front of those people.
         At this moment, someone's entire body trembled. Even his hands were shaking, and he couldn't write anything. He was so scared that his guts were about to split apart. No matter how arrogant he was before, he was now terrified after seeing these murderous demons.
         This was a true devil!
         "Is this what a noble is like?" Li Hao chuckled.
         He smiled and landed in front of everyone. He sighed,""How can the dynasty not be corrupted with you bunch of scum? How could it not collapse? I'll give you five minutes. For those who haven't finished writing ... Find someone to write for you. If you can't write it well, then you'll be buried here!"
         In an instant, like primary school students in class, the rustling sounds continued. Many people were writing their identities, and some were trembling so much that they couldn't write anymore, begging the people around them for help.
         At this moment, Nan Quan had also returned. He smiled and nodded.""It's settled!"
         In this short period of time, he had killed six Sunglow experts and one Sunglow demon.
         On the island, there were quite a few guards, close to a thousand of them.
         However, at this moment ... They were all killed by a few butchers!
         In Li Hao's eyes, this group of people was even more disgusting than Pirates. They were all guilty!
         Raising demonic beasts was nothing.
         Feeding blood food!
         Feed them humans!
         Eating children, eating woman...In the name of helping the human race get rid of tras...Don't these guards know?
          Didn't the players on this Island know?
         Li Hao actually wanted to kill them all ... But in the end, he held back. He suppressed the anger in his heart. He knew that he couldn't do that. There were too many people involved.
         It was fine if he killed a few, but if he killed all of them ... That would be unacceptable.
         Unless he wanted to go against the entire dynasty now.
         But he didn't have the strength.
         These people all deserved to die.
         Li Hao felt that killing them all would not be an injustice, but ... He suppressed his anger in the end. He smiled and continued,""After writing your identity, write down the crimes of the four Seas Chamber of Commerce ... As for which crimes, you can think about it yourself!"
         "I'm done. Sign and stamp!"
         He took out countless pieces of paper and threw them in front of the crowd. Some of them looked scared, but Li Hao said calmly,""If you write it, you can live! If you don't want to write ... You can try!"
         After a while, yang Shan appeared. At this moment, he was holding many storage rings in his hand. He sent a voice transmission."Several storehouses have been cleared. All the storage rings on the bodies of those sunguang's corpses have been taken, and the three suns 'storage rings have also been taken ... However, there are probably many treasures in these buildings on the island that we haven't had the time to take."
        
         Li Hao took it but didn't check it.
         He continued to stare at the bronze mirror. After a while, he reached out and grabbed the papers and storage rings in front of those people.
         After checking them, Li Hao smiled.
         "If all your fathers and grandfathers are called over ... About half of the nine divisions of the dynasty and the royal family will come ... No wonder the four Seas Chamber of Commerce is so arrogant and rich. With you here, of course we're rich!"
         He pointed at a young man who seemed rather calm. Seeing Li Hao point at him, he lowered his head and smiled.""You're the grandson of the North Sea King?"
         The King of the North Sea, the Pirate of the North Sea!
         The number one Bandit!
         And this person's identity was written as the grandson of the North Sea King ...
         We've caught a big fish!
         "Yes, but my grandfather has many children and grandchildren. I'm just one of them, so I'm not really valued ..." The young man said in a low voice.
          "You should know that if you're not valued, then there's no need for you to exist ... Are you sure?"
         The young man struggled a little and sighed,""I'm a junior that grandfather dotes on. This ... Is my guard!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He pointed at the two men kneeling on the ground. The strong man was his guard.
         A late-stage sunguang expert.
         The capable man sighed helplessly. The grandson of the North Sea King, Li Hao, had a grudge with the Pirates of the North Sea. An Archduke of the North Sea pirates had tried to attack Li Hao and was killed.
         He was not one of the Archdukes, but he was a strong man trusted by the King of the North Sea. Therefore, he had been protecting the young man.
         Li Hao smiled and nodded.
         Then, he looked at the woman kneeling on the ground. She was an expert at the middle stage of the rising light realm."What about your identity?"
         Without the woman's reminder, Nan Quan said,"she's not simple. If you look at the God tier Masters Ranking list, you'll see her name. Mu Xiaorong, the youngest daughter of the Secretary of internal affairs. She's involved with the royal family."
         "The daughter of a Secretary?" Li Hao was surprised.
         "Right!"
         "And he's very talented," Nan Quan said."He's on the God tier Masters Ranking list."
         Li Hao laughed,"the Internal Affairs Division represents the royal family, and the four Seas Chamber of Commerce is under the financial division. What are you doing here?" You're a woman, and you're here to eat, drink, womanize, and gamble?"
         He seemed to have caught a bigger fish!
         The woman kneeling on the ground had exquisite looks, and she was no more than 30 years old. At this moment, she sent a voice transmission to Li Hao,""Governor li, it's not a good thing to disclose my identity here. It involves the affairs of the nine Imperial families ..." He said.
         BOOM!
         Li Hao threw a punch, and mu Xiaorong's expression changed. She wanted to resist, but she was directly hit into the ground. Blood spurted out of her body, and she kept spitting out blood. Her face was full of horror.
         Li Hao laughed."Don't threaten me. Also, I don't care what you're negotiating about. Someone will naturally investigate it!" All I know is that you're now a prisoner, a criminal, understand?"
         Mu Xiaorong kept coughing blood and said in a low voice,""I'm your prisoner ... But I'm not a criminal!"
         "No, no, no!"
         Li Hao shook his head."You have to understand. All the matters of the transcendents in the world are under the jurisdiction of the night patrolmen!" You're an extraordinary, and you've just threatened the Vice Governor of the Heavenly Star military governor's office, the night patrolman. That's a crime! Do you understand?"
         Mu Xiaorong did not speak.  "Hand over the storage ring!"
         "What do you want?" Li Hao looked at her with a cold gaze.
         Mu Xiaorong was shocked and lowered her head."No, I don't ..."
         p "What do you think you can take out to kill top martial masters like me and Nan Quan?"  "Why don't you try it?" Li Hao said coldly.
         Mu Xiaorong's face was pale. Without saying a word, she threw the storage ring away.
         Li Hao caught it, and the next moment, his expression changed slightly. He took out something from it. It was a transparent crystal, but it was filled with energy. It felt ... Extremely unstable, as if it could explode at any time.
         "Energy bomb!" Southern Fist gasped.
         Soon, he heaved a sigh of relief, it shouldn't kill me!
         There was only one pill, so it shouldn't be able to kill him.
         Li Hao also frowned slightly. He knew about this thing. Fan Chang had used it last time, and Hong Yitang was forced to retreat and suffer minor injuries.
         As expected, he was rich and overbearing!
         A mid-stage rising light realm cultivator actually had such a treasure.
         He laughed and glanced at the descendant of the North Sea King."How about you?"
         "I don't have this ..." The young man quickly said.
         "Do you want to take out your own storage ring, or do you want me to cut it open for you?" Li Hao laughed.
         The young man's expression changed.
         Li Hao said indifferently,"it's not just him. The others are the same!" You have to understand that storage rings are hidden in the flesh and blood, so you can actually see them. One is used on the surface, and the other is a backup. I'm very familiar with this routine!"
         "If you really want me to cut them open one by one ... You can try."
         At this moment, someone in the crowd was trembling.
         Soon, someone grunted and dug out the hidden storage ring from the flesh and blood.
          These were also preparations in case of an emergency.
         When they were robbed or in danger, these storage rings would contain some treasures that could be used to kill their enemies or other treasures that could help them escape ...
         The young man also sighed. He did not dig out the flesh, but instead spat out a storage ring.
         Li Hao ... Was very difficult to deal with!
         He had hidden the storage ring in his internal organs, and it had actually been discovered.
         Li Hao also smiled.
         Have you discovered it?
         Not really.
         How could it be that easy?
         However, he recalled the time when he hid the divine power Stone with Liu Long and the others. If they could hide the divine power Stone in their stomachs, why could the others not?
        
         As expected, there was more than one person who hid the storage rings.
         There were actually dozens of people who had hidden storage rings.
         He collected a large number of storage rings.
         ,m There were also two suguangs that he had captured alive. One was the guard of the North Sea King, and the other was the daughter of the Secretary of the Internal Affairs Department. Their identities were not ordinary.  And in the crowd, there were a lot of people who were related to the imperial family of the nine divisions!
         The Deputy Secretary's grandsons and granddaughters, there were a bunch of them.
         On the other hand, the only direct descendant of the ninth Secretary seemed to be this woman.
         There were also many descendants of the imperial family and Dukes, as well as the descendants of the Kings. However, it was a pity that there were no princes and princesses.
         Li Hao's eyes swept over the crowd. There were at least three thousand people here!
         A lot of them!
          However, many of them were service personnel of the four Seas Chamber of Commerce. Li Hao had only ordered his men to kill the guards, but not these people. Some of them were here to do business, while others were here to provide services. Li Hao had no interest in killing them.
         The small island, including those who had died, could actually accommodate four thousand people.
         It wasn't too many, but it wasn't too few either. Most importantly, many of them had extraordinary identities.
         At this moment, everyone was looking at Li Hao cautiously. A foul smell was lingering in the air.
         Li Hao looked at the time. It had been 20 minutes since the ambush started.
         Perhaps, someone had already discovered something.
         For example, if someone tried to contact the people here but couldn't reach them, they might be suspicious.
         Li Hao seemed to be thinking about something as he looked at the group of people in front of him.
         Nan Quan sent a voice transmission,"what should we do?" Should he kill them all? Or what?"
         Li Hao glanced at him and said,""Uncle-master, kill them all!"
         “……”
         Nan qun was speechless. I'm not doing it.
         If this gets out, I won't be able to survive.
         He had offended the Financial Secretary. Anyway, hou Xiaochen was there to stop him. If he really killed all of these people, he would just escape to the Li Dynasty.
         Li Hao didn't say anything else and put away all the confessions.
         After thinking for a while, he looked at mu Xiaorong."You write one too. Write it ... In the Department of Internal Affairs ..."
         Mu Xiaorong said in a low voice,"then you should just kill me. It's impossible for you to write all this. I'm different from them. By writing all this ... It represents the attitude of the Department of Internal Affairs."
         BOOM!
         Li Hao's fist smashed down, and mu Xiaorong's face was filled with fear!
         Killing intent!
         The next moment, he was no longer calm as he screamed,""I'll write!"
         Bang! Bang!
         He was still sent flying by Li Hao's punch, coughing up blood. Li Hao chuckled,""You're really ... Cheap!"
         The surroundings were incomparably silent, and everyone was terrified to the extreme.
         Was this the demonic sword?
         She was the daughter of the Secretary of the Internal Affairs Department. If he said he would kill her, he would kill her ... At this moment, the others had completely given up on all thoughts. They only hoped that Li Hao would spare their lives. As for resistance ... It was impossible.
         "And you ... Write down everything about the collusion between the Pirates of the North Sea and the four Seas Chamber of Commerce!"
         He looked at the grandson of the North Sea King."Don't tell me you don't know."
         The young man sighed."I ... Just want to ask, do I have a chance to live?"
         It was hard to say for others, but he was the grandson of the North Sea King. Li Hao might not spare his life.
         This was a devil!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao smiled."Yes. I won't kill you. It's good that you're still alive. However, you might be locked up in the inspector's office or the night patrollers 'headquarters ... Of course, if your grandfather is capable enough, he can directly bribe the higher-ups of the inspector's office or the night patrollers ... You might be able to go back alive! But as long as I'm here ... You can just help me point out a witness!"
         Pointing out the witness!
         The young man understood. He felt miserable. In this case ... Even if he managed to escape from the night patrolmen, he would still be dead. Li Hao's intention was clear. He wanted to kill a group of people, and he was the best evidence.
         "Everyone, be happy!"
          Li Hao chuckled,"I'm a good person, an existence that upholds justice!" Later, I'll take everyone back to stellarsky city ... I've even prepared a vehicle for you ... As long as you're not guilty, you won't die. Be happy, or else you'll think that I, Li Hao, eat people!"  As soon as these words came out, some people heaved a sigh of relief.
         However, they were also cursing in their hearts.
         You don't eat people?
         You're scarier than a man-eating devil!
         As for Li Hao, he threw out an origin divine weapon, which quickly grew in size. In the blink of an eye, it covered an area and turned into a spaceship. The space was not small, which was also one of the spoils of the Duke dingguo's mansion.
         Li Hao exhaled and looked at Southern Fist.""When we return to stellarsky city ... There might be some trouble on the way. Martial uncle Nanquan, be careful."
         Nan Quan nodded slightly.
         Li Hao took out a communication Jade. After some consideration, he put away the bronze mirror and sent a message."The four islands are suddenly covered in fog, and communication is blocked. It is suspected that great demons are causing trouble ..."
         After sending the message, he no longer cared about this.
         In the next moment, he transmitted a few words to Nan Quan. Nan Quan was a little surprised and nodded, not saying anything.
         ……
         Meanwhile, in the Douluo arena.
         Wu Yong frowned and looked at quicksand.""There seems to be a problem with the four islands. The communication is not smooth ... Many people are asking me that I can't contact my family. I just received a message from the four islands, but when I sent it back, no one answered ..."
         "Will something happen?" Liu Sha frowned.
         Wu Yong's heart skipped a beat. He looked at Liu Sha in ... Disbelief. A moment later, he transmitted his voice,""Do you ... Think ... The demonic sword ..."
         Liu Sha's expression changed as well."He ... He dares?"
         Of course I dare!
         Touching the Douluo arena and the four Seas Chamber of Commerce was the same, so why wouldn't he dare?
         Wu Yong swallowed his saliva. If it was really as he had guessed, then ... He would be in big trouble!
         Although the four Seas Chamber of Commerce had many Sunglow swords, the demonic sword was not weak either ...
         However, after thinking about it, he frowned. There were so many people, could it be that no one could escape and send out the message?
         Perhaps, he was just overthinking it.
         "Tell the Secretary that I want to take a look at the Douluo arena. Be careful of them creating a diversion ..."
         "You're going by yourself?"
         "En!"
         Wu Yong nodded."I'll go on my own ... And bring ... Bring that thing along. I'll leave the energy bomb with you for now. This way, we'll have the power to protect ourselves."
         "Alright!"
         The two of them discussed for a while. Wu Yong didn't say much and quickly left with the two sunguang.
         Although he was worried that they were luring the Tiger away from the mountain, he was also very afraid that something would happen to the four islands. If that was the case, then it would be very troublesome. There were still many treasures on the islands, and there were also many descendants of powerful figures.
         If they all died, he, Wu Yong, would not be able to keep his head.
         Even the Secretary couldn't protect him!
         After Wu Yong left, quicksand quickly reported. Not long after, Secretary Liu's message came,""Investigate with Wu Yong, don't act alone!"
         Secretary Liu was very annoyed. When faced with such a situation, of course they had to stick together. Were they giving the enemy the chance to attack separately?
         These two idiots!
          ……
         In the financial division, Secretary Liu frowned slightly.
         He was thinking about something.
         Could it be Li Hao?
         Did he have the courage and the ability to cause such a blow to the four islands without even sending out any news?
         "Unless there's a helper, and an extremely powerful helper at that, it's impossible ..."
         He quickly sent out a message to have people keep an eye on hou Xiaochen. Could it be that this guy was personally involved?
         His subordinates quickly sent back news that hou Xiaochen was still at the Nightwatchers "headquarters, which made Secretary Liu feel a little more at ease.
         "He should be fine ..."
         Not knowing if he was comforting himself or if he really believed it, Secretary Liu let out a sigh of relief. He still felt a little uneasy.
        
         (Diarrhea, so miserable)
         In the darkness.
         A huge spaceship flew across the sky.
         Thousands of people were imprisoned in the spaceship. The two powerhouses of the rising light were pale. They watched as Li Hao's internal strength slowly reached their hearts. Their eyes were full of despair and anger.
         But Li Hao didn't care.
         He was very calm.
         Little by little, he penetrated his inner strength and carefully wrapped it around their internal organs. His movements were very gentle, as if he was working very seriously.
         It was said that men who worked hard were the most handsome.
         However, mu Xiaorong and the other woman didn't feel it at all. They only felt fear.
         The feeling of their hearts being squeezed tightly made them feel like they could explode at any time.
          Li Hao frowned and said softly, don't move! The mysterious energy is unstable. Although the inner strength is stable, if it moves around and the mysterious energy flows, it's easy to burst the inner strength and cause the five internal organs to explode!"
         Mu Xiaorong's face turned pale."You know that the mysterious energy is unstable ... We've already been captured. You're going to make our hearts explode."
         "I won 't."
         Li Hao's smile was bright."I know what I'm doing. As long as you don't display power greater than three suns, your hearts won't explode. I'm not completely controlling you, either. I just don't want any unpleasant things to happen, understand?"
         Mu Xiaorong gritted her teeth and didn't say anything.
         If Li Hao openly took them to Tian Xing city, it would easily lead to the Financial Secretary's counterattack. Once the war broke out ... It would be extremely dangerous for them.
         "Governor li, what exactly do you want to do?"
         Mu Xiaorong suppressed the fear in her heart.""Since they won't kill us, there's no need to do this. We'll just cooperate. If we encounter danger, we might be able to help."
         "No need, no need!"
         "No." Li Hao refused with a smile and shook his head."Your status is too noble. I can't bear to make you work so hard."
         Mu Xiaorong was speechless.
         Li Hao looked outside the ship. They were about to cross the star sea.
         After crossing the ocean and passing through an uninhabited area, they would arrive at stellarsky city.
         Would the Financial Secretary send someone?
         He smiled and looked at mu Xiaorong."Your status is noble. Come, you stand at the bow of the ship. As long as it's someone from the financial division or the government, they won't dare to make a move on you. The ninth Secretary's status is too noble. No one will dare to touch their children ... What do you think?"
         Mu Xiaorong's face turned pale again.  Li Hao looked into the distance as if he saw the light approaching quickly. He didn't say anything. He just grabbed mu Xiaorong and threw her to the bow of the ship. His voice came slowly,""I'm giving you an order, not a prayer! Think about how you can make the people on the other side not attack you and this ship ..."
         After saying that, he turned around and looked at the trembling nobles in the cabin. He smiled and said,""All the descendants of the Deputy Secretary, walk to the front. All the members of the royal family, walk to the front. How carefree you were just now, now, continue to be carefree at the bow of the ship!"
         The group of people did not dare move.
         They knew that the bow of the ship was dangerous and people could die.
         Li Hao smiled."First time. I don't like to say it a third time. You still have one more chance ..."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com As soon as he said that, there was a slight commotion in the crowd.
         After a while, the first person, the second person ... People walked out one after another. They were all trembling, but they didn't dare to delay any longer. They knew how terrifying and ruthless this person was.
         The thousands of corpses on the island were still fresh in his mind.
         Those who were usually high and mighty were just paper tigers in front of these people. They were killed in an instant. Until now, they still didn't know how many experts had come.
         He only knew the southern style, but he was not familiar with the others.
         About twenty people walked to the bow of the ship.
         It was very quiet.
         Li Hao was not happy. A large divine power Stone appeared and illuminated the bow of the ship. He looked at the men and women and said in a cold voice,""Come on, you're still as arrogant as you were on the island! Men and women ... Didn't they like to play? Come and play for me. Whether it's kissing or doing something else, come on, move. Let people know that you're having fun here!"
         The group of people trembled in fear.
         Mu Xiaorong's face was livid. She looked at Li Hao, and Li Hao looked back at her, his face even colder."I don't want to kill the people of Jiusi! But, don't force me ... Otherwise, I can't guarantee how many of you will survive! Don't think that there's any trouble for me to kill you. Yes, there are too many people who want to kill me, and because of that ... I don't mind offending a few more!"
          Everyone trembled, but they still moved. Some people whispered to the people around them, some played rock-paper-scissors with people they knew, and some trembled as they hugged and kissed the people around them ...
         They were clearly in a state of enjoyment, but their bodies were trembling.
         Li Hao made them fear him.
         These people were very arrogant, but that was because they were backed by their background. Now, someone didn't care about their background. They could only submit.
         Li Hao once again looked into the distance.
         In the darkness, there were too many spotlights in stellarsky city. He couldn't see clearly, so he didn't plan to enter the city. He only slowed down to give the enemy more time. Once he left the city, the light ball would be very obvious.
         In the distance, a huge ball of light seemed to be flying forward at high speed, and there were two smaller balls of light beside it.
         Three sunrises!
         Someone was coming.
         Not only that ... Li Hao looked around and suddenly turned his head. Behind him ... There was another huge ball of light. It was very eye-catching and powerful. He didn't know when it had followed him. It was approaching, but its speed was decreasing.
        
         Li Hao raised his eyebrows.
         A metahuman followed behind.
         In front of him, there was a metamorphosized expert and two peak sunrise experts.
         The person in front was easy to deal with. There was a high probability that it was Wu Yong and the others. Then, the person behind ... Who was he?
         Friend or Foe?
         It was probably an enemy.
         From the looks of it, they must have discovered something. Nan Quan, yang Shan, and even Qin Lian, who had been secretly following him, did not give any warning. The other party was already less than ten miles away from them, only five thousand meters.
         He was very good at hiding his tracks.
         Dark element?
         Killer?
          Flying heavens!
         Li Hao quickly made a judgment. It was most likely a flying assassin. Only then could they easily hide from experts like Southern Fist. Southern Fist and the others were also following them in secret, but they did not discover them. It should be known that for experts, 5000 meters ... Was actually not too far.
         Did a mere transformation stage cultivator dare to kill him?
         These people should know that he was not easy to kill.
         Not to mention one metahuman, last time in the East, three metahumans had chased after him and failed in the end. They would not be so stupid.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "So ... If these people dare to come and guess that I'm here, they definitely won't think that they can kill me just because I've transformed ..." He thought.
         Therefore, he must have a trump card.
         What was it?
         Energy bomb?
         Or something else?
         In any case, there must be some. Li Hao was sure that if there weren't any, the Metamorphoses wouldn't be so bold.
         Many thoughts appeared in his mind.
         And he also walked to the bow of the ship. The next moment, as if he had become invisible, he gradually disappeared from the bow. Mu Xiaorong and the others 'expressions changed. Li Hao ... Escaped!
         No, or rather, he used them as bait and hid in the dark.
         What to do?
         Mu Xiaorong sent a message to sunguang from the North Sea,""He's gone. Should we escape?"
         Sunguang of the North Sea ignored her and looked at the young man beside him. The young man shook his head slightly with a bitter expression. What did these nobles of the capital know?
         They had no idea how brutal the northern barbarians were!
         As a Pirate of the North Sea, he knew what Li Hao and the other Silver Moon martial masters represented in the North. They would rather die in glory than live in dishonor. If they did not cooperate with Li Hao and kill the enemy, they would have no chance of survival.
         At the critical moment, Li Hao would definitely kill them and run for his life.
         Escape?
         That would be the stupidest choice. It would be better to wait here. Wait. Perhaps there would be a chance of survival.
         ……
         "There's a metamorphosing cultivator following behind us. Southern Fist, be careful and sneak over ... Heibao, too!"
         At this moment, Li Hao hid in the darkness and sent a message through his armor.
         He could command the southern Fist, but Heibao couldn 't.
         However, it did not matter. Black Panther was now following Qin Lian, and Qin Lian was the weakest link. This meant that Southern Fist would go with Qin Lian and black Panther.
          "Be careful of what kind of trump card he has. It's possible that he can kill a metamorphosis stage cultivator in an instant ... Southern Fist is in front. If he knows I'm here, he must be prepared. He won't dare to kill me with just a metamorphosis ..."  "How about you?"
         Nan Quan's voice came from the armor."It seems like someone is coming ..."
         "I'm fine!"
         "Whether it's the three major organizations or anyone else, they are all afraid of the nine divisions at this time ... Seeing so many descendants of the nine divisions, they won't attack easily."
         Southern Fist didn't say anything else. Instead, he quickly sneaked into the darkness and moved in the direction Li Hao had pointed out.
         "Governor li, what about me?"
         Yang Shan asked.
         "You'll be in charge of the martial masters who might come ..."
         "Then ..."
         "Execute the order!"
         Yang Shan didn't dare to ask any more questions. He finally knew Li Hao. He was a ruthless character and even stronger than the rumors said. He didn't need much effort to kill a peak Xuguang.
         Such an existence ... Perhaps only divine power realm could deal with him.
         ……
         Wu Yong was very anxious, but as he flew, he also slowed down.
         His communication Jade vibrated with a lot of messages.
         He quickly took a look and grabbed some important information. One was from the director, telling him to slow down and not be anxious. He had already told quicksand to catch up.
         The other message was from an assassin.
         They said they found a ship flying out from the four islands, and it seemed to be full of aristocrats.
         That person was following them.
         In addition, some people have already gone to the four islands and are currently investigating the situation. There will be a reply soon.
         Wu Yong let out a breath. That was good.
         "Slow down, there's no hurry," he said to the two sunrises beside him.
         The two of them were stunned. You were the one who was anxious just now, and now you're also the one who's not anxious ...
         Of course, they did not refute Wu Yong's words.
         Then, he'd just have to take it slow.
         The three of them slowed down, but they could vaguely see the situation outside the city. In the distance, there seemed to be a flying ship, and a group of men and women were having fun at the bow.
          They even saw some people playing finger-guessing games and some kissing in public ...
         One of the sunrises let out a breath and cursed in a low voice,""I thought something happened to them and they were all dead. They looked so cool!"
         Wu Yong also frowned slightly.
         Are you all okay?
         He seemed to have seen an important figure, the one from the home of the Department of Internal Affairs.
         He was slightly moved. At this moment, the distance between them was only a few thousand meters. He sent a message to the other party, but there was no response. He frowned. Did he not see it, or ... Was there another reason?
         He thought for a moment and sent out a message to some of the people he recognized on the ship.
         In the end, it was like throwing a stone into the sea.
         At this moment, he felt that something was amiss. He transmitted his voice to the two people beside him,""Be careful, there's something wrong with these people ..."
         The two peak sunrise experts were shocked. Something was wrong?
        
         The three of them no longer spoke. Instead, they carefully concealed their tracks and quietly approached the area.
         ……
         However, the three huge balls of light were too obvious for Li Hao.
         At this moment, he did not make a move.
         However, a large amount of inner strength quickly flowed into the wind-chasing boots under his feet. The wind-chasing boots were used for escaping, but they were also used to kill. In the world of martial arts, speed was the only thing that could not be broken.
         It might not be accurate, but it was very useful at times.
         With a pair of boots, Li Hao could instantly cross three thousand meters if he went all out.
         Of course, he couldn't sustain such an outburst for long.
         For example, when he was chased by Xu Qing last time, he could only use it two or three times continuously. After that, he had to rest, recover, and use it again.
         " 4000 meters ..."
          Li Hao waited in silence. He hid in the darkness and remained motionless.
         3500 meters ...
         Li Hao was still very quiet.
         At the next moment, he sent a message to Southern Fist,""Attack!"
         In the distance, there was a loud bang!
         In the darkness, Nan Quan punched out, and a loud rumble resounded through the world. Nan Quan's roar resounded in all directions."How dare you, a flying assassin, attack an important member of the nine divisions!"
         BOOM!
         Fist suppressing the world!
         In the entire world, it was as if there was only this pair of fists. In the darkness, a dog instantly turned golden. Without a sound, it was incomparably valiant as it clawed at the black-robed expert!
         BOOM!
         Loud noises kept coming.
         Wu Yong and the others 'expressions changed as they quickly looked over. Wu Yong's expression changed as he transmitted,""Hurry up and help ..."
         "Guild leader, that ... Seems to be ... Southern style?"
         Help?
         Nan Quan was an expert from the royal family. Now that he was shouting loudly to deal with the flying killer, how could he help?
         Wu Yong cursed in his heart!
         Of course, it was an unintentional help. Sure enough, something still happened. It was Southern Fist who attacked. He was probably working with Li Hao.
         What about Li Hao?
         Just as he was thinking, the void suddenly fluctuated.
         His vision blurred, and a silver light appeared.
         The speed was extremely fast!
         No, he wasn't fast, but more like teleportation. He appeared in front of the three of them, dropped something, and disappeared in the blink of an eye without looking back.
         Wu Yong didn't even have time to react. In the next moment, he realized something. He didn't even have time to take out the divine power talisman. His expression changed drastically, and he didn't have time to warn the people around him. He broke through the air and fled!
         BOOM!
         A deafening sound was heard. At this moment, the explosion even caused the stellarsky city to tremble.
         An energy bomb was specially used to deal with those in the transformation stage.
          One pill could possibly kill a metahuman.  Of course, the transformation stage also depended on one's strength. Those who were stronger could still escape, but injuries were inevitable.
         With a loud bang, the two peak stage rising light experts were instantly blown away. One of them was unlucky as his head exploded. The other one roared and escaped, his legs instantly turning into nothingness.
         As for Wu Yong, he also let out an angry roar and tore through the air to leave.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com BOOM!
         A huge energy fluctuation exploded behind him and swept over. In an instant, a powerful aura burst out from his body. With a loud bang, he was sent flying and kept spitting blood.
         In his eyes, however, there was a hint of relief.
         However, he was injured, and his internal organs were in turmoil ...
         Puchi!
         A sword pierced through the air!
         The timing was perfect. Wu Yong punched out and roared,""I'm the president of the four Seas Chamber of Commerce. If you dare, the nine divisions will not let you off ..."
         He wanted to scare Li Hao away!
         He knew that it was Li Hao.
         As long as Li Hao hesitated, as long as Li Hao felt that he couldn't kill him in front of everyone, he could take out a divine power talisman and kill Li Hao.
         But Li Hao was waiting for this opportunity.
         The long sword was silent, but it struck out!
         With a clatter, an arm flew up. Wu Yong's expression changed drastically. There was a storage ring on that arm. His other hand hurriedly grabbed at the arm.
         Li Hao, that bastard!
         He actually broke through in an instant. Wind-chasing boots ... At this moment, Wu Yong was greatly regretful. He had forgotten that the wind-chasing boots seemed to be of great use to Li Hao.
         More importantly, where did this guy's energy bomb come from?
         He couldn't think about it anymore. He could vaguely sense that the quicksand behind him was catching up. He couldn't be led by the nose by Li Hao. Thinking of this, he suddenly gave up on grabbing the storage ring. Instead, he instantly retreated and turned to escape.
         Li Hao's attack missed. As he attacked, his opponent retracted his other hand, turned around, and fled.
         Li Hao was slightly surprised.
         He grabbed the broken arm and glanced at Wu Yong, who had escaped in an instant. He smiled. These transformations were quite capable. He had actually given up at this time.
         In the next moment, half of the five superpower locks in his internal organs were broken.
         A powerful aura was brewing in his body.
          Li Hao grabbed his broken arm and activated his wind-chasing boots. He instantly broke through and attacked with his sword. He dodged and attacked again!
         He didn't care about what Wu Yong did, and only struck out with his sword heartlessly.
         Puchi!
         The long sword seemed to have pierced into his opponent's body, but he didn't stop. Instead, he continued to retreat and activated his wind chasing boots. In the blink of an eye, Wu Yong's screams rang out. He wanted to explode, but he hit nothing!
         Just as it exploded, another sword came!
         Li Hao's sword was getting stronger and faster.
         In the next moment, Wu Yong seemed to see a ferocious Tiger pouncing at him and clawing out his heart ... He didn't die, but with some unwillingness, he spat out blood and gritted his teeth.""You ... Aren't you at the peak of the rising light realm ..."
         Li Hao's battle strength was definitely not at the peak of the rising light Stage.
         Definitely!
         The information was wrong.
        
         He was ridiculously wrong.
         Li Hao's combat ability was even stronger than his. He didn't know if it was an illusion, but he felt that he might not be able to deal with this guy even at his peak. Not only was Li Hao powerful, but he also had a divine weapon.
         Sunguang?
         Li Hao had never thought of himself as the rising sun. He was a Martial Master.
         Martial masters and superpowers were different.
         Without saying anything, the sword pierced through Wu Yong's head. Wu Yong stared at him with wide eyes. This was the first metamorphosis stage expert that Li Hao had personally killed.
         Not far away, the heavily injured peak stage Sunglow had his legs gone. He had a look of fear on his face.
         "Quicksand ..." He suddenly felt a little hopeful.
         The quicksand was here!
         It was in the distance, and there were a few sunrises following him. Quicksand was here, so he didn't have to die.
          Wu Yong was dead!
         Everyone had underestimated Li Hao and his true battle strength. They all thought that although his divine weapon was powerful and he had the great mountain Silver Moon behind him, Li Hao himself couldn't be compared to the metamorphosis.
         But ... Was that really the case?
         As for Li Hao, he quickly looked through the storage ring. A crystal-like object appeared in front of his eyes, and he smiled. He sensed something similar to the origin talisman that little tree had given him.
         However, it was different. The little tree's aura was Origin Energy, while this thing's aura was super energy.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Is the damage caused by divine arts merciless?"
         Li Hao thought to himself, is this thing powerful?
         Who knows?
         He would know after trying.
         The next moment, he didn't stop at all. He shuttled through the void. The battle with the wind chasing boots was of great significance. He instantly shuttled. One was 3000 meters, two were 3000 meters ...
         Six thousand meters away was where quicksand and's group was.
         Li Hao instantly appeared in front of them. Liu Sha's expression changed drastically. She could vaguely see the battle ahead, but before she could rush over, Li Hao had arrived!
         Without a word, quicksand quickly took out the energy bomb.
         She took out one, hesitated for a moment, and then took out three more ... But she hesitated for a moment whether she should throw them out or not. The explosive power of these things was too strong, and at this moment ... They were still near the city gate.
         Wu Yong had just left the city, and she was still in the city. She was afraid that she would be in big trouble if she created such a big explosion here.
         She would not be able to explain herself if a large number of soldiers and civilians were killed.
         In this moment of hesitation, Li Hao threw out a crystal.
         The next moment, Li Hao disappeared.
         Liu Sha and the others thought that Li Hao would hesitate, but Li Hao wouldn 't. As for whether the civilians would be affected, there were no damn civilians in this place. There were many defenders, but if the defenders died ... Li Hao didn't care!
         In stellarsky city, Li Hao could kill nine out of ten officers and soldiers, and he felt that some of them had escaped.
         In the air, the power of metal and fire were entangled.
          It exploded instantly!  Quicksand's expression changed drastically as he hurriedly threw out the energy bombs in his hands!
         BOOM!
         A deafening explosion directly razed all the nearby buildings to the ground. Hundreds of guards near the city gate were instantly turned into ashes.
         The ground cracked open, and a huge wave of energy swept in all directions.
         "Ah!"
         Screams of pain instantly erupted. The few sunrises around Liu Sha were blown up by the two forces in the blink of an eye.
         This place was like the sun.
         Li Hao's voice sounded like a demon 's.""Night watchman Li Hao of the star military governor's office is enforcing the law and killing the dark powers! Star Douluo arena's quicksand, innocents killed, defenders killed, energy bomb and God art talisman in hand, the night patrolmen will definitely investigate the source!"
         A stern shout resounded in all directions. At this moment, the huge stellarsky city actually fell silent.
         Silence!
         BOOM!
         A sword radiance shot toward heaven and earth. Li Hao was so fast that he appeared in an instant. The quicksand didn't have time to retreat before Li Hao appeared.
         Liu Sha was severely injured but fortunately, the power of the talisman had been greatly reduced by the energy bomb. Although she was severely injured, she still had the strength to fight. She quickly took out the remaining nine bombs.
         At such a close distance, if he threw it out, he would probably die together with Li Hao.
         But ... At this point, she didn't dare to hesitate.
         At most, they would die together!
         At this moment, a huge fist pierced through quicksand's back before Li Hao did. Beside it, a broadsword fell, and Li Hao's longsword pierced through the air!
         Did he really think that the southern Fist and the others were dead?
         Nanquan instantly released an extremely powerful aura and appeared in front of Li Hao. He wanted to block the explosive force of the energy bomb for him so that he might not die.
         Li Hao had paid for his life!
          He was very fast ... But Li Hao was even faster. He pierced through the void in an instant and appeared in front of quicksand. There was a large hole in quicksand's chest, but he was gritting his teeth and sneering. She had thrown an energy bomb!
         Let's Just Die together!
         This Li Hao was actually so strong, and the southern Fist and the others were also terrifyingly strong.
         However ... She had activated the nine energy bombs and thrown them out.
         She could imagine how this place would explode later. Li Hao didn't run away, but suddenly dared to attack. Unfortunately, he was too late!
         However, Li Hao didn't care about this.
         He could sense the unstable energy, but he wanted to try. In an instant, the starry sky sword emitted a huge devouring force."Black Panther!"
         Li Hao roared!
         In the darkness, the Black Panther was speechless. It opened its mouth wide and a huge devouring force was transmitted over.
         The starry sky sword and the Black Panther started to devour everything in their surroundings at the same time, as if they were going to devour all the energy.
        
         Quicksand was in disbelief. The bomb ... Didn't explode.
         Yang Shan did not stay idle. He looked in one direction from the corner of his eye. In the next moment, a sharp sword pierced through the void in the darkness and went through Liu Sha's head with a pfft.
         Qin Lian appeared.
         Tonight, she didn't show up much, but at this moment, at her husband's signal, she came out to steal the kill.
         Kill the Metamorphoses!
         Even if they were seriously injured and dying, they had to make a contribution so that Li Hao would know that they were not idle.
         Yang Shan disappeared in an instant and roared,""The Heavenly Star military governor Li Hao is currently enforcing the law! Miscellaneous people had to stay away! Wu Yong of the four Seas group, quicksand of the star Douluo arena, colluded with Pirates and demons, and fed humans to the demons. He was unpardonable and had committed heinous crimes. He had been executed! Quicksand tried to destroy stellarsky city with a city-destroying bomb, but Governor li stopped them in time. All parties, retreat and be careful of accidental injuries!"
         The sound shook the world!
         A powerhouse in the transformation stage shouted with all his might. One could imagine how loud his voice was.
         As for Li Hao, the starry sky sword's devouring power erupted.
          An extremely powerful force was integrated into the small sword by him. The Black Panther burped and kept releasing energy. The unstable energy went on a rampage in its body, but it was instantly melted.
         As the bloodline of the demon subduer, the demon subduer was famous for its devouring ability. It could devour any kind of energy, any kind of chaotic energy. As long as it didn't exceed its limit, it was a delicacy to the Black Panther.
         At this moment, the stellarsky city was frighteningly silent.
         The next moment, Nan Quan's voice rang out,"make the information public!"
         In an instant, many people in the city heard the sound.
         At this moment, many people took action. A large number of flyers were distributed, and it was as if it was raining in the entire stellarsky city.
         "Activate!" Nan Quan shouted again."Activate!"
         At that moment, the owner of the old tavern where he was drinking heard the noise. Without saying anything, he carried out a huge machine and projected it into the sky.
         The next moment, a huge screen appeared in the air.
         It was a projection.
         Nan Quan looked at Li Hao, smiled, and raised his eyebrows. Not bad, right?
         Li Hao had asked him to disclose the news one step ahead of time and let everyone in stellarsky city know about the SI Hai group's crimes. He had done much more than Li Hao had imagined.
         In an instant, an image appeared on the huge projection.
         A huge bird!
         "No, no, no, I don't eat people. It's blood food, offered by the four Seas Chamber of Commerce ..."
         In an instant, Li Hao crushed the ground, revealing a large number of human skeletons, as well as many living women and children.
         "Is this what you're eating?"
         "These are all useless ..."
         The conversation continued. In the next moment, a powerful force swept through the world. With a boom, the screen exploded and disappeared. However, this scene was engraved in the hearts of countless people.
         Eating people!
         Many, many people were worshipped by the SI Hai Group.
         A voice came from the distance,""Li Hao, well done. However, there are some things that you shouldn't make public. It's not good to scare the people ..."
         Li Hao's voice shook the world."The four Seas group belongs to the financial division. I can understand that Secretary Liu is feeling heartache for his subordinate's evil deeds. However, I think it's better to let the people judge and know that there is still justice and righteousness in this world!"
         Li Hao shouted coldly, his voice reverberating in all directions,""Night patrollers, clean up the Heavenly Star Douluo arena. Anyone who dares to resist will be killed without mercy!"
         "Kill!" A loud shout rang out from afar.
         The Golden spear shot out. In an instant, a large number of the Wei Wu Army charged towards the star Douluo arena!
         At this moment, some people were near Li Hao.
         Secretary Liu was like a breeze, breaking through the void and floating over.
         Li Hao looked at him expressionlessly.
         Secretary Liu looked around and looked at the southern style. He smiled and nodded,""Li Hao ... Well done!"
         "Average!"
         "But you know what?"
         Secretary Liu laughed."The People's sentiment ... Is actually nothing!"
         At this moment, he was transmitting his voice.
         With a smile on his face, he simply looked at Li Hao. Are you trying to incite the people?
         "But you have to understand that they are nothing. They can't do anything. Even if they know something, what can they do?  In the next moment, Secretary Liu's voice reverberated, "I'm Liu Yunqing, from the SI Hai Group. I colluded with Pirates and killed innocent people ... It's heartbreaking! The Financial Secretary has an unshirkable responsibility and will follow the orders of the Nightwalker of the inspection Division, the Heavenly Star military governor. Governor Li's combat power is monstrous, he instantly killed Xu Guang and transformed, and he Yong from the southern Fist has unparalleled courage. I am ashamed and hope that the nine divisions will come together to reward these heroes and remove a big parasite for my Heavenly Star!"
         As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared.
         Li Hao just watched silently. After they left, he said,""The Heavenly Star military governor's office, a night patroller of the inspection Division, will be opening today. Anyone who has been wronged can go to the headquarters of the night patrollers on Jiulong Street to report the case. Anyone who has anything to do with Wu Yong and quicksand, turn themselves in as soon as possible! Today, I have killed more than ten people from the rising sun and three from the transformation stage. Unless I use my magical power, I can still seek justice for all of heavenstar!"
         "Justice is in the hearts of the people. If it involves the Financial Secretary and Li Hao is incompetent, he will also invite the Secretary of the inspection Division, the fourth Minister of the night patrol, and the Deputy Minister of the hou Xiaochen Department to jointly purge the world! Return the world to a clear and bright universe!"
         Li Hao shouted,""In addition, I've captured thousands of people on the four islands, including the grandson of the biggest pirate leader in the North Sea and the descendant of a certain Secretary ... I won't favor or side with anyone. I'll investigate to the end whether there are more colluding with the four Seas group, whether they kill the people, whether they provide human food for the demon race ... The four Seas group has also colluded with the three major dark power organizations, He Yong of the southern Fist, and killed the elder of the flying metamorphosis. I hope the royal family can protect them from the three major dark power organizations!"
         His voice reverberated.
         The surroundings were eerily quiet.
         Someone had flipped the table and wanted to expose the dirty deeds of these upper echelons to the public, shaking the world!
         Li Hao's move was very unwise!
         Li Hao, on the other hand, had a cold smile on his face. Since you've done it, don't be afraid of finding out. Since you don't care about the People's feelings, what are you afraid of?
         At this moment, a majestic voice suddenly rang out from the silent Imperial Palace,""Li Hao of the star military governor's office should be rewarded handsomely for eradicating the cancer! The imperial family has already retired and has no treasures to reward him with. Li Hao is bestowed the title of Marquis Tianxing, an empty noble, as a token of my sincerity!"
         "I'll reward you with a Marquis's Manor. I hope that Viceroy li will continue to work hard and make decisions for the people. I hope that my dynasty will be restored to its former glory!"
         At this moment, there was a commotion all around.
         The royal family!
         The person who spoke ... Was definitely a top-notch expert since his voice had spread throughout the city. Who was it?
         The heavenly astral King?
         At this moment, the commoners were shocked. They seemed to have just remembered that ... They still had an Emperor!
         The powerhouses of the nine divisions all looked solemn.
         Li Hao, do you know that your trial today ... Has given the imperial family a great opportunity? they can't sit still anymore. Li Hao, you're really good at causing trouble!
         ……
         At the same time.
         Hou Xiaochen also sighed. "I knew you didn't leave, but ... I didn't know you were so cruel!"
         You've torn apart the nine divisions 'veil.
         The imperial family also saw this opportunity and began to surface. Li Hao, if you do this ... The following storm will probably be even bigger.
         I'm afraid I can't handle it!
         ……
         In the distance, Li Hao didn't say anything.
         He didn't thank her or reject her.
         ,m Marquis heavenstar?  Who would dare to ask for this title? heavenstar was the name of the dynasty, and Marquis heavenstar ... The royal family was afraid that he would not die!
         As long as the position of Marquis heavenstar was given, the nine divisions would never let Li Hao off.
         Thinking of this, Li Hao suddenly smiled. Not bad.
         Then let's continue playing!
         He looked at Nan Quan and smiled."Let's go. We'll go to the Heavenly Star Douluo arena and take a look. Bring those guys behind us ... Whoever dares to come and save us will be killed without mercy!"
         "Yes!"
          Nan Quan was also smiling brightly. This Li Hao ... Was really brutal.
         He had directly clashed with Jiusi!
         Of course, that was not all. The Financial Secretary had completely fallen out with him. There might be more crises in the future, but wasn't a crisis an opportunity?
         Nan Quan was in a good mood as he thought this.
         As for him being exposed ... So what if there were benefits for him to be exposed?
         Hiding wasn't to make himself weaker. As long as he could become stronger, he would just expose himself.
         ……
         At this moment, Li Hao's name had completely spread throughout stellarsky city.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The demonic sword Li Hao!
         An extremely terrifying guy had killed many transformation stage cultivators. He had only been in the stellarsky city for a few days, but he had already destroyed the four Seas group and the stellarsky Douluo arena. This time, the Liu family was going to cry.
        
         On this day, Li Hao made a name for himself.
         The tens of millions of citizens in stellarsky city remembered one person: night patrol Li Hao, the governor of the stellarsky military governor's office. Although many of them did not know this organization at all, they had all remembered it at this moment.
         The imperial family, which had not appeared for a long time, had also conferred Li Hao the title of Marquis heavenstar.
         The position of a Marquis was actually not worth much anymore.
         Even the royal family was worthless, much less the Marquis.
         However, in the past 80 years, there were very few conferment from the royal family. The conferment of Li Hao's title in public still caused a huge uproar.
         ……
         At the inspection Office.
         The Secretary arrived late. He didn't care about the terrified faces of the people below. He just looked outside and fell into deep thought.
         Li Hao, what a man!
          He had taken down the four Seas group and killed quicksand in an instant. Now, he was dealing with the star Douluo arena and had lost three powerhouses in the transformation stage and more than ten sunrise realm powerhouses in an instant.
         This wasn't all, Li Hao actually took away the magical talisman of the old Secretary of the financial division. It seemed that the old Secretary was going to suffer a loss and paid a big price, but in the end...It actually exploded with his own energy bomb and was scrapped!
         "The energy bomb is ineffective ... What a terrifying kid!"
         That sword was not ordinary.
         That dog was not ordinary either.
         The Liu family had probably used up all their resources to launch so many energy bombs, but they had all been devoured. Li Hao, on the other hand, had attacked quicksand head-on. Although he hadn't killed quicksand, Li Hao had already possessed the combat strength of a metamorphosis.
         This was even more terrifying!
         With these thoughts in mind, he looked at the imperial family again, and then at the area outside Jiusi Street. There was a sudden burst of noise.
         Even the sky was shaking!
         No one had expected to see such a big show in stellarsky city tonight. The new military governor of stellarsky city was actually so bold. He was talking about Li Hao, not hou Xiaochen, who was being ignored by many people.
         The public was more concerned about Li Hao, even though he was only the Vice Governor.
         "Secretary ..."
         Someone looked at the inspector, and the inspector looked back at them. He suddenly laughed."Let's go to the financial division!"
         "What?"
         "Eat the meat!"
         "Hmph!" The inspector sneered."His subordinates colluded with Pirates, fed demons, and killed humans. Does Liu Yunqing think he can just let it go?"
         Then, he went straight to the Financial Secretary.
         It was not just him. At this moment, people from the other eight divisions also flew over.
          Since you've been caught red-handed and made public ... Then I'm sorry, the financial division is overflowing with money. Although Li Hao is a big problem, before that, the Liu family will first have to pay a huge price to calm everything down.  ……
         The Financial Secretary.
         Secretary Liu's smile disappeared.
         A moment later, he coughed.""AI! I didn't expect this ... Of course, this is fate. Although I didn't expect this to be the result, I should be prepared for failure. The financial division will take away everything except the dynasty's taxation power!"
         "Father!"
         "Are we just going to throw it away like this?" Secretary Liu gritted his teeth.
         "It's not necessarily a bad thing to have gains and losses. "
         The old man's voice rang out once more."Right now, Li Hao and silver moon's gang are in the limelight ... It's actually a good thing that we've suffered a great loss. The royal family is about to rise up, so let them fight!" Except for the right to pay taxes, we can't give up all the caravans of the four Seas group, and the same goes for the Douluo arena. All the industries in the stellarsky city ... We have to give them all up!"
         "If they continue to force us ... Throw out the grade-two relic we have."
         Secretary Liu's expression changed. He suppressed the shock in his heart and said in a low voice,""Father, we've only lost for a short while. It's hard to accept the death of two metahumans, but ..."
         He thought for a moment and suddenly felt a little discouraged. He sighed and nodded.""Alright, I understand! The financial division does need a period of silence to eliminate the influence. He, Li Hao...Has no black spots, but the nine divisions and the royal family, big brother won't say anything about second brother, they won't do that ..."
         He laughed bitterly.
         Actually, no one would disclose this kind of thing. Who would dare to say that they were clean?
         No one dared to!
         No one would dare to do this, because everyone was the same. But Li Hao dared to do this. If you exposed the black material of the inspection Office in order to take revenge on him ... That would be a joke.
         Did he, Li Hao, care?
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He wouldn't care!
          The more you threw it out, the more excited he would be. He didn't mind watching a show. Anyway, he had nothing to say. If you're capable, you can find some dirt on Li Hao. He's only been out for a few days. What are you looking for?
         "Hehe ..."
         Secretary Liu suddenly laughed coldly."All of you are here to watch the show. Why don't you think about where Li Hao came from? he's a barbarian from Silver Moon! Be careful not to fall into your own trap, who doesn't have a little shit under their butt? Father is right ... Since we've suffered a great loss ... Let's just lay low. I'd like to see if this Li Hao ... Can still cause another storm!"
         Alright, you want to watch a show?
         Even the imperial family wanted to join in the fun? fine, just wait and see. Li Hao was no saint. Everyone had been paying attention to hou Xiaochen, but who knew that Li Hao would suddenly transform so quickly?
         Just wait!
         If this continued, no one would benefit.
         He sneered again when he felt that someone was outside. Were they all so impatient?
         Alright, that's just nice. I also need some time to stabilize my realm.
         He didn't go out, but only said in the hall,""The four Seas group's Wu Yong has made a mistake, and the facts are conclusive. His crime is unforgivable, and his death is also a way to court death. I have an unshirkable responsibility. From today onwards, the four Seas group will be nationalized, and the star Douluo arena has nothing to do with the Financial Secretary. The financial division is the financial center of the country. This Liu is incompetent and lacks discipline. From today onwards, except for the country's taxes, all other industries will be closed ..."
