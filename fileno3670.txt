The local powerhouses could hardly cause any waves."The chaos must be unified!""Chaos and order will always oppose each other! The only way to resolve the chaos was to establish order. Using order to resolve the chaos, to establish the true order and chaos! "Only in this way will order last forever ...""Now that chaos 'true body has arrived, the other nine have yet to arrive. This is our greatest chance!" Huntian Supreme Emperor said calmly. Kill the chaos, expand the order, and rebuild the nine Heavens and earth!""Mortals remain mortals. One layer of heaven and earth, one layer of order. The strong and the weak are clearly distinguished, all the way to the nine Heavens!""This is the meaning of the existence of the ninefold guards. Let the chaos be divided into nine parts, let the light shine on the world, and expel the darkness. All of you shall walk in the darkness! The existence of darkness, the ninefold guards! When the darkness disappears, it will be time for the ninefold guards to appear!" The shadow in the darkness!Without darkness, there would be no ninefold guards. With darkness, there would be the shadow of the ninefold guards. They were the pioneers of the darkness, and also the existences that expelled the darkness. They were a complex and contradictory combination.The darkness might never go extinct, and the ninefold guards would always exist.At this moment, all the cultivators of the ninth layer guard had fervent gazes."We pledge to follow you to the death! Banish the darkness, establish order, chaos, and clarity!"Beside him, the leader of the ninefold guards let out a low roar.The surrounding cultivators followed one after another, their low shouts shaking the surroundings.Huntian Supreme Emperor revealed a smile."Order encompasses all DAOs, and darkness is also within the scope of order. However, darkness will not be the mainstream of order, and chaos will not be the mainstream of order!""In the depths of chaos, chaos has descended ... Perhaps, it's to resist the expansion of my order. Since that's the case, it naturally won't go as people wish! This time, I'll personally exterminate the chaos. You ... Kill all the powerful enemies and completely destroy the will of chaos in the North!""Yes, sir!"Everyone shouted in a low voice. At this moment, they were even more eager.Huntian didn't say anything else. He stepped into the air and headed straight for the core of the North. 'Chaos, I'm coming!'……At the same time.In the West.The nine Heavens.An extremely huge world stood at the peak of the nine levels.Li Hao stood in the chaos, as if he didn't exist. He just looked and felt the power of order around him. It was powerful and strange, as if it could correct everything.Yes, he had to correct everything.It was as if ... Standing here, even if one's heart was in chaos and there was injustice, it seemed to be able to calm all your troubles. It was as if one could let go of everything here.'Order ...Li Hao looked into the distance and fell into deep thought.There were experts from the huntian realm coming and going from time to time. It was very lively, but there weren't any strong existences. However, some venerable sovereigns still came and went.They were all brimming with smiles, as if this place was a Holy Land.He had forgotten all his troubles!Order brought light. But ...Li Hao, on the other hand, frowned and did not speak for a long time.The West was the most orderly, safest, and most heavily guarded place he had ever seen, but ... There seemed to be something hidden beneath it, which made him a little ... Uncomfortable.In fact, he had already sensed something.He even knew why the order in the West ... Had been established so quickly.He had even personally come into contact with this power.He saw it as the power of the devil!"Huntian ..."Murmuring, Li Hao looked to the North with a complicated look. Have you ... Established a new order?Within the order, there was ... Faith!Faith might not be the power of the devil.However, there were too many things mixed in with the power of faith. For example, the power of faith that shouldered the mission of the human race and was hailed by him as the power of the devil, also known as the power of the human Emperor.In the nine Heavens, in the huntian realm, he ... Could sense something.Moreover, it wasn't exclusive to him.It was because ... Countless people were wandering under the power of the great Dao. Therefore, countless people established some beliefs, established some responsibilities, and forgot some personal troubles. It was as if ... They had thrown away their selfishness.This wasn't the power of the human Emperor, the kind of power that only contained the will of the human race. Instead, it was the power of faith that contained many things, including ... The existence that maintained order and established order!Or was this a derivation of order?Li Hao fell into deep thought.He once again sank into deep thought. It was far too difficult to maintain order. There were people, living beings, and everyone had a selfish side to them. However, in this place, the special power of faith would gradually make them forget all of that.In fact ... It was an even larger divine Kingdom!For example, in the divine Kingdom, countless humans were chanting for the Queen, but was the Queen ... Really divine?No!Li Hao had never thought so. It was only the influence of the great Dao, not the true nature of countless humans."Huntian ... Is this good or bad?"He ... Couldn't tell for a moment.Such a country, such a country of order, could indeed save a lot of trouble. It could make the internal affairs more peaceful, and countless living beings would no longer be selfish and try to break the rules in vain.But ... Emotions, desires, darkness, selfishness ...  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ All of this, perhaps, would eventually disappear.Huntian was building a Peach Blossom Spring, a Peach Blossom Spring that belonged to him or order."Everyone has a selfish side and a dark side. He wants to purify them ..."

Chapter 3671 Order And Chaos_ 4
From then on, people would only be left with the bright side. At that moment, Li Hao finally understood why the West was so prosperous when order was established. It was because ... The special power of faith was affecting the entire West.He felt that it wasn't good, but he couldn't tell what it was ...He felt that this was destroying some of the human nature, but he also felt that to the current chaos, perhaps ... This was the fastest and most convenient method.The Queen's divine Kingdom was actually a similar existence, perhaps even more direct.Li Hao had already felt that it was inappropriate before this. Therefore, he was going to split open the sky and place the humans he had saved in the past back into the relatively safe chaos.However, on second thought, the relatively safe pseudo-chaos ... Was it the same as the West?In order, there was some faith ... To prevent people from killing?  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ "No... It shouldn't ... Have extinguished desire ... Society will collapse sooner or later. Desire must exist!"At this moment, Li Hao had an epiphany.Originally, he might have wanted to create an existence similar to the Western countries of order. However, at this moment, he seemed to have understood something.When people lost their desires and emotions and only had respect, be it the development of society, the progress of civilization, the comprehension of cultivation, or the innovation of Dao ... They would all stagnate.When everyone thought that this society was the best existence, that it had no ambition, that there would be no changes, and that there would be no new generations ... Then this society would be on the verge of collapse.Ambition and desire were the things that supported countless geniuses, lunatics, ambitious people, and inventors."The future false chaos should not only have order and rules, but also desires!"Li Hao muttered to himself.Huntian, in order to create an orderly Kingdom, had paid a lot and given a lot, but it had taken away the desires and emotions of many people, as well as their ambitions. This should not have happened.Of course, the present might be simpler. Perhaps huntian would think of the future and gradually let go ... This might not be the case.He should have understood that a pure source of peaches did not exist.Was it?Li Hao once again looked at the Realm of Chaos in front of him. This world was very beautiful ... Desires, emotions, ambitions, chaos, and darkness had all been expelled. It was truly a Holy Land. Perhaps countless people would look forward to it ...But ... It also ... Seemed a little fake."The future ... Shouldn't be like this ... So, the chaos of the future will still have a change in eras!"And so, the future could still come out, the future person he had seen before.There would still be masters of chaos, and there would still be new masters.After seeing the Realm of Chaos in front of him, Li Hao had more thoughts. In order, those things should not be completely annihilated. Desire might be a person's greatest enemy, but it could not be without it. However ... He had to learn to restrain and suppress."And ... Where did the countless cultivators, the countless cultivators of chaos heaven domain, the desires and emotions of mortals, and the darkness go?"Li Hao was shocked!At this moment, his expression suddenly changed and he fell into deep thought.The desires, darkness, and ambition in the human heart were all natural, eternal, and ever-present, including the countless humans in the divine Kingdom. They all existed.However, it was only temporarily suppressed.As a result, the humans of the divine Kingdom were like the Living Dead, which was equivalent to having their intelligence wiped out ... They were still sealed and in a state of silence.However, the cultivators and living beings of the chaos heaven realm were all active and even normal. This meant that ... The endless darkness, emotions, and desires had all been extracted by someone.Who was it?Huntian?Huntian ...Li Hao's expression changed slightly. In that case, huntian might ... Have gathered countless darkness, desires, and ambitions?Li Hao's expression changed slightly at the thought of this. This meant that huntian might be more powerful than he had imagined.That kind-looking Daoist, once darkened, might ... Be terrifyingly powerful.……Five elements realm."What?" the chaos Emperor suddenly opened his eyes and frowned.So fast!Was he that confident?He suddenly rose into the air and slowly exuded his aura. In an instant, many experts quickly arrived. Some were confused, while others were afraid."Our enemy is here!" The chaos Emperor said in a deep voice. You might not be familiar with me, but you're all here on the orders of your Dao master. For the sake of your Dao master's descent and for the sake of the primordial chaos, you must no longer imprison some people ... All of you must contribute for this!""Chaos heaven in the West is the inheritance of order. Order may look bright, but in fact, order ... Is even more overbearing! It's more domineering than any great Dao, and everything must be under order ... This is true order!""A million years ago, the master of order established the nine Heavens. At that time, all worlds were under the suppression of order, and all great DAOs were under the suppression of order!""At that time, the cultivators were in a constant state of panic ... The existence of order made all cultivators feel like they were about to be exterminated! The nine Heavens and earth, the nine tribulations, the next step forward is as difficult as mortals ascending to the heavens!""The existence of time may represent eternity and longevity, but it may not be the greatest enemy. However, the existence of order is the greatest opponent for cultivators to defy the heavens!"

These people might not agree with what he said, but this was what he, a rank nine, felt from the bottom of his heart.Order is our greatest enemy.What the cultivators who went against the heavens needed was not this kind of order that suppressed everything.The master of order might not understand, but would this generation's huntian understand?Why did he believe that the cultivators would willingly accept such an order?Cultivation and longevity were both heaven-defying acts to begin with. Breaking the limits of mortals ... Breaking the limits of longevity was heaven-defying in itself."Sky Gold, golden sun ... Follow me!"He didn't say much and went straight to the outer realm. At this moment, there were many experts in the outer realm.The members of the sky Gold Association were a little excited and nervous.Huntian, is he coming?Tian Jin made some arrangements and left two level-eight experts in the periphery to guard the five elements realm just in case. The rest of the people all rushed out of the realm and flew into the chaos.……The nine Heavens.Chaos and order gradually began to collide.The primal Chaos energy was like a vortex that swept through the world.The two sides had not even arrived yet, but they had already set off a monstrous wave.Huntian and the others stopped at the edge of the vortex, and the hurricane-like Primal Chaos energy swept through everyone. The dust in the primal Chaos was completely shattered and disappeared into the chaos.The weak spirituality began to spread.The Dao Laws of Chaos and order seemed to have begun to clash. One side rose, the other fell.Both sides were building their own battle domains.It seemed to cover the nine Heavens.After a while.The two sides looked at each other from a distance. They could already see each other's existence.Huntian placed his hands behind his back and looked into the distance. His eyes were a little deep.In the distance, the power of the great DAOs around the chaos Emperor was extremely chaotic, like the most explosive chaos. The world bobbed up and down, and a thought created and a thought destroyed.Their spirituality collided.Some of the seventh rank venerable sovereigns were already feeling suffocated.The chaos Emperor's expression changed slightly as he looked at the Daoist standing in the chaos. After a long time, he laughed."Order?"Huntian shook his head,"no, huntian!" In the heaven of chaos, order is not the only thing. Chaos needs a sky, and among it, order is the main force. There is also chaos, chaos, and all living things!" "What a huntian!"Chaos laughed."I thought it was just a random Daoist name. I didn't expect it to have such a meaning. It doesn't matter if you're order or chaos heaven. You want to establish order above others. I think ... You're a little delusional!" Huntian wasn't annoyed and nodded,"it's very difficult, but I'll do it!" Chaos, you have to understand that all living things, including chaos and the human heart, ultimately desire order, not long-term chaos! Be it mortals or cultivators, not everyone wants to be an Overlord. Even if order will interfere with some people, it can help the majority. The minority is subordinate to the majority, this is also the law of chaos!"As soon as he spoke, the surroundings, heaven and earth, seemed to be blooming with light.The spirit of the great path seemed to be trembling slightly.The chaotic power of the great Dao was suppressed, and the vortex seemed to have been forcibly stopped.Countless Primal Chaos energies turned from chaotic to docile energy. Huntian slowly said,""Look, even Primal Chaos wishes to stop being brutal. You're already a tier-9 expert; why don't you understand? You're the chaos Dao master. If you're willing to do your best to suppress chaos and become the master of chaos instead of the creator, you'll be even more powerful!"Chaos laughed."I can do that, but ... Who said that I have to do it for you? For the sake of order? The order in your eyes might not be my order, right?"Huntian sighed."You're so stubborn. Maybe what you said makes sense, but you still don't understand ... You're not the main character!""Is it? whoever wins has the right to say this. Huntian, you're not order ... Your arrogance has no basis at all!"In an instant, the world collapsed!The power of the great path began to shake violently. The vortex that had disappeared earlier reappeared and swept across the world. Some of the weaker ninth-tier guards trembled slightly.He was swept away by the powerful and chaotic power of the great Dao, and he couldn't even stand still.This was a tier 9!Even if it wasn't at its peak, it was still terrifyingly powerful. This was the main body, not a clone.Huntian Supreme Emperor shook his head.Sure enough, at this point, they all had their own Dao spirit. Their great Dao was already alive, so how could it be shaken by a few words? it was just that discussing the Dao before the battle would make one's Dao heart clearer.Chaos ... Since you are so stubborn, then ... Die!In an instant!A monstrous force swept out, and he instantly disappeared. His voice trembled,""Kill them!"As for himself, he floated into the air as if he had entered another world."Chaos, I'll be waiting for you!"The chaos Emperor's eyes flickered. He suppressed the shock in his heart and laughed,""Huntian, what a good name. Alright, let's give it a try!"In an instant, he disappeared from his original spot, and his voice reverberated,""Kill the ninefold guards! Remember ... The ninefold guards are the puppets of order. Order is the butcher's knife, and the ninefold guards are the butcher's knife of order ... Only by killing them will I have a chance to kill huntian!"As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared.He had already seen through it.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ The ninefold guards were one of huntian's hands, a crucial part of the existence of order. When this butcher's knife was gone, order ... Would not be stable.

Chapter 3673 Order And Chaos (1)
Huntian, do you think I can't understand?……High in the sky, it was as if they had stepped into the edge of chaos.The two of them appeared.Chaos and order opposed each other. The power of the great Dao emerged like two roaring dragons, one Holy and one chaotic. At this moment, they collided in the void and the entire chaos seemed to be trembling. The collision of light and darkness, the collision of order and chaos.The two figures stood at the peak of the chaos and attacked silently. There were only countless Dao laws that were born and destroyed. Order had just risen, but chaos was destroyed.Chaos erupted and order was broken.With a single thought from the chaos Dao master, countless worlds seemed to appear at the peak of chaos. Countless Wars and disasters emerged. This was a calamity and chaos."The heavens and earth were created, chaos appeared, and living beings were born ... The origin is chaos!""You want to establish order and destroy chaos. That is the source of ruin!" The chaos path Master's Voice was like a great Bell.As the voice rang out, the power of Chaos was like the beginning of the world. The entire area was filled with broken power of chaos, and order could not be established.Huntian's voice was calm."The source of life is indefinite between good and evil. Only order can exist forever!" Chaos was only temporary. Order was eternal! Edification and civilization are the necessity of order. Time is eternal, and at the end of time, there will only be order!""What big words!"The chaos path master snorted coldly. The end of time was order?What a good huntian!"Let's see if you can create something faster than me, huntian!" He said. Order collapsed and all living beings were in misery. The power of the great Dao swept in all directions and absorbed all the power of turbulence.With a wave of his hand, the Dragon of the great path roared madly, destroying everything. The world shook, and the destroyed land turned into a zone of chaos.Huntian Supreme Emperor also waved his hand and his Dao domain was established in an orderly manner. However, the speed was slower. After all, destruction was faster than establishment.……At this moment, in the chaos.Everyone had their own moves.In the East.The human King and the Supreme-being looked towards the North. The human King's eyes flickered for a moment. He looked over and raised his brows, but he remained silent."It's a collision between order ... And chaos?"Zhi Zun asked softly.The Lord of Chaos and chaos?The human King pondered for a moment before nodding his head slightly,""He came so quickly!"After saying that, he no longer paid any attention to her and only looked at the Grandmaster."We can't get involved," Grandmaster replied with a bitter smile.The human King fell into deep thought and did not speak again. After a while, he suddenly said,""It doesn't matter if I intervene or not. I just want to ask ... Is my neo martial the source of chaos or the representative of order?"The Grandmaster was silent for a moment before shaking his head."It's hard to say. I believe that chaos and order co-exist. There won't be a single existence. If there was a single existence ... There would be no difference between order and chaos!"The human King seemed to only be asking and didn't say anything else.Am I from the order faction or the chaos Faction?In fact ... None of them!He suddenly laughed."Order and chaos don't represent neo martial. Neo martial ... Represents ... Where I am, is neo martial!" No order, no chaos, no rules, it's all up to me!""How overbearing!" The Grandmaster laughed."Yes, it's overbearing!"The human King stood up and looked into the distance,""I don't care, I won't look, I won't ask. Today, the East has been completely unified. Completely seal off the four-sided domain. You can either leave or die!"He stood up with a long saber in his hand and shouted,""The East belongs to me, and all worlds must prostrate before me! Follow me ... On my conquest!"Around him, the figures of venerable sovereigns appeared one after another.Neo martial, set out!…… Four regions.Long Zhan could sense everything and silently looked into the depths of the chaos. Huntian, are you going to start?The four-sided region was full of wolves in the front and tigers in the back.If he couldn't leave, it would be difficult not to leave.After a moment of silence, he said in a low voice,"the North is in chaos. The war for chaos has officially begun!" Follow me out of the four regions and save all the cultivators of the chaos race. Destroy all those who enslave my race! "Take advantage of the outbreak of the war to gather our chaos race! With everyone United, there will be a day when the clouds open!"Today, he would not participate in the battle, but he would lead his men to save all the chaos race cultivators.The spirit of the great path seemed to tremble slightly and guide him in the right direction. He did not say anything more and looked at the people behind him."Wherever the Dao spirit is, there will be the chaos race waiting for rescue. Only by saving ourselves can we become stronger. Follow me!"A group of powerful chaos race cultivators entered the void one after another and followed long Zhan.The North was in turmoil, and the East was in turmoil. At this moment, perhaps it was the opportunity for the chaos race to grow stronger.……In the South.The spring Autumn Emperor smiled like a child. He suddenly looked to the West and mumbled,""They're fighting ..."It was as if she had no intention of conquering the world, but also as if she had nothing to pursue.He was only unwilling to accept his own fate!At this moment, he suddenly revealed a faint smile.""Heaven and earth will reverse, spirituality will be split again, chaos will be broken, and the races will no longer exist ... Our race can be redefined!"She smiled, and two dimples appeared on her small face.Behind her, in an instant, it was as if countless figures had appeared, and every single one of them was her.She took a step out and disappeared.No one knew what this powerhouse who rose up from the bottom had been fighting for all these years. It was as if he was always playing around in the world, but also seemed to be everywhere.However, he didn't know that the idea of spring and autumn had long surpassed the battle for hegemony.She wanted to reverse the chaos, break the limits of the races, and completely define the chaos. No one had stipulated that cicadas could only live for one season.It was difficult, but so what?Chunqiu smiled and disappeared into the South.……At the same time.In the West.Li Hao also sensed some fluctuations. The powerful order in the West began to tremble slightly. Someone in the chaotic heaven realm seemed to have sensed something too. At this moment, waves of powerful auras rose up, as if they were threatening the surroundings.The weak were still ignorant and continued with their lives.He was still brimming with happiness. On his face, there was a somewhat illusionary smile, making it impossible for people to distinguish between the real and the fake.Li Hao didn't move. He just watched, sensed, and silently experienced.In the North, a Great War had broken out.The war of chaos and chaos.It was also the expansion of order and chaos. Who could win?At this moment, he was inclined to huntian ..."Chaos, perhaps...You should come to the West to take a look. Perhaps, only then will you understand that huntian, in truth...Perhaps, is the greatest chaos!  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ I can only sense a thing or two because I'm here.It's a pity ... You didn't come.At this moment, the way of order in the West seemed to have become purer. Something invisible seemed to be disappearing. Even Li Hao sensed a faint peace.The desire that lingered in his heart seemed to have dissipated a lot.The West was a terrifying place.

Chapter 3674 Revolution (1)
In the North.Chaos and order were opposing each other, and the power of the great Dao was turbulent.Huntian ... Seemed to be no match for chaos.The speed at which order was established was far slower than the speed at which the other party destroyed it.The world was born, and the world was destroyed.With a single thought, the sky changed color.The collision of light and darkness!The chaos Thearch was expressionless. Although he had managed to suppress huntian, he was not happy. There was only a hint of ruthlessness in his eyes, but it did not seem to be directed at huntian.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ The chaotic laws shook, and his spirituality exploded.In all four directions, between heaven and earth, there seemed to be a chaotic world."My Dao, the origin of chaos!"He muttered softly and suddenly punched out. Heaven and earth exploded, and chaos erupted.On the other side, huntian retreated in an orderly manner. The power of the great DAOs seemed to have transformed into soldiers and set up a barrier that surrounded the power of Chaos, preventing it from spreading.Suddenly.A word appeared in huntian's hand."Freeze!"The words seemed to have come alive.At this moment, it was actually somewhat like Li Hao's divine text. The divine text suppressed the world and seemed to calm the chaos. In an instant, countless Dao law powers turned from disorderly to orderly and were forcibly suppressed between the heaven and earth."Huntian?" the path master of the path of chaos was a little surprised.Huntian's expression was calm."Quote one or two, chaos, heaven, has changed! The times have changed. "It was as if he was saying that this era was no longer the era a million years ago.The chaos path master laughed."Times have changed. The Dao is still the Dao, people are still people, and experts are still experts. For the past million years, the chaos is still the same chaos. It has never changed!""No, the old will be gone!""Hahaha!" Huntian laughed out loud."A new order is about to be established. Chaos, you're old!"In an instant, light burst forth!It was as bright as the sun!At this moment, it was as if the entire chaos was illuminated. Suddenly, the power of Chaos began to decay, as if it were using the Dao of the other overlords.The power of Chaos shattered in an instant. However, the chaos path master merely sneered. Even if it shattered, it was still chaos.However, in the next moment, the power of countless great DAOs seemed to revive. The withering Dao revived from the chaos. Suddenly, the power of order exploded from the core.BOOM!Heaven and earth seemed to be rebuilt. Everything was changing. In an instant, there was no heaven or earth.Barriers appeared in the nine Heavens and earth. The power of countless Dao laws transformed into countless clones and set up an extremely powerful barrier, surrounding the chaos Supreme Emperor.Recovery from destruction!The chaos path master's expression changed slightly. Suddenly, he let out a shrill cry. In the void, tens of thousands of black dragons appeared, and their roars reverberated in all directions."This world is still a chaotic world! The human heart is in chaos, the world is in chaos, and the chaos is in chaos. Your order is only a small part of the world!" BOOM!Outside the barrier, ten thousand Dragons charged at it, and countless clones of order were instantly shattered.The two sides exchanged blows, and for a moment, it was difficult to determine the victor.A powerful force spread in all directions, and a great battle broke out below. The five elements emissaries besieged the commander of the ninth layer guard, but the black shadow was like a sharp blade, piercing through. The five powerful cultivators who had fought against long Zhan in the past were now barely able to maintain their five elements under the attack of the black shadow.Tian Jin's group of three was also surrounded by many powerhouses of the ninth layer guard. All of them were extremely powerful. Even though they were once known as the overlords of the North, it was difficult for them to break out of the siege.On the contrary, he seemed to be at a disadvantage.Dozens of high-level auras burst out, and the entire Nine Heavens was shaking as if it was going to explode.In the North, the aura of chaos emerged.At the same time, the East was also in turmoil. The aura of the chaotic world appeared in the East, which seemed to strengthen the power of Chaos. In an instant, the chaos path master smiled in the sky.Chaos was the mainstream!Today, he was at war with huntian. As long as the other parties took the opportunity to attack, they would create chaos. The power of order was not as simple as chaos.Huntian would definitely be defeated!……In the West.As the War in the North broke out, the West became more and more peaceful. Other than the aura of a few type 8 powerhouses, the entire West was as peaceful as a Holy Land.Some people seemed to have sensed something. They were a little worried, but soon, they turned into prayers.It also turned into faith.He firmly believed that there was no problem that huntian path master couldn't solve in the chaos. Whether it involved the path of order or not, order would welcome a new life.At this moment, Li Hao still hadn't made a move.He sat cross-legged in the void and merged his great Dao with the Western land. He sensed the faint changes and the power of faith and Order that permeated the chaos.,m They were all calm.Li Hao had also forgotten the powerful aura from the West. Faith, order ...All sorts of thoughts appeared in his mind.Did people have to establish faith in order to strengthen order?What would happen to people without faith?Neo martial had faith, long Zhan had faith, spring and autumn had faith, and huntian had faith ...What is my faith?Li Hao thought.At this moment, he temporarily put aside the thought of attacking chaos heaven world. Chaos heaven and chaos had yet to determine a winner, so if he attacked now, he might give chaos an opportunity.Li Hao didn't interfere.At this moment, he suddenly pulled out a star from the river of the great path, which was like a Holy sun.He looked at the star and fell into deep thought.What was this?This was the power of the way of faith and the way of the human Emperor that Hong Yitang had absorbed. The Queen was creating countless balls of faith at every moment. There were too many humans in her divine Kingdom. The power of faith and the power of responsibility were exploding at every moment.

Chapter 3675 Revolution (2)
The Queen didn't dare to absorb it herself, and Hong Yitang had absorbed such a Dao law before. Therefore, the Queen was even more unscrupulous and injected the power of the Dao law into Li Hao's River of Dao.The Queen's idea was that Hong Yitang needed it anyway.However, Li Hao didn't give all of it to Hong Yitang.Bearing some responsibility was called responsibility.To carry all of them, to carry countless of them, that was ... A puppet.At this moment, Li Hao was looking at the balls of light. There were more in the depths of the river. He was quite afraid of this Dao, so he had never bothered with it and only suppressed it.If Hong Yitang needed it, he would only let him absorb a part of it, not the entire thing!At this moment, wandering under the Faith and Order of the West, Li Hao looked at the ball of light in a daze. If you don't understand it, you will never understand it.There was no good or bad in Dao.It was a sentence that he often said."I still don't understand this Dao enough. Huntian is using it, senior uncle Hong is using it, and in the future, there might be others who will use it. This Dao originates from the beliefs and persistence deep in the human heart ... What's the point of trying it?"At this moment, he didn't care about the chaos heaven world or the War in the North.Looking at the light ball in front of him, he laughed. Suddenly, he incorporated the light ball into the system of the great Dao. A star began to be born. Countless light balls began to overflow from the long river and merge into that small world.At this moment, countless voices seemed to appear in his mind."I want to live forever ...""I'd rather be a dog in peace than a man in chaos!""Mom, I want to study ..." He said."I want to become stronger!""It's so dark outside. Where did the sun go?"“……”Countless voices and thoughts appeared in Li Hao's mind at this moment, as if they were about to explode.That intense thought, that intense thought, made him feel as if he had become one of those countless mortals ... All of them seemed to have their own desires, their own beliefs, their own persistences.At this moment, it was as if a mountain of burden was pressing down on the river. Li Hao ... You should work hard for the peace of the chaos!In the nine Heavens and earth, the power of faith spread out and was absorbed by the stars.Li Hao didn't stop him!He allowed this energy to seep into it. Gradually, this energy combined with the stars. Suddenly ... It began to float toward the world of order in the 5000th world, toward the core that Li Hao was going to use to build the 5000th world.Huntian's clone was there.At this moment, all the voices in his mind seemed to have been unified, turning into one voice and one will ..."All living things and spirits, establish order, unite the will, and the chaos will be at peace!"Li Hao allowed the power to penetrate him.He was only sensing and sensing that he had even established a weak connection with the order of this place.Li Hao's eyes remained unchanged. He simply watched the huge star grow crazily.,m Order!At this moment, the power of the human Emperor path began to merge and even connect with the order path. This was the true core of chaos heaven-order, faith, responsibility, and persistence. In his mind, a voice kept echoing, as if it came from huntian!Li Hao's expression remained the same.Huntian ... You, are you sure I will come?You believe that I will come to the West?'It might not be today, but it might be in the future. As long as I come, will I ... Be in your plan?'Using order and faith to weaken my wariness, using peace to ease my emotions, and using the power of your clones to interfere with my judgment, so that I can also establish the path of order?More and more power of order gushed toward Li Hao.Up ahead, within the chaos heaven world.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ The grade 8 cultivators were all shocked. Suddenly, they felt something. A large amount of order power started to flow and gather towards the outer realm.At this moment, no one dared to go out and investigate rashly.However, they could all feel the loss of the power of order!It was as if ... It had been absorbed by someone?……In the North.BOOM!Huntian's order suddenly collapsed. It took a few steps back and coughed. Blood flowed from the corner of its mouth.He looked to the West and smiled. Li Hao, you ... You went to the West!You went to huntian domain!On the other side, the chaos path master's expression changed slightly. He said in a deep voice,""Why do I feel that your power of order has weakened a lot? where is the heavenly policy of order? Why not? huntian, what are you planning?"Huntian's strength seemed to have weakened in that instant.It was as if ... A large amount of order power was flowing.It was flowing towards the West!Did something happen in the West?Did someone attack huntian's lair?Was it like this?The chaos path master was a little happy, but ... Huntian's expression was strange. He didn't seem to be surprised or worried. At this moment, he was actually smiling.Huntian was indeed laughing."I've said it before, the end of time is order! Order would be established in everything, and even time would be suppressed by order! Time is the only thing that exists. Reversing time is a chaotic act!"He seemed to be saying this to chaos, but also to someone else.The end of time was order.Li Hao's time-reversal was irregular. He shouldn't be interfering with time and chaos like this. Time shouldn't be reversed or accelerated. Time ... Could only pass with time.Li Hao ... Can you understand my painstaking efforts?

Chapter 3676 Revolution (3)
I must scheme against you ... I only want you to understand that chaos needs order!……In the West.A large amount of order power gushed into Li Hao's River of Dao. At the same time, a book-like object appeared in the sky and floated toward Li Hao.The power of order seemed to have emerged from this book.In the book, there were mountains, rivers, sun, moon, stars, and nine parts of the world ...From a distance, Li Hao sensed ... The power of rules, or even the smell of spirituality.The book flew toward Li Hao.On it, a few words of will faintly appeared.Heavenly policy of order!Li Hao's expression suddenly changed. He couldn't help but mock himself."What a great deal!"At this moment, he suddenly didn't know what to do.The moment huntian gave him the clone, it seemed to have calculated that Li Hao would go to the West One day. One Ring after another, in the end, huntian even used the order heavenly policy as a bait to lure Li Hao.At this moment, the heavenly policy of order was flying toward his River of great Dao. It was extremely powerful, and vaguely, there was even an aura that surpassed level eight!That was ... The power of the ninth rank!Li Hao's expression changed slightly. He now understood huntian's plan. Huntian wanted to use the heavenly policy of order to reverse his Dao River and turn him into the power of order, the inheritor of order, so that time ... Would be suppressed!"F * ck ..."Li Hao suddenly cursed. At this moment, he didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Huntian, are you scheming chaos or me?You actually left such a powerful treasure of laws in the chaos heaven realm and didn't take it with you to deal with the chaos. Furthermore ... Because of the existence of the chaos heaven clone and Li Hao's use of it as the core of the 5000th world ... At this moment, the power of order began to spread through his long river of Dao!Even the Time and Stars at the core were being compressed!It was spreading and covered!Once the heavenly policy of order entered the path River, perhaps ... Li Hao would become a person of order and become the spokesperson of order.The other party wasn't trying to control Li Hao. Instead, they wanted Li Hao to ... Change his attributes and become a cultivator of the path of order."What a big move!"p Was it for me?Or for others?Or could it be that whoever dealt with the chaos heaven realm would have to face all of this and change their attacker's identity to a Guardian?If that was the case ... Then huntian was truly unbelievable."The power of order is pouring into my body ... The Order of Chaos is fading ... After the order, it is ... Chaos, darkness, turmoil ..."Li Hao suddenly looked to the North, as if he had realized something.When chaos heaven's power of order was completely gone, perhaps ... Chaos heaven was the most terrifying."The power of order will flow into my body. I will take on the role of order and maintain the order of the West. I can also deal with all enemies who come to invade. On the other hand, huntian will use the power of Chaos and the power of darkness as the desires and ambitions hidden under order to kill chaos?" Li Hao seemed to have finally understood everything.Huntian ... You're very bold and bold. Aren't you afraid that you'll lose order and be devoured by desire and darkness?……In the North.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ More and more power of order began to flow away. Chaos heaven Supreme Emperor was forced back by chaos, and a large amount of chaos energy began to counter-attack chaos heaven.Huntian Supreme Emperor's aura was weakening as if he had lost the power he should have.But he kept smiling.The West had Li Hao.Spring and autumn ... Or the human King, or long Zhan ... Even if you all go to the West, it will be of no use. You all don't dare to come here easily, but if you go to the West, you may face a new king of order!And I ... Have never been the master of order. I have never been. I am the heaven of chaos, the heaven of chaos!Above order!You guys don't understand me.Li Hao, even if you have control over time, you don't understand it."Why is your power still weakening?"At this moment, the chaos path master's expression changed. Even though huntian was getting weaker and weaker, he didn't feel any joy. He only felt some fear. Why was huntian's power getting weaker and weaker?The power of order was rapidly fading away.Where did he go?What had happened?Also, what was he laughing about?"Weakened? isn't that what you want?"Huntian took a few steps back, blood dripping down his face. He was all smiles."The chaos is still in chaos. The more Wars there are, the more powerful you will be. You can't wait for the chaos to continue, and you can't wait for the war between us to continue!""Chaos, you think that time is on your side, don't you?"He laughed loudly."The more people die, the more spirituality will overflow, and the stronger the power of Chaos will be. As long as this continues, you ... Will be able to defeat me sooner or later, right?"The chaos path master remained silent.It was like this.However, at this moment, he felt a little uneasy.His expression changed. He stopped talking and suddenly attacked. Before, he was fighting in the air. Now, he appeared instantly. Where the chaos was, he was there. It was like teleportation. He appeared in the blink of an eye and punched out, shattering the world.Huntian continued to retreat as he was completely suppressed by the chaos. Even though he still had 8000 Dao laws, he was still suppressed!The power of order in his body was still flowing away.He was getting weaker and weaker!However, this made the chaos path master even more uneasy. It was as if ... Something was about to awaken.

Chapter 3677 Revolution (4)
Huntian's smile seemed to be hiding some sort of heaven-shaking secret.Huntian laughed the whole time. Even though he was constantly being injured and a large amount of chaotic power was corroding him, even devouring him, and suppressing him, he was not worried. Instead, he was getting happier.The moment order completely disappeared, chaos was about to see the true chaos!……Deep in the chaos.The countless sculptures seemed to be sensing something at this moment.Suddenly, tianfang master frowned and looked outside the chaos. The world and chaos appeared in his eyes. It was as if he could see the battle between chaos and chaos and the loss of order power.They were also watching and sensing the calamity."Huntian ..." The Lord of calamity suddenly spoke,"huntian seems to be on the verge of collapse. His order is crumbling ..."The others were also watching.Someone else added,"order is unstable. If we establish order in this chaos, we don't have absolute power to suppress it. In my opinion ... It will collapse sooner or later. How can we establish order when we're not even at level nine?" Does he really think he's the master of order?""The heavenly policy of order doesn't seem to be in his hands!""If chaos attacks, he can still be suppressed. Even if the other party's power doesn't dissipate, he won't be able to cause much trouble with chaos path master around!"“……”A few ninth level venerable sovereigns were talking to each other with faint smiles on their faces.Now that huntian was dead, chaos would break out.Once the chaos gained a firm foothold, the chances of everyone descending would greatly increase.Very good!He didn't choose the wrong person.As for the master of heaven, he seemed to be searching for something. He was searching for ... The direction and end of the loss of order. Since chaos heaven had lost the power of order, the power of order had not disappeared. Naturally, it had a place to go.Where did he go?He wasn't sure.At this moment, he was looking for something. Something seemed to be interfering with his vision. It seemed to be ... The heavenly policy of order!The power of order extended through the chaos great Dao, blocking his vision. Huntian ... Seemed to have been prepared and blocked his view.Where did the power of order go?The master of tianfang frowned slightly.It was one thing for the second generation to be disobedient, but now, even the second generation order seemed to be plotting something in the dark. What ... Was he doing?……In the West.The heavenly policy of order was falling toward the river and spreading. Even at this moment, Li Hao still didn't stop it. He just watched it silently, as if he couldn't stop it, but also as if he didn't intend to stop it. A large amount of power of order began to spread through the river, tidying it up and building a Dao River that belonged to order.In the void, the time star was suppressed to one side, and Li Hao's other great DAOs were contaminated with the power of order. Those that were suppressed were suppressed, and those that were squeezed were squeezed. At this moment, the 5000 Dao laws could not establish an effective defense. The 5000th world was expanding wildly with order as the core!The domain was rapidly filled!Li Hao, who had already opened up nearly 5000 realms, was now filling up the remaining hundreds of realms. The strongest realm of order was rapidly improving at this moment.Li Hao's understanding of the path of order was limited, but it was completely different now as the book approached.The power of the entire realm expanded limitlessly.In the river, huntian's voice seemed to echo,""Only by establishing order can the chaos completely calm down. There will be no more turmoil, and everything will be hidden in darkness ..."At the core of the world of order, a figure appeared, as if ... It was also huntian.This world was created from the power of huntian's clone.At this moment, as if the chaos heaven had awakened, it took the initiative and forcefully suppressed Li Hao's will. It interfered with and assimilated Li Hao's will with the will of order.Li Hao didn't attack, but he didn't stay idle either. A large amount of power of faith was still being infused into it.The passage created by the spacetime star was also forcefully opened. Li Hao didn't contact anyone else but the Queen. At this moment, he activated the passage that belonged to the Queen, and his voice resounded."Merge faith and responsibility into my Dao River!" He said."Let go of the melting, the more the better!"As soon as Li Hao finished speaking, the Queen seemed to be impatient. At that moment, countless power of faith poured into the river of the path and instantly fused with the power of order."Protect the human race ...""Save the world!"These countless thoughts frantically merged into the world of order. Li Hao observed the depths of the world. The shadow of a clone of chaos gradually changed, as if it had tens of thousands of faces!At this moment, the heavenly policy of order also fused into Li Hao's River, bringing with it countless power of order.Li Hao's aura surged crazily.In an instant, all 5000 realms were filled up.Order was still the dominant force. Li Hao was no weaker than Su Yu, who had come from the future, but he was stronger.5,000 Dao laws!As the heavenly policy of order merged with the river, the world of order expanded once again, covering almost half of the river of Dao.At the same time.Outside the chaos heaven realm.A little girl suddenly appeared. Spring and autumn!The moment Spring Autumn appeared, he suddenly looked at Li Hao and frowned.""Is it too late?"  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ She seemed a little depressed and regretful. She looked at Li Hao in the distance and said helplessly,""It shouldn't be! You've taken my clone and established the Dao of life and death. As long as you wither away his order, you can resist it for a while even if you're weak. Why ... Did you get assimilated so quickly?"

Chapter 3678 Revolution (3)_5
She was a little puzzled!She was also a little depressed.She wasn't too surprised by Li Hao's arrival. What surprised her was ... How did he get devoured by order so quickly?He was really ... A weakling!What's going on with this trash?I'm so angry!That day, when they walked through the river of time together, Li Hao had taken one of her avatars and one of huntian's avatars. To the two of them, Li Hao was too bold and crazy. He actually dared to take their avatars!Of course, Chunqiu gave it to him because huntian gave it to him.As long as Li Hao refined her clone, it wouldn't be a problem for him to refine a chaotic heaven clone as well. The Dao of withering was extremely powerful, and it was her strongest clone. She was confident that as long as Li Hao used the Dao of withering, he would be able to stop her for a while.And she would be there soon.However, it was too late!At this moment, Li Hao opened his eyes and looked at spring and autumn. He suddenly said,""Why did you come to the West?"Spring Autumn looked at Li Hao and sighed.""I can't tolerate absolute order. I won't let the ancient order continue either. The so-called order is actually the rules! I want to break all the existing rules. The war between chaos and chaos ... I hope chaos will win! And not huntian, do you understand?""So ... Huntian better lose to chaos! Let the chaos, throw the entire chaos into chaos ..."At this point, he said regretfully,"I just didn't expect that you, who had time and my withered body, would be defeated so quickly. Even with the heavenly order scroll, you shouldn't have been defeated so quickly. Li Hao, you've disappointed me!"She shook her head. Li Hao smiled.""So, you're here to disrupt the order?""Yeah!"Spring Autumn did not mind what he said and laughed,""I'm more afraid of huntian than chaos, so ... I'm not afraid of chaos winning, but I'm worried that it'll be troublesome if huntian wins!"Then, he sighed."Forget it. You've already become the spokesperson of order. This time, I've miscalculated. I didn't expect that you wouldn't understand the true meaning of my life and death. I've given you my clone for nothing!""I thought you were a smart person and that I couldn't hide from you. I didn't expect that I've overestimated you. You're too young ..."She seemed to have found the best reason for her failure.Li Hao was too stupid and too young.Therefore, he had no way to comprehend the true meaning of life and death and was unable to fight back against the invasion of order. In the end, he was schemed by huntian and turned into a puppet of order. What a fool, time was wasted!Li Hao didn't care about this at the moment. The river of Dao fluctuated wildly, and the power of order even began to overflow.The powerful heavenly policy of order had almost enveloped the entire River of Dao.At this moment, the 5000 Dao laws seemed to have only one will ... Order!Even Shi Guang was suppressed to the point where not a single trace of her could be seen. Li Hao sighed."So you're saying that when I asked for a clone the other day, you all ... Thought that it was a good opportunity. You also thought that it was a good opportunity to control me?"Chun Qiu raised her eyebrows."I don't have that intention, and I'm not interested. As for huntian ... I just felt that there was something wrong with him. I gave you a clone to help you, but in the end ... You're too stupid! Who Do You Think You Are to accept something from?"  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ Then, he said,"it seems that order can only be destroyed if I defeat you today. Li Hao, I didn't intend to kill you. The way of time might still be useful to me ... But I have no choice but to kill you today!"In an instant, she appeared in front of Li Hao, as if she had been there for countless years.A small palm appeared, like the thousand-hand Guanyin. He sealed the void!Desolation!The world was withered, chaos was destroyed, all life was destroyed, and time left no trace. Li Hao's long hair danced in the wind, but in just a moment, his longevity seemed to be crazily flowing away. His hair turned white, and order was fading!Spring Autumn had attacked him.In other words, she didn't allow or wish for huntian to stabilize the order. Otherwise, it would be even more difficult to break the root of the race!At this moment, her strength was reflected.At this moment, Li Hao had the power of 5000 Dao laws, which was comparable to the power of 8000 Dao laws of an Ordinary Level eight. However, in her hands, he was still difficult to defeat. Time withered, his longevity flowed away, and even the chaos was decaying.The order heavenly policy burst out with a brilliant light!A new power of order burst out once again. The river of the path churned, blocking the invasion of the other party's withering power.As for Chunqiu, he harrumphed coldly. His tiny body seemed to be filled with energy, and a moment later, countless figures appeared behind him. All of them were Chunqiu!She took a step forward, and the countless phantoms dispersed and merged into her body."You have a past and a future. I have countless pasts, but no future. The past has fused with me, and I am the spring and autumn!"Palm strike!The White jade-like palm pierced through the sky and the earth, breaking the river of the path. Her avatar merged with it, and her combat power soared. Her powerful aura shook the entire world."Huntian, you know what I want. It's not a bad idea to use Li Hao to stop me, but he ... Is no match for me!"Chunqiu shouted in a low voice."You know what I want."But your order ... Why is it also so unfair?I, Spring Autumn Cicada, why can't I obtain a new life in this order?Your order is not my order!He had to build and break everything on his own in order to welcome a new life. Li Hao felt both pity and not pity. Such an idiot deserved to be tricked.

Chapter 3679 Revolution (6)
At this moment, in Li Hao's River, in the depths of the realm of order, a voice seemed to be echoing.""Spring and autumn, order, is to establish, not to break everything. That is fairness! "Whether it's humans or all living things, they all have their own destinies. This is also a part of order ...""Destiny? Don't you think you're funny?"The corner of Spring autumn's small face curled up, revealing a mocking smile.""Alright, fate is that even humans can only live for a hundred years. If you're willing to live for a hundred years, I'm willing to live for a spring and autumn! That was true order. Otherwise ... All order was just the expansion of one's ambition! Chaos is at least a tier 9, and you dare to fight him while also dealing with me ... What a good move!"With that, his aura grew stronger, and more clones fused into his body."I've lived for 800000 years. How long do you think Li Hao can fight me?" The chirping of cicadas resounded in all directions. The chaos seemed to have frozen, and time stopped flowing.Li Hao retreated, and the heavenly decree of order once again erupted with an extremely powerful power of order, blocking spring and autumn's advance.……At this moment, Li Hao seemed to have become a bystander.Today, he had understood the pursuit of spring and autumn. He couldn't say much about this spring and autumn Cicada. It could break the restrictions of the race and let the spring and autumn Cicada, or rather, let herself, no longer experience the pain of transformation.They underwent a transformation every year and were reborn every year. They had already reached this stage. Even if they became the overlords of chaos, they would still have to experience the end of spring and autumn. For such a weak race to be able to rise to power in spring and autumn, it was as if ... They had already broken their destiny and broken the order and rules of chaos.Thus ... She wasn't like what Li Hao had thought. She didn't have any pursuits and didn't have any conflicts with others. On the contrary, anyone who maintained the original system of rules was her enemy!Whoever protected and maintained it would be the one!Huntian was one, and those grade-9 experts ... Were all the same.Her ultimate goal might be ... The source of chaos!Therefore, Li Hao's desire to resurrect some people in the depths of the origin of chaos might be the same as her goal. At the very least, their goal was the same before they came into contact with the origin of chaos.That was why she had given him the strongest clone, and even let Li Hao comprehend the life and death domain, in the hope that Li Hao could resist all of huntian's schemes.Who would have thought that Li Hao didn't resist at all and allowed the power of order to invade him?They even took the initiative to use their faith and provoke the integration of order, which increased the opportunities and convenience for the integration of order.It was unbelievably fast, so fast that spring and autumn had arrived. His speed was extremely fast, but he was still one step too late!Spring Autumn attacked again!Above the long river of the great path, the heavenly policy of order burst with an extremely powerful light, suppressing the path of decay and glory. The spring and autumn were indeed powerful. The chirping of cicadas sounded again, and even the heavenly policy of order trembled violently, as if the Holy Light had dissipated.The current Spring Autumn was facing huntian, huntian of the Dao of order.Even so, huntian, who was infinitely close to the ninth rank, was still somewhat suppressed by him. Li Hao had not expected him to be so powerful."Huntian, I won't let you succeed ... Those grade-9 experts can forget about dominating me!" Spring and autumn disappeared again and reappeared in an instant, as if it was close to the heavenly policy of order. It even stepped into Li Hao's long river of Dao. Countless spring and autumn were suddenly suppressed by order and shattered!The closer one was to the heavenly policy of order, the stronger the order would be. All existences that did not obey the order would fall.With every step she took, spring and autumn left behind countless corpses, all of which were her own.But she didn't care at all!So what?Today, she would definitely destroy the heavenly policy of order and completely shatter the original order!At this time, Li Hao was hiding behind the heavenly decree of order, looking at the spring and autumn, the corpses that fell, and the heavenly decree of order that was erupting madly ... As if he was an outsider.After a while, he looked to the North.The power of order should have been almost fully extracted. Huntian ... If it was going to explode, it should be very soon.If he killed chaos and huntian returned, Chunqiu would probably be no match for him.At this moment, almost all of Li Hao's 5000 great DAOs, except for order, had been squeezed, suppressed, and submitted ... The entire path River had been suppressed by the heavenly policy of order."Order ... Should not be just like this."Li Hao murmured. In the river, spring and autumn, who was fighting against the heavenly policy of order, seemed to have heard his voice and was a little confused.At this moment, Li Hao's eyes glowed with a holy light.The light of compassion also seemed to appear.Countless voices were shouting. The long river seemed to be roaring. Billions of human voices were roaring, shouting, and growling ... They disturbed people's hearts and made them unable to calm down.Even the chirping of cicadas was suppressed at this moment. Spring autumn's face changed.The order seemed to have undergone a new change."There is no such thing as absolute order in the myriad world and myriad people ..."Li Hao shook his head. After devouring a large amount of power of faith, he discovered that the power of faith, the power of responsibility, and the power of order were not absolute.This thing, once it was absolute, it was wrong.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ It would change with the development of the times.Everyone's demands were different. The demands of every civilization were different.Living beings all had different demands.
