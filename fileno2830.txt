In the surroundings, waves of sword intent spread out and waves of Red Moon Power were extinguished.In an instant, the waves of a long river Rose.Two figures appeared, surrounded by the river. They were the third party in the central region, and not one of them. Furthermore ... A Dao River? a Dao domain?Red Moon sovereign recognized one of them instantly. He looked at Kong Ji and his eyes changed."Empty! No, it should be called Ming Tang, right?"The son of the God of Light!Damn it!How could it be him?Wasn't he in the tianfang world? why had he suddenly come here?No wonder he was so arrogant!Of course, he wasn't afraid of this fellow. What he was worried about was that with this person here, would the divine light plane have sent experts over?Why did you come to my Red Moon region? Although the divine light plane was powerful, it had its own enemies in the tianfang region. There had also been some changes in the tianfang grand world recently. Why had this person appeared here?"Greetings, awakening God Emperor!" Kong Ji smiled.Awakening, Level Seven, high-level venerable sovereign of the Crimson Moon world.In fact, not many people mentioned the name 'awakening'. Most people called it 'shocking'.'Awakening' was actually a title for the intermediate level. When one reached the advanced level, it would change a little.The awakening God Emperor looked at the two of them indifferently.At this moment, he was not in a good mood.This person's arrival was a problem.The key was that he was about to exhaust the longevity sword to death. The appearance of these two people might cause some changes ... Although he was not afraid, it would be troublesome if there were more changes.He didn't ask or say anything. As an advanced venerable sovereign of the red moon, this was the territory of the red moon world. He sensed but didn't sense the existence of any advanced venerable sovereigns.The next moment, he waved his hand, and the power of the Crimson Moon transformed into a giant dragon that charged toward the two of them.Even if Kong Ji wasn't easy to kill ... At this time, what was the harm in killing him?Even if he didn't kill them, he would at least heavily injure them so that they wouldn't have a chance to cause trouble.Afterwards, he would negotiate with the divine light plane!The giant red Dragon was filled with anger, deterrence, and madness. It charged at the two of them. At this time, Li Hao and the other man didn't say a word. Li Hao's River of Life and death spread out and came into contact with the giant dragon in an instant!A powerful Crimson Moon Power seeped into his River of Dao.In an instant, the river was dyed red."Nirvana!""Die!" Kong Ji roared and attacked. The rank 6 Nirvana world appeared. Instantly, the river froze and the red power stopped expanding. Taking advantage of this moment, life and death appeared. The Red Dragon in the river of life and death suddenly experienced the cycle of life and death.The red power gradually dissipated, and waves of pure power of the great Dao emerged, overflowing into the long river.Under the joint attack of the two of them, although they still managed to resolve the attack of the other party, the gap between the two of them could be seen. If the other party was not afraid of the sword venerable's outburst and went all out, the two of them would not be a match at all.BOOM! The waves of the river Rose again, and the Red Dragon disappeared completely."That's amazing!"Xing Shen suddenly chuckled,"amazing!" "They both have Dao domains? I know the Forsaken desolation. And this ... Is he the Silvermoon King?" It's indeed impressive. A mere rank four can actually present a Dao domain and even half a Dao River ... It's not simple. "Li Hao didn't say anything. He wasn't surprised to be recognized.He looked in that direction, and on the other side, venerable the sword also looked in his direction.The two of them met each other face to face for the first time.In fact, Li Hao had seen venerable the sword many times, from the apparition in the eight trigrams Formation to his travels in new martial arts. This was the first time he had seen the Silver Moon King in real life.His hair was slightly white, as if he had consumed too much of his lifespan.His Sage-like demeanor ... Was not much different from what he had imagined and expected.Overflowing with sword intent, he was an unparalleled swordsman!Of course, Li Hao, who had traveled to neo martial arts before, knew that venerable the sword was not a civilized person in private. He often cursed, but to the outside world, he was similar to his teacher in that he still paid a lot of attention to his image."Junior Li Hao greets Sword Saint!"At this moment, Li Hao still introduced himself.Li Hao!Venerable the sword was a little surprised. He nodded slightly and looked over.Li!The Li family did not necessarily mean that they were his descendants. He did not have any descendants, but his grandniece did have descendants. However, there were many with the Li family name, and silver Moon had moved a few of them over.He didn't sense any rich Li family bloodline in Li Hao.However, the new king from Silver Moon was surnamed li, which made venerable the sword a little happy."Not bad!"The sword Saint smiled and nodded his head. His imposing and murderous aura was reduced a little.Even though it was extremely dangerous at the moment ... So what?The fact that the new king of Silver Moon dared to come in was a Testament to his ability. He was very happy and did not feel that there was anything wrong with it. He had seen people who were even more rash ... For example, the human King. On such an occasion, if it was the human King, he would definitely barge in. Thus, he was very used to such situations. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  He also didn't feel that the two of them were just a burden to him.Xing Shen also smiled. An intense Crimson Moon Power spread out in all directions, turning the entire world red. An intense desire surged through the world, as if the void and chaos had turned into a realm of desire."Although we didn't manage to catch an existence like the sun god, three of them ... I think it's no worse than catching a seventh-rank one!" He laughed.Revered sword was a cultivator with seventh-grade offensive power.Li Hao, the king of the Silver Moon.Void, the son of the God of Light.He laughed. Today was a good day. If these three people were caught, loneliness might be the key to Red Moon and the Guild of light. And if the Silver Moon King was caught, the Silver Moon world was not far away, and the homeland of new martial was not far away!

2831 Chapter 467
The death of the sword venerable could eliminate a threat that could advance to the seventh step and become invincible.That's great!Even the heavens are helping me!Venerable the sword laughed as well."Let's cut the chit-chat Now. We're facing a great enemy. Let's talk later. Today ... We'll kill him first!"The harsh words were said first, but in reality, they were saying,"we've met, and we know each other. Let's escape first."I'll talk to you later!BOOM!An extremely powerful sword Qi exploded, and the power of the Crimson Moon shattered instantly!A sword of 10000 DAOs emerged from the sky and headed straight for the awakening God Emperor. The latter smiled. He was not as good as before. Venerable sword had used up too much energy.He waved his hand, and red Shadows appeared. Most of them headed toward venerable the sword, while a few headed toward Li Hao and the others.Let's stop here!These red Shadows were formed by the power of the Crimson Moon. They were extremely powerful and directly invaded the great Dao.In the void, the longsword was surrounded by countless Red Shadows like locusts. They were all feasting on the longsword madly, and the longsword instantly became a little bumpy. The power of 10000 DAOs was no longer stable. Some of them dissipated and turned into the power of the red moon, and some even began to betray.On Li Hao's side, the two of them attacked together again.The winding river fused with the power of red Shadows ... And instantly crumbled. Then, it began to die out. But this time, as if it had exceeded its limit, Li Hao's River suddenly fluctuated violently and broke through the will of death.The blood Dragons charged at Li Hao and Kong Ji.The long river instantly turned into a long sword, just like the one venerable sword had. At this time, in the starry sky, the stars gathered and turned into the shape of a long sword. Li Hao's voice came,"Sword venerable, please have a look at my sword!"He slashed out with his sword!With a loud rumble, the Red Shadows were shattered. The Red Shadows fell one after another, and the blood Dragon was also shattered and integrated into the river. Venerable the sword was about to remind him, but the river seemed to be out of control and rebelling against Li Hao.There was too much of the Crimson Moon's power, and it was easy to control. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  But at this moment, a destructive power suddenly appeared in the river and turned into a long sword. If the Thunder of the great path could defeat the power of the red moon, the chaotic Thunder could naturally do the same. In an instant, the destructive power appeared.BOOM!A shattering sound came from the river, and in the blink of an eye, the blood color faded.Emperor Xing Shen tilted his head and smiled.You have some ability!Of course, that was all he could do. He was mainly dealing with venerable sword. He had only used one-tenth of his strength to deal with these two people. These two people were still okay among the middle-stage venerable sovereigns, but ... What could they do?Sword Saint didn't say anything. He was just thinking about how to escape with the two of them.​ Since he was already here, he could only bring him along.Old Zhang, that bastard, won't you give me a chance? It was an opportunity for the two of them to come in, but he knew that they were on his side, so he couldn't just ignore it. Otherwise, he would have run away long ago.Now, he had no chance.Li Hao didn't care about this. He looked at Kong Ji.Kong Ji didn't need him to say anything. He disappeared into the river. He didn't come here to be a bystander. He came here to kill a rank seven venerable sovereign.In an instant, he appeared in a place with no one.The Nirvana world started to expand rapidly.It instantly spread across the entire world!Waves of sword will and the power of the red moon were destroyed by him. They spread to venerable sword, who raised his eyebrows and did not move. However, when they reached awakening God Thearch, they were instantly destroyed!Kong Ji grunted but he didn't care. At this moment, the Nirvana world had already enveloped the sword Saint. That was enough.He wasn't familiar with venerable the sword, but it didn't matter. It was fine as long as Li Hao was familiar with him.Well, Li Hao wasn't familiar with it, either.At this moment, he had an origin of light with him, which could restore some of the power of a fifth or sixth stage venerable sovereign. However, it was highly unlikely that it would work for a revered sword artist, as he was no ordinary sixth stage venerable sovereign.Kong Ji smiled and looked at venerable the sword."Senior venerable the sword, I've heard a lot about you. Today ... I'll show you my skills so that Li Hao can have some face. The people he befriended are not incompetent!"It was as if he was meeting his parents. Kong Ji's words seemed special, but in fact, he just felt that he couldn't let Li Hao lose face in front of the neo martial artists.The people he befriended were not trash.Sword Saint did not understand, and so did awakening God Emperor. In the next moment, their expressions changed. The silence in the Nirvana domain was no longer dead. In an instant, the power of the void great Dao was consumed.In the dark Nirvana world, a small flower appeared under the feet of the sword Saint.Venerable the sword wanted to Dodge, but Li Hao's voice came, "Don't worry, Sword Saint!"Sword Saint stopped and did not move. In fact, this was a very dangerous thing to do. He did not know Kong Ji and was not familiar with him. Moreover, he was from the divine light plane. However, at this moment, Sword Saint still did not move.It was fate that they met by chance and the other party came.In addition, Li Hao from Silver Moon was present. Although he was not familiar with the place, he chose to remain still, regardless of whether he was careless or boorish.The next moment, the flower appeared under his feet. In an instant, it was as if it had taken root under his feet. Venerable the sword didn't have time to think about anything, and his expression suddenly changed.The power of his great Dao, which had been exhausted, seemed to have suddenly begun to recover.The power of countless great DAOs instantly surged out.The sword Saint felt that his body, which was about to collapse, suddenly became young and full of energy.With a loud bang, the awakening God Thearch also felt that something was wrong. His face changed greatly and he attacked directly!Resuscitation!Damn it!

2832 Chapter 467
He understood now. Kong Ji had actually comprehended the way of the two extremes. He was recovering after Nirvana. This was bad. Once the sword venerable recovered, he would be a huge threat to him."Wu Sheng!"At this moment, Sword Saint was overjoyed and he slashed out crazily!His power hadn't recovered completely, but at least 90%!To him, this meant that he had the strength to put up a fight again. However ... He was unable to kill the other party even when he was at the pinnacle of his cultivation, so what more now? his main priority was to escape. This was because he had also discovered that Kong Ji seemed to have lost all of his energy in an instant.Clearly, this kind of recovery technique was extremely taxing on the Forsaken desolation.……Kong Ji gasped for breath.A source of light appeared in his hand. He laughed and consumed it instantly. There was a high chance that the sword Saint would not recover after using it. However, he could recover instantly after using it. This also meant that he could give the sword Saint another chance.He was not the main attacker.He was only a helper. Kong Ji understood this very well. Therefore, after he revived venerable the sword, he retreated immediately. He did not dare to be attacked by a seventh-rank cultivator. Otherwise, he would die without a doubt.That was enough.In a three-man team, a super healer like him was sometimes the key to determining the outcome."The source of light!"When the awakening God Thearch saw this, he shouted angrily.Damn it!Bastard!He did not expect that Kong Ji could really revive a person. Bastard. In this way, although he was not afraid, venerable the sword had recovered most of his strength. When he first fought against Kong Ji, he was injured.One more time ... If he had to do it again, three more times, even if he killed these people, he would be seriously injured.No!"I can't give him a second chance." Awakening God Emperor made up his mind. He would fight venerable sword first. He couldn't give Kong Ji a second chance to revive him. Otherwise, he would be in big trouble.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  The origin of light was not a large number. It only appeared once every 100000 years. Even in the world of light, there would not be many. He did not believe that there were many of them.One pill might be the limit.At this moment, he didn't care about Li Hao at all. Compared to Kong Ji, Li Hao's rank four was nothing.No matter how great his potential was, it was only potential!BOOM!Sword will burst forth, shaking the heavens and earth. As the sword slashed out, the lifeless world seemed to be destroyed. Kong Ji's expression changed slightly. He looked at this sword and took a deep breath. This sword actually had a great destruction will.He had thought that he would only observe and be a nanny ... But he had seen the state of great Nirvana after the sword mind of the sword venerable had burst out!BOOM!The awakening God Emperor retreated, his expression changing slightly. His sword intent annihilated everything. The lifeless sword destroyed everything, destroyed everything, and destroyed everything!Kong Ji watched intently, feeling extremely excited.He didn't come in vain! Of course, he didn't forget Li Hao. What was Li Hao doing?Was he preparing to borrow power?Who did you borrow from?In his mind, Li Hao was still far from being able to participate in this battle. He had to borrow Li Hao's strength. Otherwise ... Li Hao wouldn't be able to do anything.Taking advantage of the fact that awakening God Emperor was forced to retreat, he turned his head and glanced at Li Hao.At this moment, Li Hao didn't borrow any power. He seemed to be setting up some kind of barrier. A special force filled the void, which seemed to be a Dao domain that blocked all directions.But ... You're just a Tier 4, yet you've set up such a Dao domain that can be easily broken. What is this fellow doing?The sky-stealing sun-changing technique!Li Hao was setting up a special Dao domain to shield him from chaos.It wasn't to deal with that seventh-rank.He simply enveloped the surroundings.At this time, he heard the voice of venerable the sword,""Get ready to run!"Venerable the sword obviously felt that the chance of a second recovery was slim. Even if there was a second time ... To be honest, the probability of him killing a rank seven was very small. The main problem was that his attack power was not enough. He could not kill a rank seven, but he could still contend with them.He couldn't continue to recover like this. During the second recovery, Kong Ji would probably be targeted by this rank 7 and killed.Run?Li Hao didn't come here to run.He knew his own weight. A fourth level venerable sovereign was too weak.He didn't expect himself to kill a stage seven. He had the same position as Kong Ji. This time, he was only a support. There was only one main attacker, the venerable sword!"We'll accompany him!"Li Hao shouted,"the void can revive senior venerable the sword. He has a lot of the source of light. Let's exhaust him to death!"Venerable the sword almost wanted to curse!I said run because I might not be able to kill him even if we continue to drag this out. Why are you so insensible?'Do I have to say it directly ... That I don't have the ability to directly kill a seventh step?'If this continued ... No matter how much origin of light that forsaken desolation had, it would not be wasted like this.Just as he was thinking about this, Xing Shen sneered. A powerful Crimson Moon Power covered the entire world, especially Kong Ji's side. A large amount of Crimson Moon Power directly invaded. I'll let you guys waste it!If this drags on, I might not be the one to die.Kong Ji's expression changed slightly. The world of Nirvana appeared in an instant and destroyed the power of the Crimson Moon. However, it consumed a lot of his power. If this continued, he would have used up all his power of great Dao before the sword venerable could recover."God-stunning!"With a low roar, the awakening God Emperor seemed to be furious. BOOM! The power of the red moon suddenly rumbled. Li Hao, Kong Ji, and even venerable sword were all shocked and lost their minds.p God-stunning!Their great DAOs seemed to have been frightened and even lost control. At this moment, even the sword of ten thousand DAOs felt a little afraid. It rumbled and was pushed back by the awakening God Thearch. His sword intent began to shatter!

The awakening God Emperor, who had also consumed a lot of his great Dao power, sneered. He had been waiting for this moment!It was meant to be used when venerable the sword escaped, but now ... Since you want to play, I'll let you experience it.Kong Ji felt his liver and guts being torn apart!The power of the great path was being consumed at a crazy rate. The entire Nirvana world was breaking. He and the sword Master were the main targets of the other party.As for Li Hao, he was slightly weaker. At this moment, the river was fluctuating wildly, and stars were even falling like frightened animals. The river was no longer stable, and sword seals and sword trees appeared in the river. They looked terrified and trembled all over as if they were about to die from fear.It was a terrifying ability.A threat that went straight for the origin of the great Dao!A faint trace of time appeared and reversed for a moment. The sword seals and the others disappeared, no longer frightened. The falling stars began to rise, and the fear on Li Hao's face faded.On the other side, Kong Ji sensed the power of the great path he had consumed and frowned slightly.Although he had managed to withstand it, he had used up too much of his energy.Another resuscitation ... There was no other way.He had also used up a lot of energy to wake up, but he still smiled.Is there still the origin of light?No more!Do you really think I can't do anything to you?This time, everyone had used up a lot of their energy. However, no matter how much energy was used up, the awakening God Emperor would still have the upper hand.Just then, a long river appeared between heaven and earth once more.A star was floating in the river.Venerable the sword was thinking about how to escape and was about to retreat. Suddenly, he sensed something and glanced at Li Hao. The next moment, something struck him.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly turned into a sword!Yes, the Dao meridians appeared one by one, and the stars returned to his body and merged with the river. Li Hao's Taoist body had turned into a sword!The Silvermoon Dao Meridian itself was a sword!Venerable the sword's heart skipped a beat."Transform into a sword for me to use?"But ... You're only at the fourth rank!'Even if I get a fourth step sword, it's useless. To deal with this guy, you have to at least give me a seventh step sword!'At the same time, awakening God Emperor also noticed it.He had the same thought as venerable sword ... Did he turn himself into a sword?A Tier 4 sword ... What the hell was the use!Although a fourth-tier sword was not bad, it was still effective for the Supreme Sword.The truth was ... Li Hao had truly turned into a sword. In an instant, his voice resounded in all directions."Sword Saint, use me to kill the enemy!"In an instant, the huge sword flew towards the sword Saint.Venerable the sword cursed in his heart, but he could only say,"Alright, you're too polite!"Alright, I'll take you on the run. He slashed out with his sword, forcing Xing Shen to retreat. Xing Shen did not stop him, but just smiled in disdain."So what if I give you a fourth-tier sword?"At the level of revered sword ... It was still a restraint.The overconfident Silver Moon King!In an instant, the huge sword fell into the hands of venerable the sword. The empty silence was also a little stunned. Was this useful?"At this moment, venerable the sword got the long sword and felt it ... It's not bad. It's not weak, but ... It's not of much use. It's of little value. I'm afraid that it's too explosive. I'm afraid that this kid will be killed!"It's not the first time I've destroyed a sovereign weapon. The sword is too weak to withstand its destructive power.Otherwise, he wouldn't have left the starry sky sword behind.That sword was just an ordinary monarch weapon. It was too weak. He was afraid that he would completely break the sword if he used his full power.The next moment, Li Hao's words appeared in his mind: "Although the outburst of a sword venerable is powerful, it is difficult to kill a seventh-rank cultivator. If one sword is not enough, what if I add two, three, or Four Swords?"Venerable the sword replied instantly,"I can kill him with three sword strikes ... But ...""Sword Saint, use your sword. Stack Four Swords to ensure that nothing goes wrong!"If I can stack Four Swords, do you think I need you to tell me?A thought flashed through his mind.That was simply bullsh * t!The next moment, venerable the sword did not even think about it. "Since you said it, I'll try it." This kid's words made him feel a little familiar, as if he had returned to more than a thousand years ago.At that time, someone had given him the same command.He was also a weakling!Of course, the person who came later was very strong. He was the new martial artist human King.That fellow was the same in the past ... Regardless of whether he could do it or not, he would do it first. How would you know if he would succeed or not if you didn't do it?"So straightforward!"Li Hao was also shocked. I wanted to say a few more words, but you're really fast even though you say no!An extremely powerful force of 10000 DAOs instantly gathered.Li Hao instantly felt a boundless killing intent. This was the first time he truly felt the horror of the sword of longevity. The sword burst out with unparalleled power, and the world changed colors. Even those who woke up were shocked.It's not going to be long?Not running anymore?This guy didn't hold back at all and wasn't afraid of exhausting himself with one strike. He was killed by me directly. As long as I block this strike, this guy will be finished.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  Just as he was thinking about this, the longevity sword's longevity sword seemed to emit a series of cracking sounds."Reverse!"At this moment, Li Hao used a powerful time-reversal technique!Time was not just borrowing power."Reverse. I have used it many times, and most of the time, I used it on myself. This time, I used it on venerable the sword. He wanted to reverse venerable the sword once again and stack the sword intent, just like that day, to reverse the sword intent and kill the Chaos Beast."The sword Saint also felt a special force covering him.

2834 Chapter 467
The energy that he had just used up seemed to be recovering ... But it was just a little bit short. It was not enough.At this moment, Kong Ji's heart moved.The power he had consumed was suddenly restored.In order to avoid some trouble, Li Hao didn't reverse venerable the sword's energy. That would be restoring a complete venerable the sword, which was too difficult and too exhausting. He couldn't bear it!However, Kong Ji, who had just entered Grade 6, could try.Sure enough, in an instant, the desolation felt the energy reverse. The next moment, without Li Hao saying anything, the Nirvana realm appeared. A small flower appeared at the feet of the sword Saint.Venerable the sword was enlightened in an instant!In the blink of an eye, his energy was restored, and a sword intent appeared in his hand out of thin air. The sword intent he had slashed out earlier had frozen in the void. The two swords overlapped, and his energy was exhausted once again!At that moment, Kong Ji felt his energy recovering ...Without another word, he once again cast the revival technique!The sword saint's energy was restored again ...Another sword appeared!At this moment, the venerable sword's three strikes overlapped each other at an unimaginable speed. Li Hao had wanted to do it again, but he suddenly felt an immense sense of danger. He immediately understood that trouble was coming. The chaos lightning tribulation!It wasn't just his own; there was also the void-type. Be it awakening or Nirvana, a single bolt of chaos lightning wouldn't cause chaos tribulation, but the fusion of two DAOs would.At this moment, the lightning tribulation of the two had arrived. Even the heaven pilfering technique was somewhat unable to block it. Just in time!Let's try what Li Zhu said about changing the day!"Kill him!"Li Hao's voice came to sword venerable's ears. Without a word, he slashed at awakening with three sword strikes.In fact, he was still waiting for the fourth sword!In the end, he didn 't.From the looks of it, this kid was also a big braggart. He said he would stack four strikes, but he started to wither after three strikes!"Break!"With a loud shout, the three swords instantly merged into one.Emperor Xing Shen's expression changed drastically. What kind of ability was this?How did the sword venerable complete the stacking technique of three swords in an instant?He didn't have time to think too much. One sword could hurt him, so three sword attacks wouldn't just triple the damage. This was a matter of life and death!In an instant, his Dao domain appeared and compressed the heaven and earth. Countless energies erupted, and the great Dao universe was drawn over once again!BOOM!The long sword destroyed everything. The three swords stacked together and directly destroyed the Dao domain. With a loud boom, the Dao domain was instantly shattered. Awakening God Thearch's strong physical body was instantly destroyed by the long sword and his body was crushed!A Red Moon appeared in his body. It was the source of the great Dao.The daosource exploded with an incomparably powerful Crimson Moon Power, covering the longsword. Two waves of energy swept through the world, and with a loud boom, the longsword's shadow was instantly shattered. The daosource was also broken in the blink of an eye.In the red moon, the awakening God Emperor was still shocked by the power of the sword, but his expression quickly turned fierce! I blocked it!I'm not dead yet!As for venerable the sword, he looked a little embarrassed and didn't say anything. His eyes conveyed his thoughts ... I said I would kill him with three strikes ... In the end, it seemed that I was just a little short ...But now, be it him, Kong Ji, or Li Hao, they all seemed to have exhausted their strength.I'm sorry!However, it didn't matter. Old Zhang's clone was still outside.While he was thinking, a weak power of Dao domain appeared on the longsword in his hand and enveloped everyone. The next moment, Li Hao tried the underhand technique that Li Zhu had taught him.He had completely shifted his aura.His own, empty!In the broken Red Moon, Xing Shen was still rapidly extracting the power of the great Dao of the universe to recover. Suddenly, he discovered that there was a little bit of special power on his Dao source.Time, life and death, destruction and recovery ...It was very weak.This attack had almost no effect on him. Were these people really at their wits 'end?You dare to deal with me with such a weak attack?Just as he was thinking, the Dao domain suddenly disappeared.The next moment, a dark cloud appeared in the sky. It seemed to have been waiting for a long time, as if it was extremely angry, as if it felt that it had been deceived. It had accumulated its anger until now, and it seemed to be unable to restrain it!In an instant, the dark cloud turned into a lightning tribulation. It wasn't too strong, only at the peak of the sixth step, not as powerful as the lightning Li Hao had experienced that day.However, things were different at this moment.In a situation where both sides were exhausted and suffering huge losses ... The lightning struck.BOOM!  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  The broken Crimson Moon was instantly blasted apart, and he was a little out of control. How could this be?What does the lightning tribulation have to do with me?If he wanted to strike, he should strike the other party. The other party seemed to have used many special means to give the sword venerable the opportunity to stack the three swords, okay?Boom! Boom! Boom!The lightning tribulation didn't listen to his explanation. In an instant, it struck down one after another. This time, it was extremely angry. In the blink of an eye, four or five lightning bolts struck down. With a loud bang, the broken Red Moon exploded!An illusionary figure appeared with some unwillingness and anger."Why did you attack me?"BOOM!The lightning tribulation rose again, and Li Hao had already transformed into his human form. At this moment, he, solitary void, and venerable the sword had all used up their strength. However, at this moment, the three of them attacked at the same time without saying a word!The Nirvana world appeared faintly and trembled a little, but it instantly enveloped The Phantom.The two sword essences stabbed into the shadow at the same time.BOOM!The Thunderbolts arrived at the same time. With a loud bang, the illusionary figure's face appeared with some confusion and unwillingness. It looked at the few of them and suddenly shattered!

2835 Chapter 467
The power of a great Dao instantly flowed out.The Thunder seemed to have vented its anger. It sensed that the aura had dissipated and disappeared instantly.……At the same time.The Crimson Moon world.Suddenly, a fiery red color appeared in the sky. In the blink of an eye, a red energy overflowed. The world cracked open, and the sky seemed to be shattered!Some venerable sovereigns 'expressions changed!This was ... A top-notch existence had fallen!Who died?Seventh-rank?In the huge Hall, a person's expression changed slightly. The next moment, with some madness and indifference, he suddenly tore the sky apart as if he was going to descend!Damn it!Bastard!How could this be?The sword Saint did not have the ability to kill a rank seven!At this moment, he couldn't even care about the problem of losing the Crimson Moon after he left. He only wanted to descend to that place and kill everyone. There must be someone else in neo martial who was involved. He wanted to ambush and kill the awakened!Otherwise, it would be impossible for the sword Saint to kill a rank seven!As this thought flashed through his mind, he was about to pass through the great path universe and directly arrive at that place. Suddenly, his expression changed again. At this moment, in the great path, the other two huge stars were also shaking violently!Red Moon master's face changed!He could still take it if one of them died, but how did the two people who went to Tian Fang get so badly injured in an instant?That was impossible!These were two top-tier venerable sovereigns, not one, but two of them working together. Even an eighth-rank venerable sovereign wouldn't be able to injure them severely in an instant.Big trouble!He couldn't save them if they died, but he couldn't let them die. He was about to travel back and forth, but a large amount of great Dao power suddenly gathered toward the two stars!At the same time, his consciousness descended onto the two stars.In an instant ... He saw a blade!It was as if it had pierced through time and destroyed the world!The saber was drawn!The star shattered!Under the stars, a man stood with an innocent face.""Tsk, I only slashed once ... I won't die, right?"Silence.After a long time, an angry roar resounded throughout the Crimson Moon great Dao universe,""Human King!"The neo martial King!A sneak attack! He, a top-tier major cosmos absolute being, actually launched a sneak attack ... Damn, B * stard, shameless, bastard!The illusionary young man picked his ears and kept one of the corpses. The other person fled quickly. The human King glanced at him and grinned. He looked up at the sky and said excitedly,"Thank you!"In an instant, the human King disappeared.Red Moon master was so angry that he didn't know where to go.While he was still hesitating, a book suddenly appeared near a shattered planet on the other side. A man appeared in the book and said with a smile,""Thank you!""Bastard!"BOOM!Heaven and earth shattered!……At this moment, the moment when venerable the sword and the other two killed Xing Shen, Li Hao was still thinking about whether he should turn the tables on venerable the sword again to resist the incoming danger and force him back!Whoever knew that in the next moment, a shocking change shocked him.At this moment, venerable the sword stretched out his hand and grabbed the Supreme-being clone. The next moment, he squeezed it into a book."Go and disguise yourself. Pretend to be your real self ... Hurry!"The book of Dao appeared and instantly burrowed into the slightly broken Dao universe. With a boom, the book of Dao burst out with a bright light!"Thank you!" The Grandmaster's voice sounded.The next moment, the Supreme Being's clone also reached out and grabbed a cat from Li Hao's River.""Big cat, kill him!"Second cat was confused.At that moment, Red Moon master was both furious and shocked. In the blink of an eye, the great path universe wriggled crazily. With a boom, it squeezed the Supreme clone and two cats out at the same time. The great path universe instantly closed and disappeared!Li Hao was dumbfounded!What was going on?The Supreme Being's clone dissipated slightly, and the book of great Dao began to collapse. The next moment, a voice rang out,""What are you doing? Run!" In an instant, venerable the sword grabbed the two dazed people and fled frantically!What are these two little fools doing?Run!  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  Could he scare the other party for a lifetime?If they didn't run, they would be waiting for death!He disappeared instantly and entered the chaos. His escape method was different from the others. It was as if ... He was drilling a hole. He was half-hidden and half-visible, appearing and disappearing in the chaos, appearing and disappearing again ... He gradually left that place.Behind him, the sovereign clone started to collapse completely, but he still shouted,""If you have the guts, don't close the great Dao universe. The new martial is here. Attack the great Dao universe!"BOOM!The book of Dao completely shattered and exploded, sweeping up a heat wave that destroyed the entire battlefield.Clean up the battlefield!'Young man, you're insensible. After killing, you have to destroy the battlefield so that the other party won't be able to find any traces.'Bang! Bang!Everything turned into chaos, and everything completely disappeared.

Chapter 2836 Dangerous Jianghu (1)
Li Hao and Kong Ji were dragged away in a daze.Outside the Skylands world.The group of people looked on in a daze, not even able to come back to their senses.While Wu Shan was fighting the two seventh rank venerable sovereigns, he was actually strong. However, the battle between two seventh rank venerable sovereigns and three seventh rank venerable sovereigns was just for fun. It would be a joke if he really wanted to do anything to the other party.If he could kill a seventh rank venerable sovereign in a one-on-two battle, then he, Wu Shan, would no longer be Wu Shan. He would be the master of the clouds.Similarly, as a top tier level Seven, if those two red Moon Level Seven cultivators could kill him here ... Not to mention whether they could or not, they just had to ask if they dared to. After all, Yunxiao was closer to this place than the red moon.If he killed Wu Shan, wouldn't that be going against Yun Xiao? In fact, they had some secret cooperation with Yun Xiao. This was also the reason why they were puzzled as to why Wu Shan had attacked them.In the end ...The three of them were just playing!The others were just watching for fun. Good fellow, it was so sudden. If it wasn't for Wushan feeling a trace of danger and instantly retreating, that blade might not have been aimed at Red Moon Princess, but at him.He dodged in an instant, but the blade was slashed by a top-tier type 7 world Lord who had killed a Type 7 world Lord.It was said that the neo martial artist King was brutal and reckless ...However, when it came to sneak attacks, it was truly sinister and unparalleled. Before the attack, there was really no movement or breath. It was just a single strike, and he had used all his strength to attack!Without the slightest hesitation.He didn't even think about what would happen if the three tier 7 experts joined forces to kill him, or what would happen if the surrounding tier 7 experts attacked ...He didn't seem to have considered this!Or rather, they believed that after killing one, the rest would definitely not dare to move. Whoever dared to step forward would be killed!Who would dare to stand out in a battle to the death?  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  The truth was just as the human King had thought.With a single slash, a tier 7 human King was killed. Even the human King seemed to be a little surprised. How weak, to be killed just like that, what trash!At this moment, everyone was stunned.Ji Huo had been killed by a single slash!As for the other Grade 7 expert, he was fleeing frantically. Hong Yu's face was already so pale that he didn't look human. With just one thought, he fled!Escape!The neo martial King!Ji Huo's death was such a big deal. Perhaps the red moon Lord would appear and come directly along the ripples of death ... It was possible. With the human King here, it would be less troublesome to defend passively.But ... He didn 't.The red moon master did not appear.He just let Ji Huo be killed! He didn't have the time to sense it, nor was he in the mood to do so. Otherwise, he would know why that person didn't come.He was attacked from the front and back!A seventh-grade demon beast had died here, and another seventh-grade demon beast had died there. There was a human King here, but there was more trouble over there. The new martial Supreme had brought Emperor Cang here. Once the red moon Lord descended on any side and left the red moon's territory, it might be a huge trouble!In addition, the instant death of two level Seven experts had shaken the great path universe. At this moment, Red Moon master was still busy suppressing the great path universe, appeasing the people, and quickly arranging other things, including defending Red moon's native land ... He really couldn't descend.For a moment, Red Moon Lord thought that this was neo martial's conspiracy.What they wanted was for him to leave the Crimson Moon.Once Red Moon lost him, no one could suppress it. It was likely to be a big problem. New martial's sun god had not been seen, and a group of top venerable sovereigns had not appeared. Perhaps ... New martial's target was red moon's territory!In the great world, there were eighth-level worlds, eighth-level venerable sovereigns, and eighth-level great path universes. He suppressed Red Moon. It would be useless even if one eighth-level came. It would also be a problem if two eighth-level experts wanted to break through Red Moon.But ... Once he left, perhaps a seventh-rank could defeat the red moon!Other than the three on both sides, there was actually one more Crimson Moon rank-7.Hong Yue had five top venerable sovereigns in total.However, the other one was still patrolling around the red moon and could not be transferred back easily. It was said to be patrolling, but it was also a deterrence to the nearby great worlds that had migrated here. At this moment, the red moon master felt a little uneasy and shocked.They couldn't call the rank-7 patroller back, or else ... The surrounding macro worlds would notice Hong Yue's uneasiness and powerlessness.They were supposed to be allies ... But once people felt that the Crimson Moon was powerless, perhaps ... She would become a Locust!The Lords of major worlds had come to the Crimson Moon to seek protection, but once they discovered that the Crimson Moon was weak ... Who wouldn't be tempted by a level eight major world?It was even more eye-catching than neo martial!Without the power to suppress them, would they be obedient?Red Moon master was in a dilemma, and she even felt like she was about to explode. Why did this happen all of a sudden?How could it be like this!How could the human King have gone to Tian Fang? even if he had gone, the two rank Sevens shouldn't have been killed instantly. However, this was the truth. He didn't know that Wu Shan had attacked first and attracted the attention of the two rank Sevens. The two sides fought, giving the human King an opportunity!Outside Tian Fang.The human King laughed out loud after killing one of them with a single strike. In fact, he was also taking a breather.To kill a rank seven in an instant ... To be honest, it wasn't that simple.It was not easy at all!In that instant, he had actually used up all his energy. In order to ensure that nothing went wrong, he liked to take risks and was used to doing so. He could not borrow Emperor Cang's power either. He had a vague idea of what the other party was planning.Therefore, if the red moon master had dared to appear in that instant ... He would have been dead!However, he did not.As a result, he became even more flamboyant. His martial arts robe fluttered in the wind as he laughed heartily.

Chapter 2837 The Dangerous Jianghu (2)
How could he win without taking risks?This guy was too timid."Hahaha!"He laughed crazily and looked at the seventh grade venerable sovereign who was running away. He didn't make a move ... Others thought he was mocking him, but in reality ... He was powerless. Otherwise, how could he escape?What a joke!If he could kill his enemies, why would he leave them alive?Don't mess around!Not a single one was left!He was just too weak to continue chasing, and he was also worried that others would see through him ... There were more than one or two level 7s nearby, and he could sense at least five or six. Once he revealed his weakened state, coupled with the mysterious nature of the yin-yang world ... He might be surrounded and killed.However, he was still extremely flamboyant and crazy. He looked in all directions and looked down on the world."What are you looking at, a bunch of trash?"He was extremely arrogant!It was as if no one in the world could match him. He sneered,""Killing a good-for-nothing to intimidate the Crimson Moon, are you not convinced?"The surroundings were silent.Even Wu Shan was extremely quiet at this moment, with some vigilance.They were both peak Type 7 experts.However, in front of this person ... He felt threatened and pressured. This was a terrifying fellow.The neo martial King!No wonder he dared to declare war on a type 8 world like the Crimson Moon, despite being a Type 7 master.Tier 7, dead!The neo martial human King's eyes seemed to grow on top of his head, as if he didn't see Wu Shan's vigilance. He looked around, then at the big world, and then at the fleeing Hong Yu. He sneered,""This is the place you wanted to come to? I saw many people gathering here. Where is this place?"“……”Was he serious or just pretending?You don't know where you are and you dare to come and kill?Wu Shan recovered for a moment and said,"This place is the tianfang world!""Tian Fang?"The human King didn't seem to know,"what place?"“……”Wushan felt that there was no need to communicate."The top venerable sovereign of the red moon zone said that he didn't know Tian Fang or the other regions around it. He was the only great world that had produced a level nine venerable sovereign. What else could I say?"At this moment, he even suspected that the Silver Moon King might have reached an agreement with this new martial human King when he attacked. Otherwise, how could there be such a coincidence?He might have suffered a loss.The original plan was for him to stop them. But now, he had created an opportunity for the human King to kill them. No matter what, this time, he didn't kill them, and he didn't eat their meat. However, he had to take the blame!He definitely had to memorize it!Take the blame ...This wasn't the result he wanted. He could kill, but he couldn't take the blame for someone else without getting any benefits.Looking at Hong Yu who was running away, he seemed to be struggling. Soon, he transmitted a message,""Neo martial King, let's be frank! You've taken advantage of me by killing one of them. Now ... Let's join forces and kill the last one ... It'll be a draw. However, this one is dead, and it's mine!"“……”The human King was stunned.What was going on? Although the few of you fought earlier, he could tell that it wasn't a life-and-death battle.They were just sparring.Do you really want to kill?A conspiracy?You want to scheme against me?You want to kill me?Or are you trying to test me?You know that I'm out of energy?In an instant, countless thoughts appeared in the eyes of the outsiders. All kinds of conspiracies, all kinds of killing methods, and all kinds of ambushes.The next moment, the other party's voice sounded in his ear.""You guys took advantage of me first. The agreement we reached with the Silver Moon King is no longer fair! Besides, Hong Yue is your enemy. Human King, if you don't attack now, he will run away!"Silver Moon King?What the hell!He had roughly guessed some things, but he was a little surprised. A little guy could also reach an agreement with a seventh-rank?How did he lie?Yes, he only had one thought. How did he lie to her?It's a little like my style!I've used my sincerity to move many people. Does that mean that this Silver Moon King, whom I've never met before, has also used his sincerity to move this tier 7 Demon King?"Hmm, not bad. You have the style of my neo martial arts. It's indeed my neo martial arts world."The thought flashed through his mind.The next moment, the new martial human King transmitted his voice,"I will prevent the red moon Lord from coming. You kill him!"“……”  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  Wu Shan was startled. You're not going to do anything?"I'm working with the new martial Lord world to intimidate the red moon master. Why else do you think he didn't come? If you kill him, Red Moon master won't dare to come. Consider it as me paying you back!"This ... Made sense.Wu Shan's heart stirred.Red Moon master was intimidated. No wonder she didn't make a move.This meant ... An opportunity!The next moment, Wu Shan disappeared, and the entire world was suddenly filled with clouds. Wu Shan moved extremely fast and disappeared in the blink of an eye. The major cosmos absolute beings around him were all stunned.​ The neo martial human King shouted coldly,""Escape? Where could he escape to? Your cloud world and Crimson Moon have been secretly targeting neo martial. Do you really think I don't know?"Wu Shan, who was in the middle of a chase, was stunned.You know!You know me?No, I've never seen you.In an instant, countless thoughts appeared in his mind. He suddenly felt a sense of fear. It was not the sense of invincibility he felt when facing Kong Ji and the others, but fear and uneasiness.This new martial human King knew everything.He usually played dumb!In an instant, he had even found an excuse to follow them. Wu Shan shouted, "That's the business of the realm Lord. It has nothing to do with me. Neo Martial Emperor, you are the master of the world. What's the point of bullying the weak?"

Chapter 2838 The Sinister Jianghu (3)
As soon as he finished speaking, he quickly chased forward. His great Dao shook, and he transmitted a message to Hong Yu, who was escaping,""Let's join forces, or we'll both die! Hold on for a while, and I, the Lord of the clouds, will definitely descend!"“……”At this moment, Hong Yu was actually scared witless and didn't dare to stop.However, when he heard what Wu Shan said, he thought about how the two of them did indeed have an Alliance. It was just that Wu Shan had attacked them before ... Of course, he could actually tell that the human King's Blade attack was mainly to cut down Wu Shan.It seemed that this new martial human King did know about the Alliance between the two sides. He had originally come to kill Wu Shan, but they were unlucky enough to run into him.At this moment, this new martial artist King still wanted to chase after Wu Shan ... And join forces to stop him?Wait for the Lord of the clouds 'rescue?As for the red moon Lord ... Perhaps she was really in trouble. Otherwise, she wouldn't have ignored Ji Huo's death.The thought emerged, and he was still a little hesitant. The voice of the great Dao quickly spread through Wushan."Quick, give me a moment, or I'll be killed...You'll be killed soon as well. Up ahead is the divine light plane, and both sides might be in an Alliance. The Son of God of light and the Silvermoon King have a deep friendship. Do you want to be killed by the divine light plane?"Hong Yu only hesitated for a moment, but he still made a decision to temporarily join forces.Because Wu Shan had no reason to deal with him.As for before ... It could be explained that Wu Shan had dealt with them and intimidated everyone for the sake of the tianfang great world and the tianfang great path universe. But now, in the face of a life-and-death crisis, facing a powerhouse who had killed several level-seven experts, what was the great path universe?He had to save his life!Hong Yu immediately made a decision and slowed down a little. There were two seventh-rank fighters, and Wu Shan was still at the peak of the seventh-rank. As long as they joined forces, the neo martial human King would be exhausted. One against two might not be able to do anything to them.He stopped, but Wu Shan was even faster. In the blink of an eye, he was behind him, panting.Behind him, the human King stepped on the air and dragged the air with his saber. He was not fast.He couldn't be faster!"So what if we work together?" he threatened. Two pieces of trash, even if they join forces, I'll Still Kill them all! Who among the trash observing the surroundings would dare to rescue you?"He sneered, and Wu Shan shouted,"I, the cloud Master, am nearby. If you don't run away and continue to fight with us, you will definitely die once the realm Lord arrives!""What a joke!"The human King sneered,"do you really think that this is this King's full strength?" I'm too lazy to even use the power of a big cat. With just half of my power, I can kill you all like chickens. If you, cloud realm Lord, dare to come, I'll kill you first!"These words ... Also had some deterrent power.When the human King was destroyed in the dark World, he had borrowed half of the power from Emperor Cang. At this moment, even some of the experts who were watching in the dark were shocked.That's true!  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  The other party had yet to merge into one, and he had already killed a tier 7. Now, he even had the guts to deal with two tier 7 experts. Once he merged into one ... How terrifying would that be?!This person, even if he had not reached the eighth rank, he was almost no different from an eighth rank!Wu Shan's expression was also solemn, half true and half false!He also considered how terrifying this person was, and quickly transmitted a message to Hong Yu,""You, Red Moon master, why didn't you follow the turbulence and come here?"It was a test, but also a sincere one.Is your Red Moon sovereign dead?After a tier 7 was killed, was there nothing to gain? When he wanted to kill these people before, he had actually considered this. The master of the great path universe, a level Seven being killed here, the great planet shaking, if he really paid the price, he could come.Wushan wanted to kill one of them, strip him of his power, and fill the sky. For the sake of a seventh-grade power, the lord of the sky would also descend, so he was not too afraid.But ... What about the red moon Lord?At this moment, Hong Yu had the chance to sense it. The next moment, his heart trembled slightly!Not good!Xing Shen seemed to be dead. This ... Neo martial arts went to Red moon's territory?Did they use a diversion tactic or besieged the red moon?No wonder the red moon master did not come!But at this moment, he couldn't say that. He could only say vaguely,""My Lord has something important to do ..."That meant he couldn't come!Wushan was shocked. Could it be that what the human King said was true? this neo martial ... Had another double-pronged attack?Also, where did the previous void teleport to?Could it be...That it had something to do with the divine light plane?The two sides had joined forces long ago? He was also thinking that he would have to pay a price if he wanted to escape from this rare opportunity.The next moment, he covered the sky with his hand, and the clouds and mist covered the sky and earth. He roared,""Kill me? I'm also at the peak of the seventh rank, why would I be afraid of you?""Let's join hands!"Wu Shan shouted in a low voice at Hong Yu. Hong Yu actually wanted to intimidate and didn't really want to fight with the human King, but Wu Shan had made a move ... He was the vanguard, and he himself was at the seventh step after all.It would be hard for him to explain the death of a Grade 7 expert today.In the next moment, he still made his move.The Crimson Moon Dao domain appeared!As for the human King, he looked at them coldly and raised his long blade ...He was only looking at Wu Shan.This old thing, is he playing tricks?Just as he was thinking, suddenly, five mountains suppressed the world. Just like before, the five Finger mountains appeared again. This time, the five Finger mountains formed a region of clouds and mist that covered the entire area!In the sky, it was as if many immortal courts had appeared on top of the mountains, suppressing the past and present!The clouds and fog obscured the vision of countless people in an instant.Behind the clouds and mist, Wu Shan's face was cold. At this moment, he turned around, turned back, and slapped his palm down at Hong Yu!Hong Yu also felt the danger and was instantly terrified!

2839 Chapter 468
How could this be?He had heard that neo martial and the divine light realm were involved, but Yunxiao, we are the Allies!Bastard!Earlier, Yunxiao secretly made a move to kill the neo martial artist powerhouses. Do you think neo martial artists don't know about this?Wushan, have you gone crazy?BOOM!With a deafening sound, the five mountains instantly pressed down. The red universe Dao domain was directly broken, and a mouthful of golden blood spurted out.The next moment, the hand of the mountain of fog was like heaven and earth, instantly forming an enormous cage.Unlike the human King, he had not been able to kill a seventh-rank magical beast with one move.However, his mountain of clouds and sea of mist seemed to have an extremely strong suppressive force. In the blink of an eye, Hong Yu was suppressed to the point where he could not move.Hong Yu continued to struggle. Suddenly, a great Dao universe appeared.The great Dao of cloud!At this moment, the power of the clouds descended. In the great path universe, it was as if someone was watching this place and prying with their will. It was as if they had seen this scene. In the great path universe, a sigh sounded,""Wushan! You ..."In the universe of the great path, Wu Shan's voice sounded,""If I leave, I'll definitely make it up to Yunxiao! "As for the Crimson Moon world, Ji Huo just died, and I've already taken the blame. A tier 7 has died, and it's already difficult for us to get along! Unless...The realm Lord hands me over!""Hongyue, do you dare to provoke me, Yunxiao?"The realm Lord's voice rang out."Neo martial ... Is not to be provoked. It's extremely aggressive, even more so than Crimson Moon. Destroying Crimson Moon will help neo martial!""I know ... But the new martial human King is right here. Even if I don't kill him, he will. If he kills one more person and takes away two seventh-grade bodies, who can stop him from reaching the eighth-grade? Sector Lord, are you willing to descend and stop him?"The cloud Master did not say anything else.Did it make sense?There was.A neo martial human King might really be infinitely close to the eighth rank. Killing one might not necessarily advance, but killing another ... Might advance.Was he willing to descend?Why?Even the red moon master did not come. If he tried to stop her, wouldn't he become a scapegoat? For a moment, he didn't say anything and chose to acquiesce.It was impossible for him to descend.Now that he had descended, he would definitely have a conflict with the neo Martial Emperor.At this moment, he chose not to speak. He didn't say a word, but he didn't stop Wu Shan from mobilizing the power of the great Dao of the clouds. He didn't even care about Wu Shan extracting the power of the daosource.In an instant, a powerful force entered Wu Shan's body.BOOM!The five mountains suppressed the heavens and earth, rumbling loudly. Hong Yu's voice resounded through the heavens and earth, filled with anger."Wushan! You dare to kill me?"The surrounding venerable sovereigns, who were hidden, were shocked!What was going on?Wasn't it the neo martial human king who killed them, and they joined forces to deal with the neo martial human King?Why ... Did it become Wushan killing Hongyu?Boom! Boom! Boom!Heaven and earth exploded, and chaos shook. Wu Shan took the opponent by surprise and directly suppressed him. Hong Yu wanted to draw a large amount of the power of the great Dao, but because the great Dao was in a bit of turmoil, it was not as good as before.Two level Seven cultivators had died. In order to stabilize his great Dao, Red Moon master had mobilized a large amount of great Dao power to suppress the great Dao universe.At this moment, there wasn't much power of great DAOs left for him, a rank seven, to use. ……The Crimson Moon world.Red Moon master's expression changed. She was shocked again and roared in anger,""Bastard, you deserve to die!"They actually didn't give up!After killing two tier 7 experts, they still wanted more!He was going crazy!At this moment, he was so impulsive that he wanted to completely descend and fight to the death with the new martial artist King!He spread his will over ... But in the next moment, his expression changed.He was not the neo martial artist human King!It was ... Wu Shan!How could this be?Yunxiao ... Has betrayed me!No, it was breaking the alliance. Yunxiao had hit him when he was down!If he descended now, perhaps he would face an incomparably terrifying consequence. Yunxiao, Fang ping, Wu Shan, and the others would try to kill him!And the new martial arts Emperor Cang would invade the Crimson Moon!They were going to devour the entire Crimson Moon!I understand now!In addition, the divine light plane was one of them.So that was how it was!No wonder Ji Huo was killed so easily. It turned out ... There were more than one neo Martial Emperor!"Also, the awakened one was killed, and he was so close to the red moon, but I didn't sense anything at the beginning. This means ... There are other powerful people involved, hiding the secrets of heaven.Who was it?In an instant, he thought of one person after another. He thought of the other seventh rank venerable sovereigns in Yunxiao and the divine light realm's venerable sovereigns ...Perhaps, these three families will join forces to divide me up!Bastard!At this moment, he made a choice with an ashen face. In an instant, he deprived Hong Yu of a large amount of power of the great Dao. He couldn't help him. In this case ... He could only let Hong Yu sacrifice himself, but he couldn't be killed just like that. Even if Hong Yu was really dead, he couldn't let the other party deprive him of a large amount of power of the great Dao.Otherwise, if three seventh-tier powers were stripped off in succession, there would definitely be problems with the Crimson Moon great Dao universe. The most serious problem would be a drop in tier!At that time, he could possibly become a seventh-rank, and that would be extremely terrifying.Leaving behind the power of a great Dao, he might be able to quickly create a new level Seven.Red Moon didn't lack a sixth-rank.……"Ah!"At this moment, red universe Supreme Emperor suddenly roared in anger. Wu Shan also instantly realized the problem and his expression changed.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  How ruthless!Although there was a high chance that Hong Yu would die, he could sense that Red Moon master had instantly drawn away at least 50% of his opponent's power. He had dropped from Level 7 to the point where he was about to fall!This was ... Sending Hong Yu to his death.The other party couldn't save them, so they chose this method?
