        d one of Fei Tian's three suns with one punch and shattered a yellow-grade origin god weapon ... Origin God weapons are actually very strong and it's difficult to break them even during the transformation stage of the rising light. However, the opponent's golden armor is also extremely powerful and can break origin God weapons of a lower grade ..."
         "Thank you for your explanation, Minister hou," Qi gang quickly said."Then ... Is it possible that it's above sunguang?"
         "There are!"
         "There's still a possibility,"hou Xiaochen said seriously." You have to know that the ancient people are not the people of today. We need to open up a new path bit by bit. Perhaps what we've opened up above the rising light realm was just ordinary back then. If this Golden Warrior was already very strong back then, it's not impossible for him to still have the strength of a rising light realm expert even now. "
         Qi gang was deep in thought. When he saw everyone looking at him, he smiled and said,""Then I have no more questions."
         He didn 't, but Hu Qingfeng interrupted,"Minister hou, the Black Tortoise seal that the gold-tier warrior is holding, what level is it?"
         "He's at the bottom of the Sky Class, and even stronger ... It's not impossible,"hou Xiaochen chuckled.
         "As you know, the classification of origin God weapons is only determined by us. It may not be accurate if we use our knowledge and insight to classify them. "According to some ancient records, all the origin God weapons we have now might have been standard weapons back then. Now, this Black Tortoise seal is the core origin divine weapon of a city. It might even be stronger than the one in the central region. "
         As soon as these words came out, the expressions of several people changed slightly.
         That thing in the middle?
          He was probably talking about the treasure he had seized from the Yama.
         The war in the central continent actually originated from this item because it could detect the so-called super talent. Whoever used it, it could easily find out what kind of super and talent was matched with that person.
         This was secondary. This treasure was also very useful to the strong. It was said that it could also be used to find the Super Lock!
         Some powerhouses might only be able to find six superpower locks.
         However, this treasure seemed to be able to help people discover more ultra-power locks. Some of the origin divine weapon origins could even help powerhouses create other ultra-power locks.
         That was a precious treasure!
         Today, it was still in the hands of the night patrolman. However, it was said that the nine secretaries were also forcing him to abdicate, hoping that the night patrolman would share it instead of keeping it to himself.
         Because of that thing, the central region was in a mess.
         But now, hou Xiaochen was saying that the Black Tortoise seal might be comparable to that thing ... Even Qi gang's expression changed slightly upon hearing this.
         "Minister hou, are you serious?" Qi gang asked.
         "Can this Black Tortoise seal be compared to the heavenly Dao ruler?" Hu Qingfeng hurriedly asked.
         The item in the middle was the treasure named the heavenly Dao ruler.
         One foot to set the sky!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It was said that, in addition to its rumored effects, it also had some other special abilities that were extremely powerful. Unfortunately, Hu Qingfeng had not had the chance to see it because the higher-ups of the night patrolman had said that although it was useful, it also had some problems, which were being solved now.
          "It's hard to say. Anything is possible. "  "I didn't get it, so who can be sure?" hou Xiaochen laughed.
         The moment he said that, it became quiet.
         Director Zhao coughed and interrupted their conversation,""Let's not talk about this. Let's talk about the arrangements this time and who will enter. We can't go in too little or too many ... Otherwise, Silver moon's side will easily fall into chaos. "
         "Minister hou, you're going in personally?" he asked.
         "Yes, it's agreed. There's no other way. This is what everyone wants, isn't it?"
         Hou Xiaochen chuckled."I won't bring too many people with me to the night watchers. Jin Shan, Mu Lin, Xiao Yu, and I will go. If Li Hao comes back, we'll go with him."
         Everyone's eyes moved slightly.
         ? Although only five people were going, other than Hao lianchuan, all the other powerhouses were pulled in.
         Director Zhao coughed,"just the few of you?" Aren't we bringing the Wei Wu Army in?"
         "Forget it," he said.
         Hou Xiaochen shook his head."Ask the Wei Wu Army to seal off the area. They can deal with the three suns, but they will not be able to deal with Xuguang. It is a pity that Silver Moon is weak. If Xuguang causes trouble, we will have to trouble the military."
         On the military side, the stern-looking Huang Yu looked at them and said,""The military won't send too many people. Hu dingfang, Ren tianchuan, Bai Yuanqing, Wang Pengju, four people, plus frenzied sword, that'll make up five people."
         The four of them were the Vice-commander of the White Dragon Army and the Tiger wing Army. Frenzied sword represented the Silver Moon Army.
          And he did not choose to enter.
         "It's just Wang Heng and I at the inspection Office. "Kong Jie smiled.
         Director Zhao coughed."All of you ... You're all going. My administration wants to go, but no one ... Forget it, Qi gang is here. He's from the central region, and I heard he's a peerless genius. Let him represent my administration!"
         Hu Qingfeng wanted to say something, but he hesitated.
         Director Zhao looked at him and smiled,""It's up to you whether you want to go or not. If you want to bring your two subordinates with you, you can also ... It just so happens that it can also strengthen the power of the Silver Moon officials."
         Hu Qingfeng nodded.
         "What?" Qi gang frowned slightly."So, even if we include me, Hu Qingfeng, and his two subordinates ... There are only 16 people in total?"
         That's too little!
         Of course, almost all the experts were dragged out.
         However, he was puzzled that Huang Yu of the Silver Moon Army did not enter. He had thought that Huang Yu would go this time.
        
         "Quite a number of people from the three major organizations have gone," he continued."I heard that even orange moon and yellow moon, who are pursuing Yuan Shuo, are rushing over. They are top-notch experts."
         In that case, it would be very dangerous.
         Hou Xiaochen laughed,"quality is not the most important thing in war. That's enough!" Moreover, with the addition of two talented heavenly stars, our safety will be even more guaranteed. "
         "Commander Yu still needs to be in charge of the military to prevent chaos. Director Zhao and the others are even older. There are indeed no strong people in the general Administration and the same goes for the inspection Guild...It is already the limit for Secretary Kong and Secretary Wang to join."
         "No matter how many people we bring, they're still too weak. They'll just be a target once we get in!"
         "Isn't Minister Hao lianchuan going?"Hu Qingfeng asked. He's also at the middle stage of the three yang realm. At this time, it'll be helpful if another three yang enters. "
         Even if there were many Sunglow, the three suns were still the core combat power.
         In the end, he didn't even bring three yang.
         Hou Xiaochen coughed and shook his head,"forget about him. He'll stay and guard the place. We can't just let him die all at once. That'll be troublesome." If something really happens to us, he's at least at the middle stage of the three yang realm and can stabilize the situation. With the Wei Wu Army, even if a handful of sunguang comes, they can still resist for a while ..."
          Hu Qingfeng did not say anything else.
         This way, there were very few people who went in.
         This also meant that hou Xiaochen was in real danger.
         This time, apart from hou Xiaochen, only Yu Luosha had reached the Sunglow level. Jin gun was one of them, but it was hard to say how strong he was. Su Meng seemed to only be comparable to three suns.
         As for him and Qi gang, they obviously wouldn't help hou Xiaochen.
         "That Li Hao is Yuan Shuo's disciple," Qi gang suddenly said."If he really returns and enters, won't he attract the hostility of the three major organizations?"
         "It's all the same. He killed six three suns, which means he's quite strong. Even the three major organizations rated him as peak three suns. He'll be of great help to us,"hou Xiaochen replied.
         "Besides, he's been to the remains last time. If Hao lianchuan doesn't go this time, he'll be the only one who's more familiar with the place. No one else is as familiar as him."
         Hu dingfang did go, but hou Xiaochen didn't mention it.
         Qi gang nodded slightly and asked curiously,""Can Li Hao really come back? It's said that Banshan and tsunami have yet to return, and even the king of equality's 16 Lords of Hell have followed the king of Samsara to hunt them down. "
         Seeing that hou Xiaochen was looking at him, he explained, "I'm just curious, nothing else. "Other things aside, the 16 Lords of Hell under King Pingdeng are quite famous. King Pingdeng is active in the South, and his strength is at the middle stage of the rising light realm. He's not the best, but with the 16 Lords of Hell under him, he's very famous. Even some powerhouses at the peak of the rising light realm don't dare to provoke him."  "Although there are only 16 three suns, but when they join forces to set up the Avici Hell net, in addition to King Pingdeng's own powerful strength, it can be said that the Yama's ninth Palace Master is much stronger than LAN Yue."
         "Although LAN Yue is on the God tier master ranking list, her ranking is quite low, just like us. The king of equality is over 30 years old, so she's not on the list. However, even those people on the God tier master ranking list who are ranked high up don't dare to offend the king of equality ..."
         He didn't really care about the Blue Moon of the Crimson Moon.
         However, he was extremely concerned about King Pingdeng.
         Hou Xiaochen thought for a moment and said,"they went to the Cang mountains. The Cang mountains aren't peaceful, and Li Hao is a Martial Master. As long as he's careful and avoids pursuit, there shouldn't be a big problem." When Li Hao comes back, we'll forget about what happened before. After we enter the remains, if some of the three great organizations die, who will remember what happened before?"
         “……”
         These words left the few of them speechless.
         "The others are just decorations," hou Xiaochen laughed,"but special envoy Qi and special envoy Hu are the ones we can rely on this time! With me and Xiao Yu, even if the three major organizations send a few more sunguangs, we're confident in dealing with them! After this, I'll be leaving Silver Moon, so I'll do my best to help everyone solve some of their problems. "
         Kong Jie laughed."Old hou, you're looking down on me too much. I'm at the peak of the three suns. Do you really think I don't exist?"
          "We'll talk after you enter the rising light,"hou Xiaochen laughed.
         Kong Jie laughed."Soon! I think I have hope for Xuguang!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com On the side, Huang Yu seemed to be a little impatient. He said coldly,""It's decided then. You guys ... Cough cough cough ... After you guys go in, take care of dingfang and the others. The White Dragon Army and the Tiger wing Army will be very troublesome without them.“
         "Don't worry, commander Yu!"
         "As long as we're fine, we'll take care of them. As for the outside, I'll have to trouble you and director Zhao to take care of them," hou Xiaochen smiled.
         Director Zhao coughed lightly."You can talk to old Huang. The only thing I can do is to report this to the higher-ups and send more experts to help Silver Moon."
         With that, the meeting was over.
         Qi gang glanced at the Silver Moon leaders who had split up and returned to their respective homes. After some thought, he caught up with Deputy Director Zhou.
         After the others had left, he fell behind and said softly,""Director Zhou, it's said that the star guard Army was mainly stationed in Silver Moon, and the identities of the three commanders are a mystery. Now that there's news ... I wonder if the director has any information on that year? I've asked the administration department, and it's said that aside from the imperial family, the administration department also has a copy of the Heavenly Star guards "files, right?"
        
         Deputy Director Zhou was a little surprised. He looked at him and thought about it,""There are, but the files from back then were all destroyed. When the Wei Wu Army was disbanded and night patrols were set up, hou Xiaochen came to the Bureau to take the files and destroyed them all!"
         "You haven't ... Seen it at the director?"
         "It can't be that you don't understand at all, right?" Qi gang whispered.
         "I know a little. At least I know that hou Xiaochen is the sickly ghost from the rumors. There's also evidence that shows that general Huang Yu ... Ahem, I can't say much."
         Deputy Director Zhou lowered his voice,"there is no point in pursuing this matter. Is it the same?"
         Qi gang nodded, unable to suppress his curiosity.""I actually want to know if the last of the three great commanders ... Is he a higher-up in Silver Moon or a martial artist? could it be that it's really Yuan Shuo, as some people have guessed?"
         "I'm not sure about that. "
         Deputy Director Zhou shook his head and quickly smiled,""We'll be exposed sooner or later! Could he hide it for a lifetime? Let's not talk about these boring things. I heard that special emissary Qi is also very famous in the central region and is very powerful. There are so many things happening in the central region, but this time, special emissary Qi actually came here personally. It's unexpected. The chief still places great importance on this matter. Didn't the other eight divisions send some experts?"
         "I'm not sure. Maybe he's not on the same path as me. Maybe he's hiding in a superpower ..."
         Qi gang laughed."Besides, I'm nothing. The central continent is full of talents and powerhouses, so most of them keep a low profile. It's US who are a little ostentatious to deter the three major organizations."
          Deputy Director Zhou sighed,"the three big organizations are a scourge and cancer!" I hope that special envoy Qi will put in more effort this time and kill a few more experts. Hou Xiaochen has the ambition of a Wolf ... Fortunately, the general Administration forced him to agree to leave after this exploration ... Whether he can get the origin god weapon or die in there, they'll force him to leave Silver Moon!"
         "If he leaves, I do hope that special envoy Qi can stay in Silver Moon," he added."With an expert like special envoy Qi around, Silver Moon can rest easy."
         Qi gang laughed drily and didn't say anything.
         What nonsense was this?
         That was the night patrolman, not the administrative Bureau. Even if he stayed, he wouldn't be able to go there. A few guys from the central region's night patrolman had almost arrived.
         Before he said anything, Deputy Director Zhou asked curiously,""I've heard that there are a few guys from the Nightwalker's headquarters who cause trouble all day long. Why aren't they here at Silver Moon this time?"
         "They?"
         "Maybe ..." Said Qi gang after some consideration."He might have gone to watch a bigger show, or he might have gone to get into bigger trouble!"
         Shaking his head, even Qi gang was speechless."Those guys can't wait for the world to fall into chaos! He did not know what the night patrolmen were thinking about, letting them leave. It's said that these guys went to the sky ROC mountain a few days ago to provoke the sky ROC, which was about to break through to the next level. They also wanted to take its descendant and train it to be their Mount. When I left, it was said that there were still great demons chasing them, but I don't know where they are now. "
         Deputy Director Zhou shook his head and sighed, not asking anymore.
         It seemed that those few people probably wouldn't be able to come. Forget it.
         ……
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The Hengduan Canyon was bustling with activity.
         Everyone was waiting for the relic to open again so that they could see the gold-tier warrior and go to the inner city. It was said that the inner city was full of divine power stones.  At that moment, a large truck stopped at a small town that was closest to the crosscut Canyon.
         It was already September 26th.
         The day after tomorrow, the ruins opened again.
         This place was less than a hundred miles away from the cross-section Canyon. If they hurried, they would be able to reach it in an hour. Walking in the wilderness would be faster.
         However, Li Hao chose to stop and rest.
         Along the way, he had avoided everyone. Whenever he saw a ball of light, he would avoid it. Now that he had returned, no one might know.
         He was not hiding his tracks to ambush anyone.
         He just wanted to figure out the current situation.
         A moment later, Li Hao, who had checked into a hotel in the town, dialed a number. As expected, that guy was nearby. The communicator could not be used a thousand miles away from white moon City.
         The Hengduan Canyon was only a thousand miles away from the White moon City, but the other party had to be nearby, otherwise, they would not be able to contact him.
         When the call went through, Wang Ming was also very excited."You ... You're here?"
         "Yes."
         "Where are you?"
          "Where are you?"
         "I'm in the military camp ... My grandfather came this time and also wants to enter the ruins. He's grounded me and won't let me leave the military camp!"
         He was helpless."I'm just going on a trip. What does it have to do with me? what's the point of grounding me?"
         After that, he said excitedly,'I'm in the middle stage of the sun glory realm! And ... I feel like the later stage is coming soon, hahaha ..."
         "Yes, congratulations."
         Li Hao replied perfunctorily and quickly said,""Help me collect intelligence, all the information on the experts! It would be best to attach photos. Also, help me check if the swords gate's headmaster has come out of his closed-door cultivation, and if the southern Fist sect has come to the Hengduan Canyon ... By the way, all the big and small things that have happened in the Hengduan Canyon recently, sort them out for me, form the materials, and give them to me. "
         "You're going to write it down in words?"Wang Ming was speechless.
         This is going to cost me my life!
         Come, I'll tell you.
         "Cut the crap," Li Hao quickly said." 100 cubic meters of mysterious energy, Deal or No Deal?"
        
         "Ah? This ..."
         "Add a divine power Stone. It's of the metal element."
         "No problem!"
         "I'll get it done overnight. When do you want it?"Wang Ming was overjoyed and hurriedly asked.
         "When you're done, you can leave the camp. I'll go get it from you."
         "Alright!"
         After ending the communication, Li Hao stuffed the communicator back into his storage ring and cut off the connection.
         After some consideration, he walked to the next room, pushed the door open, and said,""Boss, let's go to the Hengduan Canyon tonight. As for the others, they should stay here for the time being. Heaven battling city is too dangerous."
         Liu Long nodded. It was indeed dangerous.
          He had been there before, so he knew how terrifying that gold-tier warrior was.
         "Aren't we going to meet up with the Wei Wu Army or the night patrols?"
         "Not for now."
         Li Hao continued."We will put on our black armor later. If the Wei Wu Army enters, it will be best if we can sneak in. If not, we have to keep a low profile. We don't want to become the target of public criticism before we enter!" It's best if we don't show our faces while no one knows we're back. Otherwise, Banshan and the others "situation will be easily exposed."
         "It's best if we can even hide it from Minister hou. If not, we can only let Minister hou and the others know."
         Liu Long glanced at him and nodded, not saying anything.
         He didn't have any objections.
         After pondering for a moment, he sent a voice transmission to Li Hao,""That's right, this time, you'd better go through the second passage. I went through it once last time, and although I didn't find anything, I had a vague feeling that there might really be good things inside, but I didn't discover them. You have good eyesight, so you might be able to find something. "
         Li Hao was a little confused, but he still nodded.
         That works too.
         As for the second passage, it wasn't too dangerous for martial masters. If no martial masters took it, they would die.
         After conversing for a while, the two of them began to wait for the sky to turn dark.
         ……
         As the sky turned dark, two figures quickly moved forward, rushing towards the crosscut Canyon.  More than an hour later.
         Li Hao took a deep breath.
         艹!
         In all directions, there were balls of light. The huge cross-section Canyon was filled with people!
         They were all superpowers!
         In his eyes, the area within a radius of several thousand meters had already turned into daytime. There were lights everywhere, and it was so dazzling that his eyes hurt.
         How many superpowers were there?
         Moreover, there were countless balls of sunlight. He saw dozens of the three suns, and the rising light would flash from time to time, blinding people's eyes.
         How many superpowers were there?
         A few thousand?
         A single heaven battling city had actually attracted so many people. Even Li Hao was impressed. Were these people not afraid of death?
         Heaven battling city wasn't safe. Li Hao suspected that, besides the heaven battling Army, the greatest danger in heaven battling city didn't come from the black armors or the copper armors, but from ... Living creatures with consciousness!
          The last time he left, he had a feeling that someone was observing him.
         He didn't think that his feeling would be wrong.
         Even though he did not see any big orbs, it only meant that the other party was not a super but a Martial Master.
         "All of you are here to die!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao cursed in his heart. He suspected that hou Xiaochen had intentionally revealed the existence of heaven battling city for some other purpose.
         Otherwise, with his strength, Silver Moon 's, and the others "strength, what happened last time wouldn't have happened. Would Ziyue and the others be able to make an enemy out of hou Xiaochen?
         However, this was also a good thing. At this moment, Li Hao still had to thank hou Xiaochen. If it weren't for him, he wouldn't have had the chance to come to Silver Moon without a super.
         A moment later, Li Hao and Liu Long avoided some experts and sneaked deeper into the cave.
         At the same time, he could also observe the strength of the various parties.
        
         In the transverse Canyon.
         Li Hao strolled around with Liu Long.
         The two martial masters concealed their auras, and almost no one could discover them. As long as they didn't intentionally get close to those experts and reveal no hostility, martial masters were the best in hiding. Even Li Hao couldn't detect them.
         However, Li Hao soon discovered some problems, and his expression turned grave.
         After quietly climbing back to the cliff with Liu Long, Li Hao said telepathically,""Boss, did you find something wrong?"
         Liu Long nodded his head. His expression was somewhat solemn as he transmitted a message,"It seems like ... There are more martial masters!"
         Yes, this time, there seemed to be a lot more martial masters.
         Clearly, some secrets had been leaked during the last exploration.
         Whether it was the three major organizations or the other parties, there were more martial masters this time. It was hard to judge their strength, but many martial masters had a force that showed that they were at least in the perfection-realm.
         Martial masters could fly in the city and easily pass through the second passage. They could also conceal their auras and avoid being attacked by the black armors ... Although the black armors were no longer there, the Golden armors might not be able to notice them.
          So this time, martial masters from all sides had come.
         Some of them were well-known old-school martial masters, while others were powerful martial masters secretly trained by large organizations.
         Of course, it would still be mainly the supers.
         The martial masters of the large organizations might not be stronger than the three suns.
         However, there should be some Qian fighters, and above that ... If he used treasures like divine energy stones to smash it, he might be able to get it, but it was hard to say.
         Other than these martial masters, there were also some rising lights, which surprised Li Hao.
         He saw a very young man, like a young master, and he even had people serving him.
         In this godforsaken place, there were even servants who served tea, prepared bathwater, and even warmed the bed ... Well, he heard that an old man had arranged it for the young master.
         As for the old man, Li Hao couldn't see through him. He should be a Martial Master, and not too weak.
         And that young man was actually Xuguang, who was even stronger than Banshan and the others. This was strange. Li Hao had never seen a Martial Master who enjoyed himself so much.
         Superpowers are so blessed!
         It wasn't that martial masters didn't enjoy it, but that powerful martial masters wouldn't even think of bringing servants over in such an environment. They were too bored.
         After walking around, Li Hao's eyes were filled with shock.
         Other than the three major organizations, he didn't go to investigate. Just in this small area, he saw three sunguang and 11 three suns!
         When did three suns and sunguang become so common?
         Didn't they say that there weren't many rays of the rising sun in the central region?
         Li Hao frowned, but he soon felt relieved. It was clear that heaven battling city had attracted the attention of many parties. The Golden-armored warrior who had blown up the source god weapon with one punch was being watched, including the powerful black turtle source god weapon.
         "The big turtle of the Wang family?"
          Li Hao muttered in his heart. If the Wang family's turtle was already so popular, it seemed that no one was even interested in the Li family's sword.  Did everyone really believe that the sword was among the night patrollers, or were they pretending that they didn't know that they had another sword? were they just waiting for the right time and deliberately not mentioning it?
         The Li family's sword and the Zhang family's saber were both with Li Hao ... But he had given the saber to Yuan Shuo.
         He wondered if his teacher had discovered anything special about the Zhang family's saber, other than its powerful offensive capabilities.
         "How terrifying ... So many experts have come. I can't even fight against an early stage rising light realm expert."
         Li Hao sighed helplessly in his heart.
         With the four forces fused, he still had a chance of matching sunguang.
         But now, with only the fusion of the three forces, the blood saber art, his extremely powerful physical body, and his five viscera, even now, he wasn't confident that he could match a sunrise realm expert.
         His physical body and five internal organs were much stronger than before, but the strengthening of Shi was not in the same system. Shi did not receive much strengthening, which meant that the attack power did not stack.
         On the other hand, its defensive power was several times stronger.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He didn't think about it anymore. He was going to find Wang Ming to get some information, then compare them one by one, and finally supplement some people who didn't appear in the information. This way, he could find all the experts to the greatest extent. Even if he missed something, he wouldn't miss too much.
         ……
         Half an hour later.
         Outside the military camp.
         ? Li Hao did not sneak around. Instead, he wore black armor and appeared outside the military camp. He attracted the attention of many people. What were the Wei Wu Army doing here?
         The Wei Wu Army was not stationed with them.
         "I'm looking for Wang Ming!"
         Li Hao, who was hiding under the black cloak, said rashly,""Please tell him that his friend is here to see him."
          After saying that, Li Hao began to wait outside the camp.
         At the same time, he also scanned the light orbs in the camp.
         Quite a few!
         There seemed to be a few people in the rising light realm. One was Hu Qingfeng, whom he knew. The other was stronger than Hu Qingfeng, but he didn't know whose it was. There was also a ball of light that seemed very powerful ... Li Hao was a little surprised.
         Three sunrise powerhouses?
         Since when did the military camp have so many sunrises?
         In addition, hou Xiaochen and the others might also be here, but Li Hao couldn't see them from a distance. Only when he was close could he see the dazzling light on their bodies.
         He pretended to be the Wei Wu Army ... No, he was the Wei Wu Army to begin with.
         Li Hao concealed his identity and waited for Wang Ming outside the military camp.
         After a while, before Wang Ming came out, a person Li Hao knew came out first.
        
         Li Hao didn't look at him, pretending not to know him.
         As he was thinking, the person in the distance suddenly waved at him.""You, come here!"
         Seeing that Li Hao was looking at him, but didn't move, the old man waved his hand again.""It's you. Stop looking and come over!"
         Li Hao was a little confused, but seeing that the person was indeed calling for him, he had no choice but to walk over and say,""My Lord!"
         "Do you know me?"
         "I know, director Zhou of the general Administration!"
         The old man smiled and nodded."It's good that you know me. I'm going out for a while and I'm preparing to get someone to escort me. That's good, I'll choose you. The Wei Wu Army is not weak."
         Li Hao was extremely speechless!
         You ... You want me to be your bodyguard?
         The point is, you're from the general Administration and I'm from the Wei Wu Army. We're not from the same system. The general Administration and the night patrols aren't on bad terms yet, so ... Why are you looking for me?
          The military personnel were everywhere in the vicinity.
         You can just find some people from the military.
         Do you recognize me?
         Li Hao thought to himself, but he also felt that it was unlikely. As a Martial Master, he had concealed all his aura. Under normal circumstances, it was impossible for anyone to discover his identity.
         This director Zhou was the only one in the higher-ups who he couldn't see anything from. Maybe he was a normal person, maybe he was a strong person.
         However, no matter what, he shouldn't be able to see through his identity through the black banner, the bronze mirror, and the Martial Master, right?
         "My Lord, I'm waiting for someone ..."
         "No matter who we're waiting for, let that person continue to wait."
         Director Zhou laughed and said,"you will do. I can't be bothered to find anyone else. I can rest assured that the Wei Wu Army will be able to use them. There is still the black Vatican. One look and I can tell that they are the core of the Army. If anything happens to me, it will be the fault of the night patrols!"
         Li Hao was completely speechless.
         ? At this moment, he had nothing to say. He could only say gloomily,""Yes! My Lord, where are you going?"
         It's the middle of the night, why would an old man like you run?
         Deputy Director Zhou had already walked out of the camp and smiled,""Just follow me,"
         Li Hao was extremely depressed.
         However, at this moment, it was really not good to refuse, and there was no way to refuse. The Wei Wu Army had no conditions to refuse this escort mission. Even though the Wei Wu Army was not in the same system as the other party, the other party was the second-in-command of Silver Moon in name.
         Hou Xiaochen was in the back row.
         Li Hao had no choice but to ask Wang Ming to wait while he followed the old man. This crosscut Canyon was very rugged. Director Zhou walked for a while, and because of the poor lighting, he couldn't see clearly and almost fell.
         Li Hao hurriedly helped her up. He cursed again in his heart. You're old, so you should just stay in the military camp. Why are you running in the middle of the night?
         At this moment, he was also thinking whether this person was looking for him on purpose or was it really just a coincidence?  He would not look down on upper-class figures like silver Moon.
         All of them were terrifying.
         Even if this old man didn't seem to have anything special, he wouldn't underestimate him.
         For example, Hong Yitang. The one Li Hao saw before was three suns with three sun orbs. But last time, he didn't see any orbs. Not only did he not see any orbs, but he didn't see anything at all. He was a Martial Master.
         Sometimes, the eyes could lie.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He helped Deputy Director Zhou up and thought, it was so late at night. Were they not afraid that something would happen if they found an unknown Wei Wu Army to escort them?
         "I'm old ... In the past, I could walk a hundred miles at night and eat five big bowls in a row. Now, I've become old ..."
         Deputy Director Zhou exclaimed.
         "You young people are still the best."
         "You must be joking, director," Li Hao said gloomily."I'm not young either. I'm almost 70."
         "You must be joking."
         Deputy Director Zhou laughed as he continued to walk forward,""Young man, I can tell from his voice. He's not that old. Are you joking with me?"
         Li Hao did not say anything.
         Deputy Director Zhou said as he walked,"don't think that escorting me is a bad thing. It's not a bad thing. It's a good thing. It was a coincidence tonight. You are really lucky."
         Li Hao was suspicious and wary.
         Could it be that he tricked me into a place with no one around and then suddenly exploded like Hong Yitang to kill me?
         In any case, he felt that it wasn't quite right for Wang Ming to suddenly appear in the middle of the night when he just happened to be looking for him.
         At this moment, Li Hao was extremely vigilant.
          Deputy Director Zhou smiled as he walked,"young man, you are kind. Kindness will be rewarded. Just don't make bad friends next time."
         Li Hao was startled. What did he mean?
         In front, Deputy Director Zhou continued to walk,""Fortunately, it was me who came out. If I was a little later, it would have been Huang Yu or someone else ... You would have been in trouble."
         Li Hao became even more vigilant. He didn't even dare to continue moving forward.
         Deputy Director Zhou turned around and smiled as he waved,""Follow me. You're so brave, but you're a coward now?"
         At this moment, Li Hao was certain that he had been recognized.
         He followed, but did not say anything.
         "You shouldn't befriend people like Wang Ming," Deputy Director Zhou said as they walked."They're too stupid and will easily drag you down. In the middle of the night, he went to ask all sorts of questions, investigate all sorts of information, and even went to the confidential room to check files ... If it wasn't for his grandfather, he would have been dragged away and sent directly to the prison!"
         "Everyone was curious about who this guy was collecting information for, or if he was selling information to make some money ... And then you came to him. If I didn't come out, Huang Yu would have come out and killed you."
         At this moment, Li Hao was speechless.
        
         Old Wang...You...Are really a F * cking idiot!
         I told you to gather information, but you went to the confidential room to check the files. Aren't you telling others that you want to check confidential information?
         Are you an idiot?
         Of course, Li Hao knew that old Wang had no other choice.
         He was grounded, so he didn't know any secrets.
         He had no choice. He wanted to earn money and fulfill Li Hao's wish to help him figure out the situation. He probably felt that even if he was discovered, his grandfather's presence was not an important secret, so it would not be a big problem.
         He didn't expect that Li Hao would come to find him so openly ... He was caught red-handed.
         Some of the big shots in the camp were actually paying attention to the matter and wanted to see who Wang Ming was checking the information for. The most likely candidate was Li Hao, but he still hadn't returned.
         They had just learned that someone was looking for Wang Ming when Li Hao was called away.
         Li Hao didn't say anything.
          After thinking for a while, he felt that the old man was exaggerating. No matter what, commander Yu wouldn't stab him to death without asking. When he found out that he was Li Hao, he wouldn't kill him.
         He was just selling a fake favor!
         Li Hao dared to appear in public not because he was afraid of his identity being exposed. He just didn't expect that it would be exposed so quickly. Old Wang, that idiot, was wasting his time.
         "Director, You must be joking!"
         Li Hao said gloomily,"I was asked by someone to see Wang Ming. I didn't do anything. Moreover, I'm from the Wei Wu Army. Why would commander Yu want to kill me without distinguishing between right and wrong?" Even if you want to kill him, you'll have to ask Minister hou's opinion ... So, director, don't scare me. "
         Old man, who are you trying to scare?
         You're scaring me in the middle of the night and doing me a favor. From what you're saying, you must have something to tell me.
         Deputy Director Zhou laughed.
         He continued walking. At this moment, he was walking towards a bright place. As he walked, he said,""I came out at night because I really have something to do. Do you know what's in front?"
         "The transverse Canyon."
         Nonsense!
         Director Zhou was also speechless. This kid was better at talking nonsense than him.
         "I mean, do you know which Force's camp it is?"
         "I don't know,"
         Li Hao looked forward and saw a huge ball of light. It was sunguang!
         With Xuguang, he was definitely not a nobody.
         However, he really didn't know who these people were.  "You need to meet him."
         "He's from the military, but he didn't reveal his identity. Do you know the name of the military's superpower organization?"the old man said as he walked.
         "I know, the star Army!"
         Li Hao knew about this. Wang Ming had told him about it back then.
         The inspection Office was the first to set up a supernatural organization, the night patrollers.
         Then, there was the inspector from the Division of Administration, the star Army from the military law Division, and the business protection and security Committee from the Division of Commerce ...
         On the side of the nine divisions, as the night patrollers were too powerful, they stopped supplying the night patrollers with superpowers. Instead, they formed their own superpower organizations. At first, they had no choice but to quickly establish their own night patrollers to gain a firm foothold. Now that they had a firm foothold, they were powerful as they occupied the core of the dynasty. They quickly strengthened their own superpower organizations.
         "Yes, it's the star Army,"
         The old man continued to walk with Li Hao.""These are people from the Heavenly Star Army. They've come from the central region and are also here for heaven battling city. However, the star Army hasn't revealed their identity to the public yet, but they reported it to the administration Bureau. They mean that it's more convenient to do things in the dark and in the open. "
         "This time, the star Army has 10 people. One of them is Xu Guang, and the other nine are three suns. They are extremely powerful and are from the military. They also have some sense of cooperation and are not ordinary three suns Xu Guang."
         Li Hao listened in silence, but he was curious. What does this have to do with me?
         The old man continued,"some situations are very complicated. I called you out to meet the star Army because I hope that you won't get involved. As a member of the eight great families, don't be used as a gun."
         As expected!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao was now completely sure that this person had recognized him!
         "This time, the leader of the Heavenly Star Army is an early stage rising sun Expert who just advanced to the rising sun realm at the end of last month. It is reasonable to say that the other party has just advanced to the rising sun realm, so his realm isn't too stable and he shouldn't participate in this kind of thing. We all know that in heaven battling city, if one's realm isn't stable, it's easy for something to happen, but the other party is an early stage rising sun Expert. Do you think there's any problem?"
         Li Hao thought for a moment."I think so. Maybe he has a special identity. Or maybe someone is trying to kill him on purpose."
          "Maybe both."
         Director Zhou smiled,"this person's name is Yuan xingwu."
         "Oh."
         Li Hao nodded and didn't pay much attention to it. But a moment later, he frowned.
         Yuan xingwu?
         Yuan ...
         Teacher?
         Was it related to her teacher?
         However, there were too many people with the same surname in the world, so he quickly stopped thinking about it. He didn't quite understand what this person meant, and he believed that since this person had called him, he should be able to explain clearly.
         As expected, seeing that Li Hao didn't seem to have any reaction, the old man had to say again,""Yuan xingwu, the first disciple of Yuan Shuo! Yuan Shuo did not accept any disciples in the early years and had always been alone. Until the rise of the supers, he was forced to hide in the Silver City. He stayed there for 15 years ... And 15 years ago, he accepted his first disciple, Yuan xingwu! "Not long after, he took in a second disciple. In the end, he took in a third disciple, Chen Yuhua. It was also the last disciple he said he would take in. He said that three was the limit, so three people were enough."
        
         "It wasn't until something happened to all three of his disciples that he stopped accepting any more disciples. Three years ago, he was severely injured. At that time, he was probably ambushed by the bronze puppet, which caused his heart to have some problems and destroyed his hope of advancing ... That was when he accepted his last disciple, hoping that he could pass on some of the ancient books that he had destroyed back then. Everyone was happy to see it happen, so as to prevent the knowledge in his head from really being taken to the earth."
         Yuan xingwu!
         Li Hao slightly frowned.
         15 years ago, he had become Yuan Shuo's disciple, and now, he was a rising light elite of the star Army.
         This was not important!
         Yes, it was not important at all.
         What was important was that Yuan xingwu was actually the one leading the team back to Silver Moon this time. Furthermore, he was representing the military's superpower organization, the star Army. If his identity were to be exposed at this time, it would mean a lot of things.
         Yuan Shuo's eldest disciple had returned!
         Everyone knew that hou Xiaochen had protected Yuan Shuo for many years, and everyone knew that Yuan Shuo had entered the spirit nurturing stage. His disciple had also entered the spirit nurturing stage after killing six third Suns a few days ago.
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Everyone knew that Li Hao was a descendant of the eight great families.
         Everyone knew that this heaven battling city might be the ancestral home of the Wang family, one of the eight great families.
         It was neither too early nor too late. At this moment, this person returned.
         And Chen Yuhua, Hu dingfang, the Bai family, the White Dragon Army, the imperial family ...
         There were thousands of links in this!
         The southern Fist had analyzed it for him before.
         Hu dingfang had the support of people in the Army, people above him, and people below him. The Bai family supported him, the Army supported him, and even commander Yu supported him. So Hu dingfang was promoted.
         Madam Bai's visit to Nan Quan might have something to do with the royal family.
         Now that Chen Yuhua and Yuan xingwu, the two senior and junior brothers and sisters, had gathered, Hu dingfang should know Yuan xingwu, right?
         Speaking of which, they could be considered a family.
         Because he had accepted Yuan xingwu as his disciple and Chen Yuhua as his disciple, the time gap between them was not long. The two of them should have studied under Yuan Shuo together. They might have known each other a long time ago and were very familiar with each other.
         Was there some connection between them?
         Would he be implicated?  No wonder the old man wanted to bring him here. But Li Hao still didn't quite understand what he meant.
         Deputy Director Zhou continued to walk, getting closer and closer. He continued, "Let's not talk about Yuan xingwu for now. Let's talk about heaven battling city. The information about heaven battling city is actually more than what you know. "
         "Heaven battling city is indeed the city of the Wang clan, one of the eight great families, or rather, the Wang clan's clan. The seal that the gold-tier warrior had was called the Black Tortoise seal. According to the records, it was not only a weapon, but also a token!"
         "It's the control hub of the entire city!"
         "With this, we might be able to control the entire heaven battling city. The weapons of the ancient people are actually very terrifying. This city might even be a part of the Black Tortoise seal, and not just a mere token."
         "As for the eight great families, it is said that during the ancient civilization period, they were of the same breath and branches. At a critical moment, if one family encountered a problem, the core disciples of the other families were qualified to hold the eight great families" tokens!"
         Li Hao frowned. A core token ... A sword, a saber, or something of the sort?
         His teacher could also use a saber. Of course, perhaps anyone who obtained the saber could use it. Could it be that his teacher was also one of the eight great families? or could it be that this saber was not truly used?
         At this moment, he was also confused by this person.
         Even though he had obtained some information, he was still unsure of what this person was going to say or do.
         "Director, I'm just a normal Wei Wu Army, I don't understand what you're saying."
         Director Zhou was speechless, after a while he said,"didn't you say that you are very smart?" "Forget it, then I'll just say it. This time, the others can choose not to enter heaven battling city, but you must go. Whether it's hou Xiaochen or Yuan xingwu, everyone who knows some secrets wants you to enter the inner city and even take the black Tortoise seal. Perhaps only you can take it!"
          "We know, the royal family might know, the nine divisions might know, and the three major organizations might know as well ... In other words, except for those without any background, everyone might know that you are the key!"
         "At this time, you are in a very safe and very dangerous situation! The safety is that before you get the Black Tortoise seal, no one will hurt you. The danger is that once you get the Black Tortoise seal ... It may be the time of your death. If you get it, it may mean that you have unsealed the Black Tortoise seal and it may recognize you as its master again or it may no longer have any destructive power ..."
         Li Hao didn't speak.
         What did this mean?
         What's your purpose?
         "Actually, I don't have any other intentions. You might know my grandson, Zhou Qin, the one who raises Tigers ... I'm just reminding you of some things. You and Yuan Shuo are both very sentimental, but don't let these things affect your judgment."
         "Second, don't rashly take the black Tortoise seal. Remember, don't be greedy!"
         Deputy Director Zhou said in a serious tone,"the Black Tortoise seal appearing at this moment is not a good thing. Furthermore, the appearance of heaven battling city is also not a good thing!" Once heaven battling city appears, it means that some problems will quickly erupt, and it might even lead to some huge trouble ... Silver moon's internal department isn't completely United, and it's not that we're enemies, but that there are some ideological differences!"
         "Also, the ancient ruins of the eight great families actually represent eight seals. Once one of them is unsealed, the others may also be affected, and some ancient existences may even descend again ... It may be a good thing, but it may also be a disaster!"
        
         "The secret of heaven battling city is not as simple as it seems, it is much more complicated!"
         Li Hao couldn't suppress his confusion and shock. He said in a low voice,""Director, how do you know all this?"
         "Ancient books."
         Deputy Director Zhou said softly,"many people know about it. Not just us, many people know about it but they pretend not to know." Let's put it this way, including the appearance of superpowers 20 years ago, actually ... Superpowers appeared a few years earlier, and they erupted from the Silver Moon. The Silver Moon is the origin of superpowers!"
         "Outsiders think that superpowers start to appear in the central continent. My ass, superpowers start to appear from the Silver Moon continent. Otherwise, do you think Ying Hongyue and the others could quickly become superpowers before the people in the central continent?"
         "However, all the mysterious energy that erupted on Silver moon's side was instantly absorbed by a mysterious existence or a seal. This caused Silver Moon to become a huge superpower barren land!"
         "Ying Hongyue knows. In fact, he also contributed to the explosion of superpowers back then. At that time, a group of people went to explore a ruin and broke something, which led to an unforeseen event. Those people are now experts from various places!"
         Deputy Director Zhou sighed."These people are Ying Hongyue from the three major organizations. Yama King from Yama. Flying sword immortal from the fairy realm. The commander of the Wei Wu Army. The master of one of the seven divine mountains, Haotian mountain ..."
         "Today, they are all existences that dominate a region!"
          Li Hao was dumbstruck. These people ... Were they all in cahoots?
         Or could it be that they just knew each other? by coincidence, these people explored a relic, which led to a superpower outbreak, so they knew about it in advance and made preparations. This was the reason for the rise of the three major organizations?
         p This was the first time he had heard of the seven divine mountains.  Also, who was the commander of the Wei Wu Army?
         Hahaha, ogres, sickbed ghosts ... He really didn't know who the great commander was. The people of the martial world only knew that there were three great commanders.
         Li Hao had never expected that the Silver Moon would be the source of his superpower!
         The other party continued,"remember, once the seal of heaven battling city is broken, there will be two possibilities. First, the superpower will erupt again and rapidly spread a large amount of mysterious energy, causing the entire star dynasty to rise again. It might even allow countless people to break through quickly and become the next stage of existence! Second, disaster!"
         "No matter what, even the first possibility is a disaster. At this stage, it's not a good thing to suddenly activate the second stage of the superpowers and have a large number of supers appear."
         Li Hao was shocked."Who ... Are you?""Who are you?"
         Was this person really just a Deputy Director?
         "Me?"
         Deputy Director Zhou smiled."Don't worry, I have no ill intentions towards you. It's not just me. The general Administration also has no ill intentions towards you. It's not just me, director Zhao also has no ill intentions. I'm telling you this because I hope you can understand ... Don't be fooled by others. "
         "Minister hou?"
         Li Hao frowned."Minister hou is bent on getting the Black Tortoise seal. Does that mean that Minister hou is trying to set me up?"  "That's not it. It's just that hou Xiaochen's quite ambitious. It's normal for him to have his own thoughts. He even wants to use this opportunity to reach a new level. He doesn't want to be like us, always living like this ... So in recent years, hou Xiaochen has been the most active in Silver Moon. "
         Li Hao cursed in his heart ten thousand times!
         What the hell?
         Did this mean that the internal conflict within Silver Moon was actually centered on hou Xiaochen and the director?
         So, their fall out earlier was not an act, but a real clash of ideas?
         Right now, Deputy Director Zhou was speaking to him on behalf of the Bureau. Was it because he didn't want him to help hou Xiaochen get the Black Tortoise seal?
         It definitely was!
         No wonder this old man insisted on coming out in the middle of the night to tell him all this. He was trying to move him with reason and emotion so that he wouldn't be used as a gun ... But who knew that the one using him as a gun wasn't the director?
         If he believed it, there would definitely be some estrangement between him and hou Xiaochen. If he could take it but not help, there might be some problems. Who knew if he was just trying to harm hou Xiaochen?
         Li Hao cursed in his heart!
         Damn it, none of them were good people, looking for trouble in the middle of the night.
         However, these words did shake Li Hao a little. Li Hao might have some ideas. This might be the result that this person wanted. And this person might be representing director Zhao.
          Also, Yuan xingwu had returned and he specifically told him. Was he trying to make him ignore Yuan xingwu or was he suspecting Yuan xingwu?
         At this moment, Li Hao had a headache.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Very quickly, he suppressed all of this ... And did not care anymore!
         He'd decided that if Nan Quan and Hong Yitang both entered, he'd follow them this time. As for hou Xiaochen and the others ... He'd put that aside for now. Nan Quan and Hong Yitang were also strong, and he'd saved them once. They didn't help last time, so there was a high chance they wouldn 't.
         And knowing that he could help them suppress it, they would put more effort into protecting him.
         Li Hao cursed in his heart."Don't try to fool me. I'm with two experts. At the critical moment, I'll let old Hong unleash his power. Hong Yitang might even be stronger than hou Xiaochen."
         At that time, I'll kill all of you one by one!
         Well, if hou Xiaochen didn't try to trick him, then he wouldn't kill him.
         After all, that person had truly protected him and his teacher. There was no need to be hostile and split up because of someone he wasn't familiar with.
        
         Thinking of this, Li Hao felt much more relaxed.
         I have two backers!
         I found it myself, or the new kind, you don't know, right?
         The two of them knew that he could help them suppress it. Every time he suppressed it, he could also help them strengthen the seal. The next time he asked them to unseal the seal, as long as he had enough divine power stones, the two of them would probably be more than happy to do so!
         Seeing that Li Hao didn't say anything, Deputy Director Zhou was speechless.
         This kid could really keep his composure!
         A moment later, they arrived at their destination.
         At this moment, an extremely dignified middle-aged man walked out. He looked to be about 40 years old. If this person was Yuan xingwu, it meant that his master, Yuan Shuo, was probably more than 20 years old.
         It was not a young age to become a disciple in his 20s.
         Li Hao was only 18 years old when he became her disciple.
          No, in fact, he was not even 18 years old, but he felt that he was not young. Was Yuan xingwu even 40 years old?
         Li Hao thought, but he didn't say anything.
         Was he wrong?
         However, this person was indeed at the sunguang level.
         In fact, he was not wrong. Yuan xingwu looked a little older, but his age was not much different from Li Hao's expectations. He was 38 years old this year, and Yuan Shuo was his master at the age of 23. However, at that time, Yuan xingwu had some Foundation in martial arts, unlike Li Hao, who was a pure newcomer.
         This could not be considered as having joined a master with skills, because the 23-year-old Yuan xingwu had not yet entered the ten decapitation realm. In that era, superpowers had just risen, and it was still very difficult to become a Martial Master. To be able to enter the ten decapitation realm in his twenties through pure hard work was not too bad.
         On the other hand, Yuan Shuo was only prepared to lay low for a short period of time. He did not expect that he would stay for more than ten years.
         As for the surname 'Yuan', it was given by Yuan Shuo. Yuan xingwu had lost his parents in the early years and was a natural star of death. He was despised when he was young until Yuan Shuo took him in. He did not have an official name yet. Later on, he followed Yuan Shuo's surname 'Yuan' and even xingwu was given a name by Yuan Shuo.
         This name had a deep meaning.
         At that time, martial arts was already on the decline, so he had some unique ideas for giving his first disciple this name.
         Li Hao observed Yuan xingwu through the black banner.
         He had never heard his teacher mention this person.
         Chen Yuhua had actually mentioned it a few times.
         This person had reached the level of rising light, which meant that he had been a superpower for a few years. Li Hao frowned slightly, but didn't think too much about it.
         Everyone had their own path. It was not necessarily a good thing to persist in martial arts during that period. Even Yuan Shuo was stuck at the 100-plus mark, let alone the others. Even an old Martial Master like Sky sword had chosen to become a super, so it was not a mistake to become a super.
         In fact, Yuan Shuo did not object to becoming a superpower. For example, Li Hao. Yuan Shuo did not object to it at first. Even he himself was prepared to become a superpower while he was still a warrior of the Qian family. Later, he felt that it was inappropriate and gave up on this path. He also warned Li Hao not to become one.  As he was thinking, the man spoke,""Director Zhou, if there's anything you need, just call me."
         "It's fine, just take it as training!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Deputy Director Zhou laughed and said, "I've come to see general Yuan because I have some things to discuss with him. I represent the general Administration and would like to have a few words with general Yuan. "
         "Please!"
         Yuan xingwu didn't say anything and just invited him in. Deputy Director Zhou entered the tent. Just as Li Hao was about to enter, he was stopped by a three suns expert. Director Zhou saw this and smiled,"This is the Wei Wu Army that will protect me ..."
         "This is Minister hou's subordinate, right?" Yuan xingwu frowned slightly.
         A person from the general Administration bringing the Wei Wu Army as guards ... What was going on!
         Moreover, the person she was meeting was him.
         "It's fine. The Wei Wu Army has a complicated background. Not everyone is loyal to hou Xiaochen. He is the descendant of my friend. We have always been on good terms."
         Yuan xingwu didn't say anything more. He gestured to the people blocking the way, and Li Hao was allowed to enter.
         He actually didn't care if he came in or not, but since he was already here, he could just listen.
         ……
         After entering the tent, there was a whole new world inside, and it was very spacious.
         Deputy Director Zhou sat opposite of him. Li Hao stood behind director Zhou and didn't say a word.
         Deputy Director Zhou was also very direct and went straight to the point,"This time, I'm here on behalf of director Zhao to ask you three questions. As long as general yuan can give me an accurate answer, the director, including commander Yu, will not have any objections."
          "Please speak!"
         "First, did the star Army come to stop hou Xiaochen from taking the black Tortoise seal?"
         Yuan xingwu frowned and nodded after a moment,""Yes! This is not my idea, but an order from my superior. As a member of the military, the star Army must carry out military orders. "
         "Alright!"
         Director Zhou laughed and continued,"Second, if we can get the Black Tortoise seal, will the star Army take it away?"
         "That's right. If we can take it, then we'll take it. Because if we can take it, it means that the Black Tortoise seal is just a pure origin divine weapon!"
         The other party didn't deny it and admitted it very readily.
         "Third, this time, orange moon and yellow moon might give up on chasing Yuan Shuo and come here. If we meet them in the ruins, will the star Army kill them ... Of course, the chances are slim."
         Yuan xingwu said in a deep voice,"if the situation permits, I will!" However, if the situation doesn't allow for it, and if I attack, it will cause the deaths of all my brothers ... I won't take the risk with the lives of these brothers!"
         "Director Zhou finished asking and smiled," okay, I understand. By the way, if you don't mind, general Yuan, are you willing to answer a question I've asked you?"
