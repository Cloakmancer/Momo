Kong Ji was also depressed.He was known as a genius everywhere, but in the end, the illusory figure actually didn't take a fancy to him. Were time cultivators very powerful?Was it special?Was it very awesome?Alright, it was indeed quite special and awesome.He was helpless!It was rare for the three cultivators of the two extremes to be despised by others one day.Under normal circumstances, cultivators of the two extremes were already highly sought after.Li Hao smiled and didn't say anything.If he continued, Kong Ji would start to shut himself up.After all, he was a cultivator who had reached the 6999th square, but the shadow didn't give him any face."Let's go!"Li Hao said,"if we don't leave now, Wushan will be anxious.""We're going out like this?""If we go out now, aren't we afraid of being targeted?" Kong Ji was suspicious."I'm fine!"Li Hao laughed."Since senior Wushan is here, do you think he'll let others spy on us so easily?"That's right.Kong Ji didn't say much.The two of them walked out of the hall and went straight to the outside world. As for borrowing power, they only had one minute, so they were not in a hurry.As for Li Hao borrowing the power for one minute, what else could he do other than open the great Dao universe ... It was almost impossible for him to kill another level Seven with the power of a level Seven, and it was hard to guess Kong Ji's intentions.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Outside the dark Demon Ridge.Wu Shan was still wrangling with the experts from all directions.In the next moment, Wu Shan's heart moved. He had come out.He was finally out!These two bastards had stayed in there for a full seven days. One must know that these seven days were very difficult to endure.If these two didn't come out, he would really run away. no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  Letting out a sigh of relief, Wu Shan's powerful aura became even more powerful as it swept in all directions. His voice was cold and shook the world."Get lost! If you don't have the confidence to kill me, you'll be dreaming if you think you can take over the dark Devil Ridge!"This was a warning and also a message.Tell those two guys that if they still didn't come out, someone was already preparing to kill me. Moreover, they wanted to take over the dark Devil Ridge, and the chess piece seemed to be in the dark Devil Ridge.As for whether these two could understand ... If they couldn 't, they would be idiots, and they deserved to die.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Li Hao and the others clearly understood."It looks like the situation isn't good," Kong Ji said."I shouldn't have gone into seclusion for seven days. The current situation ... I'm afraid all the experts in Tian Fang are paying attention to this side.""It's better with more people. It'll be more lively with more people, and we'll have an opportunity to take advantage!"Li Hao wished that there were more people. It would be bad if there were fewer people.There were too few of them. If the Dao universe was suddenly entered by someone, wouldn't it be impossible to play?There are more people, you guys fight first."Senior Wushan!"Li Hao said telepathically. He wasn't afraid of being intercepted. Wasn't Wu Shan outside?"Leave immediately ... We'll talk later!"Wu Shan also quickly sent a message. Even though he had never met Li Hao before, he had at least communicated with him last time and knew that the person who had sent the message was the Silver Moon King. From his aura, he could tell that he was at the 4th rank, which was not bad. It was said that this person seemed to have killed a level 4 or even Level 5 cultivator at Red moon's side!As for the matter of him killing a Tier 6, it had yet to spread."Leave? No, I'm telling you that I'm here to fulfill my promise and open the Dao universe for you ...""Now?""Yes,"Wu Shan cursed in his heart!Beast!Opening a great Dao universe at this time?He immediately understood Li Hao's thoughts. He was surrounded by experts, and he was opening a Dao universe ... Damn it, are you sure I'll be the one going in?Also, the agreement was that Li Hao would open the Dao universe for him ... But there was no rule that it had to be when he was alone. Was this Li Hao taking advantage of a loophole?"Senior, don't worry! Silvermoon is still in the great path universe. Even if I don't care about senior, I won't let anyone in. If I did, wouldn't I be putting Silvermoon to death?"As soon as these words came out, Wu Shan sighed in relief.That's right.The Silvermoon world was still inside.Then why now?Now, wouldn't it be better for these two to quietly move away, wait for the people to disperse, or give up on the dark Demon Ridge, and then quietly enter? "When will it open?""Let's wait for a while!"Li Hao sent a voice transmission, senior, hold on for a while! In addition ... I need senior to help me with a small matter ...""What?""I'll open a small gate for tianfang universe. Senior can take the initiative and guard the gate! However ... You must at least guard until one person arrives. ""Red Moon sovereign?""Yes,"I f * cking knew it!Wushan cursed!Ëâπ!Is he crazy?If you open a small door and I guard it, the first ones to arrive will definitely be two level eight Masters, light and cloud, followed by red sun Supreme Emperor or Dragon Master. Whether red Moon master can come or not is also a problem.Even if they did, they would probably be the last.How long would it take for him to arrive?Do you think that those level 8 powerhouses are vegetarians?People would die!He would really die!"This is not part of the agreement!"Wu Shan was somewhat irascible. This wasn't the agreement at the beginning.He was not convinced!If that was the case, the danger he was in would increase greatly. It was too dangerous."As for the radiant master ... I'll try my best to get Kong Ji to inform him so that he can pester the cloud Master ... This has some benefits. Senior, if you leave the cloud Master, you'll have less trouble!"The Misty Mountain trembled. Silence ... The radiant sovereign!This ... Will it work?If the radiant sovereign was truly able to tie cloudsky down, then it would be a good opportunity for him to escape from the clouds."In addition ... I'll try my best to convince the human King to stop the other seventh rank venerable sovereigns with me. We'll buy more time and opportunities for you, senior!"

Chapter 2991 The East Has Arrived (2)
Would the human King listen to you?Wushan thought to himself,"besides, what's the use of you taking action?"You're a 4th rank, if you make a move, then it's better for Kong Ji to make a move."Senior, as long as we can hold out until Red Moon master arrives ... Even if you can't take down tianfang great cosmos this time, I'll give you another chance next time!" If Wushan didn't help and let the other level eights go in first, the great Dao universe would be sealed ... At that time, whether red Moon master would come or not would be a different matter.He had to hold on!They guarded the crack and didn't allow anyone to enter.Wu Shan quickly thought, weighing the pros and cons.It was very dangerous!Of course, if what Li Hao said was true, and the God of Light and the neo martial King could both withstand a wave of attacks ... Although the danger was great, it was not impossible to consider."However, will the radiant God give up on entering the great Dao universe because of his son? This is the hope of the other side reaching the ninth step ... Who do you think is more important, the ninth step or your son?"What if the radiant sovereign didn't act according to plan?Wouldn't that be the end of it?"I'll try my best. If there's really no way ... Then seniors and the others can enter the Dao universe together. I didn't say that we have to persist until we die!"Wu Shan thought for a moment and sent a voice transmission,"okay ... There's one more thing. If it's possible, let venerable sovereign Qi Shui come here alone ... I want to kill this woman!" We'll take her great Dao universe, take her energy, and repay it to Yunxiao!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùYou still have such thoughts at this time?Li Hao was speechless, but after thinking for a while, he smiled. It was not bad to have some principles.Since Wu Shan still had such thoughts, it meant that he was someone with a bottom line. As for whether it would work, it was hard to say. Li Hao didn't know Supreme Emperor Qi Shui, but it didn't prevent him from understanding the meaning of the Dao universe.The master of a seventh-rank great Dao!It was actually very, very difficult for a non-master of the great Dao like you to kill such an expert!It took a lot of effort for the human King to kill the Master of Darkness.Without the right time, it would be very difficult."Alright, I'll try ..."Since Wu Shan was willing to agree and bear the responsibility, that was fine. As for the rest, it was up to him.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Li Hao looked at Kong Ji with some doubt."Will your father ... Agree?"To tell the truth, he felt that Wu Shan's worry was reasonable.If he lost his son, he could have another one.Moreover, Kong Ji was not gone. He was still here, and it was not a life-threatening crisis. Would his father give up the opportunity to enter the great path universe just because of his words?To deal with the Lord of the clouds?Was that even possible?"I'm fine, don't worry!"Kong Ji was confident.Alright, since you're so confident, I have nothing to say."Then how do you contact them?""Just wait. If my father is near Tian Fang, it'll be easy to contact him. If he's not ... Then we'll think of another way."At this moment, Kong Ji had found some confidence. Look, no matter how powerful you are in the Dao of time, my father is at the eighth step!Where's your father?The neo martial human King isn't your father. Even if he is ... He isn't an eighth-grade.Kong Ji didn't waste any time. He led Li Hao to an empty Hall and sat down. After some thought, he took out something from his Dao mark that looked like the source of light.After a moment of stirring, the light source flickered.Kong Ji waited and said,""The great world usually has some long-distance communication means, but it has to be closer. Otherwise ... We have to use large communication equipment. That way, the movement will be relatively big and may expose my father's location."Li Hao nodded. It was a good item.He was a little envious.Right now, I have no way of contacting those far away in the Crimson Moon. After entering the chaos, Li Hao discovered that communication is sometimes the key to restrictions. The lack of information is often caused by the communication process.It would be great if they could contact each other at will.After a while, an illusionary figure appeared above the light source. Its back was facing Li Hao, so he couldn't see it clearly.When the mysterious man saw Kong Ji, he heaved a sigh of relief. "It's good that you're fine. "He thought he had run away.It looked like they had returned to tianfang."Father!"Kong Ji was much more obedient. At this moment, he said solemnly,""Father, I need your help with something.""Help?""Yes,""What's the matter?""I'm encouraging Wushan Imperial master to leave the clouds as soon as possible. This is the bait to open the tianfang great path universe. It's a good time for father to kill Imperial master Yunxiao. It won't come again. Whether father can restrain his desire to enter the great path universe and kill Imperial master Yunxiao ... Is the key!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùEven Li Hao was stunned. no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  You ... You're so good at talking!'I'm encouraging Wushan Supreme Emperor to leave Yunxiao and create an opportunity for radiance Supreme Emperor to kill Yunxiao ...'Was it an opportunity?Actually, it could be considered so!The radiance Thearch was also slightly stunned."You ... Incited Wu Shan? At the cost of opening the tianfang great Dao universe?"What was he saying?"Right!""Father, do you think I can't do it?" Kong Ji nodded."Yes, I am!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao pretended not to hear him. He felt a little awkward. This ... Don't you know that there are outsiders here?You're not giving me any face with your words.It's fine if father and son talk about it in private, but now, you're saying it in front of my friend. Don't you want to save face?Kong Ji was speechless and said,""I'm afraid father doesn't know that I've already reached the sixth step! "Not only that, but today, I cultivate life and death, Nirvana recovery, light and darkness ... This time, I'm also planning for my breakthrough to tier 7. I've already convinced many people, including the neo martial human King, to create an opportunity for me!"

Chapter 2992 The East Has Arrived (3)
"Father, you can't be worse than an outsider, right?""Who?" the radiant sovereign was stunned."Neo martial human King!" no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  "You?""Yes!""Do you have the ability to do so?""Father ..."Kong Ji was a little angry!He was a little displeased,"I'm friends with the Silver Moon King! Father should know about this!""Oh, I understand. The Silver Moon King convinced the neo Martial Emperor? That heaven's side universe ... In that case, could it be related to the Silvermoon King? Or was it related to the new martial artist human King? My stupid son, you wouldn't have been tricked by neo martial arts, right?"Kong Ji was completely speechless.Where was this?How could that be!Why does my father not trust me?He was a little unhappy. He was lonely and not someone who lived off his parents, so why was he not trusted by his father?The radiant sovereign let out a sigh. "Although you're quite talented, and you're devoted to the Dao, and you've seen a lot, compared to those people, you're still lacking in one thing ... You're an unscrupulous person!" You've been under my protection since you were young, and tianfang is the place you've gone the furthest you've ever been. Even in tianfang, you've had people protecting you, and no one dares to touch you. ""Whether it's neo martial or Silver Moon, they're all rising up in the market. When you deal with these people, even if you're not younger than them, or even older ... I don't trust them, and I don't trust you either! "What you said is also a little taken for granted. People like Wu Shan and the neo martial human King are rare talents. Will they be easily persuaded by you? They must have their own plans ..."As expected of a veteran powerhouse, he could still see very clearly.He knew his own son very well.Of course, he was talented, but ... In terms of experience, he might not be as good as the young Li Hao. After all, Li Hao had fought his way out of a small world, but his son, even if he had walked out of the light, was actually under his protection.Simply put, he was too shallow!The radiant sovereign suspected that his son had been used.At this moment, Kong Ji frowned slightly. He was a little unhappy. Some people were gentle and had good tempers outside, but in front of their parents, they always wanted to prove themselves and say that they had grown up.The empty silence was no exception.At this moment, he was a little unhappy.""Father, I'm not a child anymore. The me in your memory might still be the me from five hundred years ago! I've grown up, and I've done many things that you might not even dare to imagine! I joined hands with the sword Saint and the Silver Moon King to kill Xing Shen. I was one of the three main forces, so I was very important!""I killed a large number of venerable sovereigns in Senlan. I killed two sixth level venerable sovereigns at the same time, both of whom were direct descendants of Hongyue!""I'm already at rank 6. Not only that, I've also walked the path of the two extremes, and it's not just one ... I'm confident that I can reach rank 7 on my own! 'Father, I'm not the same person from 500 years ago who chose to leave the light and wander the chaos just for the sake of vindication!' I am Kong Ji, but now, I am no longer a nobody in the primordial chaos!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe radiant sovereign was silent for a moment. He killed Xing Shen, he killed a Tier 6 ...Have you grown up?Perhaps. In his eyes, his son was too young and immature. However, just as Kong Ji had said, he had done many things that he had never dared to imagine. He had become a dual extreme Emperor and killed a rank seven ..."Everything you've said and done today, was it because someone taught you?" the radiant God asked.Kong Ji was dissatisfied,'why do we need people to teach us? I'm a thousand years old, not a child anymore!""Only a thousand years old ..."The radiant sovereign let out an emotional sigh. Only a thousand? he was like a child.It was too small.His tone was as if his child had just come out of the cradle. In fact, it was almost the same for him.He was too old.Kong Ji couldn't hold it in any longer."Neo Martial Emperor, around 1200 years old. Silver Moon King, around 20 years old ... Father, I'm a thousand years old!""You're different from them. They don't have a powerful father ... But you do!"Kong Ji didn't want to talk about this anymore and was a little annoyed."Then, will father agree?""Since my son has said so ..."The radiant sovereign considered it for a moment, then said calmly,""Then I'll agree! However...If anyone dares to use this to plot against my son, the divine light plane will naturally seek revenge!"These words were obviously not meant for Kong Ji.He seemed to know that there was someone beside Kong Ji, and that he was talking to Li Hao.On the side, Li Hao shrugged.I'm not afraid of this threat.In addition, contacting the radiant sovereign wasn't his idea. It was Voidwalker's own idea.Kong Ji, on the other hand, obviously felt that he had lost face in front of his friends. Outside, he was a gentle and refined top-notch venerable sovereign who was proficient in the great Dao. However, when he contacted his father, he seemed to be a young child in his father's mouth.It was too embarrassing!"Father, when I reach the seventh rank, or even the eighth rank ... You should understand that I'm no longer the ignorant child you think I am!" Kong Ji sighed."Maybe!"The radiant sovereign laughed.Even if you've reached the ninth step ... Are you going to be my father?What a joke!If he wasn't a child, could he be an ancestor?Kong Ji took in a deep breath. He clearly understood and gritted his teeth. "That's it then. Also, be careful of the new martial artist human King. He might not attack you, but ... He needs the Yang Qi! That's all ..."He was going to hang up.His father's words made him lose face.The radiant sovereign didn't say anything. Just as the void was about to hang up, he said,""Come back earlier. I've been out for so many years and have been training here and there. If I haven't reached level eight, I might as well come back earlier and try to take over the light. Even if I don't die so early ... It's still better than being outside."

Chapter 2993 The East Has Arrived (1)_4
"I know!"Kong Ji didn't want to say anything more and quickly hung up the communication.Then, he glanced at Li Hao and said, somewhat embarrassed,""My father ...""That's normal. No matter how big a child is, he's still a child! As parents, I always feel that my child hasn't grown up ..."Li Hao laughed, feeling a little sad. He quickly said,""In the past, I also felt that when I grew up, my parents would also treat me like a child and nag at me ... At that time, I was so sick of it!"In the end ... He didn't have the chance to get tired of it.The radiant sovereign had been acting like a father. He wasn't as emotionless as he'd imagined.Li Hao couldn't help but laugh."In our Silver Moon, there were some rumors circulating in the past. Under normal circumstances, light is a villain and a heartless person ... But in the end, when it comes to you, your father seems to be not bad."Kong Ji smiled.Suddenly, he sighed."Novels and myths are all based on facts ... They can't come out of thin air. In many people's eyes, whether it's light, darkness, the Crimson Moon, or the clouds ... Which of these macro worlds isn't sinful for them to grow to this day?" Who didn't have hands full of blood? "What you see might not be right. As far as I know, there are many small worlds that have the legend of the radiant sovereign. His notoriety is very well-known ... In fact, it's all the same. The neo martial human King is not bad in your eyes, but in some small worlds in the chaos, some realm Lords are afraid of him. A few years later, his notoriety will also be notorious."Li Hao was stunned for a moment before he nodded.That's right!"So, it's settled?" Li Hao said with a smile."Yes,"Kong Ji also put down these and laughed. "I've settled my father, can you settle the human King?"The human King was not that easy to talk to."Don't worry, it's just a word. When he comes out, there won't be a problem!"Li Hao had traveled to neo martial arts and understood human King, so it wasn't a big problem.When he appeared, he only needed to say one sentence,"find a seventh-rank opportunity for teacher Changsheng." That was enough.The human King was actually true to his emotions and nature.Even if he had to give up the tianfang great path universe and let the longevity Swordmaster reach Level Seven, he would not have any objections.This was the human King!Therefore, there was no need to communicate in advance. As long as he revealed his identity, the human King would naturally know what to do."Then it's settled ... It's just ... There are too many tier 7 now ...""It's useless even if there are many of them! These people are not the main force and will only follow the trend! Once Red Moon Lord arrives ... It'll be best if you can send them all into tianfang universe ... Even if you can 't, you have to make them fight ... It'll be easier for us to act!"Li Hao calculated.At this point, it could be said that the plan was only lacking the finishing touches. They had paid such a huge price, spent several months, given up many benefits, and even used the tianfang universe as bait ...It could be said that he had used everything that could be used.If the plan still fails, then the heavens are no longer on my side. It was no exaggeration to say that Li Hao would feel that he had suffered a loss if the harvest of the Crimson Moon this time was less than three billion great Dao crystals!He had killed so many venerable sovereigns, including a large number of level six venerable sovereigns. He had given up on Senlan, a world of great Dao that was within his reach. He had even taken the initiative to help the Senlan realm Lord, at the cost of many conditions of the Dao chess.If you don't give me a harvest of more than 3 billion, then I'll suffer a huge loss!Three billion great Dao crystals, about 30 medium-level worlds, or 300 small worlds ... This calculation was actually very difficult, but at this point, he could only take a gamble. He was betting that the great Dao crystals stored in the Crimson Moon great Dao universe and the worlds were enough.After all, the other party had destroyed many worlds, including great worlds. They had always been known for their invasion!This was an aggressive world, not a peaceful one.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Outside the Dragon Temple.The two sides were still wrangling.At this moment, Wu Shan wasn't in a hurry. He was very calm.There were more and more venerable sovereigns in the outside world.Venerable sovereigns appeared in all directions, and even ... Some people could vaguely sense the emergence of some eighth-order wills, which belonged to the radiant master. This time, even if the cloud Master was not prepared to descend his will, he had no choice but to do so.,m They were ready to descend at any time!In the dark, the human King was also watching the show.He had guessed that the Silver Moon King might have arrived here, but ... So what if he had?Did Wu Shan and that little fellow work together?The situation was very complicated.The human King made some guesses ... However, he had yet to guess that the other party's target was the Crimson Moon world. It was mainly an eighth-order world, which was too far away for the Silver Moon King.If it was a Tier 6 great world that was inferior to Senlan, he would have guessed it more accurately.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the world barrier. Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã  Lizhu was also thinking. Now, everything was in place. The only thing missing was a fuse ... And the most critical, most important thing was the tianfang universe.If tianfang cosmos didn't appear, there wouldn't be a fight.However, once tianfang universe appeared, the entire tianfang universe would be in a chaotic battle!A chaotic battle was his chance.In fact, he wanted to make a fake one ... Unfortunately, it was not easy to make a fake one in the great Dao universe. Otherwise, according to his personality or the human King's personality, they would choose to make a fake one to trick these venerable sovereigns.Other than seventh level venerable sovereigns, there were also many middle-stage venerable sovereigns gathered outside the Hui long temple. Some were there to cheer for the great world, some were there to watch the show, and some were there to take advantage of the situation ...

Chapter 2994 The East Has Arrived (1)_ 5
There were many venerable sovereigns in tianfang.Just the southern region alone had dozens of venerable sovereigns, and they were the permanent ones. Including the idle ones, there were nearly a hundred venerable sovereigns in the southern region.In the entire tianfang world, there were many more venerable sovereigns than Senlan.Hundreds of venerable sovereigns! As for existences at the level of Heavenly Kings, there were countless of them!At this moment, other than the venerable sovereigns, there were also some Heavenly Kings gathered. Those who dared to gather at this moment were a group of bold people, and some even had other thoughts ... The venerable sovereigns had fallen!As soon as the venerable sovereign died, the great Dao dissipated, and the power of the great Dao overflowed. For the Heavenly Kings, the venerable sovereign's Dao was extremely powerful. Even if they only picked up a little bit of it, it would be enough for them to eat their fill.Who didn't want to become a venerable sovereign?Usually, it was very difficult for venerable sovereigns to die.Even if they died, most of them would still be in the chaos.Even if it wasn't in the chaos, in a world of the great path with a master, it would be absorbed by the Masters of the great path and wouldn't overflow. However, tianfang had no master, and tianfang's great path universe wouldn't absorb the power of the great path.Once a venerable sovereign died here and no one was able to absorb the energy, the power of a venerable sovereign would dissipate.This was a great opportunity for many people.Last time, Li Hao had scattered the power of many venerable sovereigns 'great DAOs, which had helped many experts. As a result, a large number of Saints and Heavenly Kings had emerged on the Tian Fang side.Now, there were more than a hundred venerable sovereigns gathered in the area of the Dragon return temple.Once a war broke out, it would be a chaotic battle between Level Seven and level eight. It was normal for low-level venerable sovereigns to die. During the war, if the other party did not have time to absorb the power of the great Dao, it would be an opportunity.So what if they knew it was dangerous?Only with danger would there be opportunities!As a result, many cultivators at the periphery, including some of Li Hao's acquaintances, were eyeing the surroundings, as if they were waiting for an opportunity.Yuan Shuo sensed a few familiar auras, but he didn't care.It was too dangerous for everyone to stay together, so it was better to go separate ways.At this moment, he also felt that the opportunity had come.At this time, Yuan Shuo was also very clear that ... All that was missing was a fuse. Everyone was talking big now, and once tianfang universe opened, a war would break out ... But he also knew that tianfang universe seemed to only be opened by Li Hao.He wasn't sure if Li Hao had returned.If they did, Li Hao would definitely open it!This was a rare opportunity!Fishing in troubled waters was also what Li Hao wanted to do.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Everyone was waiting. As for the Crimson Moon world, the Crimson Moon master had also been paying attention to it.He didn't waste any time while he was paying attention to these things. He didn't stay idle either. He waited for movements near Tian Fang while contacting several powerhouses through some means.The experts from the three large fields nearby.On a giant screen, Red Moon master looked more carefree than before. At this moment, she smiled gently.""I think the kanwu Alliance still exists! "Now, the neo martial human King is in Tian Fang, but the homeland of neo martial is missing ... Neo martial is a malignant tumor!""I have the intention to go to Tian Fang and kill the neo martial artist King ... Unfortunately, I'm in trouble."He sighed."I'm sure you all know what happened before. In one day, three of my Red moon's seventh-tier Masters died, causing the red moon's internal department to be empty. Even though I knew that the neo martial human King was in Tian Fang, I couldn't leave ... I have to be prepared!"The rank seven venerable sovereigns only listened and did not say much.Not only was he worried about neo martial's sneak attack, but he was also worried about the three families.Red Moon master continued,"today, because of what Wu Shan did, everyone knows that Tian Fang's side is ready to make a move! I have an idea, I wonder if you guys are interested ...""Fellow Daoist Red Moon, just say it."Red Moon sovereign thought for a while and said slowly,""I want to launch a surprise attack on the neo martial King ... And I may not be able to kill him alone. Therefore, I want you to come with me and suddenly descend to tianfang. With the strength of one tier 8 and four tier 7, a mere neo martial King will die without a doubt!"Conquering the three worlds?Why!Alliance, then let's form an alliance.Now that he had set his mind on Tian Fang, even though there were two level 7s in the realm ... What if there were any changes? Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã  In that case, I'll take these Level 7s with me. Not only can they become my helpers, but they can also reduce the pressure on Hong Yue!Two birds with one stone!The realm Lord of the heavenly waves world frowned slightly."Descend to tianfang?""Right!"Red Moon master smiled and said,"aren't you interested?" The type 9 world is about to recover. Don't you have any thoughts about it? If there is ... Then it's just right!""Daoist Red Moon, you must be joking. The recovery of a rank nine world has nothing to do with us rank seven ..."Red Moon sovereign shook his head."It's hard to say. Sometimes, it depends on fate, luck, and the great Dao. Otherwise, why are there so many rank seven masters there?""The problem is that we can't take the great world with us if we go now," Dark Moon master said in a deep voice."If something goes wrong and we can't make it back in time, we'll be in trouble!"You, Hong Yue, have two rank-7s, so you're not afraid, but we can 't.For example, Yue Ming was the only Level Seven. Once he left, it would be very troublesome if someone attacked the great world.Red Moon master laughed."There are three major worlds. Consider Red Moon. With AI Hong and Sen LAN in charge, as long as it's not an eighth-tier attack, it won't be so easy to break through a major world!"The others, however, were deep in thought.

Tian Fang, are you interested?Of course!However, they didn't believe the red moon Lord's words completely. What they were afraid of was that before the others could do anything, you, Red Moon, would lead us away and attack us. Two seventh-rank Masters were enough, but before we could return, our home would be gone!Without a base, even if the other party could not take away the Dao universe, the Dao universe would wither and become dispirited after losing billions of people's Dao cultivators ... If there were not enough opportunities, even if one still had a Dao universe, it might wither very quickly and become an itinerant cultivator.Red Moon master also knew that they might not trust her.But at this moment, taking them away was the best choice!Not only would Hong Yue be safe, but he would also take away several venerable sovereigns. When he went out, he would not be worried even if he was attacked by neo martial."You ..." Red Moon master said again,"I understand your fears and concerns ...""Since we have the intention to form an alliance, we need to have some trust!" At this moment, he seemed very sincere.""Since you don't trust me, then form an alliance of the great Dao! If the Alliance is broken, then chaos lightning will descend and destroy the daosource .... If you still can't trust the Alliance ... Then there's no point in this Alliance!"The few of them were stunned. Chaos Pact!There was, of course, such a thing. If it was destroyed, then with the daosource as the foundation, the source of the great Dao universe ... A chaos lightning tribulation would truly descend.Dark Moon master's heart stirred."The Treaty ... Is not impossible. The conditions are simple. No one in the Crimson Moon world is to make things difficult for the three worlds or attack anyone from the three worlds ... Once the Treaty is broken, you will be struck by lightning ..."Red Moon master laughed," There are billions of living beings in the great world, and I can't control everyone ... Let's set the seventh-rank as the limit! Of course, Hong Yue and I ... The three of us can be counted in the Alliance. The same goes for you! Furthermore, there is a time limit ... Let's make it a hundred year agreement!"What a joke, everyone in the great world?If any one of you attacks you, won't I be struck by lightning? I can be struck thousands or tens of thousands of times a day ... And I'll be dead!Three advanced venerable sovereigns were the limit.Moreover, there was a time limit.Of course, the establishment of this treaty was very beneficial to him. That was, there were only three level Seven venerable sovereigns and above, but it would be difficult for other worlds to produce new level Seven venerable sovereigns. As for Hong Yue ... She had a great chance!If they really fell out, the newly-born rank seven venerable sovereign would not be considered a breach of contract.He had also taken this into account.He would've made a move on the three worlds long ago if not for the inappropriate timing.What mutual non-invasion?What a joke!The law of the jungle!If the opportunity was right, why not just devour them?Since he thought of it, the other venerable sovereigns naturally thought of it as well. The master of cangjiang said,""If fellow Daoist Red Moon really wants to form an alliance, you can count in the few Tier 6 experts in your Red Moon territory!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùRed Moon master raised her eyebrows slightly."After all ..." Blue River master said calmly."Now that Red Moon has fused with forest orchid, in my opinion, one or two more rank Sevens will be born soon. It's too difficult for our rank seven great world to produce another rank seven!"Everyone wasn't stupid!"Not only that," he added,"once Hong Yue breaks the contract, the eighth-grade lightning tribulation will be reduced. If we break the contract, the seventh-grade lightning tribulation will be reduced! Otherwise, if we don't clearly state the strength of the lightning tribulations, it'll be meaningless if they're all low-level lightning tribulations!"Red Moon master raised her eyebrows again.These guys, to be able to become world Lords, they were indeed not fools.If it was another day, he would not have agreed.However, today, he was very concerned about the changes in the situation in Tian Fang. In addition, the neo martial artist King was indeed his target. In order to leave the Crimson Moon as soon as possible and leave as he pleased ...Perhaps, it was necessary to give in. He hesitated for a moment before nodding,"sure!" In addition, if tianfang universe is really going to open ... All of you must leave with me. ""Then the local neo martial ...""Don't worry!"Red Moon master laughed."They're not nearby. If they were, they would have attacked long ago. Last time was the best chance!" They missed the last chance and wanted to attack us. They have to pay a huge price!"The other party must not be nearby."Besides, if we can leave at the critical moment, we can come back. It's not like we can't return!" He laughed.If he could go, he could naturally return.Unless he was entangled by someone.However, even if the neo martial artists had a plan, could a neo martial human King hold them all back?What a joke!If neo martial had this strength, they would have come head-on long ago."Then ... That's it!"The venerable sovereigns thought about it and nodded. This wasn't a bad thing. It was a formal Alliance. It was already rare for the other party to even limit their own strength!Before this, Hong Yue had not taken the initiative to mention the great Dao Alliance, obviously because she felt that he was powerful. It was only a verbal Alliance, and she would not set too many restrictions on him.But now, it was clearly because of the death of the three tier 7 experts and the turmoil in Tian Fang that this person took the initiative to compromise.Soon, the four universes signed a great Dao covenant under the foundation of the great Dao and the witness of the chaos lightning tribulation!The three worlds also began to move toward the Crimson Moon.The distance was getting closer and closer!Venerable the sword, who was hiding in the void, grumbled inwardly.How could he be so close?This was big trouble!Even if Li Hao succeeded, when he returned, there would be six stage seven experts, including Supreme Emperor Senlan ... He would be in deep trouble!They had paid a huge price to ambush Red Moon.This is terrible!Venerable the sword was helpless. He was in big trouble.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, the Senlan sector Lord and King Huai were both stunned.Huai King didn't know the details, and as one of the contestants, sector Lord Sen LAN was helpless!This ... Was he preparing to give away the three great worlds as well?From the looks of it, if the red moon Lord left, the experts from the three worlds would follow ... He just didn't know if the Silver Moon King had made any arrangements for Tian Fang. If the four tier 7 experts here left and went to Tian Fang, perhaps ... There would be big trouble.Of course, if he didn't care about Tian Fang and brought these people away, the four worlds would be together ... The key was that apart from himself, there was only AI Hong ... This ... Might really be a super fat piece of meat!"Tian Fang...Is about to activate, right?"He murmured in his heart. This time, he didn't know if he was going to eat meat or ... Fall into a pit!Once Red Moon master took four of the 7th rank helpers, the entire sky universe would be eaten by him. Silver Moon King, be careful not to go for wool and come home shorn. In the end, you would suffer heavy losses and gain nothing! Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã  After all, the addition of four level 7s was beyond everyone's expectations. And at this moment, he had no way to send a message to Li Hao, as he didn't have any contact information at all!He could only look at the heavens!

Chapter 2996 The East Doesn't Light Up, The West Does
The Skylands world.Time slowly passed.Li Hao had also come out of his hiding place. In the area of the Dragon returning temple, a large number of cultivators were hiding. No one dared to come out and face the pressure of so many venerable sovereigns.This place was getting more and more terrifying.Li Hao raised his head and looked at the sky.Beside him, Kong Ji was also slightly nervous. The opening of the tianfang path was bound to be an explosive fuse. Although they were hidden in the dark, it did not mean that it would be safe to open it this time.He turned around and was slightly stunned.Some changes occurred to Li Hao's body, and a weak sword intent appeared on his body. Supreme Sword?He impersonated the sword Saint in an instant?He turned around and thought ... Perhaps it wasn't a bad thing. It wasn't a surprise that venerable the sword had run away from the Crimson Moon and come here. After all, the Crimson Moon wasn't too far away from this place. Li Hao and Kong Ji both flew back. Since venerable the sword was so powerful, he would naturally come here.Li Hao looked around. He couldn't see the other venerable sovereigns, but he could sense their auras.Soon, Li Hao's eyes locked onto an expert at the back."Return to the Dragon!"This guy had isolated himself from the world several times in the dark Demon Ridge. Huilong had even organized a small team to hunt venerable the sword. Although they had returned without success in the end, when venerable the sword appeared, without a Crimson Moon expert, he would choose his opponent first and kill him ... This was in line with venerable the sword's personality.Since he was going to open a Dao universe ... Killing a level six and offering a flag was a must.Was a wandering cultivator like Huilong very strong?He used to think that he was very strong, but after killing the Rogue cultivator Yu Xiu, he was just so-so. Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã  It had been two years since he entered the chaos, and he didn't have many enemies except for the red moon. This time, the Dragon Emperor ... Was one of them."Wait a moment, I'll kill Hui long first to open up the stage for everyone!"Li Hao smiled and looked at Kong Ji."Brother Kong Ji, the only thing you need to do now is to create a Nirvana world for me in a place where no one is around and destroy the teleportation fluctuations. As for the rest ... I don't need your help here."Kong Ji nodded and didn't try to be brave.In addition, his father was also in the vicinity. It wouldn't be very good for him to reveal himself, as it would be very easy for others to mistake it for the attitude of the divine light plane.Obliterating the fluctuations of teleportation was not an easy task.Although it could be done in the Nirvana realm, the range was limited. Moreover, there were many venerable sovereigns now, so it was easy to be exposed. This was actually very dangerous."Then I'll head over first ... And try to avoid the southern region ...""Alright," he said.Kong Ji didn't say anything more and left quickly. With the power of Nirvana, his ability to conceal himself was quite strong. Now, most of the venerable sovereigns were focused on Wu Shan, and few people would pay attention to the other cultivators in the Dragon field.Li Hao, on the other hand, disappeared in a flash. Almost all of them in the innermost circle were rank seven venerable sovereigns.The grade-6 ones were all at the outer area.The return Dragon Emperor was not far from the deep sea Supreme Emperor.Li Hao had killed almost all the venerable sovereigns in the Hui long temple. Now, there was only one fifth-rank venerable sovereign and two fourth-rank venerable sovereigns around the Hui long temple. This was the number of venerable sovereigns in the Hui long temple, and they were of good quality.Li Hao walked toward the outside at a fast speed.Some of the venerable sovereigns who had been staring at Wu Shan noticed Li Hao. Some were slightly confused. Who would be so bold as to wander around while Level Seven venerable sovereigns were confronting each other?Li Hao didn't try to hide it. For a seventh-rank, if he did, he would appear sneaky.It was easy to be targeted.At this moment, it was more convenient to leave in an open and aboveboard manner.Seeing that someone's aura seemed to have locked onto him, Li Hao ignored it and retreated to the periphery. Seeing this, some people gave up on observing. Perhaps the wandering venerable sovereigns in the Dragon Temple area had sensed the danger and wanted to leave early.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, the Dragon Emperor was still talking to the people around him."This sovereign Wushan ... Sigh ... Of all the places he could occupy, he occupied Huilong temple. In this situation, if a fight really broke out, Huilong temple would be gone!"Emperor Hui long was helpless.,m Recently, he had a bad feeling.In the past two years, the strength of Huilong temple had increased greatly, and the number of venerable sovereigns under their command had increased. Kong Ji had reached level five and recruited many venerable sovereigns from The Dark World and the surrounding venerable sovereigns.As a result, Kong Ji ran away in the blink of an eye, and the other venerable sovereigns in Huilong temple were all killed.It was not easy to wait for the high-level venerable sovereigns from the cloud world to send reinforcements. In the blink of an eye, Wu mountain seemed to be breaking away from the clouds. It was not over here, but these people were going to fight again in the territory of the Dragon returning temple.Once the high-level battle started, there was a high chance that Huilong temple would be gone.After so many years of hard work, the power that was built up was gone in the blink of an eye.As for advancing to rank 7 in Tian Fang ... It seemed like it was just an illusion. The previous rank 7 and rank 8 Masters did not come to Tian Fang, so they thought that they did not care about it. Good Lord, they all came at the slightest movement.At this time, in front of him, the deep sea venerable sovereign transmitted a message,""Huilong, don't be idle! I think a venerable sovereign has come out of the Dragon Temple ... Wushan didn't stop him. Go and ask what's going on with Wushan and whether there's any change in the dark Demon Ridge!"As a seventh rank venerable sovereign, he didn't have to do these trivial things himself. He could just return to the Dragon."Damn it!" Venerable Emperor Hui long cursed in his heart."I'm a sixth rank venerable Emperor after all. You're really not giving me any face."Speaking of which, were there any other venerable sovereigns in the Dragon Temple area?How come I didn't know?After all, he was the nominal master of the Huilong temple, but he had been driven away by Wushan for some time. Did he enter through the southern realm gate?

Chapter 2997 The East Doesn't Light Up, But The West Does
At this time, there were still venerable sovereigns who dared to walk around here ... Those at the seventh rank, pretend I didn't say anything. Those below the seventh rank, they were really bold and tired of living.Once a battle broke out, anyone below grade 7 would be cannon fodder.Even though he cursed, Huilong still quickly transmitted his voice: "Okay, understood. I'll go immediately!"Deepsea did not reply to him.At this moment, he didn't have the mood to reply to this guy.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Venerable Emperor Hui long looked at the people around him and said,""Let's go and see who has come out of the Hui long temple. By the way ... Let's stay away from here. We'll follow them when they're far away."It was pretty good!Being too close to the seventh-rank circle was actually quite stressful. If it were not for the deep sea venerable sovereign in front of him, he would not have wanted to get close to this side at all. The pressure of those seventh-rank beasts made him uncomfortable.At this moment, he was not the only one. The other parties had also received some orders.Some venerable sovereigns walked out of the Huilong temple.Judging from his aura ... He might be a middle-stage venerable sovereign. Of course, Li Hao had concealed it, so it wasn't too obvious. However, for a seventh-stage venerable sovereign, it was possible to tell if he was an advanced venerable sovereign with just a glance.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Li Hao didn't move quickly. He was still wondering if there would be an advanced venerable sovereign to stop him. It turned out that advanced venerable sovereigns wouldn't attack easily at this stage, in case of misunderstandings and a fight.It was not until he left the circle of Level Seven cultivators that Li Hao sensed that venerable sovereigns were approaching him from all directions.He could even sense the aura of the Dragon returning Emperor.What a coincidence!Li Hao continued to move forward. After a while, the void fluctuated, and several venerable sovereigns arrived. Some of them looked at Li Hao. There was a weak sword intent on Li Hao, but his appearance was not worth much.The venerable sovereign who was blocking the way was about to speak when he frowned slightly.In an instant.Huilong and the others arrived.Huilong also looked at the venerable sovereigns around him. Some of them had shown their faces, while some of them had not. He raised his eyebrows slightly and smiled."Everyone, this is Hui long temple's territory after all ... The situation inside Hui long temple is still unclear. Since this fellow Daoist has come out, I would like to have a chat with him first ... This is also Lord Deepsea's intention!"He wasn't interested in getting into a conflict with these people. He just had to use his identity as a level-eight great path universe and suppress them directly.Then, he looked at Li Hao and smiled."Fellow Daoist, I'm Hui long! Fellow Daoist just came out of the Huilong temple, and I've neglected you and didn't welcome you. Now, the Huilong area is a little complicated ... Is it convenient for fellow Daoist to have a chat?"As he said that, he sized up Li Hao, feeling a little confused.This person ... Have I seen him before? It wasn't a matter of appearance. It was a weak and familiar aura.After all, he had met Li Hao before. Li Hao was a sixth rank Supreme Emperor. Even if Li Hao had changed a little, it was not to the extent of changing his origin. To him, they had met before. Although he could not recognize him at first glance, he felt that he had seen this person before.Of course, he had lived for a long time, so it was normal for him to have seen some venerable sovereigns.Li Hao looked at him, exhaled, and nodded.""Yes! I also sensed the pressure from Hui long temple, so I wanted to leave as soon as possible. I've long heard of fellow Daoist Hui Long's name. In fact, I've met you a few years ago, but ... I'm afraid you've forgotten your sixth-tier power. ""I said that fellow Daoist seemed familiar!"Venerable Emperor Hui long followed the cue and laughed. It wasn't a courtesy, and they were indeed familiar.Since the other party was willing to have a good talk, that was for the best.He had always been a smooth person. At this moment, he was also smiling at people. It was best if he didn't fall out with them."This fellow Daoist has agreed to it ... If there's anything you want to know, you can invite him to talk after I'm done talking with you ..." Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã  Around them, some people didn't say anything, while others were a little dissatisfied.However, Huilong was a sixth level venerable sovereign after all, and he had Yunxiao behind him, so no one stopped him.Li Hao heard the voices of some venerable sovereigns.They were quite polite and only invited Li Hao for a chat. After all, he was only a venerable sovereign from the Huilong District, not from Wushan. He might not know anything, and there was no need to make things too unpleasant for a middle-stage venerable sovereign.Li Hao replied to them one by one.He took another look at Huilong ... What a coincidence.He rose into the air and headed straight for Hui long Emperor. Hui long had always felt that he had really met Li Hao before. At this moment, he smiled."May I ask how I should address you, fellow Daoist? You and I might have met before ... But as fellow Daoist knows, it might not be convenient to get to know each other in the chaos ...""I understand!""Just call me annihilating Dragon!" Li Hao laughed.‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe Supreme Emperor frowned slightly, and Li Hao explained,""Fellow Daoist, please don't misunderstand ... In my realm, the dragon clan is a threat, so ... This is also a title given by the people of my realm. I actually don't want to tell anyone, but it's not convenient for me to lie today, in case everyone thinks that I'm hiding something. Therefore, I'm only being honest with you. If I've offended you, I'm really sorry. ""It's fine!" Although Supreme Emperor Hui long didn't want to hear it, this was his name ... Even the dragon clan didn't find trouble with him, so why would he?They were both middle-stage venerable sovereigns, although the other party seemed to be only at the fourth stage.Li Hao, on the other hand, saw that he didn't say anything and took him far away from the battle. He smiled.

Chapter 2998 The East Doesn't Light Up, The West Does
How could he be so cooperative?Was he afraid that he would be too close to a tier 7 and it would be inconvenient for him to make a move?After flying for a while, he returned to the venerable Dragon Emperor to take a look. There was still a long way to go before he could reach the seventh rank."Back at the Dragon Temple, there are too many Level 7s, and the atmosphere is too depressing. I have no other purpose in inviting you here. I just want to ask how the situation in the temple is now and if there are any changes in the dark Demon Ridge ... The outside world is saying that the opening of tianfang universe may be related to the dark Demon Ridge."Li Hao didn't reply. He looked around and asked,""Fellow Daoist Huilong, I heard that the neo martial human King has also arrived at tianfang. Fellow Daoist Huilong, you seemed to have organized a team to kill the neo martial Swordmaster. The neo martial human King is vengeful and didn't cause you any trouble?"The Emperor frowned.What did that mean?It's all ancient history!Besides, I didn't go, did I?Revenge on what?Whether the human King knew about it or not was a question.Was this guy deliberately looking for trouble?He was slightly unhappy!Moreover, he was also afraid of people mentioning this. Back then, the human King was not here, so he was naturally not afraid of new martial artists. But now the human King was here and had killed a seventh-rank, so he was quite afraid of others mentioning the past, in case the human King heard it and suddenly attacked him.He was about to say something when his expression suddenly changed.The aura of the person opposite him seemed to have become much stronger in an instant. At this moment, Li Hao did not waste any time. The Supreme Emperor Hui long was just a minor character, and a single sentence was enough to provoke him ... Killing Hui long was the start, and the death of a stage six expert to cause a huge explosion was more in line with his identity ... No, his identity as a Supreme Sword.Hui long Emperor's expression changed slightly, as if he had sensed something.The other party was clearly only at the 4th rank, but in an instant, his aura seemed to have become much stronger.His expression changed drastically, and he turned around to escape.He cursed in his heart!He had really seen a ghost!Was every venerable sovereign they met a hidden expert?Where did so many experts come from these days?Moreover, he had a rank eight world behind him. How could he find out that anyone dared to bully him? he was the Lord of cloud sky's rank eight world. Was his deterrence not enough?The commotion had attracted the attention of some venerable sovereigns in the distance.Someone's will approached the powerful venerable sovereigns in an instant. The deep sea venerable sovereign turned his head quickly and was a little angry.Who was it?The next moment, a giant sword appeared in the air.Venerable Emperor Hui long, who was running away, changed his expression as he felt a bone-piercing cold.‚Äã Who was it?Could it be ... Sword Saint?'How is this possible ...'Just as he was thinking, a cold laugh resounded in all directions,""Didn't you want to kill me? I'll fulfill your wish!""You dare!"On the other side, the deep sea venerable sovereign shouted with anger. This is ... The new martial Swordmaster?Why was he here?Didn't they say that he was in the Crimson Moon region not long ago? Of course, he had left a long time ago and it was normal for him to rush here. However, the neo martial Swordmaster had walked out of the Dragon Temple area ... Did this mean that Wushan and neo martial had really joined forces?There was the human King in the past, and there was the sword venerable behind, which confirmed the collusion between Wushan and new martial.That powerful sword essence instantly burst out!At this moment, Li Hao began to borrow the power of the chess piece. The chess piece's body was nearby, which was convenient. Moreover, it was alive, which made it even more convenient. Besides, Li Hao was not afraid of a sixth level venerable sovereign.Even if he didn't borrow strength, he wasn't afraid of Huilong.  Best novel online free at ùöó0ùöüùöéùöïùöãùöíùöó  Borrowing force was only for the sake of being faster.The longevity sword will appeared along with the longevity sword. Although the core was different, how could outsiders see anything?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, in the world barrier.Someone's gaze instantly gathered on him. The human King frowned slightly. Who would dare to impersonate old man Li?The next moment, he realized something and raised his eyebrows slightly.The new king of the Silver Moon?The imitation is somewhat similar, but ... To impersonate in front of me ... Forget it, old man Li has stayed in the Silver Moon world for many years. Who knows if the new king of the Silver Moon is one of his descendants? who knows if old man Li has an illegitimate son or something.The human King was just a little curious ... Impersonating old man Li to kill a sixth-tier ... Did this sixth-tier bear a deep grudge against you?His strength seemed to be not bad!However, this power seemed to be ... A little weak.Of course, the instantaneous outburst was even close to the seventh rank. With such strength, even if old man Li said that he had never seen or fought a revered sword artist, he would still believe it.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"It's starting!"On the other side of the regional wall, Li Zhu let out a breath. A good show was about to start.This Silver Moon King didn't seem to be a good person either. After waiting for a few days, the key to the chaos had finally arrived.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Back to the Dragon Temple.Sovereign Wushan's eyes flickered. Was it about to start?This Silver Moon King was really vengeful!This time, it was said that long had a slight grudge with the other party before, but this guy was good. He took a life the moment he made a move!Just as everyone was having different reactions.The sword light fell at an extremely fast speed.As the sword intent burst out, a powerful force swept in all directions. The venerable Emperor was shocked. If it was the sword Saint ... He knew that he would not be able to match him. He felt a powerful sword intent burst out from his back.He roared, and it was as if a giant dragon had really appeared on his body!He wasn't a Dragon, but he had cultivated a Dragon physical technique, which made his body extremely strong. A Golden Dragon rose up behind him and roared at the sky. A powerful force burst out instantly!"Lord Deepsea!""Kill!" The Dragon Emperor roared.He was still cursing in his heart. How unlucky. There was a group of Grade 7s here and you still dared to attack?

Chapter 2999 The East Doesn't Light Up, The West Does
This is crazy!"Die!"The sword fell, and the powerful sword intent directly cut the Golden Dragon into pieces with a loud bang. This scene shocked some of the venerable sovereigns who had not arrived in time.After all, it was the strongest cultivation technique of a rank six venerable sovereign, so its defensive power was still extremely strong.In the end, it was destroyed by a sword venerable, who was also at the sixth rank!It was said that venerable sword had fought with a rank seven and even caused the death of awakening God Emperor. It might not be false.What a powerful sword!On the other side, the deep sea venerable sovereign instantly disappeared from his original spot. As he moved through the void, a touch of anger burst out in his eyes.At this moment, a miserable shriek reverberated through the sky!With a slash of his sword, a sword domain appeared!It directly destroyed the Golden Dragon and instantly shrouded the Hui long Emperor. The Emperor was so terrified that he did not have the chance to fight back. The sword fell and with a loud bang, his body was crushed!Dao marks appeared!It was also a little Golden Dragon. Many people were surprised. Even the Dao marks were in the shape of a Golden Dragon. Could the venerable Dragon Emperor be related to the Dragon field?They didn't have much time to think.There was a loud bang!A sixth stage venerable sovereign was completely destroyed by a single sword in an instant. His Dao marks were shattered and the sword domain swept across. Everything disappeared. Apart from a crack in the air, nothing was left!Li Hao didn't waste any time. He turned around and slashed!The fifth rank and two fourth rank venerable sovereigns, who were fleeing, felt the danger of death at the same time. On the other side, the deep sea venerable sovereign was furious."You still dare to kill?""You're too noisy!"Li Hao snorted and unleashed his sword domain, which instantly enveloped the three of them.The sword swept across!"Ah!"The three venerable sovereigns were cut in half at the waist and their Dao marks were devoured by the sword realm!This scene happened too quickly.It was so fast that many people felt it was strange ... The venerable sword suddenly appeared and killed people without any warning ... Why?Even if he wanted to kill the Dragon, why did he have to choose this time?At this moment, Li Hao shouted,""What are you waiting for? let's kill Deepsea! I can sense that my rank 7 opportunity is about to arrive!"‚Äã What?Just as some people were puzzled, suddenly, someone looked up at the sky and his expression changed slightly."The great Dao universe ...""What's the situation?""Why is it suddenly opening ..."The series of changes had left many people in a daze, and Li Hao's attack was sudden.At this moment, in the stronghold, the young man king raised his eyebrows slightly.Little guy ... You're talking to me. A seventh-rank opportunity ... Was it real or fake?It wasn't li Hao himself, but venerable the sword!He knew that Li Hao must be representing the sword venerable, and he was pretending to be the sword venerable.Of course, it didn't matter!In that moment, he laughed. Interesting. This guy's appearance had thrown the situation into chaos. And even more interesting ... The power of time seemed to have borrowed some power that didn't belong to him.It was very powerful ... But it was also very superficial.It probably wouldn't last long.At this moment, he didn't care about the great path universe in the sky. Only an illusory image had appeared in the great path universe and had yet to open. Although it attracted the attention of many people, the human King didn't even look at it!Deep ocean ... Clouds ...He did not know that the cloud world and the Crimson Moon had worked together. He had heard about it, but he had not been in the mood to pay attention to it. He did not expect that this guy would ask him to kill Deepsea ... Interesting!"Slash!"The blade fell directly from the wall of the world!The powerful saber intent instantly changed the expression of the deep sea Supreme Emperor, who was about to reach him. In front of him, Li Hao's Dao domain also spread out, and he slashed out with his sword. The powerful sword intent instantly changed the expression of the deep sea Supreme Emperor!Damn it!How could he have forgotten about the human King?No matter how strong the sword Saint was, he was not afraid. But the human King ... He had killed more than one grade seven human King.His expression changed as he tried to escape into the air, trying to avoid the blade. However, the extremely powerful and boundless blade intent in the sky had locked onto him, making his expression change instantly. He was somewhat unable to escape!Was this the saber of a human King?The entire world seemed to have turned into a yin-yang millstone. A Taiji seemed to have appeared around him, locking him in place. He had been wondering why human Kings could kill a rank seven with a single strike!  Best novel online free at ùöó0ùöüùöéùöïùöãùöíùöó  Today, he finally understood!That was because ... The Dao of Yin Yang, the human King's saber, was not just a simple saber Dao. There was also the Dao of Yin Yang.
