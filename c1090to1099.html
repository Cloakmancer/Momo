        the metamorphosis stage, not the early stage of the rising light realm.
        His palm had been pierced by a spear!
        This hou Xiaochen ... Had he been hiding his true strength, or had he only recently improved?
        He glanced at the early stage rising light realm cultivator who had been killed, then looked at the Academy's powerhouses who were silent like cicadas in winter. He sighed and turned to leave.
        After this incident, tenseng Academy had lost all its prestige.
        As expected, it would not work to imitate the martial arts universities of the ancient civilization.
        There were too many students, too many instructors, too few experts, and everyone was afraid of death ... It was different.
        ……
        At the same time.
        On the coast of the East Sea.
         Yuan Shuo looked at the waves in the distance and smiled. He held the stone saber and flew toward the middle of the bridge.
        With such a huge commotion, they could more or less sense it.
        Little Li Hao, can you sense it?
        Even if you don 't, Xu Qing should know the news. Xu Qing, will you come?
        Or ... Will the experts under your command come?
        In the next moment, he was like a cannonball, heavily smashing forward!
        The saber cut through the sky and cut off the few experts who were escaping from the waves. Their blood splattered across the East Sea.
        ……
        "Bastard!"
        Xu Qing suddenly roared in anger!
        In that instant, he had received many messages.
        The eastsea bridge had been blown up, the eastsea Pirates had suffered heavy losses, the Duke's residence in stellarsky city had been ransacked, his brother had been killed by hou Xiaochen, and the inspection Office had sent a notice to the dynasty, directly demoting the Duke of dingguo from a rank to a Marquis of dingguo!
        In this world, there was still a need for righteousness and status.
        Because he was disobedient and fired the city-destroying bombs randomly without permission, there was a crisis of being baptized by the city-destroying bombs in all directions. If he didn't kill the chicken to warn the monkeys, the others would soon follow suit.
        That would be a complete mess!
        The demotion of a rank did not affect his strength, but to the Duke of dingguo, the loss was greater than anything else. He gritted his teeth and roared,"How dare you!"
        Is that guy from the inspection Office crazy?
        He actually dared to demote the Duke's rank!
        More importantly, the royal family had agreed to it, and so had the other eight divisions. Clearly, they felt that he had made a bad start and could not allow him to do so.
        "Damn it!"
        "F * ck!" He cursed. He was a little annoyed. When he used the city-destroying bomb, he didn't think too much. Now, the price he had to pay was unimaginably heavy.
        He suppressed the anger in his heart and looked into the distance. There was still a small black dot.
        Li Hao was running further and further away.
        He was constantly bothered by these trivial matters, and Li Hao left him further and further behind.
        Silver moon's bastards ... They've all gone mad!
        Yes, Xu Qing felt that they were sick.
        It was Li Hao who had come first, and it was Li Hao who had attacked the high Duke dingguo's public house first. These Silver Moon lunatics had actually initiated a war against his public house for another lunatic!
        At this moment, he gritted his teeth. The only way to calm this matter was to kill Li Hao as soon as possible.
        People were worthless when they died.
        Wasn't Silver Moon bent on protecting him?
        No, I'm going to kill him!  Otherwise, all the losses and sacrifices would be a waste.
        He grunted and his qi and blood surged. The next moment, his aura became even stronger. He swallowed a drop of the spring of life into his stomach. He was a little reluctant. Even he didn't have much of the spring of life.
        Every time it devoured, it was a waste of life.
        However, he had to end the battle as soon as possible!
        The five viscera Super Lock was slightly unlocked. With a powerful aura, he instantly traveled through space and chased after Li Hao. He couldn't let Li Hao escape so unscrupulously.
        If this continued, he would lose them.
        ……
        In front of him, Li Hao's expression changed.
        Looking back, Duke dingguo, who had been completely left behind, seemed to have accelerated again at this moment.
        Li Hao gasped for breath and cursed in his heart!
        This old fellow seemed to have really unsealed a little. Was he crazy?
        Be careful not to overload. If even the spring of life could not suppress it, then all their previous efforts would be in vain.
        According to Li Hao's judgment, a person like Xu Qing wouldn't dare to unseal the seal easily. Now, it was once again beyond his expectations ...
        "He must have been forced into a corner ... And wanted to kill me as soon as possible ..."
        He judged that perhaps someone was forcing this guy to go crazy.
        Who was it?
        Silver moon's men?
        Only silver moon's men could do that.
        Those old fogeys were truly capable. They could threaten Xu Qing even from such a distance.
        But ... Li Hao secretly groaned."But, you guys are forcing him so hard that he's going crazy. If it's a little later, I'll have a chance to get rid of him. At that time, Xu Qing might not be in a hurry, so he won't go crazy too early."
        "You've screwed me over. The timing you guys grasped is wrong!"
        Li Hao secretly groaned!
        Silver Moon must have been secretly making his move. He understood that, but the timing was not right. It was too early, and I had yet to reach the ocean.
        When I'm close to the ocean, you can use your strength. I have a high chance of escaping.
        They had no choice. The distance was too far, and those people could not get first-hand information. They could only follow their judgment.
        At this moment, Li Hao gritted his teeth. His blood and Qi surged, and he swallowed the sword, including the starry sky sword. He circulated the five birds breathing technique to the extreme, and countless sword energy entered his body. With a Swoosh, Li Hao accelerated again and traversed the void.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Xu Qing cursed from behind!
        It could still explode?
        What the hell is this Li Hao?
        In front of him, Li Hao's face was pale, but he was grinning.
         And you're even more surprised!
        The SuperLock on his heart was already full. Li Hao tried to break it a little, but it was very difficult. He had no choice but to use his sword force to hit the powerful SuperLock ... I'll cut it in half and see if it can burst. If it can, I'll speed it up!
        I'm going to anger you to death, you old bastard!
        At this time, Li Hao was flying toward the east Ocean Bridge. He didn't hear the huge explosion, but he felt a wave of energy erupting and sweeping over.
        At this moment, with such a commotion in the East Ocean, Li Hao guessed that ... Reinforcements might have arrived.
        As for who would come to save him ... He wasn't sure. He would go and take a look first.
        The light sword wanted him to help her suppress the power of light. Hong Yitang wanted him to help her because she was a good person ... Probably?
        In any case, these were the only few who could escape.
        As for his teacher, Li Hao didn't really think about it. After his teacher entered the central continent, there was still news about him, but there hadn't been any news recently. He might have gone missing, taken the aquamarine light sword, or dug up a grave ... Who knew?
        Besides, his teacher was so weak that it was useless even if he came!
       
        The sound of panting continued.
        Li Hao tried his best to escape in the direction of the eastsea bridge.
        At the back, Xu Qing's expression was unsightly.
        At this moment, he had already unsealed himself slightly, but he was still unable to catch up with Li Hao. He looked in the direction that Li Hao had fled in with a gloomy expression.
        The East China Sea bridge collapsed from the explosion.
        Was there a problem at the East Coast, or was it something else? he hadn't received any news yet. Perhaps someone was at the East Coast, ready to rescue Li Hao.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com If he allowed Li Hao to meet up with them now, it might cause him a lot of trouble.
        At this point, he gritted his teeth and broke another superpower lock. Then, he swallowed two more drops of the spring of life. A stream of life force flowed into his five internal organs and circulated rapidly.
        However, it couldn't be repaired at this time. If it was repaired, it would be a waste.
        If he didn't repair it, he would feel the increasingly strong sense of being torn apart, and he would also feel a little afraid.
         In the end, he suppressed his fear and gritted his teeth. With a boom, his legs shot into the air like a rocket. In an instant, he crossed thousands of meters. With the sound of explosions, Xu Qing's speed was extremely fast.
        In front of him, Li Hao's expression also changed.
        This guy had really gone crazy.
        The so-called son of a rich family could not sit in the hall.
        You're not just a Martial Master, you're a Duke, a Big Shot. Why are you so desperate?
        Seeing that the other party was about to catch up, Li Hao gritted his teeth. Suddenly, a crystal root-like object appeared in his hand. He roared and threw it at Xu Qing.
        "Go to hell!"
        Xu Qing's pupils contracted!
        He stopped in his tracks for a moment, then stepped into the air and flew straight into the sky with a look of shock on his face. He had seen this thing kill Redbeard with one strike, and he had been on guard all this time.
        However, Li Hao had never used it before, so he had almost forgotten about it.
        Seeing Li Hao gnashing his teeth and wanting to kill him, Xu Qing did not dare to fight back. He was confident that he was much stronger than red beard, but even so, even if that thing could not kill him, it was inevitable that he would be seriously injured or break more super locks.
        He did not dare to.
        Therefore, he chose to avoid it at this moment.
        He knew that this thing would not last for long.
        One second, two seconds, three seconds ...
        Li Hao, who was in front, had already escaped in an instant, once again pulling apart the distance.
        In mid-air, the crystal root ... Floated and floated ... And then it smashed into the ground.
        Xu Qing was stunned.
        In the next moment, he looked at Li Hao, who was running away, with a fierce look in his eyes.
        You lied to me!
        Again and again, three times!
        "Li Hao!"
        Xu Qing was furious. With a boom, he stomped through the air and charged at Li Hao!
        'This bastard, does he really think I'm an idiot?'
        He had been deceived again and again.
         In front, Li Hao didn't bother to respond. Anyone would be scared to death.  Unfortunately, it was only useful for the first time.
        Of course, if he still had a real one, he could throw it out at this time. Perhaps it would have a miraculous effect. After being fooled once, the other party might not care about it the second time and directly attack him.
        Unfortunately, there was only one of this item left.
        Li Hao was somewhat regretful. He didn't know how powerful this thing was and had given it to Redbeard. Redbeard was only in the transformation stage and clearly didn't have the strength to unseal it. He shouldn't have paid attention to Redbeard back then.
        Unfortunately, he didn't expect the origin root to be so powerful that it could kill the red beard.
        Otherwise, he would have stayed behind to deal with Xu Qing.
        At that time, Li Hao thought that he could only deal with transcendents around the peak of the rising light Stage. He didn't even expect to kill red beard.
        "Li Hao! You can't escape!"
        Xu Qing's speed became faster and faster, his aura became stronger and stronger, and the fierceness in his eyes became heavier and heavier.
        The losses that Li Hao had caused him were simply unimaginable.
        If they did not kill Li Hao ... The high Duke's public house would not be able to make up for such a loss.
        He had just been fooled, and now the distance between them had increased again.
        Xu Qing closed the distance again.
        In front of them, Li Hao looked at the Black Panther that was being dragged and felt helpless. This dog was still bald. Should he lose the Black Panther?
        The Black Panther seemed to have sensed something. It looked at Li Hao innocently and pitifully.
        Li Hao chuckled.
        That's right, the fact that he could still smile at a time like this showed that he had a big heart and wasn't afraid at all. The fear he felt now wasn't as great as the fear he felt from the red shadow when he was a weak mortal.
        The day he broke his fear, he no longer feared these things.
        In the distance, he could already see the sea.
        He saw a bridge, a bridge that was spreading and collapsing.
        He also saw many soldiers.
        At this moment, there seemed to be something else aimed at him, but the threat was not so great. It might be a city-destroying bomb, but it seemed that the dingguo Army had no intention of firing.
        Behind him, Xu Qing naturally saw it too.
        There were still troops stationed in front of the city-destroying bomb, but he didn't order anyone to fire it this time.
         We can't fire anymore.
        If he continued firing, he might really cause a huge problem. The nine divisions, the imperial family, and the Silver Moon were all warning him, and the others were also hitting him when he was down. If he continued to fire townspeople without restraint, the East might be divided before Li Hao died.
        He looked into the distance at the collapsed bridge, but he didn't see anything.
        "Dingguo Army, stop Li Hao!" He shouted.
        In the distance.
        There weren't many troops stationed there, only about a thousand. At this moment, many of them were sweating and feeling a little scared.
        A sunguang was overseeing this place.
        There were also several three suns.
        Most of the remaining people were ordinary people, and they all carried guns.
        However, at this moment ... These people were all trembling.
       
        When the Duke dingguo's order came, the sunguang elite's forehead was covered in sweat. He had worked for the Duke dingguo's public house for many years, and he, Cheng Xuguang, was also supported by the Duke dingguo's public house. At this moment, he did not dare to resist the order.
        However, he knew how powerful the demonic sword was.
        He wasn't afraid of anything when the two generals were here. But now that they had left, he was left with only sunguang to guard this place ... He was truly afraid.
        With such fear in his mind, he thought about how Li Hao was also an arrow at the end of its flight. He had only been pestering him for a while, but the high Duke would soon catch up ... He felt a little more at ease.
        "Kill!"
        The general roared and soared into the sky with the other three suns, who were also terrified. They blocked Li Hao's way.
        Below, the soldiers were also shooting at the sky while trembling.
        In fact, the distance was very far, and it was impossible to hit anyone at this moment.
        They didn't have any city-destroying bombs, but they still had ordinary cannonballs, which were aimed at Li Hao!
        Li Hao, on the other hand, could vaguely sense that someone was coming.
         It was a special kind of tacit understanding.
        He looked into the distance and slightly raised his brows ... It wasn't Hong Yitang, because there was no information displayed in the silver Crystal, and the red dot seemed to be quite far away from him.
        It seemed ... It seemed to be of the same origin!
        Li Hao's heart moved, and he secretly complained.
        A teacher?
        Don't mess around!
        You must be joking.
        I'm being chased by an expert who's even stronger than sunguang. What are you doing here?
        'You're a weakling who can't even kill sunguang. Why are you causing trouble for me now? it's good that you have such thoughts, but ... You have to see your own strength. '
        I might have to save you later.
        Groaning, Li Hao could no longer Dodge.
        If he dodged and the teacher charged over, he would just happen to fall into Xu Qing's hands.
        "Kill!"
        Li Hao didn't Dodge. Instead, with a roar, he punched out. This punch was like a tiger's roar, like a tiger leaving its cage!
        On the other side, although the Black Panther had become a bald dog, it was still furious when it saw that a weakling dared to stop it. With a roar, it opened its mouth wide like a black hole, devouring the world.
        A strong suction force instantly made the three suns 'bodies shake and unable to move.
        General Xuguang's expression also changed slightly. He felt that the Super power in his body was trembling as if it was going to leave his body. His face turned pale, but he resisted his fear and slashed at Li Hao!
        Li Hao is only at the rising light level ... I'm also at the rising light level, so the gap isn't that big, right?
        I'll just block him for a while ... Even if it's just two or three moves.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com BOOM!
        The giant fist shattered the sky and the earth. With a crack, the long saber was shattered.
        BOOM!
        His arm exploded. The next moment, a divine intent burst forth, and the sword momentum soared into the sky. In an instant, the early-stage sunrise light expert was dazed. His spirit seemed to be torn apart as he saw a sword cutting through the world.  With a muffled groan, he opened his eyes ... And the first thing he saw was a fist.
        Bang! Bang!
        The head exploded!
        As for the three suns, they were extremely terrified. Before they could escape, they were swept by the Black Panther's bare tail. Bang Bang Bang, like dumplings falling into the ground, they were pierced through and fell to the ground!
        In the blink of an eye, one sunguang and four three suns had all died.
        The dingguo Army soldiers who were still firing below ... In an instant, a shell exploded with a bang. In the blink of an eye, the others fled in panic and scattered in all directions. Each one of them was pale and their legs were weak. The phrase "throwing away your armor and helmet" was vividly reflected at this moment.
        These soldiers threw away their weapons and armor and fled in panic.
        Li Hao glanced at it but didn't pay much attention.
        There was no need to have too many demands on the armies of the world, except for a few elites, such as the Wei Wu Army, the black armored Army, the star Army ...
        The other armies were similar.
        Of course, Li Hao had never seen the Silver Moon Army before, so he didn't know the details. However, most of the armies in the world couldn't fight head-on battles. Once they were defeated, they would quickly collapse.
        Although he had killed the other party, these few people had indeed caused him some trouble.
        Behind him, Xu Qing's aura had already appeared.
        Li Hao quickly turned around and stopped running.
        This was because he had sensed Yuan Shuo's Shi.
        If he left, Yuan Shuo would not be able to escape.
        Li Hao exhaled. This master of mine ... Is still treating the present as the past. He's different now.
        This era no longer belongs to you.
        This Xu Qing is unimaginably powerful. You're no match for him now.
        He didn't complain about anything. His master had come all the way here to save him, so he wasn't a fool. He naturally knew the gap between him and these powerhouses, but he still came ... Just this point alone was enough.
        However, since his master was here, he could not leave.
        Li Hao looked at Xu Qing, who was charging at him, and growled,""Go back! Xu Qing's seal has already been unsealed, and he's surpassed the rising sun. He's unrivaled ..."
         He was telling Yuan Shuo to leave!
        He might be able to stop him for a while, but ... Xu Qing, whose combat power had been unsealed, was extremely powerful. Before he even reached Li Hao, Li Hao could already feel the impact of his powerful qi and blood.
        This time ... He was really going to fail.
        Strictly speaking, Silver moon's coercion and Yuan Shuo's arrival were the key to Li Hao's downfall. Otherwise, Li Hao might have been able to escape.
        Could they be blamed?
        It couldn 't.
        He had to thank him.
        They had paid a great price and risked their lives to save you, and you still blame them?
        But ... Good intentions do bad things.
        Li Hao didn't know whether to laugh or cry. His mentality was okay, but he felt that these people didn't seem very reliable at times. Next time, if they acted mysterious in front of him again, he would punch them to death!
       
        However, would there be a next time?
        Spitting out the starry sky sword, Li Hao flicked his hand and sent the Black Panther flying. The Black Panther heard Li Hao's voice,""Take my teacher away!"
        The Black Panther howled!
        A fierce glint flickered in his eyes. In the next moment, he still turned around and fled, taking Yuan Shuo away ... Then, he would find an opportunity to kill Xu Qing and take revenge.
        Xu Qing saw it, but he didn't care.
        He didn't care about the dog. At this moment, he only cared about Li Hao.
        He revealed a smile!
        Li Hao was no longer running.
        He couldn't escape.
        The kick came at an unimaginable speed, and the void seemed to be shattered. A tornado appeared in Li Hao's mind. This was the force of the enemy. Xu Qing was a Martial Master, the strongest Martial Master Li Hao had ever met.
         This was also Li Hao's first time fighting a top-tier Martial Master.
        In just an instant, his divine intent seemed to be torn apart.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com This was probably the reason why the radiant light sword and the others killed the sunrise experts with each strike. If the divine intent was too strong, it could tear apart the opponent's divine intent and instantly cause them to freeze. It was the same as when he had killed sunguang.
        However, Li Hao was also a Martial Master, a top-notch Martial Master!
        Even though he wasn't as powerful as the person before him, his divine intent wasn't weak, either. After consuming an entire Skygold Lotus, his divine intent was at its peak.
        At this moment, Li Hao didn't think about anything.
        His five internal organs exploded instantly!
        The divine intent appeared and in the blink of an eye, it turned into a sword. The general outline of the sword intent appeared and the five Forces were forcefully integrated into it. A monstrous sword intent exploded.
        "Kill!"
        With a fierce shout, the starry sky sword slashed out, and its divine intent tore apart the opponent's tornado. The sword of his ancestor flashed in Li Hao's eyes. Wearing silver armor, he slashed out!
        BOOM!
        In the collision of spiritual levels, Li Hao's invincible Five Forces sword essence was directly shaken and scattered. His five internal organs were in turmoil, and his vision went black.
        The tornado was cut apart, but it still had an extremely powerful momentum.
        In an instant, it engulfed Li Hao, and Li Hao's sword momentum was directly broken!
        Pfft!
        A mouthful of blood spurted out, mixed with some fragments of his internal organs. On the opposite side, Xu Qing, who was kicking towards him, paused slightly. A strange look appeared in his eyes. What a strong sword force!
        However, it was a little messy.
        Of course, they were not as strong as him.
        He had unlocked some of his combat strength and surpassed the limits of rising light. Although he did not break multiple superlocks like the others, he had broken half of one.
         Even if he couldn't kill Li Hao in one hit, he could still easily crush Li Hao.  A heavy kick came down!
        Li Hao's starry sky sword was kicked to the side. In the next second, Xu Qing's other foot hit the chest of the armor. With a boom, the silver armor cracked and caved in a little.
        With a bang, Li Hao was sent flying.
        His vision turned black, but he quickly regained it.
        He opened his eyes and saw Xu Qing's cold face."Not weak! "It's a pity that you're up against me. Your Shi is your greatest trump card, but it's a pity that you're up against me. Your Shi is useless!"
        "The convergence of the five Forces ... Is nothing more than this!"
        A top-notch Martial Master like Xu Qing could tell that Li Hao was very strong to ordinary people, but to experts, his flaws were very obvious.
        At this stage, Li Hao might be able to play with superpowers, but he would have a slim chance of survival if he were to fight a top-tier Martial Master.
        Before Li Hao could think of anything, Xu Qing disappeared with a loud bang. He kicked Li Hao's head, and the silver armor caved in a little more. Xu Qing's voice faintly sounded,"Among all the martial arts in the world, only speed can not be broken! However, your armor is not bad. It's of good quality. Is this the heaven-battling armor?"
        "It's not bad that you didn't get crushed by my kicks ... Unfortunately, can you unleash the full potential of the armor? I can even kill you with a shock!"
        His words were only to break Li Hao's fighting spirit and confidence.
        As for making a move ... He did not hesitate at all.
        Boom! Boom! Boom!
        Like a rubber ball, Li Hao was quickly suppressed by him. Li Hao, who was in the armor, vomited blood one after another.
        The gap!
        At this moment, Li Hao felt that the gap between the two of them was huge.
        His speed, reaction speed, divine intent, and momentum were inferior to his ...
        He was completely crushed by this guy.
         If it wasn't for his armor and his powerful five internal organs, he would have been kicked to death. No wonder Hong Yitang and the others could easily kill peak stage sunguang and kill him very quickly when they unsealed the light sword.
        Xu Qing didn't unseal as many seals as they did, but he was also extremely powerful. Even Li Hao, who could kill a late-stage rising light realm expert, couldn't fight back at all.
        Bang! Bang!
        Li Hao was once again smashed down by a heavy blow, and Li Hao was about to fall into the sea. However, the next moment, Xu Qing appeared from below and punched out, sending Li Hao flying again. The shock wave penetrated his armor.
        Xu Qing praised,"what powerful five internal organs!" Even now, you're still not shattered ... Li Hao, you're the Martial Master with the strongest internal organs I've ever seen. Even those people with the earth-overturning sword might not have as strong internal organs as you ..."
        It was normal to have a strong body.
        However, he had been using vibration force all this time. According to a Martial master's situation, this was the most suitable attack method. If Li Hao was really a Martial Master at the rising light realm, his internal organs should have been shattered.
        But ... Li Hao could still defend!
        This was terrifying!
        His eyes were also filled with greed as he looked at the Galaxy Sword in Li Hao's hand. All of this was probably related to that sword.
       
        The greed that had just been born ... In the next moment, his expression changed slightly, and it instantly disappeared.
        However, when he disappeared and reappeared, Li Hao was still beside him. The wind-chasing boots on Li Hao's feet glowed, and he stabbed out with his sword, as if he had been waiting for him!
        Li Hao didn't give up on his counterattack!
        He didn't take the opportunity to escape either, because he realized that his foolish teacher had come again ... F * ck ... Forget it, I won't scold him anymore!
        Otherwise, Li Hao's plan would have been to pretend to be heavily injured and weak, and then find an opportunity to escape with his wind-chasing shoes. My God, my lovely teacher is afraid that I won't die, and is rushing to collect my corpse!
        I'm just afraid that the master and disciple will die together!
        There was a local Shout!
        The sword pierced through!
        A crisp sound of metal clashing was heard from the sword. In the next moment, a set of armor appeared on Xu Qing's body. Xu Qing's eyes were filled with surprise and slight disbelief.
        Li Hao ... Actually dared to counterattack!
         No, he could still counterattack!
        If it wasn't for his armor, even if this sword attack couldn't kill him, the sharpness of the starry sky sword might have pierced through his defense and injured him. This was a rare thing. A Martial Master of the younger generation actually had such battle consciousness and such tenacity.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com But as a state Duke, did he lack an origin divine weapon?
        No lack!
        If they were really lacking, it was impossible for the Treasury to have a pile of them.
        Not only did he not lack anything, but he also had good ones. The armor he was wearing was called the God sealing armor. According to his current level, it was a heaven-grade origin divine weapon!
        It was on the same level as the Phoenix spear.
        Even the starry sky sword couldn't break it before the soldier soul appeared.
        With a clang, Li Hao was knocked back by the huge impact, a helpless look in his eyes.
        He had guessed it!
        A Duke like Xu Qing was not a poor man like silver Moon, a pauper like the earth overturning sword, or a worker like the light sword. He was an Overlord, so how could he lack treasures?
        If it wasn't for the fact that he didn't have any other boot-type divine weapons, this person might have even equipped a pair of boot-type divine weapons.
        Even so, Li Hao guessed that this person had more than one divine weapon.
        "That's right ..." Xu Qing smiled."Someone said that you're The Prodigy of this generation of Silver Moon martial masters, and that you might be able to raise the upper limit of the Silver Moon martial masters. I didn't believe it, but I believe it now. Not to mention this generation, even if all the martial masters from the previous generation were lined up, you'd be one of the top!"
        As soon as he finished speaking, he kicked!
        With the appearance of the God sealing armor, his defense greatly increased, and he no longer had to worry about Li Hao's counterattack. He kicked out, and Li Hao also slashed with his sword. Shadowless Sword!
        The Willow catkins floated, the Willow catkin sword.
        At this moment, Li Hao also used all that he had learned-five birds capture, tiger roar in the forest, deer stealth technique, and the ninth refinement force!
        BOOM!
         With an explosive sound, Li Hao's eyes were calm. He slashed again and again, his long sword cutting through the air.  The sword light illuminated the world!
        It was like a hot knife through butter, but it was once again swept up by the tornado.
        "Roar!"
        The Tiger roared in the forest, and the Tiger was released from its cage. The Tiger that had always been successful was swept away by the tornado created by Xu Qing's punch. It scraped the bones and broke the stomach!
        The ferocious Tiger turned into a skeleton Tiger, but it was still unwilling to give up. It roared and fought back with all its might!
        There's a Tiger in my heart that wants to break out of its cage ...
        However, the enemy ... Was too strong!
        This was the first time that Li Hao had been completely suppressed. He had used all Five Forces, but they were still broken, his divine intent was torn apart, his sword was knocked away, and his ninth refinement force was shattered ...
        His five internal organs started to shatter.
        Mountains collapsed, Tigers died, willow trees withered, waves died, and the Golden origin exploded ...
        At this moment, even if Li Hao's will was extremely stubborn ... He still couldn't stop the gap in strength.
        With a loud bang, Li Hao crashed into the ground. The earth cracked, and Li Hao fell heavily!
        He didn't say anything, but forced himself to turn his head to look at the bridge ...
        My stupid teacher!
        'I've bought you so much time. What the hell are you doing? why don't you run ... You don't want to merge the five Forces and step into the spirit fusion stage to avenge me, but you F * cking have to run here ... Are you out of your mind?'
        At this moment, just as Xu Qing was about to stomp his foot, he suddenly raised his head and looked over.
        Yuan Shuo walked out from the collapsed bridge, holding the Black Panther's head tightly with one hand. He was a little angry.
        He looked at Xu Qing, then at Li Hao, who had fallen to the ground and caused the earth to cave in.
         "My stupid disciple ... You let this dog drag me. Damn it, it's a waste of my time. You have to subdue this dog first. This dog is as stupid as you ... I'll stew it later!"
        The Black Panther looked innocent as he held its head.
        I'm saving you!
        But this old man ... It had been afraid of him since the beginning. It thought that it could kill him easily now, but ... Looking at the situation now, it knew that it was still suppressed and had been grabbed by the head!
        Heibao was also very innocent. He glanced at Li Hao. It's not that I don't want to take him with me, but this old man is stronger than me, and he's suppressing me!
        "Yuan Shuo!"
        Xu Qing narrowed his eyes."I thought it was Hong Yitang ... I thought he wouldn't be here so quickly. I didn't expect it to be you!"
        Yuan Shuo laughed,"are you mocking me?" Or what? Why did my disciple come to Hong Yitang? Xu Qing, we haven't seen each other for thirty years, but you're still so stupid. Thirty years ago, I should have stuffed you into your mother's stomach and remade you. Your brain isn't working well!"
        Xu Qing looked at him and laughed,'the times ... Have changed! Yuan Shuo, this is no longer your era. "
        He kicked Li Hao into the ground with a boom.
       
        But in the next moment, Li Hao's expression changed slightly. At this moment, Li Hao opened his arms and suddenly grabbed his legs, dragging him with all his might. He gritted his teeth and roared,""Talk my ass ... Kill him!"
        The teacher even had the time to chat!
        They could either run or fight!
        Reminiscing? we'll have to wait until he's dead or killed by him, then we'll go to hell to reminisce.
        BOOM!
        Xu Qing's right foot trembled as he kicked out a few times. Crack ... At this moment, cracks actually appeared on the silver armor.
        However, Yuan Shuo still did not make a move.
        He was only looking, but his body was shaking.
        Not only that, Yuan Shuo opened his mouth and bit the Black Panther, his voice ringing in the Black Panther's ears,""I'll borrow some blood and ask Li Hao to return it to you later ... The blood of a powerful demon can strengthen the five internal organs. You're a Martial Master dog and an ancient demon dog, so your blood is very strong and just meets my requirements ..."
        The Black Panther howled in pain as its butt was bitten by the other party!
         I knew it!
        I knew that this old man wanted to eat me.
        It had thought that it was strong enough and wasn't afraid of the old man eating it, but the old man had actually hit it when it was down. Now, he was biting its butt. It could feel the old devil sucking its blood!
        "Aowu!"
        The Black Panther howled miserably. It was in so much pain. It had lost too much blood today.
        This scene ... Stunned Xu Qing and Li Hao.
        What was he doing?
        They saw Yuan Shuo biting the Black Panther and the dog's butt. Then, he seemed to be licking the dog's butt ...
        What the hell?
        Xu Qing was stunned for a moment. The next moment, he realized something. Was he ... Sucking the blood of a great demon?
        As for Yuan Shuo, his five internal organs were currently shaking. His four internal organs were already very strong, but his spleen was a little weak, causing the earth Force to be weak and the bear force to be weak, causing some deviation in the fusion of the five Forces.
        It wasn't the fusion of the five Forces, but the fusion of the five Forces.
        The blood of a Greater Demon did have the effect of strengthening the five internal organs, and it was recorded in ancient books. However, the greater demon's bloodline was not pure. No matter how strong the greater Demon was, it was just that.
        On the other hand, the Black Panther's bloodline had been activated and was still considered pure.
        Moreover, it was a dog that had never absorbed any energy. This dog ate all the good stuff, including sword energy, spring of life, Origin Energy, Li Hao, and the old turtle in heaven battling city.
        Its blood was really good.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It wasn't like the big demons today, who ate all kinds of energy, the thin mysterious energy.
        The Black Panther's blood was even stronger than some ancient Fey.
        At this moment, Yuan Shuo also felt it.
        At first, he was worried that it wouldn't work, but after drinking a little, he suddenly realized that the effect ... Was really good. It didn't taste bloody, and even had a sweet taste.
        'What a cute dog. I'll treat it better next time so that I can keep it and drink its blood ...' This thought flashed through his mind.
        The Black Panther seemed to have sensed it. Its eyes were full of humiliation and anger."Damn old man, I'll bite you to death one day!"
        His five internal organs roared!
         Yuan Shuo ignored Li Hao. At present, it seemed that Li Hao could still fight back and wouldn't die so soon. He would just wait a little longer. To do a good job, one had to be sharp with weapons first.  Xu Qing's expression changed slightly.
        With a low shout, he kicked Li Hao into the air again.
        At this moment, a huge crack appeared on Li Hao's armor.
        Li Hao kept spitting out blood. The sword energy surged into his body, but he still found it difficult to withstand such an attack ...
        Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, shook off Heibao.
        The Black Panther was incomparably weak as it pitifully fell to the ground. It felt a little drunk, which was caused by the lack of blood. This made the Black Panther want to cry.
        "Xu Qing, you've angered me!"
        A low chuckle was heard. In the next moment, Xu Qing's vision blurred as if a deer had appeared. When he looked again, it was like an ape rippling in the air. It flashed and disappeared as a punch was thrown!
        At this moment, the five animals-Tiger, bear, deer, ape, and bird-appeared and instantly fused into one person!
        Yuan Shuo!
        Xu Qing seemed to have returned to the past.
        That year, Yuan Shuo had used the five birds technique to beat him, the future Duke of the high Duke's public house, until he collapsed. If the third Duke had not been alive and the Xu family's status had not been so high, he would have been beaten to death that day!
        "Do you think it's still the same as back then?"
        He roared and roared as he kicked out!
        Do you think that I'm still the Xu Qing from back then?
        Do you think you're still the old demon Yuan from back then?
        "You'll always be that trash!"
        Yuan Shuo let out a fierce roar and punched out. A bulge appeared on his fist, which was a stone blade. With a loud bang, a hole appeared in the heaven-grade armor, which Li Hao had failed to break!
        There was a loud bang!
        Yuan Shuo was like a ferocious Tiger. He turned around and swung his fist like a tiger's tail whip. With a wave of his fist, he hit Xu Qing again with a bang, shattering the armor on his right leg!
        Li Hao was dumbfounded.
        Xu Qing's expression changed drastically.
         "Roar!"
        Fierce tiger roar!
        "Qiang!"
        The Golden Eagle spread its wings and soared.
        At this moment, the five birds appeared as if five great demons had appeared. A giant bear was so huge that it could burst the heavens and earth. Yuan Shuo stomped his foot and the earth cracked. Xu Qing had just landed when the earth exploded with a bang!
        Yuan Shuo transformed into a giant bear and threw a punch. Xu Qing was dumbfounded. His eyes were filled with horror. The next moment, he stomped on the ground and flew into the sky to avoid it.
        BOOM!
        The earth was torn apart!
        At this moment, Yuan Shuo was extremely valiant. He looked at the escaping Xu Qing with a cold expression."Useless thing! Don't you want a seal? Then I'll beat you to death!"
        "Impossible!"
       
        "Impossible!" Xu Qing said in disbelief.
        Even at this moment, he was at the peak of his strength during the metamorphosis stage, perhaps even surpassing it by a little ... But against Yuan Shuo, he was actually being suppressed!
        "Your inner strength ... Your Shi ..."
        Yuan Shuo sneered."If you only look at one's cultivation level, force, and inner strength ... Then martial masters shouldn't look at experience and talent. Just look at these. What's the point of fighting ... You're still as useless as ever!"
        His words were like a bird pouncing!
        "Stupid disciple, look closely, what is the true fusion of the five powers! When the five Forces merge, my body is the force, I am the bear, the Tiger, the Condor ... I can do as I please!"
        "I know tiger roar, I know Xiong Dou, I know Lu Ying ... I've fused all Five Forces into one. How could it be so troublesome? I still need to switch between them and in the end, I lost the essence of the five Forces ..."
        "Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth are the five Forces and five elements. When I punch, metal, wood, water, fire, and earth come out at the same time. How can there be only water and fire?"
        BOOM!
        The sound of an explosion resounded. The heavens and earth split apart. Water and fire were compatible, and a brilliant and powerful explosive force exploded. With a punch, the stone blade protruded. The punch sent Xu Qing flying, and a huge bloody hole appeared on his body!
         At this moment, a large hole had actually appeared on his armor, but it was quickly being repaired.
        Xu Qing flew backward and vomited blood. He was in disbelief.
        In his eyes, there was actually some fear!
        That Yuan Shuo had returned!
        This was impossible. Yuan Shuo's inner strength seemed to be on par with Li Hao 's. It was true, it was only on par, but the other party's force ... Was too strong!
        A single force might not be much stronger than Li Hao 's, but when the five Forces were fused, it was definitely not a simple stacking. When the five individual forces were fused together, they could even erupt with the power of ten or even twenty stacked forces!
        Xu Qing's expression was ugly, and he was a little scared.
        This was the fear of being suppressed and almost beaten to death back then. He thought that he had forgotten about it, but he didn 't.
        He thought that he could not care anymore!
        However ... When he met Yuan Shuo once more, he still managed to vent his anger.
        Yuan Shuo was like a devil as he sneered."Trash will always be trash. Relying on the Xu family to become a top-notch Martial Master ... Is that considered top-notch? They're just a pile of trash. Come, unseal them. Let me see how strong the so-called unseal is! All martial masters who rely on unsealing to gain combat power are useless!"
        “……”
        On the side, Li Hao was frantically absorbing sword energy to heal his injuries. Hearing this, he opened his mouth but chose to shut it.
        His words had offended all the martial masters in the world, the top martial masters!
        This included Hong Yitang and the others.
        But at this moment, he was also very shocked. Was this only the fusion of the five Forces?
        Why?
        Under the combination of the five Forces, Xu Qing, who was at the peak of the transformation stage, was beaten by his teacher to the point where he could barely fight back. Of course, this had something to do with Xu Qing's inner fear. He was afraid of Yuan Shuo. Yes, even Li Hao could see that this guy did not have the confidence to deal with him. When fighting Yuan Shuo, he was so timid that it was as if he had changed into a different person.
        But even so, to be able to break through the defense of a top-tier Martial Master with just a punch and a kick, his teacher's offensive power had reached a terrifying level.
        His force, inner strength, Qi, and blood seemed to have all fused together.
        It wasn't just the fusion of the five powers, but also some of the characteristics of the blood Blade technique.
        However, his teacher did not seem to have used the art of the bloody blade.
        Li Hao was at a loss. He felt that the confidence he had built up over the past few days had been completely shattered by his teacher. This was what it meant to kill someone's heart. If he were his enemy, he would probably be on the verge of collapse as well.
        BOOM!
        Just as he was watching, Yuan Shuo seemed to have transformed into a Golden Eagle. His hands formed claws as he grabbed at Xu Qing's arms. In the next moment, a ferocious Tiger seemed to have appeared on his arms, and with a crack, it seemed to have bitten on his armor.
        The armor had obviously caved in a little.
        Yuan Shuo's body turned around at an unbelievable angle and kicked towards Xu Qing's head. Xu Qing roared continuously and his qi and blood exploded. A tornado swept through the world but was destroyed by Yuan Shuo's Five Forces!
        "Roar!"
        With a fierce roar, Yuan Shuo suddenly extended a hand. Under Li Hao's excited gaze, as expected, he pulled out a hand from below, grabbed it, and then turned it into a hammer ... BOOM!
        "Ah!"  "Ah!" Xu Qing let out a blood-curdling screech as he broke free from Yuan Shuo's control. He rose into the air, bent his back, and covered his lower body. His face was pale as he looked at Yuan Shuo below.
        The next moment, a crazed look appeared on his face."Yuan Shuo ... You ... Forced me!" He said unwillingly.
        BOOM!
        It was as if something had exploded. In the next moment, another superpower lock exploded!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Two locks exploded in a row. His aura instantly soared to its peak. At this moment, it even exceeded the southern Fist that he had used at full force that day. It was unbelievable. His opponent seemed to have only opened two locks!
        Xu Qing, on the other hand, quickly swallowed a large amount of spring of life. His eyes revealed a touch of pain and unwillingness.
        The spring of life ... He had already consumed three drops.
        This time, he consumed a total of 7 drops at once.
        He only had this much, or it could be said that he only brought this much. There were still some, but they were all with some of the strong people in the ruins. Even if he was the Duke of dingguo, he couldn't take all of them.
        10 drops ...
        At this moment, he swallowed all of them, protecting his five internal organs.
        He did not allow his five internal organs to collapse, nor did he allow the two superpower locks to break completely.
        A powerful aura swept across the world.
        At this moment, he was too powerful.
        He was so powerful that even Li Hao was shocked. This guy was definitely much stronger than the southern Fist and had more superpowers than the light sword.
        The light sword had 6 energy locks, while Southern Fist had 5. This guy had at least 7, which meant that he had 3 out of his 5 organs.
        Yuan Shuo squinted at Xu Qing.
        At this moment, although Yuan Shuo was calling him trash, his heart was solemn.
        Unsealed combat strength ... Actually had such a huge increase!
        After fusing the five Forces, he had also improved by a large margin in an instant. However, when he saw Xu Qing unsealing him, he realized that ... The current him might not be able to match this person!
        But ... What's wrong with trying?
        He licked his lips and smiled,'I like ... To challenge the strong! Xu Qing, you're no longer trash. You're a more powerful ... Trash!"
        "Hahaha!"
        BOOM!
        A thunderous attack was launched into the sky in an instant. The unparalleled explosive power was vividly reflected on Yuan Shuo's side!
        He was too well-rounded, and his speed was also extremely fast. Even Xu Qing, who specialized in leg techniques, was not faster than him.
        It was like a deer jumping, like an ape climbing, like a bird flying in the sky!
        Coupled with the powerful destructive power of the stone saber, Yuan Shuo was at a disadvantage. But at this moment, from Li Hao's perspective, his teacher was still as brave as ever!
        Judging from the aura alone, Xu Qing still seemed to be a little afraid.
         The influence of that year was still present today!
        With a loud bang, Yuan Shuo was forced to retreat.
        At this moment, Yuan Shuo was still as domineering as ever. His eyes were sharp and his lips were curled into a smile. Even though he was bleeding, he was still extremely arrogant.
        Yuan Shuo's exasperated voice rang in Li Hao's ears,""Are you an idiot? Run, you can't win! After unsealing, I'm going to be abused!"
        At this moment, Yuan Shuo really despised this idiotic disciple of his.
        What the hell!
        Do you have to see me being abused before you run?
        The unsealed Xu Qing ... Had truly surpassed Xu Guang. Yuan Shuo was no match for him.
        Li Hao didn't say anything. I want to run, but ... I haven't recovered from my injuries.
        Teacher, hold on a little longer. I can run away in a while.
       
        Yuan Shuo was still incomparably domineering.
        As for Xu Qing, he gradually calmed down. What he needed to do now was to overcome the fear in his heart. He knew very clearly that he was stronger than Yuan Shuo at this moment.
        It had to be absolutely powerful!
        However, Yuan Shuo still dared to beat him up. Why?
        Because he was afraid, afraid!
        Everything seemed to have returned to 30 years ago. At that time, he was scared of being beaten.
        And today, perhaps it was his chance.
        "Yuan Shuo!"
        He slowly landed on the ground and looked at the proud Yuan Shuo. He gritted his teeth and said in a muffled voice,""I am not afraid of you! Today, you have given me a chance. As long as I defeat you and kill you today ... I, Xu Qing, will definitely be able to rise to a higher level!"
        "Are you sure you can do it?" Yuan Shuo laughed. Are you sure you're not afraid? "Have you forgotten how miserable and pitiful you were back then? if it wasn't for your father, I would have smashed your head that day ... You were so close to death. Xu Qing, have you forgotten?"
         Instead of retreating, he advanced!
        Taking a step forward, Xu Qing's legs moved slightly as if he wanted to retreat. However, in the next moment ... He stood still and did not move.
        He raised his head and looked at Yuan Shuo.
        A cold look appeared in his eyes,"you said that it was back then!" For thirty years, I have swept the East, I have defeated everyone. So, today I am the eastern Duke dingguo, and you ... Are nothing!"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "You can only struggle on whilst at death's door under the protection of hou Xiaochen and Silvermoon! If not for some guys in the metamorphosis stage who are trying to use you to perfect the five elements technique and the five organs technique ... You would have died long ago!"
        "Do you really think that Ying Hongyue can't kill you?"
        "Do you really think that hou Xiaochen and the others can protect you? "Everything is just your own imagination. The truth is that you're just a tool in everyone's eyes. Your role is only to perfect the five viscera technique. Even if you don't teach it to others, killing you and studying your corpse will be the same!"
        He seemed to be encouraging himself.
        He took a step forward ... And walked forward.
        This was actually a kind of leap, a kind of breakthrough.
        It was a shock that came from the heart!
        Just like the Golden spear, it was unable to break through Yuan Shuo's intimidation. Now, it was unable to break through hou Xiaochen's intimidation and was unable to advance any further. Xu Qing's cultivation might not necessarily have broken through Yuan Shuo's intimidation.
        It was just that after so many years, he had forgotten about Yuan Shuo and chose to avoid it spiritually, which was why he had avoided those crucial points.
        He didn't choose to face it head-on.
        However, he had to break this demonic barrier today. Otherwise, he would be intimidated every time he met Yuan Shuo in this lifetime.
        Yuan Shuo raised his eyebrows slightly.
        He laughed,"not bad!" Xu Qing, you've managed to cultivate some anger after being a Duke for thirty years. You actually took the initiative to take this step in front of me ... Congratulations!"
        Xu Qing gritted his teeth and took another step forward.
        "I am one of the best martial masters in this world! "My vitality is unparalleled, my physical body is invincible, and my divine intent is full ... In my eyes, the light sword is nothing but a servant! Yuan Shuo, defeat you, kill you, and break the demon in my heart. I, Xu Qing, will definitely reach the peak of the martial Dao in the world!"
         He shouted, and in the next moment, he took the initiative to attack!  He couldn't afford to waste too much time on unsealing his combat strength.
        He was also extremely eager to suppress this guy, the devil of the martial arts world, with his current powerful strength!
        Yuan Shuo, you've missed out on these 20 years, missed out on the wonders of these 20 years.
        You can't be invincible forever!
        "Kill!"
        The kick shook the heavens and the earth. The ground cracked and a loud boom resounded in all directions. It was as if there was only a pair of legs in the world!
        It was extremely powerful!
        It was not until this moment that this Duke dingguo truly revealed his strength.
        Yuan Shuo was the nightmare of this generation's martial masters.
        Whoever could break Yuan Shuo's curse would be known as the top martial Master of the martial Dao.
        "Roar!"
        The tiger's roar in the forest!
        Yuan Shuo transformed into a fierce tiger, with clouds following the Dragon and wind following the Tiger. Between heaven and earth, it was as if a cloud had appeared, rain fell, and the wind and rain poured.
        The five elements and five Forces!
        At this moment, Li Hao seemed to have finally understood what divine will and momentum were.
        This was the Dao!
        Martial arts!
        This was the martial Dao path of the people of today.
         His teacher had once said that above the thousand-man combat stage, there was nothing that the gods of the land could not do. The key to this realm was the divine intent and force. As for the physical body, Qi, and blood, if the force was strong, those would naturally be strong.
        Li Hao actually didn't understand, but he later felt that something was wrong. Since it could be strong ... Why were its five internal organs still weak?
        But at this moment, he seemed to have understood something.
        He stared at it intently, and indistinctly ... He really understood some of it. Yuan Shuo could summon the wind and rain, and the power of the five elements drifted from heaven and earth. It was as if a part of it had integrated into his body and strengthened his five internal organs.
        This was ... Nurturing the spirit!
        He was also recuperating!
        In other words, what Yuan Shuo lacked was time, and not a bottleneck. If he had enough time, he could have strengthened his five internal organs by himself. He had actually absorbed the power of the five elements into his body.
        For other people, it was almost impossible to strengthen the five internal organs.
        Yuan Shuo stretched out his hand, and a small stone knife appeared instantly. It transformed from a knuckle duster into a short knife. Although Yuan Shuo's strength was much weaker than his opponent 's, when he controlled the five elements and slashed out, it was as if the great Dao had descended and suppressed the heaven and earth!
        A giant bear appeared from the clouds. With one step, it was as if a mountain was pressing down. The next moment, it turned into a storm, a wave, and a myriad of sword techniques ...
       
        "Break!"
        The wind rose!
        "Die!" Xu Qing bellowed in rage as the wind howled. Although it was not as mystical as Yuan Shuo 's, it was still incomparably valiant. The wind howled and swept through the heavens and earth. As the strong wind blew, the giant bear was shattered and the clouds dispersed.
        Xu Qing roared,"nothing is more practical than strength!" Yuan Shuo, didn't you say that no matter how many tricks you have, they're all useless?"
        Since that's the case, what can you do even if you have more tricks up your sleeve?
        You're also trash!
        Yuan Shuo retreated. With a wave of his hand, fire and water fused together. Heaven and earth exploded, and the wind stopped.
        Yuan Shuo retreated again!
        He did not speak.
        A trick?
         This was not a trick. Xu Qing was a piece of trash. How could he understand this? he was using the least amount of energy to deal with that guy. At this stage, he might be hammered to death by him. He was not stupid. Why would he take the initiative to fight in close combat? was he looking for a beating?
        At this moment, he only wanted to delay for a while.
        They could either drag it out until Xu Qing couldn't hold on any longer or until Li Hao could move. It seemed that Li Hao was still recuperating, and his injuries were not light.
        Otherwise, with this brat's shrewdness, he would have run away without her saying anything.
        The battle erupted again.
        From the start, Yuan Shuo had been suppressing his opponent, but now, he was completely suppressed by his opponent. He could only passively defend himself, and he used all sorts of tricks.
        Wherever the two sides passed, not even a blade of grass was left.
        The ground cracked open and was spreading.
        The seawater was also pouring in.
        The surrounding coastline was collapsing, and the monstrous waves in the distance were also sweeping over. This was caused by Yuan Shuo's city-destroying bomb. The waves were about to sweep over.
        As the waves neared, Yuan Shuo's Tiger seemed to grow stronger.
        A wave of water force burst forth.
        At this moment, Li Hao suddenly leaped up. Instead of using his sword, he punched out. Nine huge waves roared and rushed toward Xu Qing.
        Xu Qing snorted coldly and kicked out, shattering the waves!
        Yuan Shuo cursed in his heart!
        If you've recovered, why aren't you leaving?
        Stupid kid!
        Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't say anything.
        Leave?
        Why are you leaving ... Old Hong is here!
        Yes, Hong Yitang and the light sword had already arrived and contacted him. Li Hao's armor had also responded. Hong Yitang and the others would arrive soon. Why should they leave?
        I'm going to kill this guy!
        As long as he and his teacher could hold on for a while and not be killed by the other party, even if they were heavily injured and on the verge of death, as long as the two silver Moon experts arrived, at that time ... Even if Xu Qing's seal was completely undone, he would die with hatred regardless of the consequences!
        Yuan Shuo seemed to have guessed something as well, and he fell silent.
        The master and disciple both used their Five Forces at the same time. You become a fierce tiger, I become a giant ape. With a boom, the giant ape retreated, and the fierce tiger dispersed.
        Xu Qing was indeed unbelievably powerful!
         But ... He realized that it was difficult to kill the two of them!  In the blink of an eye, Li Hao's back was against Yuan Shuo 's. A drop of the spring of life spread out, and the injuries on their bodies began to heal.
        The next moment, Li Hao transformed into a willow tree and took root in the clouds.
        A surge of sword energy gushed out and entered the cloud.
        While Xu Qing was dazzled, the master and disciple operated the five birds technique to the extreme. Sword energy and the spring of life gushed out continuously. Not only that, Li Hao reached out and grabbed a stone knife.
        The starry sky sword, on the other hand, had fallen into the hands of Yuan Shuo.
        Yuan Shuo slashed with his sword!
        BOOM!
        Xu Qing took a step back and said in disbelief,""You can also use a divine sword?"
        Why?
        How could someone without the bloodline of the eight great families use these divine weapons?
        One must know that the wind chasing boots had existed for many years, but he could only grind it bit by bit and could not use it. He could only use it a little.
        Why could Yuan Shuo do it?
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Yuan Shuo ignored him. In the next moment, he suddenly stepped on his boots, but there was nothing under Li Hao's feet.
        The breathing technique of five birds was actually the reason why Li Hao could use these weapons all this time. However, these people didn't know this and thought it was because of his bloodline.
        At this moment, Li Hao had to strengthen Yuan Shuo with all his might.
        He gave her the sword and the shoes.
        In the next moment, he was like an ape, lying on Yuan Shuo's back. He activated the five birds breathing technique, and his qi and blood flowed into Yuan Shuo's body. His inner strength surged in, and the cultivation technique of the same origin burst out!
        Dual cultivation!
        Yuan Shuo roared. The master and disciple were in an extremely strange position. Li Hao rode on Yuan Shuo, and Yuan Shuo looked like he was carrying his mother and child ... Or rather, this was the true embarrassing posture of cooperation.
        The bei was on top, and the wolf was on the bottom. The bei was in charge of commanding, and the wolf was in charge of attacking.
        Yuan Shuo's aura surged!
        With a roar, he pounced forward, throwing out punches and kicks. Behind him, Li Hao stuck one hand to his back, while the other hand pierced forward!
        His fist was like fire, and his palm was like wind.
        The starry sky sword revolved around him, and the stone saber pierced through him!
        Xu Qing, who was originally extremely powerful, was once again suppressed at this moment. It was somewhat unbelievable. With some shock, he roared and kicked sideways. The void seemed to explode from the kick!
         There was a loud bang!
        A fist mark was left on his foot, and his boot was shattered, revealing his right foot, which was dripping with blood. Yuan Shuo's arm seemed to have been fractured. The next moment, Li Hao extended his arm, but Yuan Shuo seemed to be fine.
        The master and disciple each held a sword in one hand and a saber in the other. They danced with the saber and the sword!
        Xu Qing roared again!
        He was unwilling to accept this!
        How was that possible?
        It was true that their techniques came from the same source, but their cooperation was too high. Li Hao had been practicing the five birds technique for a few years, but there was a huge gap between his strength and Yuan Shuo 's, so they probably didn't have many opportunities to work together.
        How could they cooperate so well?
        Bang!
        A crack appeared on his armor, and he also kicked out. Yuan Shuo's back revealed Li Hao, who shattered his silver armor with a kick. Li Hao grimaced in pain. His teacher was really inhumane!
       
        It was obvious that Yuan Shuo felt that Li Hao's body, internal organs, and armor were stronger than his ... So it was safer for Li Hao to take the kick than him.
        But ... It really hurt!
        In the next moment, Li Hao climbed up like monkeys, and so did Yuan Shuo. The two monkeys flipped over, and Yuan Shuo appeared in front of the other again. He struck with his sword, and with a crack, another bloody gash appeared on Xu Qing's foot, which had not been withdrawn yet. Xu Qing's foot was almost cut off.
        Xu Qing took a few steps back and landed on the ground. His blood stained the broken ground red. He looked at the two of them and his eyes revealed a hint of ferocity."Five birds technique!"
        His eyes revealed a hint of greed and shock."The five birds technique ... Seems to be able to fuse martial arts, origins, and even point straight to the great Dao ... Yuan Shuo, you're indeed a genius!"
        He understood that this master and disciple pair could cooperate in battle!
        It was the effect of the five birds technique!
        At that moment, their breathing was in sync, and it was as if their inner strength and mental energy were fluctuating in unison. This was unbelievable. Even cultivation techniques of the same origin were not like this.
        This was the uniqueness of the five birds technique!
        Everyone had underestimated Yuan Shuo and the five animal technique.
         This cultivation technique that had been created during the 100-year-old period seemed to have become completely different after Yuan Shuo had perfected it time and time again.
        Yuan Shuo laughed like an old devil."Hehe, Xu Qing, do you want it? He wanted to continue unsealing! Just two of them were not enough! Come, unseal three, four, five, or even all of them. Only by completely cutting them off will you have a chance to kill me and take everything!"
        "The Li family's divine sword, the Zhang family's divine saber, and the Liu family's divine boots are all yours!"
        Three great divine weapons!
        At this moment, even Xu Qing was a little excited and impulsive. All of it erupted. The excitement and impulse of killing two people. Yes, these two people were too rich.
        It wasn't wealth in the ordinary sense, but the three divine weapons and the five birds technique. These things were the true treasures!
        Any one of them would attract the attention of everyone.
        Moreover, the master and disciple had so much.
        "Hmph!" Xu Qing snorted coldly. His feet glowed with light as he stomped down. It was as if he was stepping on heaven and earth.
        However, Yuan Shuo's expression changed slightly.
        At this moment, he suddenly retreated and rapidly retreated. With a loud boom, a huge footprint was left on the ground.
        Meanwhile, Yuan Shuo's expression had changed, and he revealed a look of rage!
        "Heaven's crippling feet! You killed him and took his secret art?"
        Yuan Shuo was furious!
        As for Xu Qing, he stomped his foot again and said coldly,""What a joke! You, Yuan Shuo, have killed so many martial masters, including Silver moon's top 36. Other than you, you've killed almost all of the remaining dead martial masters ... Yet, you're angry that I've killed a heaven's leg breaker!"
        "You should die!"
        "You bastard!" Yuan Shuo was furious. How dare you ambush my Silver Moon Martial Master! If he was killed in a fight or a Kung Fu competition, there would be news that you killed him in secret!"
        "Roar!"  A tiger's roar sounded. Yuan Shuo seemed to be furious!
        It was a different kind of anger.
        He had killed countless Silver Moon martial masters, but the crippled feet of the 36 heroes had been killed by Xu Qing. He seemed to be more furious than ever, even angrier than Li Hao who had almost died!
        The ferocious Tiger roared, but Yuan Shuo did not retreat. Instead, he advanced. His long sword pierced through the air like a fierce Tiger's sharp claws, and he slashed at the giant foot!
        BOOM!
        The Big Foot stomped down, and the sky fell and the earth cracked!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "I was wondering why the Silver Moon martial masters are so powerful. You guys are all quite lucky. These secret skills are either the essence of ancient martial arts or contain the truth of martial arts. Yuan Shuo, the Silver Moon Martial Master does have the right to be arrogant ... Now, I'll kill you with the Silver Moon secret skill. What do you think?" Xu Qing said coldly.
        His big feet stomped on the ground!
        One kick after another, Yuan Shuo retreated in defeat. Li Hao also took the initiative to receive a few hits. His internal organs felt like they were about to be completely shattered. At this moment, he knew ... He really couldn't win!
        This heaven crippling foot was extremely powerful.
        Xu Qing had not used it before, either out of fear or out of fear that Silver Moon would take revenge on him, but he had completely let go of his restraint now.
        Obviously, Tian canjiao of the thirty-six heroes had most likely been assassinated by him, and he had even taken the secret skill. It was not known whether Tian canjiao was too confident or he had been tricked into taking the secret skill.
        Yuan Shuo's mouth was also bleeding. He was a little mad, angry, but also helpless!
        He was also sullen!
        He was very powerful after fusing the five powers, but the first opponent he faced was the extremely powerful Eastern Overlord. He was truly unlucky.
        It never went smoothly!
        At this moment, he heard Li Hao's extremely weak voice.""Soon ... Soon ... Hold on for a while ..."
         Yuan Shuo rolled on the ground and quickly avoided the next kick.
        At this moment, he was in a sorry state.
        Literally, the master and disciple were both covered in mud and were extremely unbearable.
        "Hahaha!"
        Xu Qing laughed wildly. He couldn't help but be happy. Yuan Shuo was his nightmare. Today, he had been stomped by his Silver Moon secret skill, heaven crippling foot, and was rolling like a beggar.
        He wasn't such a flamboyant person, but at this moment ... He was really happy.
        The next moment, he suddenly frowned.
        In the distance, the two martial masters seemed to know that they couldn't hide it. Hong Yitang usually didn't show his emotions on his face, but at this moment, his eyes were cold as he looked at them and came over on the huge waves!
        "Heaven crippling foot!"
        Hong Yitang paused after every word. The light sword was also a little angry. With anger in his eyes, he gritted his teeth."You killed the crippled Heavenly Feet? No wonder that guy has completely disappeared. Even BA Dao has news, but there's no news about him ... We thought he was hiding somewhere to cultivate ... It turns out that he was killed by you!"
