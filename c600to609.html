now how many years he's been practicing martial arts?" Yuan Shuo laughed.
 "Ten years?" Wu Hongshan raised an eyebrow.
 "Hahaha, I know you're ignorant ... Three years ... No, one year ... No, two months!"
 “……”
 Wu Hongjun looked at him like he was a fool.
 Continue!
 "It's true!"
 Yuan Shuo laughed heartily,"wasn't I injured earlier?" I took him in three years ago and was prepared to let him inherit some of my knowledge ..."
 "And the result? In fact, I didn't teach him anything else except the five birds breathing technique, including the five birds breathing technique. In July, he said that the people of the red moon wanted to kill him and that he had to save himself. Then he began to concentrate on practicing martial arts and absorbing mysterious energy. Good Lord, it didn't take long for him to cut Ten Realms!"
 "This kind of ten slashing realms is very superficial!" Wu Hongjun said lightly.
  "Nonsense, of course I know!"
 Yuan Shuo laughed heartily."That's why I didn't say anything. But that kid, to be honest, even if he managed to break through to the late 100-stage quickly, I don't think it's that impressive. Things are different these days. He has enough mysterious energy and he's not a super yet. He can still break through to the late 100-stage very quickly."
 "But, do you know? He actually quickly comprehended force!"
 Yuan Shuo sighed,"that was when I felt that this guy was a genius, a genius of martial arts!" You know silver Spear's son, right? That day, I was helping him comprehend force while my disciple was watching from the side. As he watched ... F * ck, he actually comprehended force too. I was shocked!"
 "In the blink of an eye, he comprehended the earth Force. Not only that, he also comprehended the sword force after the battle with sun Yifei's disciple. Jade light, don't you think he's a genius?" Yuan Shuo couldn't stop laughing.
 If it was simply breaking through 100 perfection, in fact, Wu Hongxi didn't care.
 At this moment, after hearing Yuan Shuo's words, he nodded slightly,""He is indeed a genius, but the sword momentum and the terrain ... To be honest, they don't match. It's better to follow your five birds force step by step. "Otherwise, after stepping into the thousand warrior class, you can only use one force as your main force. Sword force is good, but you're not good at it, so he might not have many chances in the future ..."
 "Woman, if you're jealous, just say it. Why do you have to say that you don't care?"
 Yuan Shuo chuckled."Very good. How long has it been?" Besides, who said that he couldn't fuse force? At that time, when the two forces merge, he might not be as good as me, but he will still be able to surpass you!"
 "Mixed doesn't mean proficient!"
 Wu Hongjun was indifferent.
 So what if he fused two powers?
 Was it stronger than a single sword force?
 It would be a waste of talent if one was not proficient in it.
  "You can go and be jealous!"  Yuan Shuo laughed and sighed."It's a pity that the kid is in so much trouble. In addition, the martial arts world is not as good as it used to be. Otherwise, I would have brought him to visit my old friends and challenge some geniuses to increase his combat experience."
 "Just like you did back then?"
 "What's wrong with that?"
 "Become The Public Enemy of the martial arts world?"
 "What Public Enemy?" Yuan Shuo said disdainfully. Back then, I relied on my own strength to defeat you all, not on my family background or my realm! I won with my real ability, what Public Enemy or not, you're just jealous and deliberately slandering me!"
 When it came to Public Enemies, he was too lazy to respond.
 However, to this Martial Master of the same generation, he did try to defend himself."That's because your skills are inferior. At this time, you're still lying to yourself and saying that you're The Public Enemy of the martial arts world. Isn't it embarrassing?" he thought.
 Wu Hongjun didn't dwell on this matter. He thought about it and said,""I've heard that you've taken in a few other disciples, and they're not weak and have good talent. Why didn't you mention them?"
 "There's nothing much to say. "
 Yuan Shuo did not say much. At this moment, he was like an old father who favored his youngest son. He chuckled and said,"That little disciple of mine is not only obedient, but also sensible, kind, and good-looking. It's a pity that you don't have an apprentice. Otherwise, I would really introduce him to you. "
 Yuan Shuo sighed."That's right. He's not a boorish man. He's a scholar. Like me, he's talented."
 Wu Hongjun continued to remain silent.
 Yuan Shuo rarely complimented others, even if it was his disciple.
  However, this fellow had nothing to do tonight, so he was praising his disciple.
 If this were to spread, many people would probably be surprised. Old demon Yuan also knew how to praise people?
 At this point, Yuan Shuo suddenly sighed,""Damn it, that hou Xiaochen is a piece of trash! That fellow might abuse my disciple ..."
 "Hou Xiaochen ..."
 Wu Hongjun was silent for a moment and said,""Is he from the Wei Wu Army?"
 "I don't know, who cares!"
 Yuan Shuo didn't really care and said indifferently,""It doesn't matter. Even if it is, it doesn't have much to do with me. Although everyone wants to beat those guys up, most of the people they kill are martial masters who don't follow the rules! I'm a Martial Master who follows the rules. First, I didn't kill anyone, second, I didn't kill the innocent, third, I didn't bully the weak, fourth, I didn't kidnap women, fifth, I didn't kill officials and rebel ... Tell me, do you think the Wei Wu Army has anything to do with me?"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Wu Hongjun suddenly laughed."Don't forget. You were wanted!"
 Yuan Shuo laughed."That has nothing to do with anything else. I was wanted because I barged into the military camp and fought with Huang Yu. That was a taboo, so it was just a token warning to Wu Lin. In the end, it was just a matter of time!"
 It was fine if he didn't mention it, but once he did, Wu Hongjun's interest was piqued. For a Martial Master, she was actually very concerned about the result of this battle,""Between you and Huang Yu, who won?"

 That battle was too mysterious.
 No one knew who had won. They only knew that both commander Yu and Yuan Shuo were fine.
 Yuan Shuo sank into his memories, as if he was struggling with how to express it. After a long while, he shook his head and said,""It's hard to say! If we're talking about winning ... I might be the one who won! But I lost again. "
 "What do you mean?"
 "That old man might have already reached the warrior Qian realm!"
 Yuan Shuo said in a deep voice,"if I'm both above 100, he's definitely no match for me. I'm invincible when I'm above 100. I'm also invincible when I'm at the same level!" But that guy ... When we fought, his strength was over a hundred. I was slightly better, but ... When I was about to attack him, he suddenly jumped away and admitted defeat!"
 Yuan Shuo sighed."That's why there's a high chance that he's a warrior of the thousand seat. It's even possible that he's been promoted for many years. Do you think I've won?"
 "The previous generation's douqian?"
 Wu Hongjun was not surprised at the existence of douqian at that time. It was normal. Yuan Shuo only suppressed his peers. It was normal for douqian to exist in the previous generation, but it was rarely seen at that time.
 Yuan Shuo nodded."Yes, there's a high chance of that. So, I thought about it and stopped playing. It didn't make much sense."
  At this point, Yuan Shuo laughed."The three great commanders of the Wei Wu Army were all gathered at Silver Moon. Do you think this old man could be one of them?"
 "What?"
 Wu Hongjun was stunned. She had thought of hou Xiaochen, but she had never thought of Huang Yu!
 He was the commander of the military!
 "Ogres, hahaha monsters, sickbed ghosts ..."
 Yuan Shuo laughed."The three of them were very mysterious. Almost no one has seen them before, but they all knew of their existence. Every time they attacked, they would kill. They were extremely powerful. Back then, it was different from now. Those who could do this back then were first-class in information, intelligence, methods, aftermath, and martial arts. Do you think it's normal for Huang Yu to be one of them? the military's intelligence system has always been top-notch. "
 Wu honggui frowned,"if what you said is true, he is a Qian Dou ... It's not impossible!" Is he an Ogre or someone else?"
 Commander Yu had a good reputation and everyone's impression of him was that he was extremely dignified.
 Ogres didn't have a good reputation.
 Of course, it wasn't that the other party ate people, but that the other party's methods were too dark and ruthless. Every time he killed someone, his body would become a bloody mess. Almost all the martial masters he killed didn't have an intact corpse. The martial arts world mocked him for eating people and killing people as brutal as eating people.
 "Who knows?"
 "Hou Xiaochen, Huang Yu, if both of them are one of the three great commanders, could the third be from Silvermoon?" Yuan Shuo asked casually. Only a Silver Moon Martial Master would be able to deal with the Silver Moon martial forest! How could a foreign Martial Master have such ability! If all three of them are still alive, who do you think will be the third commander of Silvermoon?"
 Wu Hongjun thought about it carefully and suddenly glanced at Yuan Shuo.
 Yuan Shuo was stunned. Why are you looking at me?
 Wu Hongjun said faintly,"who is the third person ... You are the most similar!" How many martial arts practitioners have you killed? The entire Silver Moon martial forest is in chaos because of you. The things you've done are much more powerful than the three great commanders! Even the three great commanders can't suppress the entire martial arts world of the same level, but you did, so ... I think the possibility of you being one of them is very high!"  Yuan Shuo was stunned for a moment. He thought about it carefully and nodded.
 Don't say, it really looked like it!
 If it were the three great commanders, there was a high possibility that Yuan Shuo was one of them. It was just that this fellow had always been in the open.
 Yuan Shuo laughed helplessly,""You don't say. If I didn't know myself, I would also think so! If I were one of the three ... Then I'd be a hahaha freak, laughing when I cut someone, don't you think so?"
 Wu Hongshan did not say anything.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Who knows if you are.
 Of course, no one would pursue the matter now.
 Hahaha ... It might really be this guy.
 The man-eating monster Huang Yu, hahaha strange Yuan Shuo, the sickbed ghost Marquis Xiao Chen ...
 Was that even possible?
 Wu Hongjun no longer thought about it. It was already in the past. If these three people were really the same, it was no big deal.
 ……
 This night, white moon City was not considered peaceful.
 The battle in the evening had made many people uneasy and even fearful.
  No one knew about the conversation in the wilderness of Linjiang province.
 The administrative Bureau, the inspection Division, the garrison, and the night patrollers were all brightly lit that night. They were investigating the evil superpowers and dangerous people in the red moon.
 Director Zhao was getting on in years and was dozing off.
 Hu Qingfeng had been staying here the whole time. He didn't leave, and it seemed that he was also working hard on the case. He even took the other two three suns to help the general Administration, saying that they were worried that the general Administration would be attacked by the Crimson Moon.
 In fact, he was just worried that he would encounter some danger in the hotel.
 Late at night, seeing that director Zhao still hadn't gone back to rest, Hu Qingfeng smiled."Director Zhao, it's getting late. Why don't you go back and rest early? I'll keep an eye on things here!"
 The administrative Bureau worked with a few large organizations to appease the people. There were actually a lot of things to do. Sometimes, these trivial matters were more troublesome than chasing after the murderer.
 Director Zhao yawned again and revealed a smile,""It's fine. Although I'm a little older and my body isn't as good as before, staying up late isn't a problem. The dynasty values me, so I'll do my best ..."
 As he was speaking, a large communicator on the table suddenly rang.
 Hu Qingfeng frowned slightly.

 Not far away, Deputy Director Zhou, who was working at his desk, suddenly raised his head and looked at the communication device on his desk. It was an Emergency communication device. They had paid a huge price to connect to the special communication system of the dynasty.
 That was the communication system of the border officials, directly reaching the heavenly hearing!
 Director Zhao's eyes were wide open, and he looked at Hu Qingfeng. Hu Qingfeng didn't say anything. He stood up and left with the other two.
 The two of them were still a little confused.
 At the side, Deputy Director Zhou was also about to stand up and leave. Director Zhao pressed his hand down, indicating for him to stay.
 After Hu Qingfeng left, director Zhao picked up the call.
 A brief report came from the other side of the communication, and soon, the communication ended.
 Deputy Director Zhou's eyes moved and he looked at director Zhao in shock.
 Director Zhao let out a breath and said,""The sky in the North ... Has collapsed ... The North is going to be in chaos!"
 The Silver Moon was in the North!
  A Big Shot had died!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com A very important person!
 How important was it?
 Back then, the rebellion in the three major provinces was also in the northern province, which was not far from Silver Moon. Later on, the war subsided, but the turmoil continued. An important figure of the dynasty received the support of the royal family and came to suppress the rebellion. He was stationed in the three important provinces!
 He was in charge of the military of the three provinces and had suppressed the rebellions in the three provinces for many years. He had killed countless people and no one in the three provinces dared to make a sound. Even now, with the rise of the supers, the three provinces were still an important force of the royal family!
 The Night Watcher system of the three provinces and the other super systems were almost all under his control!
 And tonight ... This person died!
 Director Zhao looked out of the window. Deputy Director Zhou was also shocked. Although he had some conjects...But...When it really happened, he still couldn't believe it!
 The three northern provinces were going to be in chaos!
 That person had killed too many people and suppressed the three provinces for many years. He had long accumulated countless grievances. However, he was too strong, and the power he controlled was too strong ... It was useless even if countless people in the three provinces were dissatisfied.
 But now, he was dead!
 Director Zhao rubbed his face, revealing a helpless and bitter expression.
 He walked out of the office.
 Hu Qingfeng didn't eavesdrop outside the office. It was an important matter. If he dared to eavesdrop, he would be easily discovered. Once he was discovered, it would be troublesome.
 "Director Zhao...What's wrong?"
 Hu Qingfeng looked at the old man, who was staggering and about to die. He was a little surprised. What kind of bad news did he receive?
 You're going to be fired?
 If that's the case, it's a good thing. The old man is always on the edge and doesn't talk about serious matters. It's best to get lost early!
 Director Zhao wanted to say something but stopped.
 "Commissioner ... Commissioner Hu ..." He said with great difficulty after a long while.  Hu Qingfeng just looked at him."Tell me!"
 "The northern General ... Is dead!"
 Hu Qingfeng was stunned at first, and then he started to think.
 Who was the northern General?
 The title of 'great general' was usually given by the imperial family. Nowadays, the nine divisions rarely gave such a title.
 Therefore, he didn't manage to react in time.
 At the side, Deputy Director Zhou saw this and said with difficulty,""It's ... The governor of the three provinces, general kou!"
 The three provincial governors ...
 At that moment, Hu Qingfeng's body trembled!
 ? His eyes revealed a look of disbelief, some disbelief, some disbelief!
 How was that possible?
 How was that possible?
 He was not sad, nor was he uncomfortable. He was just extremely shocked. How could he have died?
 The great general of the bandits!
 He was the banner of the imperial family in the North. Actually, the inspector didn't care if he died or not ... But ... But he was a peak Sunglow expert!
 How could that be?
 Furthermore, the other party was protected by countless powerhouses ... How could that be possible?
 Hu Qingfeng was completely dumbfounded.
 After being stunned, there was only one thought in his mind ... If this person died, the three northern provinces that he had suppressed would not fall into chaos, right?
  The three northern provinces were adjacent to Silver Moon. Would Silver Moon be affected if there was a riot?
 He wasn't afraid of this. What he was afraid of was ... They wouldn't call the nearby powerhouses for help, would they?
 At this moment, Hu Qingfeng was terrified. The great general kou was dead. Who did this?
 If I'm transferred over ... That would be really dangerous!
 ……
 That night, ordinary people were fine.
 Normal superpowers are fine too.
 However, on this night, all of the higher-ups and top-notch powerhouses could no longer sleep. It was not just Silver Moon, but the wind of insomnia quickly spread to stellarsky city, which was tens of millions of miles away!
 A sudden clap of thunder!
 In comparison, Silver moon's two three suns were nothing!

 The next day.
 Early in the morning, Li Hao still went to work on time.
 However, Hao lianchuan did not come back this morning or even last night. He might have come back to deal with the murder of Third Sun.
 Thus, Li Hao went to work alone in the morning.
 The superpowers that were watching him from all directions were gone.
 Not a single one!
 At around eighto' clock, Li Hao stepped into the night patrolmen's headquarters.
 The night patrollers coming and going were all very busy at the moment. When they saw Li Hao, some of them said a few words of concern. Li Hao had been attacked the day before. Although he seemed to be fine, they still expressed their concern and concern.
 Tracking down Hong Yue's whereabouts was the most important task for the night patrollers at the moment.
 Everyone was busy.
  The night patrolmen did not have much to fear about Red Moon. After a few times, Red Moon had suffered serious losses. Even the strong ones at the level of suguang were easily killed by the Minister. The night patrolmen were now very popular.
 After hearing that Red Moon had attacked Li Hao again, the Nightwalker's inner circle kept saying that they wanted to exterminate Red Moon. They were all very excited.
 Before he entered, Li Hao was slightly stunned.
 He glanced at the sixth floor.
 Sixth floor, I didn't see anything before.
 However, today, there was something about the 6th floor that he couldn't look at directly. He had this feeling before, when he was facing hou Xiaochen. Sometimes, when he looked at hou Xiaochen, his eyes would hurt.
 He didn't feel this way in the past few days.
 Thus, Li Hao guessed that hou Xiaochen wasn't in the headquarters before.
 But today, she suddenly had the same feeling. Was hou Xiaochen back?
 Thinking of this, Li Hao walked into the hall and headed to the fourth floor.
 Just as she arrived at the door of her office, Chief Steward Yu suddenly walked out of her office. He glanced at Li Hao and said coldly,""Li Hao, the Minister has come out of seclusion. I told you to go see him after he comes out!"
 Exit seclusion?
 Could it be that hou Xiaochen wasn't in seclusion here?
 Li Hao didn't understand the situation either.
 Did hou Xiaochen want to see him because of what happened yesterday?
 Although he thought this in his heart, he didn't show it on his face. He just nodded and smiled,"I understand, chief."
 Just as he was about to go over, he saw Chief Steward Yu looking at him.
 Li Hao had no choice but to follow her up the stairs.
 Li Hao wasn't the only one. When they reached the fifth floor, Hao lianchuan's eyes seemed a little red. He had just left his office and was walking upstairs.
 When he saw Li Hao, he nodded and forced a smile.
 Li Hao thought that he was having a headache over yesterday's matter, so he didn't say anything.
 The three of them walked up to the sixth floor.
 ……
  On the sixth floor, there was only one office.  It was very, very big!
 Majordomo Yu knocked on the door, and the door was opened. Li Hao looked over and saw hou Xiaochen sitting in a chair in a daze. The current hou Xiaochen seemed to be weaker than the last time he saw him.
 The sound of coughing could be heard from time to time.
 When he saw them, he nodded slightly and did not speak.
 "Cough cough ..."
 Hou Xiaochen coughed a few more times and took out a handkerchief to wipe his mouth. A faint red color flashed across his face, and steward Yu hurriedly stood up,"Minister ..."
 "Sit."
 Hou Xiaochen smiled, his smile as gentle as ever.
 Li Hao didn't look around. He only glanced around the office.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com There weren't many things in the office, but there were two most eye-catching things. One was a huge screen, and the other was a huge map. It was so huge that it almost took up an entire wall of the office.
 There was another door at the back of the office, probably where hou Xiaochen usually lived.
 Hou Xiaochen gently exhaled and leaned back in his chair. He looked a little tired. He glanced at Li Hao and smiled."You did well yesterday. You're a Martial Master, after all. When you attack, you attack. You don't bully the weak, but you don't fear anyone either!"
 Li Hao stood up."Sorry for the trouble, Minister!"
 "It's just a small matter!"
 Hou Xiaochen laughed."I attacked you in Whitemoon city. That's not taking me seriously. So what if I killed you? forget about killing two three suns. If I'm capable, so what if I killed two suguangs?"
 Li Hao was speechless. I don't have that kind of ability.
 Hou Xiaochen looked at Hao lianchuan and coughed lightly. He frowned slightly and said,"Your reaction speed is shockingly slow. You rushed to the battlefield thousands of meters away with the fiery phoenix spear in your hand. You already expected it, but it actually took you more than 20 seconds. If I send you to the battlefield ... Won't You Be delaying your opportunity every day?"
 Hao lianchuan felt a little helpless. He quickly got up and said,"Minister, I ..."
 "Alright, that's enough!"
 Hou Xiaochen cut him off and coughed, "You've entered the middle stage of the three yang realm. Not bad, but you're still too slow."
 Was it slow?
 Hao lianchuan felt that it was okay. It was actually quite fast.
  p Of course, he couldn't be compared to the Minister.  Hou Xiaochen didn't seem to care too much about what had happened yesterday. He looked at the others and said,"What happened yesterday is in the past. We just need to pursue Hongyue."
 He didn't continue on this topic and brought up something else.""The four organizations have a meeting. Old Yan went once before, but the meeting didn't go well. I've come out of seclusion today, and the other three parties want to talk again ... So let's talk again."
 "Li Hao, you should go with them."
 "Me?"
 Li Hao was stunned. You want me to do this?
 Although they were only going with him, shouldn't the Deputy Ministers be the ones to handle this?
 He, Li Hao, seemed to have only been here for a few days.
 "Let's go together!"
 Hou Xiaochen laughed,"it's to broaden my horizons. I'll be able to see more people and more powerful experts." A Martial Master couldn't be a frog in a well. Silvermoon's sky isn't too high, but you haven't touched the limits of this sky yet. "

 "If it wasn't for yesterday's battle, you wouldn't have to go. But since there is one ... Then let's go together!"
 Li Hao was surprised, but he didn't refuse. He immediately said,""Thank you for your high regard, Minister!"
 "That's what I should do. After all, according to what you said, you've shown your value. I should give you more chances, shouldn't I?"
 He joked, but Li Hao could only respond with a silly smile.
 Chief Yu really told this person everything!
 Hou Xiaochen stood up."Let's go. Today's four-party meeting will be held at the administration department. After all, the administration department is the one in charge of Silver Moon."
 "In Silver Moon," he said as he walked,"the night patrollers are only a subordinate organization of the inspection Bureau. Li Hao, remember, the night patrollers aren't the gods here."
 Li Hao hurriedly nodded. He didn't care about this at all.
 Plus, you're so powerful, who would care about that?
 The group of four walked out of the door under the respectful and Worshipful gazes of the others.
  A black car stopped at the entrance.
 The driver was quiet.
 Li Hao observed him for a moment. He was probably a Martial Master, not a superhuman, so there were no orbs.
 As for the driver's level as a Martial Master, Li Hao didn't sense the existence of Shi, so he didn't pay much attention to it.
 Once they got in the car, the fat Hao lianchuan immediately ran to the front passenger seat.
 Li Hao felt terrible!
 He couldn't run as fast as this fatty.
 He sat in the front passenger seat. This car wasn't a three-row one, so he could only squeeze in the back with hou Xiaochen and chief Yu.
 Li Hao cursed in his heart. This fatty is not a good person!
 I also want to sit in the front!
 Although he had been very fierce when he killed people yesterday, Li Hao knew that he was no match for hou Xiaochen. He would have been killed by hou Xiaochen's spear if he had been killed.
 She was actually under a lot of pressure when she was with him.
 However, he had no choice but to sit next to hou Xiaochen.
 Hou Xiaochen sat in the middle, with Li Hao on his left and chief Yu on his right.
 Hou Xiaochen coughed a few times again. Sitting next to him, Li Hao could see a little more clearly. He vaguely saw a wisp of red, which made him feel a little strange.
 At this time, there was no one else, and he was still pretending to cough blood?
 As a subordinate, Li Hao should still show some concern. He hurriedly said,""Has the Minister's injury not healed yet?"
  "It's an old injury. It's not a big deal, but the root isn't removed. " This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Hou Xiaochen laughed, but didn't say anything."Little li, what do you know about the star dynasty?"
 "The dynasty has nine divisions, the royal family, and 99 provinces ..."
 Li Hao immediately said a few words, and hou Xiaochen laughed,"Just this?"
 "Um ... I've never left the Silver City before, so there are some things that can't be written in the books, so I ..."
 "You're lacking in knowledge!"
 Hou Xiaochen seemed to be both blaming and criticizing her.
 "Yuan Shuo only cares about martial arts and digging graves. He doesn't care much about anything else. Although you've learned from him for a few years, you're still inexperienced."
 "Cough!" He coughed and said,"Xiao Yu, briefly introduce the dynasty to Li Hao."
 With that, he closed his eyes and rested, no longer paying attention to Li Hao.
 Chief Steward Yu didn't say much and said in a calm voice,""The star dynasty was established in the year 1531, and it's currently year 199. Next year will be the 200th year of the dynasty. In the first 120 years of the dynasty, the royal family ruled the world! Until 80 years ago, in 1650, the nine divisions jointly submitted a Memorial, requesting the royal family to rule with a bow. The nine divisions began to rule. "
 "The nine divisions are the Division of Administration, the military law Division, the inspection Division, the business division, the financial division, the criminal law Division, the Internal Affairs Division, the Foreign Affairs division, and the Meritorious Service division that decides the promotion system of officials."
 ? Li Hao listened quietly. Actually, he had heard of the nine divisions before, but he did not pay much attention to them. Silver Moon did not have some organizations, or rather, they did, but their presence was not strong.
 "The 99 provinces in the world are divided into five parts: North, South, East, West, and central. The central part is vast and has many people. It has developed businesses and is rich. Under normal circumstances, the 22 provinces in the central part will be divided into the central part."
 "Silver Moon is one of the northern regions. The entire North consists of 19 provinces, which form the Northern Territory of the dynasty!"
 “……”
 On the way, Chief Steward Yu explained the basic knowledge to Li Hao. Most people didn't know about this.
  The world was too big!
 In many people's eyes, a province was their entire world. Who would care too much about things outside of the province?
 But now, as steward Yu explained, Li Hao gradually felt the vastness of the dynasty.
 It was unbelievably big!
 The nine divisions, the imperial family, the province ...
 Silver Moon was only one of the 99 provinces in the world, and it was even a border area. Other than the strong martial arts atmosphere in the past, there did not seem to be anything special about it.
 The car was also gradually approaching the administration Bureau.
 At that moment, hou Xiaochen opened his eyes and coughed,"The 19 provinces in the North are all relatively independent. However, there are three major provinces that are more special. These three major provinces are close to the central region. Because of some matters, the three major provinces have unified military control and have been in place for many years."
 "The three great provinces are the fog province, which is covered in clouds all year round, like a city in the sky! Heyuan province had many large rivers, water bandits, and severe flooding. The North Sea province has a large ocean within its borders ... It is also the boundary between the central region and the North. After crossing the natural boundary of the North Sea, you will reach the central region. "
 Li Hao recalled the map of the dynasty he had read and roughly understood the locations of the three provinces.

 The three provinces were still quite a distance away from Silver Moon.
 Of course, on the entire map, it did not seem far. They only needed to cross the neighboring Linjiang province to reach Heyuan. Heyuan, fog province, and the North Sea formed a triangle.
 The North Sea was the tip of a triangle, while Heyuan and the fog province formed a line for the Silver Moon.
 Starting from Silver Moon, they crossed Linjiang province, then entered the border between Heyuan and Wu province. After walking for a few thousand miles, they arrived at Beihai province. After crossing Beihai, they entered the central region.
 Li Hao didn't quite understand. Why did hou Xiaochen introduce the three provinces to him?
 There were 19 provinces in the North, and hou Xiaochen had picked three of them. Could they be special?
 Military control system?
 "The three provinces form an arrow. If you go south, you'll reach the central region. If you go north, you'll reach the entire North. The dynasty has been paying close attention to this area."
 "The three provinces are all controlled by one person. The nine divisions of the three provinces are all under his jurisdiction. He also controls an extremely elite army. His combat strength is also extremely strong. He is the northern General conferred by the imperial family and the governor of the three provinces conferred by the nine divisions. He is also the only general in the world who controls the three provinces."
 Li Hao had a vague impression of it. He seemed to have read about it in a book.
  After some thought, Li Hao asked, Minister, is this general very strong? After the rise of the supers, they became supers too, right?"
 "Not bad."
 Oh!
 Li Hao was still not very interested. He felt that they were very far away from him. He felt like he was reading a history book. Although he knew that those people were living people, what did they have to do with him?
 Could it be that the first thing hou Xiaochen would have to deal with after the rebellion?
 That was a possibility!
 So, he was telling her to be careful?
 As they were chatting, the car stopped.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Someone was waiting at the door.
 A white-haired old man with a refined appearance looked at hou Xiaochen and smiled,"Minister hou is here."
 "Director Zhou, you're too polite ... I'm ashamed to have made you wait here!"
 On the side, Hao lianchuan transmitted his voice and explained,""Zhou Xing, Deputy Director of the administrative Bureau. He's also the number one Deputy Director, and he's the old partner of director Zhao of the general Administration. The two of them have worked together for close to 40 years ... They've been working together since they were of low status, and he's also the Golden partner of Silver Moon!"
 They had worked together for nearly 40 years. It was truly a long time.
 Furthermore, the key was that they could also become important figures of Silver Moon. Strictly speaking, these two could be considered as Silver moon's first and second brothers. However, with the decline of the administrative Bureau and the rise of superpowers, the administrative system had taken a heavy blow.
 Li Hao didn't say anything. He didn't have the right to speak here.
 However, he didn't say anything. After director Zhou greeted department head hou, he also greeted chief Yu and Hao lianchuan. Then, to Li Hao's surprise, the old man looked at Li Hao and nodded with a smile,""Li Hao, right? He's a talented young man and Yuan Shuo's disciple. A strict master produces brilliant disciples. Yuan Shuo was also famous in Silver Moon back then, and now that his disciples have become talented, it's Silver moon's joy. "
  Li Hao was slightly dazed, but he still quickly said,""Your Excellency is too kind!"  "Not a bad kid!"
 Director Zhou smiled and didn't say anything more. He walked forward and brought them in.
 Li Hao raised his eyebrows slightly, but didn't say anything.
 It seemed that his name had spread.
 He didn't know if it was a good or bad thing.
 Beside him, Hao lianchuan transmitted his voice again."This old man isn't even this polite to me. He's very polite to you. Was he beaten up by your master back then?"
 “……”
 Li Hao was speechless.
 My teacher only beats martial masters. This is a scholar.
 As for whether the other party was strong or not ... Li Hao took a look but did not see any light orbs. He was not a superhuman, nor was he hiding his strength. As for whether he was a Martial Master or not, he did not look like one either, judging from his loose skin.
 Why did my teacher hit him?
 Ignoring Hao lianchuan, Li Hao followed him into the administrative Bureau. The place was very empty, and there were not many people in the hall.
 Seeing the crowd, those people also avoided one after another, making way for a passage.
 He did have superpowers.
 Li Hao seemed very curious. He looked around and saw some light orbs, but they were not too strong. There seemed to be two or three sunlit existences on the second floor, which was not too bad. However, Li Hao, who had killed three suns, did not care too much.
  In such a large Administration Bureau, if there were only a few people from the sunlight sect here, they would indeed lose their right to speak.
 There seemed to be a few larger balls of light on the third floor.
 There were even existences at the Sunglow level!
 Li Hao didn't think that it was someone from the general Administration. It could be someone from another organization, or even Hu Qingfeng, whom he had never met before. After all, he would definitely come to this meeting of the four parties.
 With Li Hao's sharp eyes, these people could hardly hide from him.
 At this moment, Li Hao couldn't help but recall something.
 When he was in the confidential room, he had seen some records. At that time, someone had seen the red shadow, but they were either taken away quickly or died in an accident. He had thought that he would meet it after entering the night patrol.
 However, until now, he had not met these people.
 Could these people also see the light balls like him?
 If it was possible ... Then it would be a joke for experts to hide their strength!

 Whoever was hiding some expert, let these people take a look and they would naturally find out.
 "Those people ... Where did they go?"
 Li Hao was a little curious. He had always wanted to ask, but he didn't have the opportunity or a good excuse to ask.
 Wang Ming clearly didn't know about this.
 Li Hao glanced at Hao lianchuan. Perhaps this person knew something.
 ……
 The few of them walked upstairs.
 He didn't take the elevator, as the third floor wasn't very high. Li Hao also realized that experts didn't like taking the elevator. Perhaps they were afraid of being ambushed in the narrow space.
 On the third floor.
 They went up the stairs and entered a small living room. At this moment, some staff members were waiting.
  In front of the small hall was a large door, and behind it was the conference room for the meeting.
 Li Hao glanced at the staff at the door. They were all supers, one at the level of sunlit and five at the level of Dark Moon. It was clear that the administrative Bureau also took them seriously.
 "The Marquis's troops have arrived!"
 Director Zhou said and the door opened.
 The moment he opened it ...
 Li Hao felt that he was blind!
 He was very curious, so the moment he opened the door, he looked inside. In the end ... He felt that his dog eyes were blind.
 Her tears flowed down slowly.
 Li Hao instantly lowered his head and wiped his tears.
 He wanted to cry!
 At this moment, he really wanted to cry.
 F * ck!
 As he cried, he was shocked, dumbfounded, and even dazed.
 When he looked at the people behind the gate, it was as if he had seen Qiao Feilong that day ...
 One, two, three ...
 The balls of light that he had not seen before were now all so bright that they blinded his eyes.
 In the crowd, the ball of light that he had seen earlier was not very eye-catching.
 Li Hao suspected that he was dreaming!
 Where am I?
 Who am I?
 Did I come to a place I shouldn't have?
 ……
 At this moment, there were four groups of people in the big conference room.
 Aside from the night patrollers, Hu Qingfeng and the other two were the remaining three organizations.
 At the top of the meeting room, an old man sat. It was director Zhao.
 On the left was another old man wearing a special military uniform. He was a military expert, commander Yu, whom many people called commander Yu. Hu dingfang and another old man could only sit behind him. Obviously, this old man had a higher status than the other two.
 On the right, the burly inspector was seated with a few others.  Hu Qingfeng and the others sat on the side of the inspector. After all, the night patrollers were still under the jurisdiction of the inspector.
 And Li Hao was blind when he looked at these people!
 He didn't know whose light had blinded him ... But Li Hao knew that this place wasn't a place for humans.
 What the hell?
 At this moment, he was so shocked that he was even trembling.
 F * ck, this is unbelievable.
 It was as if he could see hou Xiaochen, and more importantly, not just one, but ... Several!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Li Hao?"
 On the side, Hao lianchuan nudged Li Hao, a little confused. What was he doing?
 He entered!
 Was this guy not moving to attract attention?
 Li Hao lowered his head and said carefully, as if he was a newbie,""I'm nervous, Hao bu...I...I've never seen the world before. Can you walk in front of me and help me? I'm scared!"
 艹!
 Hao lianchuan cursed under his breath. 'This little brat is still pretending at a time like this.'
 Pretend your head!
 When you killed three suns yesterday, I didn't see you being a coward.
 He was a little speechless, but he didn't say anything. He walked in front of Li Hao. Li Hao was like a child, carefully following him. He didn't dare to move at all. He just timidly followed Hao lianchuan like a big girl.
 They entered and the door was closed.
 Director Zhou went to the other side, while hou Xiaochen sat down directly opposite director Zhao. There were enough chairs, and Li Hao's group didn't have many people, only 4. They all had seats, so they didn't let anyone stand.
 Li Hao and the other two sat behind hou Xiaochen. Li Hao carefully pulled a chair and hid behind hou Xiaochen, pushing Hao lianchuan out of the room.
 Hao lianchuan was speechless. What was she doing?
 This guy, what's wrong today?
 Was he afraid that Hu Qingfeng would find out what had happened yesterday?
 The Marquis is here, what is there to be afraid of?
 He kicked Li Hao. At this moment, the big shots seemed to be greeting each other, but Li Hao wasn't in the mood to listen. Hao lianchuan's voice rang in his ear,""The one over there, the one in front of director Zhou is director Zhao, Silver moon's number one. However, this old geezer isn't a good person. He's stubborn and goes against us night watchers. If you get the chance and no one sees it, you can give him a beating!"
 Li Hao lowered his head.
  He did not reply.
 He was thinking, thinking about a question. If he was stronger than Hao lianchuan, would he be able to hear his voice?
 Voice transmission was just an application of energy. It was a special kind of fluctuation and vibration.
 The weak naturally had no right to analyze, distinguish, or listen.
 What about the strong?
 Li Hao didn't know.
 So, at this moment, he was very curious. He raised his head and looked at the old man opposite him.
 At this moment, the old man was smiling. He seemed to be looking at both hou Xiaochen and Li Hao. There was no light in his eyes, and he looked a little tired. When he saw Li Hao's gaze, the old man seemed to nod slightly, but it was not very obvious.
 Li Hao was slightly dazed.
 Then, he looked at Hao lianchuan, who was still transmitting his voice to him."Don't look at that old man. He looks kind, but he's not a good person. He often cuts off our resources and expenses ..."

 As he was speaking, he felt that someone was looking at him. He looked up and saw that director Zhao seemed to be looking at him. Hao lianchuan revealed a bright smile and continued to speak to Li Hao,""Did you see that? This old geezer is polite to everyone, but he's actually very evil!"
 Li Hao didn't reply.
 Understood!
 Also, that director Zhao ... He probably heard it, right?
 Hao lianchuan, you ... You're so awesome!
 It wasn't just director Zhao. Li Hao suspected that there were more than one or two people present who could have heard it.
 At this moment, Hao lianchuan kicked Li Hao.""Look to the left. The three people on the left are the military commanders! The one in the middle with white hair is commander Yu of the Silver Moon Army. This old man is very powerful. He has fought in a war before and even quelled a rebellion. However, this old man is very arrogant. I have seen him twice, and he always has a cold attitude. I don't like to have contact with this old man!"
 Li Hao looked to his left and saw three people. He also saw Hu dingfang looking at him and nodding at him.
 Next to Hu dingfang was a dazzling figure. At this moment, the old man also looked in their direction, as if he was looking at Li Hao, but also as if he was looking at Hao lianchuan. He was expressionless and very serious.
 Hao lianchuan transmitted his voice again,'look to the right. That big guy on the right. Do you see him?' This is the Secretary of the inspection Division, our boss in name. Her name is Kong Jie. It sounds like a woman's name. Don't look down on the big guy. He's big, and his strength isn't weak either. He's at the peak of the sun radiance realm, and it's said that he's almost at the third Sun realm, just a little weaker than me ... Not bad!"
  On the right, the big, burly director also looked over, as if he was talking to hou Xiaochen, his tone neither warm nor cold,"Xiaochen, don't bring just anyone to the next meeting. It's a mess!"
 “……”
 Hao lianchuan transmitted his voice again,'I'm talking to you! This guy doesn't know how powerful you are, otherwise ..."
 Li Hao kicked him and groaned in his heart.
 My master Hao, stop talking!
 Shut up!
 I'm not powerful, I'm not powerful at all, I'm nothing!
 I'm scum!
 Also, she's not talking about me, she's talking about you!
 You're finished!
 It was not easy for Hao lianchuan to survive until today.
 Yes, this one ... F * cking hell, this one was also one of the people that Li Hao had been blinded by.
 Oh my God!
 What was up with Silver Moon?
 I couldn't even look at these people.
 It didn't really look like a ball of light.
 Speaking of influence, it didn't really seem like it.
 Li Hao had a feeling that these people were very scary, but they didn't seem like martial masters or superpowers.
  In any case ... He felt that he was blind and stupid.  Hao lianchuan thought that no one could break his voice transmission, and that was indeed the case. Ordinary sunguang would not be able to hear anything. At this moment, he even sent a voice transmission,""That golden-haired guy is Hu Qingfeng. He's at the suguang rank, and he's the strongest one here, second only to the Marquis. Just be careful of him!"
 Li Hao looked at Hu Qingfeng. This time, he wasn't blind!
 He looked at Hu Qingfeng. Well, the ball of light was huge and powerful.
 And then ... There was nothing else!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Hu Qingfeng's face was cold, as if everyone owed him something. Li Hao didn't care. He looked at Hu Qingfeng, then at the others, and sighed inwardly. This guy actually came to Silver Moon. Only today did Li Hao understand a thing or two about Silver moon's situation.
 This place was hell!
 Here, the three suns 'light balls were like fluorescent lights!
 Hu dingfang, who was in the late stage of three yang, was not too conspicuous.
 As for director Zhou, who didn't see anything before, Li Hao started to doubt himself. Was it because his eyesight wasn't good that he didn't see anything?
 Every minute he spent in this place was torture.
 As for his side, there were four of them. Hao lianchuan, who had just entered the mid-stage of the three yang realm ... If he didn't have the fiery phoenix spear, Li Hao felt that this guy didn't even have the right to sit here!
 As for Li Hao himself, he felt that he was at least more qualified than Hao lianchuan.
 Well, at least I'm young!
 "Everyone's here. "
 At this moment, director Zhao opened his mouth. His voice was still loud, but it seemed like he didn't have enough sleep and was dozing off.
 "This time, we have to come up with a plan!"
 Director Zhao then glanced at Hu Qingfeng."Special Agent Hu, we'll talk about Minister hou later. I'll talk about the three northern provinces first. You don't have any objections, right?"
  "No problem!" Hu Qingfeng said in a deep voice.
 "Last night, there was news that the governor of the three northern provinces, the North suppressing general kou Shiming, was killed in his mansion!"
 Director Zhao coughed and said uncomfortably,""General kou suppressed the rebellion in the three provinces and took great credit for it. He protected the 19 northern provinces and pacified them. However, he was ambushed and killed by bandits last night ... Cough, cough, cough ... Unbelievable, unimaginable, the world is shocked!"
 "Today's meeting is also to commemorate and mourn ... Without general kou in the three northern provinces, the unrest will continue and even spread. This time, we need to discuss countermeasures to deal with the unrest in the three provinces. Although Silver Moon is not adjacent to the three provinces, it is not too far from Heyuan. Once Linjiang is threatened, it will soon spread to Silver Moon!"
 “……”
 Behind them, Li Hao was dumbfounded.
 Minister hou had just mentioned this person.
 Now, as soon as he arrived, he heard the news of the other party's death. He had been killed!
 Moreover, Minister hou had just returned ...
 Li Hao's heart trembled violently. My God, what the hell am I in?

 As for Hao lianchuan, he seemed to have realized something as his face turned slightly pale.
 He had also heard it just now!
 So ... Was the death of this great general related to the Marquis?
 Not far away, that commander Yu said seriously, "There's no need to say anything more. The three major organizations will definitely take responsibility for this. I will ask the nine divisions to send troops to encircle and suppress the three major organizations and quell the chaos in the North!"
 On the other side, the Inspector General was extremely calm: "Director, don't worry. Starting from today, the inspection Division will be sent out to clean up the remnants of the three large organizations! With Xiaochen around, he can also deter the night patrollers. This time, we'll catch all the evil superpowers from the three organizations in one fell swoop. Since special investigator Hu is here, it's good that Xuguang is here. We'll be able to kill the enemy in one fell swoop and wipe out the Silver Moon Bandits!"
 “……”
 When the two top figures spoke, Hu Qingfeng wanted to say something, but he couldn't for a long time.
 He had directly determined his nature!
 The general's death had turned into a matter of hunting down the members of the three major organizations and eliminating the unorthodox superpowers.
  p Director Zhao frowned. After a while, he nodded,""Sure, but you must be careful not to disturb Silver moon's security. Remember, the three great organizations are only a branch here! "Even if we exterminate them, it's only a temporary solution ... It's good that Special Agent Hu and the others are here. Otherwise, without Xuguang, Minister hou might be powerful, but he's injured. It's hard to say how much of his strength he can use ..."  Li Hao's mouth was wide open, but he didn't say anything.
 He only felt that these people were all black-hearted!
 They were all black!
 Without exception, all of them were.
 He looked at Hu Qingfeng again, and suddenly felt that this Big Shot Xu Guang was very pitiful.
 Sympathy for no reason!
 The three parties, no, the entire Silver Moon, seemed to want him to stay, not leave, and to help Silver Moon.
 Li Hao swallowed his saliva and lowered his head again.
 I didn't hear it, I didn't see it, I'm blind and deaf.
 Hou bu said to go out and gain knowledge.
 Li Hao felt that he had learned something new today.  This was Silver Moon?
 A barren land with superpowers?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The three suns could run amuck in the weaker provinces?
 It was said that in the central region, Xu Guang was also a Big Shot who could run amuck. The central region was a place where experts were as common as clouds. A Xu Guang like Hu Qingfeng was also an existence who could command a region.
 But ... Why do I feel so miserable with this person here?
 "Cough, cough, cough ..."
 A series of coughs followed.
 Hou Xiaochen coughed, and the other important figures, except for Kong Jie, who wasn't coughing, all started coughing.
 This included that commander Yu.
 Hou Xiaochen coughed for a while before saying,"The night patrollers will definitely cooperate with Special Agent Hu to encircle and annihilate the three major organizations ..."
  "But I'm still injured and can't travel far," he said apologetically."If I do, I'll need special investigator Hu to help me. I'll ask Deputy Minister Hao lianchuan to cooperate with me!"
 "Cough, cough, cough!"
 There was another series of coughs, and the entire conference room seemed to have become a Ward at this moment.
 Li Hao's throat also felt itchy and he wanted to cough.
 On the other hand, Hao lianchuan's expression was a little bitter. 'Why am I being mentioned?'
 The others seemed to agree.
 Li Hao seriously suspected that these people were taking revenge on purpose!
 That's right, to take revenge on a certain someone who had just sent a voice transmission and spoken nonsense!
 It's you!

 In the huge conference room, the sound of coughing could be heard.
 It was either one of them coughing, and Hu Qingfeng and the others were a little upset.
 Silver moon's upper echelons were all sickly.
 Either you're sick, or I'm sick.
 At this moment, Deputy Director Zhou suddenly interjected and interrupted their coughs,""Everyone, let me interrupt you for a moment. In addition to these topics today, there's one more thing to add."
 "Reinforcements!"
 Director Zhou's voice wasn't loud, but it was very serious,"The three provinces in the North are in trouble. With the death of general kou, the three provinces will be in chaos. In the three provinces, the three major organizations are active. Other than that, there are also many ambitious people active. In addition, the Navy of the North Sea, which has never been destroyed, is also active in the sea, occasionally attacking the North Sea province ..."
 "The central region is further away and the deployment of troops is slow. With the rise of supers, there are many experts in the bandit Army and they have gathered a large number of idle supers ... Back then, Silver Moon was led by commander Yu to exterminate the bandits, but he was also hated. He did not completely exterminate them back then and they will take revenge sooner or later!"
 "Even if the central Command has not given the order, we must be prepared to provide support. The military and the supers must be prepared!"
 Everyone nodded in agreement.
  The stern commander Yu was also showing his dignity at this moment. He said in a deep voice,"I can't move without orders from the stellarsky city. However, I can lead 50000 soldiers from the Tiger wing Army to the three northern provinces. The Tiger wing Army is a Mobile Force. As long as they don't cross the North Sea, there won't be a big problem."
 "Commander Yu has ordered us to do our best!" Hu dingfang quickly said.
 The old man did not say anything.
 The three northern provinces would be the center of the chaotic world. At this moment, it was actually a good thing to go to the three northern provinces.
 It was chaotic there, but there were opportunities.
 The chaos would be controlled in the three northern provinces, which would become the main battlefield in the northern region.
 Next, there would be a large number of experts rising from there.
 There were many experts in the central region for many reasons, and it was also greatly related to the chaos of war. Only in troubled times could experts be produced quickly.
 The chaos in the three northern provinces would definitely attract powerful people from all directions. Not only the 19 northern provinces, but there would also be powerful people from other regions. Those who could not survive in the central region and those who did not dare to participate in the chaotic war in the central region ... These people would all gather in the North!
 "On my side, when the three major organizations are annihilated, I'll let Hao lianchuan lead a team to help."
 Hao lianchuan's face turned even more bitter. Why me again?
 Hou Xiaochen's face was calm. Of course it was you.
 I'm giving you a chance, so don't not know how to cherish it.
 "If possible, the Silver Moon guards can also join the northern battlefield," he added.
 As soon as he said that, Hu Qingfeng seemed to have found something that could be used against him. He hurriedly said,"The Silver Moon guards? Minister hou, what kind of Army is this? Why isn't it on the roll?"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He was a little excited.  After a few days, they finally found some evidence. This was what hou Xiaochen had said himself.
 Of course, he didn't want to have a falling out with hou Xiaochen right now ... But, hou Xiaochen probably wouldn't do that right now. What he needed to do was to follow hou Xiaochen's words and continue to tear out more things!
 The three northern provinces were in chaos. At this moment, he really wanted to return to the central region, but if he went back like this, he would be in big trouble.
 Yu Xiao and Huang Jie were dead, so he had to make some contributions before he could return.
 Hou Xiaochen's face was calm as he coughed,"Who said it's not on the list? The Silvermoon guards were formed from the remnants of the disbanded Heavenly Star guards! "This Army does not belong to the system of the inspection Division, so the night patrollers are naturally not registered. However, this Army belongs to the royal family and has always been registered. You'll know when you go back and check. Although the royal family has no longer allocated resources, the serial number is still there."
 Hu Qingfeng was slightly stunned.
 Under the name of the royal family?
 The imperial family rarely showed their faces now.
 He looked at hou Xiaochen suspiciously. Beside him, commander Yu said,"This is indeed the case. The royal family has already registered it and its designation is still there. The Wei Wu Army doesn't have many people. I know a few, only about a thousand."
 Hu Qingfeng was a little disappointed.
 Was it like this?
 However, this would also cause some trouble for hou Xiaochen. After all, the imperial family and the nine divisions were not on good terms. If he used the imperial family's name to raise a Wei Wu Army, it might cause some dissatisfaction among the nine divisions.
 But ... It didn't matter!
 It's just a small matter!
 It would be a joke to expect such a small thing to topple hou Xiaochen.
  "Cough, cough, cough ..."
 Hou Xiaochen coughed again, interrupting Hu Qingfeng's thoughts. He said softly,"In addition, after finishing your work here, it's best for Special Agent Hu to make preparations and go to the three northern provinces. Right now, the night patrolmen have just received the news and may not have the time to send people here."
 Hu Qingfeng frowned and didn't say anything.
 He didn't want to go over!
 He was not afraid of anything but the expert who had killed general kou.
 It was so dangerous!
 He didn't answer but changed the topic.""Minister hou, there's no hurry. What I'm thinking about now is whether Silver Moon will still have the manpower to fight the three major organizations once they start a war. In addition, the Ruins of Heaven battling city were quite dangerous, so wasn't it a good thing to fall out with the three great organizations? We've originally agreed to explore together and share the risks, but now that we've fallen out with the three large organizations, Silver Moon will have to bear all the risks ..."
 Did it make sense?
 A little.
 During the previous exploration, if the three major organizations had not joined forces with the night patrollers, the night patrollers would probably not have been able to enter the inner city, and they would have suffered heavy losses.
