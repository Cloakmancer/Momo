        "So I can swim whenever I want?"
         "If you're not afraid of drowning, it's up to you,"
         Li Hao's mood suddenly improved. The moon sea ... Although it was only a branch, it didn't matter. He had never seen the sea.
         He heard that there were naked beauties by the beach ... Ahem, people who sunbathed.
         "Chief, are there any beaches near the encampment?"
         p "Of course there are, but there aren't many people there. That's a military restricted area."  This time, Li Hao was a little disappointed. It was a restricted area!
         What a pity!
         Not for himself, but for his teacher.
          He was still thinking that when his teacher came one day, he could take him to see some beautiful women who were sunbathing. Now, it seemed like he could only give up.
         ……
         There was a forest near the moon sea.
         The artificial forest covered a large area, covering thousands of acres. In the middle of the artificial forest was an open space. Looking down, the square artificial forest had a hollow in the middle. It was a building.
         This piece of empty land also occupied several hundred mu of land.
         At this moment, looking down from the sky, he could see some figures moving, but there were not many.
         Underground building.
         At this moment, the shouts continued.
         However, the area around this place was a restricted area and an important military area. No one would come here usually. In addition, the surrounding artificial woods also had some silencing effect. Under normal circumstances, even if the noise was a little loud, it would not spread out of the jungle.
         The building was built in a circular shape, but in the middle was a huge square, which was also the training field and the soldier counting platform.
         The square was not small either. It was close to 50 acres of land and 30000 square meters.
         In an emergency, they could even gather 100000 troops.
         Of course, there were not many people around.
         Although the sky was already dark, there were still lights gathered here, illuminating the square.
         In the middle of the square, there were some people standing.
         Different from the martial artists around them, the martial masters all wore the same uniform, which was very similar to the inspector 's. However, there were some differences. They all wore red badges, while the inspector and the night patrollers didn't wear badges. They only had epaulets, which represented their rank.
         Some of the people in the middle were dressed in casual clothes, while others were dressed in short sleeves. There were not many people, but they were of all kinds. It was obvious that they were not bound by ordinary rules.
         At that moment, a chubby middle-aged man with eyes so small that they seemed to have narrowed into slits laughed first.""Chief Yu will come over later. I heard that he's sending a person over. It's yuan Shuo's disciple."
         "Li Hao?"
          Someone added. Clearly, they were well-informed.  "It's him!"
         "Yuan Shuo ..." The fat man laughed."He's the old devil from back then. We've never had any dealings with him. When we were practicing martial arts, he had already retired from the martial world. But everyone here knows him, right?"
         Martial arts didn't come out of thin air. Naturally, someone had to pass it down.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Some of the people present had gloomy expressions and snorted.""He was the one who killed my uncle master, so of course I know him!"
         "My Grand Master also died at his hands!"
         "If it wasn't for the Minister's protection over the years ... I would have killed that old demon!"
         “……”
         Some people were very angry. Yuan Shuo had killed many people back then, and they were all famous martial masters.
         And these people had all stepped into the thousand warrior realm.
         At the level of a warrior of thousands, there were a few who had been practicing martial arts for about twenty years. Even if the mysterious person had appeared and reduced the time, the ones present had been practicing martial arts for the shortest time, at least ten years. The generation before them happened to be in Yuan Shuo's period.
         Someone looked at the fatty and said in a deep voice,"Mu Lin, I heard that your brother mu Sen has a good relationship with Yuan Shuo. Are you trying to stand up for Li Hao by saying this?."
         "It's a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding. How could that be?"Mu Lin laughed. Besides, why should I stand up for him? Li Hao was also a Martial Master who had broken through 100 perfection, and he was not a nobody. He had killed the first disciple of the eyebrows-up stick, so he was not a real newcomer. Martial arts training is short, but you're not weak!"
         Mu Lin laughed."I'm just informing you in advance. Now that Li Hao is here, what should we do with him?"
         The Wei Wu Army had a Captain and a vice captain.
         And the Deputy was Mu Lin.
         However, the few Centurions present were actually not very convinced by him.
         This fatty was timid when fighting, but he was the first one to ask for benefits. Sometimes, he was also very annoying.
         However, for Mu Lin to be able to become this Deputy and the second-in-command of the Wei Wu Army, he naturally had some skills, such as ... Stirring up trouble!
          Mu Lin saw that everyone was silent and laughed,""I've thought about it. Why don't we let him be the centurion ... After all, he's yuan Shuo's disciple, and it's not appropriate to not give him face. Although his strength has not reached the level of a warrior, the five birds sect is famous. He might be able to defeat a warrior!"
         "Mulin, if you have something to say, then say it. What do you want?"
         "How rude!" Mu Lin sighed.
         After sighing, he quickly smiled and said,"alright, to be honest, I don't really want to do anything. I just want to let us test his skills. I've been thinking of forming a personal guard Army recently. I'm a chiliarch, but I don't have a single person under me. It's uncomfortable. I'm interested in this guy and want to recruit him as the captain of my personal guards. Let us try him out, what do you think?"
         The few of them frowned.
         What was this guy up to recently?
         There was a reason why Mu Lin could be the Deputy. At least this guy's brain was more flexible than many people 's.
         The few of them didn't want to pay attention, but they were still eager to try.
         Yuan Shuo's disciple!
         Some wanted to take revenge, some wanted to intimidate the other party, and some wanted to make friends ...
        
         Of course, the other party was sent by the hou tribe. He did not have the guts to kill him.
         But isn't it normal for martial masters to spar?
         Martial masters spoke with their strength. If they entered the Wei Wu Army through the back door, then they couldn't blame everyone for not giving them face.
         At this moment, Mu Lin's voice was loud and clear as he said,""Stop, stop, stop practicing! The disciple of Yuan Shuo, the last disciple of the five bird King, will be coming soon. Everyone, please welcome him!"
         As soon as he said this, a series of voices rang out in the surroundings.
         "Old demon Yuan's disciple?"
         "The old Devil's disciple actually dares to come here? He was the one who killed my Grand Master back then ..."
         "He killed your Grand Master? Keep bragging! It's not like I don't know your Grandmaster. The sect master of the iron fist sect, although his Iron Fist is powerful, it wasn't ranked at that time. The old devil had nothing better to do, so why did he go and kill your Grandmaster?"
         ,m “……”  In an instant, the surroundings were filled with discussions.
          There were not many people who had a grudge against Yuan Shuo.
         That was because the person Yuan Shuo killed represented his strength and status. Back then, if the Martial Master wasn't famous enough, he wouldn't have challenged him.
         Some people liked to brag about this.
         For example,"my master was killed by him". This actually represented a kind of strength, because those who could be killed by Yuan Shuo were all experts from back then.
         Therefore, other than a few martial masters who had come from famous sects, most of the others were curious.
         It can't be helped. As a Martial Master, and one of Silver moon's martial masters at that, you can't avoid this person and this name.
         Yuan Shuo!
         If this person was completely crippled and retired in the Silver City, there would be no more legends about him in the martial world after a few more years.
         However, he had appeared again!
         At this moment, all the martial masters in the encampment looked toward the gate in front of them. There was a huge gate, or rather, a gatehouse, and people would have to come in from there.
         ……
         The car drove into the forest.
         Li Hao opened his eyes and looked forward.
         Vaguely, he could see some orbs ... Martial masters were out of the question, but the station clearly had a few supers. They might be used to assist the Martial Master, and some of them were very suitable to work with the Martial Master.
         For example, the soaring system and the scouting system were all required by martial masters.
         As for Li Hao, the closer he got, the more excited he became.
         There were many experts!
         He had power!
         With so many martial masters gathered here, there were nearly a hundred who had comprehended force. The gathering of these martial masters gave off a heavy pressure.
          Li Hao suddenly sat up straight. He turned around to look at Chief Steward Yu and said in a deep voice,""Can I kill someone?"  “……”
         The driver's hand trembled, and Chief Steward Yu also frowned slightly.
         Li Hao said in a deep voice,"my master's enemies are everywhere. There are so many martial masters here. I'm his last disciple. There will be a lot of people looking for trouble!" If it were me, I wouldn't mind, but I can't embarrass my five birds sect!"
         "Otherwise, others will say that your five birds sect is only so-so!"
         "I'm not interested in those who are too weak, but if there is a warrior of a Qian who provokes me ... I can't hold back and kill the other party. Will there be any problems?"
         Chief Steward Yu was also a Martial Master in the past, so he naturally knew the meaning behind it.
         She frowned slightly, and after a while, she said in a deep voice,""With your strength, other than a few people, it's impossible for you to lose control of the others. Li Hao, it's not a problem for you to get injured in a spar, but you have to remember that even if the Wei Wu Army isn't from the same sect, they're still colleagues. Killing your colleagues is not what a Martial Master seeks!"
         "I'm not yet!"
         "Forget it," Li Hao said."How about this? as long as they don't insult the five birds sect, my teacher, or kill me ... I won't kill them on purpose!"
         At this point, Chief Steward Yu had nothing to say.
         She had been a famous Martial Master in the past, so she knew all too well about this. If Li Hao really didn't care, he wouldn't be able to stand here. No one would look up to him, even if he had a powerful teacher.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, was a little excited.
         There were many martial masters!
         There was also a lot of influence. Although it might not be as prosperous as Silver Moon martial forest back then, with so many martial masters gathered here, there might be some unexpected gains.
         Seeing different forces, comprehending different martial arts.
         It might be helpful to his comprehension of Shi.
         If the people in front of him were all supers, he would not be interested, but they were all martial masters, and he felt some hostility ... If they really dared to provoke him, then they could not blame him for being impolite!
         The car slowly came to a stop.
          A huge gatehouse appeared in front of them.
         "The Wei Wu Army!"
         The three large words hung on the gate tower looked extraordinary, but Li Hao only took a glance at them. They might have been written by hou Xiaochen, but they were far inferior to the two words on heaven battling city's wall, so there was no need to look at them.
         Before he even got out of the car, a monstrous aura had already surged out uncontrollably.
         Behind the gatehouse, there was a dense mass of people.
         Hundreds of martial masters had gathered!
         Li Hao got out of the car and felt some pressure at first glance. There was more than one warrior of the thousand world. At this moment, teams of 100 warriors were quickly gathering into a square formation, which gave Li Hao even more pressure.
         If it was a mess, there would not be much pressure.
         A Martial Master stood in front of each troop.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At the very front was a fatty who looked a little familiar ... Upon closer inspection, he looked very similar to mu Sen, except that his eyes were smaller. Li Hao quickly guessed that this was probably the Big Brother mu Sen had mentioned.
        
         He was also the Vice commander of the Wei Wu Army.
         "Welcome, chief Yu, welcome, people of the five birds sect!"
         The fat man shouted from far away, revealing a bright smile.
         At this moment, Chief Steward Yu also got out of the car. His face was cold and he did not say anything.
         At this moment, Li Hao also buttoned his shirt.
         After thinking for a while, he rolled up his sleeves.
         Acting weak and cowardly also depended on the location and time.
         In front of a group of martial masters, some of whom were about the same age as him, there was no point in pretending to be weak.
         These people were obviously trying to give him a show of strength.
         I won 't!
          Hou Xiaochen clearly wanted him to join the Wei Wu Army, so ... He might as well give them a taste of his own medicine!
         If he wanted to live well, he had to take action when he had to.
         Li Hao followed Chief Steward Yu and walked forward.
         The further they went, the greater the pressure.
         The sense of oppression was very strong!
         In the distance, the square teams were even showing signs of being overwhelmed by qi and blood. The martial masters had cold expressions as their qi and blood surged. Ordinary superpowers would probably not be able to control the mysterious energy in their bodies at this time.
         "Mu Lin!"
         Chief Steward Yu shouted, and Mu Lin hurriedly ran over. He smiled and said,""Chief, you're here, so please forgive me for not welcoming you!"
         "It's already so late, are you still training?"
         "Yes, our brothers insisted on additional training. We had no choice. We couldn't stop them!"
         Mu Lin looked at Li Hao and chuckled,""You're Li Hao? I've long heard about the last disciple of the five birds sect. My younger brother often talks about him and says that he's a talent. Meeting him for the first time is indeed better than hearing about him!"
         Li Hao nodded slightly.
         He didn't say anything, only looking at the martial masters behind him.
         The martial masters were also looking at Li Hao, giving him even more pressure.
         Li Hao carefully sensed that these people still had some vigor. It seemed that they had fought before, not those martial masters who cultivated in seclusion. This was interesting. Who had these martial masters fought with?
         It was impossible for the news of a battle between thousands of martial masters to not leak out.
         At this moment, Li Hao was no longer polite. He looked at the people behind him and suddenly smiled."It seems that the seniors are somewhat dissatisfied with me. Perhaps it has something to do with my identity as a member of the five birds sect ..."
         Many people's eyes flickered.
         "My master killed many people in the past. I don't know if he killed the relatives and friends of some of the people present ... However, it's normal for people to die in a spar between martial masters. If you can't accept it, you should leave the martial arts world as soon as possible!"
         Li Hao smiled brightly."Since you're angry, why don't you vent it out? since I'm here, I don't mind helping you vent your anger ... Those who feel that there's a need to spar with me, just come out!" If you think you can't win, then come at me all at once, I'll take them all!"
         “……”
         The surroundings were silent.
         The next moment, the clamor rose again.
         How arrogant!
         Mu Lin, who was opposite him, was also stunned. Something was wrong!
         This wasn't the Li Hao her brother had mentioned.
         This kid, his words were too arrogant!
         In the distance, a douqian Martial Master said coldly,""Li Hao, you'd better think this through! This is the Wei Wu Army. Everyone will give face to the Minister and not do anything to you, but you provoked us first ... That's a different story!"
         Li Hao looked at the man and saw that he was holding a short axe. He smiled.""The one who uses an axe, could he be ... The successor of the mountain splitting axe? The one who was killed by my master with three punches? My master said that the mountain splitting axe is not weak, but it is still lacking compared to fame. He couldn't stop his hand for a while. "
         "Bastard!"
         The axe-wielding expert instantly jumped up and appeared in front of Li Hao, his eyes cold.
         "Li Hao, don't you dare die!" This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao sighed."Don't give me that. We're all martial masters. You're the most hostile when I come!" He can't wait to chop me to death with his axe, so why should I be polite?"
         Li Hao laughed."Since that's the case, let's be direct. We're all martial masters, so there's no need to learn superpowers. If you have any grudges, just say it and then fight. That's more straightforward, right?"
         The axe-wielding expert sneered,"that's right!" Li Hao, you're interesting. I'm Chen Jin, the successor of the mountain splitting axe. However, I've been in the warrior dimension for five years. Fine, I won't bully the weak. I'll let my disciple meet you. I'd like to see what kind of trash your current successor of the five birds sect is!"
         "There's no need for that!"
         At this moment, Li Hao stomped on the ground with his leather boots, and the floor cracked as he took a step.
         He threw a light punch at the other party and said in an indifferent tone,""You should do it yourself. I'm afraid your disciple is too weak!"
         "Hmph!"
         Chen Jin coldly snorted and swung his axe at him. He knew that Li Hao's fist was nothing compared to the Tiger fighting technique and the five birds technique.
         His punches were not fast enough!
         This axe wasn't too powerful. Li Hao frowned."Using force, who are you looking down on?"
         In the next moment, Li Hao suddenly let out a roar that was like a tiger's roar in the forest. Chen Jin suddenly coughed, blood flowing out of the corner of his mouth, and his internal organs violently shook!
         His expression changed. In the next moment, he roared and struck out with his axe!
         As he swung the axe, a mountain-like axe appeared on his body. It was the mountain splitting axe!
         Li Hao's roar was enough to tell him that he had met a formidable opponent.
         At this moment, Li Hao did not hold back at all. Since his opponent had already gone all out, there was no need to hold back.
         Otherwise, he would seem like a bully.
         This time, his fist was faster.
         It was very fast, extremely fast!
         This punch didn't use sword force, but a fierce tiger appeared on Li Hao's body. The five birds sect naturally used the Tiger Force.
         BOOM!
         With a loud bang, Li Hao's fist, which didn't seem to be fast, hit the axe before it could even reach him. At this moment, a Tiger came out of its cage. As if it had smelled something, it opened its mouth and struck out with its claws!
         The mountain-like axe was instantly split apart by the Tiger!
         The collision of forces!
         With a loud bang, Li Hao's fist hit the axe. With a crack, the extremely tough axe was directly broken by this punch!
         Li Hao stomped on the ground and punched again!
         BOOM!
         With a loud sound, the punch hit his opponent's chest. With a crack, his bones were broken and he was sent flying. Chen Jin, the successor of the mountain splitting axe, had his momentum broken by Li Hao's first punch. The second punch had seriously injured him and sent him flying!
         Bang! Bang!
         Chen Jin fell heavily to the ground, continuously coughing up blood. He looked at Li Hao in disbelief.
         At this moment, the entire square was silent.
         Li Hao withdrew his fist and didn't continue to attack. He looked around and smiled."It seems that my five birds sect is still better!"
          Everyone was silent.
         Many people's eyes were filled with disbelief. The few Centurions also had grave looks in their eyes.
         He had defeated the successor of the mountain splitting axe in the fifth year of Dou Qian with two punches!
         This guy was stronger than he had imagined!
         As for Mu Lin, he opened his mouth and was speechless for a long time. He found it unbelievable. Didn't you say that Li Hao only broke through 100?
         I'll go!
         This information is so outdated!
         Behind Li Hao, Chief Steward Yu's expression also changed slightly. She glanced at Li Hao. She knew that Li Hao's sword energy was very powerful, but just now ... It didn't seem like a sword energy. Was that a Tiger energy?
         Li Hao's divine will could change continuously?
         After two punches, a Centurion was severely injured and fell to the ground. At this moment, the Wei Wu Army could not react in time. This ... Was a member of the five birds sect?
        
         On the square.
         Li Hao took a step forward, looking arrogant and domineering!
         Of course, he didn't think so.
         No matter why hou Xiaochen had asked him to join the Wei Wu Army, as a Martial Master, he was not willing to lower his head in a place filled with martial masters.
         Especially when his teacher was the old demon Yuan Shuo!
         After defeating the successor of the mountain splitting axe with two punches, Li Hao's qi and blood were boiling. At this moment, he was showing the might of a Tiger.
         "Minister hou asked me to join the Wei Wu Army ... But I'm not very willing!"
         Li Hao's voice was loud."I think you martial masters can't compare to the martial masters of the past, so I don't think there's a need to join you. If I, Li Hao, want to compete, I'll compete with the older martial masters!"
         "Some of them have gone to the central region, and some have become supers. I have seen the late three suns 'Qi Mei staff. Although he is no longer a Martial Master, I think he still has the heart of a Martial Master!"
         "I think I'll be very happy to fight with such a Martial Master!"
          "At noon, I went to see senior He Yong of the southern Fist and wanted to spar with him, but he refused. He said that either I beat him to death, or he would beat me to death ... He was unwilling to fight to the death because he wanted to fight with my teacher!"
         "I think it's a pity that a Martial Master like him doesn't want to fight with me. It's my regret!"
         Li Hao looked around and swept his gaze over everyone.""I know that the older generation of martial masters look down on us. They think that we are young, and even if we are strong, we are far from our generation ... Even if we have the strength of a thousand warrior, they only have the strength of a hundred!"
         "So, when I felt your hostility and your fighting spirit ... I was very happy. I felt that I, Li Hao, might not be looked upon favorably by any of the older martial masters, but if I were to sweep away the Wei Wu Army, in the future, if someone asks me,'Li Hao, what battle records do you have?'"
         "I'll tell them that I once swept through the Wei Wu Army, the Wei Wu Army that scared all of you back then!"
         As soon as he said that, auras rose from all directions!
         A Woman in Black training clothes quickly jumped out, her face cold."Li Hao, do you think you can defeat the Wei Wu Army?"
         Li Hao smiled and nodded,"I think I can!" Not only that, I think that no one here can even last more than ten moves from me! You guys ... Can 't!"
         "Jade Sword School, Xie Lan! Please give me your guidance!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The woman shouted coldly and swung her sword!
         Li Hao was slapping them in the face, not just one or two people, but the entire Wei Wu Army.
         The successor of the mountain splitting axe had been defeated. Although everyone knew that Li Hao was strong, martial masters would not admit defeat. Even if they knew that they were no match for Li Hao, they would never admit that they were weaker than him.
         Buzzzzzz!
         The sword broke through the sky and the cold light of the sword shone in all directions.
         The martial masters became nervous.
         As soon as Li Hao arrived, he defeated Chen Jin. They really hoped that Xie Lan of the Jade Sword School would win.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, strode forward at an extremely fast speed. He leaped into the air and stomped his foot. With a loud boom, the long sword was directly stomped into the ground!
         The web between his thumb and forefinger split open. Xie Lan wanted to control the sword, but he found that he couldn't pull it away.
         The next moment, Li Hao punched out, and the roar of a Tiger resounded in the forest.
         It was like a hot knife through butter!
         He was too strong!  Xie Lan's expression changed, and he quickly retreated. Li Hao, on the other hand, instantly pounced forward.
         In an instant, he tore through the void and appeared in front of Xie Lan. Xie Lan's face changed and he kicked out, but Li Hao punched heavily!
         BOOM!
         Xie Lan was sent flying backward, his right leg slightly curled up. But with a roar, he turned around and pointed at Li Hao's head with his hand like a sword!
         Li Hao opened his mouth.
         "Roar!"
         Tiger roar!
         A fierce tiger seemed to be on Li Hao's back. Its roar shook the world, and its inner strength exploded. Before Xie Lan's sword Qi could touch Li Hao, Li Hao grabbed it with his claws. Crack!
         It was as if a piece of metal had been shattered. The sword Qi was clearly made of inner strength, but it was directly crushed by Li Hao's grip. His inner strength exploded!
         After crushing the sword Qi, Li Hao's tiger roar reverberated through the air. Xie Lan was slightly dazed, and Li Hao punched out!
         Bang! Bang!
         With a loud bang, Xie Lan was sent flying, and blood spurted out of his mouth as he crashed heavily onto the ground. He landed right beside Chen Jin, who was just about to get up, and crashed into him once more!
         In the blink of an eye, two of the nine Centurions were quickly defeated.
         He had no power to fight back!
         The remaining people's expressions changed.
         Li Hao said coldly,"I told you. One person isn't enough. I told you to come at me together. Why are you being so pretentious?!" Martial masters like to fight one on one, and that's built on the foundation that their strength is equal. You're too weak, and going up one by one is just courting death. If it wasn't for the fact that the gap between you and them is too big, and you don't have the heart to kill, you would all be dead!"
         These words were no longer a slap in the face.
         Instead, he sat on his head and pooped!
         In an instant, three people jumped out.
         All three of them were men. At this moment, one of them was using a saber, one was using a spear, and the last one was bare-handed, but his palms were pitch-black, as all his inner power was concentrated in his palms.
          "Zhang Yang from the five tigers broken blade sect!"
         "The successor of the heart-crushing palm, Wu Yue!"
         "Luo family Spear's successor, Luo qizhao!"
         "Please give me some pointers!"
         The moment the three of them finished speaking, they thrust their long Spears forward. Their killing intent shook the heavens and they roared like a Blood Dragon.
         The five tigers broken blade sect spread their wings and slashed down with their blade.
         Heart-crushing palm, Wu Yue, also struck at Li Hao silently.
         With the three of them working together, Li Hao's throat, heart, and head were locked in an instant. The Divine Will of the three Dou Qian martial masters burst out and locked onto Li Hao with godlike power!
         All the martial masters present took a deep breath, afraid to miss a scene.
         It was extremely rare for three Centurions to join forces to kill an enemy. Previously, two centurions had joined forces to fight a three-sun super and the centurion had won!
        
         The Qian fighters here were not weak.
         The two centurions working together had the confidence to defeat some of the three suns. Of course, it was already unbelievable to say that they were only at the initial stage.
         It was obvious that the three of them felt that Li Hao might be stronger than an ordinary early three yang realm cultivator.
         ……
         On the field.
         Li Hao's expression did not change. When the spear came, his right hand was as fast as lightning. He grabbed the spear with one hand, roared, and pulled hard, causing the Luo family's spear descendant to stagger and lose his balance.
         Terrifying!
         Luo qizhao's expression changed instantly, and his long spear trembled violently.
         Inner strength surged out, and the spear was filled with inner strength.
         However, Li Hao threw his spear. Luo qizhao almost lost control of his spear, and it instantly pierced the heart-crushing palm.
          Li Hao swung his spear with his right hand, but his left hand instantly clenched into a fist. He raised his hand and punched out!
         Clang!
         With a crisp sound, the saber was knocked away from his head. Li Hao turned his head and dodged the saber. Then, he stomped on the ground and, in an instant, hung in the air like an ape. His figure flickered and suddenly disappeared before their eyes.
         "Be careful!"
         The macheteman missed his target and suddenly cried out in alarm. His expression changed as he used heart-crushing palm. Just as he was about to Dodge the attack, he felt his neck being locked. Li Hao descended from the sky like a monkey and wrapped his legs around his neck.
         Ka ka!
         A series of bone-twisting sounds came from his neck. Without saying a word, he struck at Li Hao with the heart-crushing palm. Meanwhile, Li Hao crossed his legs, and in an instant, he suddenly turned upside down and hit his knees with both fists!
         Bang! Bang!
         He knelt on the ground and couldn't get up. His knees were in extreme pain!
         Li Hao nimbly jumped down and kicked backward with his right leg. Like a monkey leaping into the air, he kicked out. With a bang, the kneeling heart destruction palm was directly kicked away!
         Bang! Bang!
         He fell heavily to the ground.
         At this moment, a long spear stabbed at Li Hao's waist. This time, there was no sound, no roar of the blood Dragon, only ruthlessness!
         Li Hao snorted and grabbed the spear. Like a small snake, he slithered along the spear and got close to the Luo family's spear descendant.
         At this moment, Li Hao suddenly stretched out his arms and hugged the man.
         The next moment, Li Hao roared. Like a giant bear hugging a tree and uprooting a Willow, he directly lifted the Luo family's spear descendant and slammed him into the ground!
         BOOM!
         A huge pit was created on the ground. Luo clan's spear descendant was locked down by Li Hao and couldn't move. He was smashed into the ground by Li Hao.
         Bear fighting technique!
         Li Hao used the Tiger fighting technique, the bear fighting technique, the flying bird technique, the ape technique ...
         Other than the deer eluding technique, he had displayed it all.
         The deer mind control technique was mainly used to make one's body light and escape. Li Hao obviously didn't need it at the moment.
         In the blink of an eye, the Luo clan spear technique and heart-crushing palm were both forced back. One of them was sent flying while the other was smashed into the ground, causing the surrounding martial masters to turn pale with shock.
         The three great experts had joined forces, but two of them had actually been taken care of in the blink of an eye. It was unbelievable.
         The remaining Saberman's expression also changed drastically!
         "Kill!"
         With a roar, he slashed at Li Hao.  At this moment, Li Hao punched out. This time, it was as if seven huge waves were sweeping across the world.
         A deafening sound rang out.
         The large saber was directly broken by this punch, and sparks flew in all directions!
         The swordsman's hand split open, and blood splattered everywhere. His face was filled with disbelief.
         One punch!
         This is ... The ninth-refinement force?
         The silver spear's ninth refinement force was also very famous.
         Just as this name appeared, a fist shadow was imprinted on his chest. BOOM!
         Bang! Bang!
         The Saberman was sent flying. This punch was heavier than the previous ones. The chest of the Saberman had obviously caved in!
         Defeat!
         Under the joint attack of the three great Dou Qian martial masters, they only managed to hold on for a moment before they were defeated!
         ……
         Mu Lin's mouth opened wide!
         Chief Steward Yu was also a little surprised.
         This wasn't a sword force, but the five birds technique.
         Li Hao didn't display his strongest sword technique, but merely relied on the five birds technique and the nine-refined force to instantly kill three Qian-fighters. This made majordomo Yu extremely surprised.
         She knew that Li Hao was very strong, and he was the one who killed Yu Xiao.
         However, in her imagination, Li Hao would definitely use his sword form to fight to the death. But today, Li Hao hadn't even used his sword form.
         On the field.
         Li Hao exhaled, looked over, smiled, and waved his hand.""The four of you together might not be able to last more than thirty moves. Do you still want to try? Or, let thousand-man commander mu go with you!"
         He actually didn't care about four.
         Mu Lin smiled. His eyes were so closed that he could not see anything.
         How arrogant!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The remaining four Centurions looked at the five people on the ground with grave expressions.
         In the blink of an eye, the five thousand warrior fighters were defeated!
          Even if the four of them joined forces, they might not be able to defeat Li Hao. What a terrifying guy. Since when did such a monster appear in the martial arts world?
         This was over a hundred?
         Everyone instantly turned to look at Mu Lin.
         At this moment, Mu Lin had no choice but to step out. He smiled and said,"Li Hao, you're very powerful. Not bad, not bad! Let's stop here. Everyone, please welcome ..."
         Li Hao turned to look at Mu Lin and smiled.""No, not enough! Captain mu, I'd like to see if your iron cloth or Golden Bell shield is strong! If the second person in the Wei Wu Army is as weak as them, then I'll be so disappointed!"
         "We're all on the same side ..."Mu Lin laughed.
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He punched out, and the roar of a Tiger resounded in the forest.
         At this point, if I don't get to the bottom of this, how can I agree?
         BOOM!
         With a loud noise, Mu Lin took a step back, but his expression did not change. He looked at Li Hao, who had punched him, and grinned.""Do you think this will work? Why don't we stop here?"
        
         Li Hao was a little surprised. He looked at him and his chest. He had just taken a punch from him, but he was fine!
         It was as if he had hit an iron block!
         He was countless times stronger than Chen Jian, who had been in the small team back in Silver City.
         Chen Jian was also a defense-type and had cultivated a secret skill called Earth Dragon cover. He was very strong, but compared to this person, he was not even worth mentioning!
         Li Hao raised his eyebrows and took a step back.
         The other martial masters in the square all heaved a sigh of relief. If Li Hao really defeated everyone, they would lose all their face.
         Fortunately, their vice-captain could still be relied on at critical moments!
         He was dressed in iron cloth and was extremely powerful.
         Even an expert like Li Hao, who could send Dou Qian flying with one punch, did not hurt Mu Lin at all.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At this moment, Li Hao smiled.""Amazing! I wonder who's stronger, you or secretary Wang from the inspection Division? I'm talking about the iron cloth martial art. He turned it into a superpower, and now he might have disabled the iron cloth ..."
          Mu Lin laughed."If I use my powers, I might not be as good as him. If I don't use my powers ... He has only broken through 100. How can he compare with me?"
         Li Hao laughed."Then, Captain mu, do you know that my teacher once blew up the famous tie Buyi with his bare hands?" he asked.
         With tie Buyi as the name!
         This was true strength. It represented that all the experts who cultivated iron cloth during that era were inferior to that person. In the end, he was still defeated by Yuan Shuo.
         "I know," Mu Lin laughed,"but you're not Yuan Shuo! Li Hao, that's enough ... As long as everyone knows how powerful you are ..."
         "No, I don't need to!"
         "The strong don't need the weak to know how strong they are. I just need the strong to know how strong I am!"
         In an instant, Li Hao's aura changed.
         Using his hand as a sword!
         The sword was like a mountain. At this moment, it was as if the mountain had turned into a sword and was slashing towards the forest!
         Earth sword force!
         Mu Lin's expression changed slightly. So strong!
         He also let out a fierce shout. His entire body emitted golden light as he charged directly at Li Hao. The iron cloth was not only for defense, but also for offense. He himself was the best weapon for offense!
         The sword Qi was like a mountain!
         Li Hao's right hand was like a sword, and he slashed at him. With a boom, the sword hit the opponent's fist.
         Bang! Bang!
         The collision of two bodies actually produced sparks, as if two blades of metal had collided. Li Hao retreated lightly, like a startled deer, and instantly drifted far away.
         A golden light also flickered on Mu Lin's fist. Li Hao's sword pierced through it, leaving a bloody mark.
         In the blink of an eye, the blood disappeared.
         "Li Hao, you're quite ruthless, I won't be polite then ..." Mu Lin said in a deep voice.
         Although he was fat, his movements were sharp.
         In an instant, it rose from the ground and charged at Li Hao without any hesitation.
         Tie Buyi was strong!
         A series of metal doors seemed to appear on his body. This was his will-invincible in defense and unafraid of attacks!
         Li Hao raised his eyebrows and used his hand as a sword.
         In an instant, he stabbed out hundreds of times!  Shadowless Sword!
         Ding ding ding!
         The sound of swords piercing through iron cloak could be heard as the two figures continued to fight. It was only at this moment that everyone realized that their vice chiliarch was also ridiculously powerful. They had never noticed it before.
         The other Centurions, including the ones who had been defeated, were also watching intently. They could not care less about their injuries. They were both nervous and excited.
         He hoped that Mu Lin could take Li Hao down!
         Mu Lin was very strong, but he usually hid in fights. Today, he was forced to fight by Li Hao.
         As for Li Hao, the more he fought, the more shocked he became.
         Amazing!
         This fellow was even stronger than Yu Xiao who was killed that day.
         Was this the power of a top-tier Qian warrior?
         If this continued, his words would become bragging.
         Li Hao snorted. The next moment, a flame appeared, and Mu Lin's expression changed.
         At this moment, Li Hao's aura changed again!
         Earth sword force fused with fire sword force!
         The sword force outline appeared!
         Three swords in one!
         "Kill!"
         Li Hao roared and slashed out with his sword, sky-breaking sword.
         Mu Lin's expression changed and he cursed in his heart.
         Did this guy break a hundred?
         My cute little brother, when your parents gave birth to you, why didn't they stuff you into a cesspit and drown you? how many people will die because of this information?
         He cursed in his heart. This time, he wasn't arrogant. He didn't want to take it head-on either. He immediately flashed and fled!
         However, at this moment, Li Hao stomped on the ground!
         BOOM!
         The ground caved in. In an instant, it was as if a mountain peak was pressing down. A Tiger was trapped in the mountain. At this moment, it was as if it had just come out of the Tiger cage. In an instant, the Tiger came out of the mountain!
          "Stop!"
         "Break!" Mu Lin roared as golden light flickered on his body. With a loud bang, a sword light broke through his body!
         Boom! Boom! Boom!
         The sword energies collided for a while, and after a moment, everyone could see the scene clearly.
         The ground caved in and Mu Lin was directly slashed into the ground. At this moment, his clothes were in tatters, revealing his strong muscles. However, his body was now covered in blood and a shocking sword mark!
         Li Hao took a step in the air and avoided the collapse of the ground. Panting slightly, he looked at the forest and said after a long time,""Captain mu is indeed powerful. My sword attack once seriously injured a late stage three yang expert ... I didn't expect that Captain mu would actually block it!"
         "Pfft!"
         Mu Lin spat out a mouthful of blood and crawled out of the hole. He looked at Li Hao with his eyes wide open, and said with some anger,""I've already shouted for it to stop!"
         F * ck, you're still a coward?
         Fortunately, he, tie Buyi, was truly powerful. Otherwise, would he not be killed by this sword?
        
         Li Hao frowned."If we stop now, I'll be the one injured. Thousand-man Captain mu, You must be joking!"
         Mu Lin was speechless!
         His injuries looked frightening, but in reality, they weren't that serious. This fellow was indeed astonishingly strong.
         He spat out a mouthful of blood and cursed,"you ... You're too ruthless!"
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He only gave him a strange look.
         He was really strong!
         To be honest, this was beyond Li Hao's expectations.
         Of course, he didn't go all out either. For example, he didn't use the blood saber technique, the sword energy entering the body, or the nine-fold heavenly refinement force ...
         However, the merging of the two swords could be said to be Li Hao's current peak.
         In the end, not only did he fail to kill his opponent, he wasn't even heavily injured. Based on this alone, Li Hao felt that this person might not be weaker than Huang Jie.
          Close to the peak of the three yang realm?
         It was too terrifying!
         Was this a Martial Master?
         Did Mu Lin walk the path of the physical body?
         Strengthen his body, strengthen his body, continue to strengthen ... He was fat, not because he was weak, but because of the accumulation of energy. The blood in his body was extremely strong, and the accumulation of Qi, blood, and inner strength ...
         In an instant, Li Hao understood this person's route!
         He was not an ordinary Qian warrior!
         In fact, such an existence could not be considered as a warrior of thousands.
         Yuan Shuo was called spirit accumulation, He Yong was called blood changing, BA Dao could be called spirit gathering, then this forest, should it be called body strengthening or body forging?
         No matter what, this forest had opened up another path.
         He was no longer at the thousand warrior level!
         There was actually such a person in the Silver Moon martial forest. More importantly, this person was only the Vice-commander, then what about the captain?
         Li Hao's eyes narrowed.
         At this moment, he instantly dispelled any thoughts of underestimating the Wei Wu Army.
         The Deputy was actually comparable to a peak three-yang.
         Then wouldn't that chiliarch be a match for sunguang?
         Chief Steward Yu said that the target of this Wei Wu Army was to deal with Xu Guang. Previously, Li Hao had thought that they would work together ... Could it be that the captain could deal with Xu Guang alone?
         Terrifying!
         No wonder hou Xiaochen didn't care too much about how weak Hao lianchuan was. To be honest, if the two centurions worked together, they might be able to match up to Hao lianchuan, who was at the early three yang realm. If the three of them worked together, they might be able to match up to Hao lianchuan now.
         How much did hou Xiaochen have to pay to raise such a powerful Martial Master to this level?
         Ordinary people couldn't afford it. If Li Hao's guess was correct, these people had probably used divine power stones!
         Yes, the divine power Stone!
         The mysterious energy was limited in enhancing the warrior power.
          The blood God's spawn were not everywhere.  The only thing that could strengthen these Qian fighters was the divine power Stone.
         "Hou Xiaochen ... There's a 90% chance that he's in control of a relic, and it's one that has a large number of divine power stones!"
         In that instant, Li Hao guessed many things.
         As for Mu Lin, he was also extremely depressed. He looked at Li Hao and said,""You ... How do you cultivate? He had only practiced martial arts for a few years? My little brother said that you had only broken through a hundred years ago, and you had just advanced not long ago. Of course, you killed sun moxian, so we all know that you have broken through a hundred years of perfection ... But ... It shouldn't be like this, right?"
         "The five birds sect naturally has a way to make me stronger!" Li Hao looked at him and slowly said.
         Bullshit!
         Mu Lin spat out another mouthful of blood."Do we still fight now?"
         "Forget it," he said.
         Li Hao suddenly laughed."Now that I've seen how powerful the chiliarch is, there's no need to fight him anymore. After all, it's not a life-and-death battle. We can learn from each other more in the future. If it were a life-and-death battle, we wouldn't have held back!"
         ,m “……”  The surrounding martial masters were silent.
         What did that mean?
         Mu Lin slightly raised his brows and laughed,""You still held back? I don't believe you. Why do you like to brag?"
         To put it bluntly, he had really held back.
         He didn't only know how to defend!
         But did Li Hao show any mercy?
         Was this kid bragging?
         Li Hao smiled, but didn't explain.
         Believe it or not!
         However, even if he went all out, it was still unknown whether he could kill Mu Lin. It was hard to say if it was not a life-and-death battle.
         Of course, he did not use the small sword either.
         He had always used his hand as a sword!
          At this moment, Li Hao's interest in the Wei Wu Army was piqued. This Army under hou Xiaochen's command was not ordinary. These martial masters must have some special way of strengthening themselves. Otherwise, it was impossible for their Qian fighters to be so much stronger than the ones outside.
         Any one of these Centurions would definitely not be weaker than Liu Long. They would only be stronger!
         Liu Long was able to fight against a mid-stage sunlight glory expert previously, but when he encountered a late-stage one ... It was hard to say.
         However, any one of these Centurions could probably match the late-stage to the peak of the radiant sun realm.
         It was hard to explain the sudden appearance of so many senior martial masters.
         Mu Lin didn't say anything more. He looked at his tattered clothes and sighed,"Forget it, let's not talk about this! Li Hao, welcome to the Wei Wu Army. This welcome ceremony is not bad, right?"
         Li Hao nodded, smiled, and said,""Is the captain of the Wei Wu Army not here?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "I went out to handle some matters. I'm temporarily the boss here!"
         Mu Lin laughed and looked at the martial masters behind him. He waved his hand and said,""Disperse, disperse! It's just a spar, there's nothing to see. The people from the five birds sect are indeed strong. Everyone, just be more polite in the future!"
         Then, he looked at Li Hao and chief Yu, and said,""Let's go in and have a seat. We'll talk about Li Hao's arrangements. I don't think he'll be the Vice Centurion anymore. Who's willing to be his leader among the nine?"
        
         I can't afford to lose that person!
         In the distance, a few Centurions who were supporting each other lowered their heads in silence.
         Yes, who would want Li Hao?
         Don't mess around!
         Today, he had been defeated by Li Hao in front of the others. If Li Hao joined a team of 100, how would he be arranged as a Centurion?
         In the huge Wei Wu Army, probably only Mu Lin and the chiliarch could suppress them.
         No, even Mu Lin might not be able to do it!
         They had witnessed the battle just now and remembered it in their hearts. Mu Lin's defense was strong, but his attack was not. In the end, Li Hao was almost unscathed. Under such circumstances, it was hard to believe that that sword attack was all Li Hao had!
         ……
         A moment later, the three of them entered a large hall.
          Mu Lin had already put on a new set of clothes.
         "Sit down!"
         He beckoned for Li Hao and Chief Steward Yu to sit down, then looked at Chief Steward Yu and said with a headache,""Chief, does the Marquis tribe have any specific arrangements?"
         "No, I just asked Li Hao to come over."
         Chief Steward Yu took a sip of tea unhurriedly. He seemed to dislike the tea here. After taking a sip, he put down the teacup and looked at Li Hao."Are you interested in staying in the Wei Wu Army?"
         Li Hao smiled and nodded, of course! The premise is that the chiliarch isn't just for show, but an existence stronger than chiliarch mu. I like to live with the strong!"
         "He's stronger than me. Speaking of which, perhaps you've heard of his name before. "Mu Lin also laughed.
         "I'd like to hear the details!"
         "Golden spear!"
         Li Hao was stunned. This time, he was really stunned.
         The Golden spear ... Wasn't it dead?
         He heard that he was dead!
         The Golden spear, one of the three Spears of the Silver Moon!
         How was that possible?
         "Surprised?" Mu Lin laughed and said. The Golden spear was not dead, it was still alive! Furthermore, he had become the captain of the Wei Wu Army. Was this person qualified? Back then, he was the strongest among the Silvermoon three spear strikes! It's as famous as the heavenly Sword. The heavenly Sword, the Overlord blade, the Golden spear, the blade, the sword, and the spear are the three unique!"
         Li Hao frowned,"he's not dead?" Since he didn't die, and my master didn't break through ... Didn't he break through in Silver Moon?"
         Li Hao didn't believe that anyone could break his master's curse!
         If he did, then that person must have surpassed master.
         As the champion of the three spear strikes, Yuan Shuo had naturally fought with the Golden spear before and won.
          At the side, chief Yu said indifferently,"not everyone needs to walk out of the Silver Moon to break through. Those people were unable to break through back then because they were suppressed by Yuan Shuo's will. If someone breaks this will, there will naturally be no obstacles in breaking through!"  Li Hao instantly understood and smiled,"understood!" Taking a shortcut might not be a good thing. "
         Yes, he understood.
         Hou Xiaochen!
         It was hou Xiaochen who had broken his teacher's will, allowing Jin Shan to break through the shackles and break through the thousand Warrior Seal. Therefore, Jin Shan might have broken through many years ago, but he did not leave Silver Moon. He had only joined hou Xiaochen!
         Chief Steward Yu frowned slightly,"a shortcut?" That might not be the case! When someone is stronger than Yuan Shuo, the path of the Golden spear will be wider ..."
         Li Hao, however, did not back down."My teacher is invincible in the same realm! "Breaking through the peak of a hundred when fusing Five Forces ... I don't believe that there's someone stronger than my teacher in the world who can break through a hundred. If there is ... Then he wouldn't be able to make such a reputation! General manager, even if you ask hou bu in person, he wouldn't dare to say that he can match my teacher at the peak of breaking one hundred!"
         Chief Steward Yu's chest heaved up and down, as if he was a little angry.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com This was a rare sight for Mu Lin. He had never seen this person get angry before. It was obvious that he was really angry at this moment.
         He didn't say a word.
         The two of them were not only fighting over who was stronger, but also for the title of number one in martial arts.
         As Yuan Shuo's disciple, Li Hao was obviously unwilling to give in.
         Chief Steward Yu suppressed his anger and said coldly,""They'll only have a chance if they're at the same level. It's a pity that Yuan Shuo didn't enter the tide changing realm during that era ... Otherwise, we might be able to take a look!"
         Li Hao smiled, there will be a chance! We can't break 100 at the same time, but we still have a chance to fight against those above the thousand-fold realm, right?"
         Chief Yu looked at him coldly and did not speak anymore.
         The number one Martial Master!
         Who was the number one?
         Perhaps, he would only find out about this in the future.
         She had no way of proving that hou Xiaochen, who had broken through 100, was stronger than Yuan Shuo ... No one in the entire dynasty would dare to say that. After all, no one could fuse the five Forces together.
          At this time, Mu Lin interrupted the argument and laughed,""Let's not talk about this. Golden spear as a chiliarch, Li Hao, do you still think the Wei Wu Army is trash?"
         Li Hao shook his head,"of course not!" If I had known earlier that golden spear senior was a thousand-man commander, I would have kept a low profile. This kind of senior Martial Master is an existence on par with my master. Although he lost to my master, against me ... There's a 90% chance that I'm no match for him!"
         This was because the other party had broken through to the Dou Qian Class A long time ago, and it was hou Xiaochen who had broken the teacher's will to let the other party advance. It was inevitable that he would be strong.
         Li Hao would even believe that the other party could rival Xuguang!
         Sky sword was in the middle section and became Sunglow. Even among Sunglow, he was a top-notch existence. Golden spear was as famous as sky sword and Overlord blade. Overlord blade was able to kill three suns seven years ago, so how could golden spear be weak?
         Absolutely not!
         No matter how proud Li Hao was, he didn't think that he was a match for his opponent.
         At this moment, Li Hao was also in a daze.
         He had already seen the eyebrows-length staff, the southern Fist, the earth-covered sword, and the Jade Rakshasa among the people on the hero list back then. He knew that the Jade light sword, the sky sword, and the Overlord blade were still alive. Perhaps he would be able to see the Golden spear soon.
         The silver spear was already dead, and the copper spear successor had been killed by him ...
        
         It was really ... Interesting!
         As for the heart-jabbing beauty he had seen before, she was not a character on the hero list. There were only 36 people on the hero list, and some of them had broken through 100 perfection. Although they had their own names, they were not on the hero list.
         If the steward Yu in front of him was really Yu Luosha from the hero list, he would be one of the influential figures back then.
         Calculating it all, it seemed like the earth overturning sword was doing the worst, not counting the people who died.
         Out of the 36 heroes on the list, about a dozen were confirmed to be dead. Almost all of them had died at the hands of Yuan Shuo. Could the rest be alive?
         Back then, Yuan Shuo had killed so many people, and some people had stopped challenging him. In a situation where their strength was equal, if he killed the first, he could kill the second. Otherwise, there would be more people who died.
         Li Hao suddenly thought of Hong Yitang. Why did he feel that this early three suns super was inferior to those who hadn't advanced to super?
         Gold spear and domineering blade had not become supers.
         The southern Fist also felt stronger than Hong Yitang 's.
         Back then, the Earthcover sword was ranked second among the Seven Swords. Li Hao frowned and suddenly felt that Hong Yitang was really crippled. He had rejected the challenge invitation three times and was challenged by Yuan Shuo three times in a row ... This meant that he was really not weak!
          Could it be that because he had not fought, he had lost his energy, which led to his current state?
         Li Hao thought to himself and quickly stopped thinking about it.
         "The Golden spear is naturally powerful," said Mu Lin with a smile."Even if I were to fight it now, I would probably only be able to hold on for a while. There's a high chance that I'll be stabbed to death by it!"
         "It's only interesting if you're powerful," Li Hao said excitedly."Otherwise, it would be boring to come here."
         Mu Lin also laughed,"that's good!" If you join the Wei Wu Army, the Wei Wu Army will be even stronger. However, the arrangements for you ... Are not very good!"
         A Centurion?
         But now that the nine were full, the Wei Wu Army was lacking in numbers. Where were they going to find 100 people for Li Hao?
         Other than the centurion, there was only the vice-captain?
         But with him, and another ... Two of them together?
         As for the chiliarch, he could forget about it.
         Jin gun was hou Xiaochen's direct disciple, and he was very powerful. Li Hao was no match for him at the moment.
         Li Hao didn't hold back. He chuckled and said,""Just like brother mu, just give him a Deputy position. If he doesn't manage things, just give him a temporary position! Of course, big brother mu seems to be a high-level City Patrol ..."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He glanced at chief Yu with a clear meaning, I want it too!
         Chief Steward Yu's expression changed slightly, and he was somewhat speechless!
         You've gone crazy trying to be an official, haven't you?
         Li Hao was only a low-level investigator right now. There were still high-level investigators and low-level investigators above him ... The low-level investigators hadn't even come down yet, and he was actually thinking about getting promoted!
          There weren't many advanced city patrols in the entire Silver Moon.  Among the night patrollers, only a few deputy ministers were. Among the Wei Wu Army, only the captain and vice-captain were. The rest were all low-level city patrollers.
         As for the higher-ranked Imperial inspector, there were only two of them in the huge Silver Moon!
         Kong Jie and hou Xiaochen!
         Mu Lin didn't really care about this. He just said in a speechless manner,""You'll be the assistant ... Then, shall we play chess and chat every day? I think that the hou tribe sent you here because they want you to do something. "
         In other words, he would play chess and find people to chat with every day.
         Li Hao laughed."I'm too young and don't know much about military affairs. An empty position is fine, but an actual position really isn 't!"
         These words were actually a little fake.
         He didn't know much about military affairs, but Li Hao actually knew some military formations, and they were very special military formations recorded in ancient books. However, he was not interested in helping with the training of martial masters at the moment.
         Otherwise, if he were to become a Centurion, he might not be able to understand other things and just follow the instructions. Even if it was not as good as the military formation of the ancient civilization, it should be better than the current one.
         If Li Hao knew how to do it, so did Yuan Shuo. In fact, he knew more.
         However, this master and disciple duo was not very interested in this kind of formation that gathered the strength of everyone and made one person stronger.
         They preferred to be strong!
         Hou Xiaochen had been trying to win Yuan Shuo over. In truth, after Yuan Shuo's breakthrough, hou Xiaochen's plan was simple. He wanted Yuan Shuo to replace Jin gun. No matter how strong Jin gun was, hou Xiaochen believed that Jin gun would not reject him.
         There was no other reason. Yuan Shuo's reputation was too great, and he had even defeated him in the past!
         Hou Xiaochen also believed that if Yuan Shuo wanted to, he could make the Wei Wu Army even stronger!
          Unfortunately, that guy was too arrogant. As soon as he broke through, he immediately caused trouble. He even created the corral spirit martial path, which forced hou Xiaochen to give up on this idea.
         Mu Lin did not say anything else."Let's wait for the boss of the Golden spear to return and the Marquis tribe to make the arrangements. I do not have the authority to make such arrangements."
         Li Hao was asking for too much!
         Chief Steward Yu frowned and said after a long while,""I will report it. I don't know if it will work, but the Marquis wants you to lead a team. Actually, the Marquis has such thoughts. The Wei Wu Army only has nine 100-man teams, so he wants to add one."
         "As for the manpower, we can recruit them. The Wei Wu Army will soon go to the front. My original plan was to let Liu Long replace you if you didn't advance to the Dou Qian class. After you advance, I can arrange for Liu Long ..."
         At this moment, she had no choice but to voice her true thoughts, which were also hou Xiaochen 's.
         They hoped that Li Hao would lead a 100-man team!
         Li Hao fell into deep thought. After a long time, he said,""Minister hou knows that I'm very young ... And that the young representative knows very little. Is he at ease letting me take control of an Army of a hundred martial masters?"
         A hundred people was not a lot.
         But one had to know that they were all martial masters, and almost all of them had broken through 100. It was rare to even see someone in the tenth realm.
        
         Chief Yu said in a deep voice,"the Minister has always been suspicious of people and doesn't use them!" You're Yuan Shuo's disciple, that's enough. "
         Moreover, Li Hao was very strong now, not a weakling like he had previously imagined.
         p This was even better!  Seeing that he was silent, chief Yu continued,"the Minister made this arrangement for your sake. Martial masters are used to fighting alone. They can't solve problems alone at all times. You can try to work together." When you were in the Silver City, you also joined a demon hunting squad. You should understand that the cooperation of martial masters is more powerful than one person. "
         Li Hao thought for a moment."I'll think about it. I'm not ready for that yet. Also, I'm not too sure what the Wei Wu Army needs to do or what they're facing ..."
         Chief Steward Yu said coldly,"two points. First, the ruins!" Second, Pirates!"
         Li Hao was slightly stunned. Pirates?
         He didn't pay much attention to it. Instead, he thought of the ruins, and his eyes moved slightly."A relic?"
         "Yes, haven't you seen the heaven-battling Army?"
         Li Hao took a deep breath."You mean ... There's more than one relic that has an existence like the heaven-battling Army?" he asked.
          "Not bad!"
         At this moment, Li Hao came to a realization!
         The reason why the Wei Wu Army had not appeared was because the enemies they were dealing with were not people that ordinary people could imagine.
         There were some remnants in the ruins, as well as bandits on the sea.
         Who would be able to understand this?
         Now, he knew why the Wei Wu Army was so strong. It was because they had received a lot of benefits from the remains.
         He also understood why he missed his teacher ... His teacher was a grave robber expert ... No, an archeologist expert.
         Looking for him, was it for the military formation or for the convenience of grave robbing?
         At this moment, even Li Hao was suspicious.
         They suspected that hou Xiaochen wasn't actually thinking about the battle formation, but about their grave robbing skills ... In reality, he wasn't that good, he just knew a bit about Feng Shui and a bit of ancient language translation.
         There were actually quite a few people who knew this.
         However, those who could still fight, run, survive, and not die ... Were very few!
         After all, it was too much of a waste of time for a Martial Master to learn all these random things while practicing martial arts. Yuan Shuo was too idle, and he was old. He had been cooped up in the Silver City for decades, so he had become more and more proficient in these things.
         Li Hao fell into deep thought.
         Chief Steward Yu continued,"there are very few superpowers in the Wei Wu Army. This is because in some remains, only martial masters are safe to enter. It is extremely dangerous for superpowers to enter. Therefore, when the Wei Wu Army was first established, we actually did not consider converting superpowers ... Everyone knows that. So, if you agree, if you want to find someone to join, you can only find a Martial Master. Superpowers can sometimes bring huge trouble!"
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao's eyes twinkled.  Was it like this?
         That was true!
         That day, after the silver-tier warrior had recovered, he had said something similar. However, in the end, he said that they were all humans, so he did not do anything.
         But in heaven battling city, it was obvious that they were targeting superpowers.
         Martial masters could fly. Li Hao had tried it before.
         He didn't need to go through the second passage!
         Martial masters could fly, but superpowers couldn 't.
         The Martial Master could avoid the black armor, but once the superpower dispersed, the black armor would attack instantly.
         It was just that there weren't many martial masters back then, so it wasn't too obvious.
         Now, from what chief Yu had said, the ruins might not only be like heaven battling city, but many other places were like this. No wonder his teacher had been exploring the ruins until now, while the other supers had died batch after batch!
         On the side, Mu Lin chuckled."Being a Centurion isn't bad. There are benefits to leading a team. At least you'll have real power. Once the Wei Wu Army is completely open to the public, the centurion can also explore the ruins alone and lead the troops to do some private work ... Of course, the premise is that the people under you agree."
         Li Hao was extremely surprised and looked at Chief Steward Yu.
         "It's not appropriate to restrict martial masters too much," chief Yu said calmly."That's why the Minister has also delegated a lot of authority to the Centurions instead of really restricting them as soldiers. If that were the case, it would cause a lot of complaints."
         Hearing this, Li Hao's eyes brightened.
          There was such a good thing?
         "Then ..."
         "As long as Golden Gun agrees, you can do anything you want!"
         Chief Steward Yu said.
         Li Hao's interest was immediately piqued. His first thought was,"I'll recruit a hundred martial masters. Hou Xiaochen will pay anyway, and I'll take these people to kill Red moon's people ..."
         Alright, very quickly, this thought disappeared.
         Red Moon didn't seem to have many people left.
         "Let me think, if I, the centurion, can become a high-level City Patrol, I ... Actually have no objections!"
         “……”
         Chief Steward Yu was completely speechless. What was this guy thinking?
