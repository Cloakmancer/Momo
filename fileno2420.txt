Who knows!The figure in front of him was becoming more and more obvious. The power of qi and blood covered the sky and earth, and the blade intent flashed. It was said that the blood Emperor was best at archery, but in reality, it was his previous life fighting the celestial Thearch!The real blood Emperor was good with knives!A saber had traveled the world.The reason why the human Kings used sabers was also because of this person's influence. He was both a teacher and a friend. When the blood Emperor used a saber, the human Kings would follow suit.The human figure became more and more solid!The blood saber trembled!After an unknown period of time, the river suddenly quivered. Suddenly, a figure completely emerged. At this moment, Li Hao seemed to feel boundless pressure, and the river trembled violently!The small spiritual world seemed to be unable to bear it.The power of time flowed wildly!He used the saber intent and blood Qi on the saber to continuously backtrack, presenting traces of the past.It seemed to be a teenager ... And he didn't look very old.However, the blood Emperor in the illusion was somewhat similar. Li Hao had never seen his true appearance in the illusion. Today, he saw some of his true faces. They were very young, and their eyes were calm ... But there was a hint of coldness in the depths!‚Äã This was a venerable sovereign with unparalleled killing power!It was said that when the human Emperor and the others proved their Dao and became emperors, they weren't old, only in their twenties.In that era, there was not only one young venerable sovereign, but many.Both at this age.The human King didn't reach the end alone. His friends from his youth and his school days had all accompanied him to the end.How blissful!Li Hao was slightly dazed. Suddenly, a long sword appeared in his hand. Li Hao stepped into the river of time with a solemn expression."I, Li Hao, am presumptuous enough to invite the venerable sovereign's body to feel the true meaning of the great Dao. I would like to fight with the venerable sovereign! Please ... Enlighten me, venerable sovereign!"The young sovereign opened his eyes and looked at him!Boundless pressure rolled over.Even if it was just a projection or a trace of the past, it still brought Li Hao boundless pressure. The pressure ... Seemed to be even stronger than that of Red Moon Emperor. It was unbelievably powerful!It wasn't strength or aura, but that kind of ... Pressure!The young sovereign did not say anything. He reached out and grabbed the bloody saber. He looked at Li Hao with a calm expression, as if he was just a mechanical projection without any consciousness.He held his saber and slashed out without saying anything!The long river was cut off!You want to challenge a venerable sovereign?And not an ordinary venerable sovereign, but a venerable sovereign who rose from slaughter?Then come!With a sword strike, cold light covered the world. Li Hao waved his sword to cut the blood saber. Time revolved, and the long sword burst with dazzling sword intent. One, two, three ... A hundred sword intents merged and struck!The long saber had no intention, only killing intent! no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  Li Hao seemed to be frozen, and even his thoughts stopped. The shadow was not too powerful, and Li Hao could not summon a real venerable sovereign.However, at this moment, a blade and a sword! A collision in the void!It was silent!There was only an explosion of blood Qi and the flow of time. As if a mirror had been broken, a sound was heard. The hundred sword intents collapsed instantly, and time stopped. A line of blood appeared on Li Hao's forehead!The blade had dissipated.A line of blood began to spread from his forehead ... Li Hao lowered his head and looked at his hand. A crack had appeared on his longsword, and more than half of the hundred stars had been shattered. The longsword had disappeared, and Li Hao was instantly split apart!One blade!Li Hao looked at the other side in a daze, and the young venerable sovereign was also looking at him silently.The sword intent that originated from the sword Saint was slightly different. It had many of his own things added to it, but ... It was still very weak.One blade was enough!"Li Hao!"A cry of surprise came from the void. The blood Emperor from the past, who was not very powerful and only had the power of a Heavenly King, had killed Li Hao with one strike!Was this the venerable sovereign?Li Hao's thoughts were a little sluggish. Venerable sovereigns ... Were like this?Long before he had made progress, he had once taken a palm from a venerable sovereign. The red moon venerable sovereign was not so terrifying. He was just a shadow from the past, but he had killed him with one strike!BOOM!Li Hao's real body collapsed!In an instant, the river trembled and time flowed as if it was trying to revive itself.But at this moment, a long saber appeared and slashed down at the river!"No!"The sword tree, the stone, and the seal appeared in an instant, terrified!The river was the key to Li Hao's recovery. Once it was cut, Li Hao would really die.The venerable sovereign's projection was beyond expectations and unbelievably powerful. After killing Li Hao, he wanted to cut off the river and Li Hao's hope of resurrection.Li Hao, who had come here to comprehend saber intent, was killed by a single saber move.At this moment, the river trembled as if it had sensed a fatal danger. A vague shadow emerged from the end of the river. It was Li Hao, who looked serious.The other party wanted to cut down the river!"Kill!"With a low shout that seemed to come from another time and space, Li Hao instantly walked out of death. He held his sword and slashed!This sword had hundreds of strokes.The heavens and earth were turned upside down, the five elements converged, yin and yang crisscrossed, and light and darkness appeared at the same time!At the other end of the river, the young venerable sovereign was still cold and silent. There was only surging qi and blood mixed with the Blood River. The long saber was pure as it slashed out!Bang! Bang!Li Hao's 100 sword essences instantly collapsed like a popped bubble. The firmament sword in his hand trembled and was split apart by the slash with some timidity and despair.Li Hao's shadow collapsed instantly!

It was still a saber!The young venerable sovereign watched silently, as if he had just killed an ant.A moment later, the river trembled again, and Li Hao appeared. He said with a calm and heavy tone,""Unexpectedly powerful! If ... This is the fighting strength of the young venerable sovereigns ... The Heavenly Kings, then the current venerable sovereigns, those two half-step sovereigns, either they hid their strength, or ... They're really trash!"They were both Heavenly Kings!The other party had killed him with one strike.Although they were both Heavenly Kings, the two half-emperors didn't seem to pose such a threat. Even their real bodies didn't pose such a huge threat to Li Hao.Was this the youth of a true venerable sovereign?"Take another strike!"The long sword burst forth again. This time, more sword intent was integrated into it. The sword intent was united as one. When the sword slashed out, the long river fluctuated and time rotated.However ... The other side still slashed!There was nothing fancy about it, only that ocean-like blade!The saber slashed out. BOOM!Li Hao's shadow exploded again. With a flick of his saber, the river even began to shatter.Three Saint projections appeared, all of them filled with boundless fear.It's finished!If this went on, Li Hao would die without a doubt if the blood Emperor's shadow didn't disappear.How did this happen?In their eyes, Li Hao might not be stronger than venerable sword in his generation, but he wouldn't be too far off. Why ... Why couldn't he take a single strike from the blood Emperor's shadow?This was impossible!In the same realm, in the new martial era, the venerable blood Emperor was very powerful. In the past, in the new martial era, in the same realm, other than Sword Master, the human King was the first, followed by the venerable blood Emperor.However, this was not the blood Emperor, and Li Hao was not weak.At such a young age, he had opened his own spiritual universe and gathered hundreds of sword wills. He had obtained the sword will inheritance of venerable sword and the human King. He was a powerful and unparalleled existence.Why was it like this?Just as the three Supreme Saints were panicking, the river fluctuated again. At the end of the river, Li Hao's apparition reappeared. He looked at the young venerable sovereign's apparition and sighed."So strong! It turns out that my sword has so many weaknesses ..."He laughed at himself. The next moment, the longsword gathered again, and hundreds of sword intents instantly merged. Li Hao sighed."Did you not fuse enough? I see ..."The long sword struck out!The long saber slashed down again! BOOM!This time, the sword intent was shattered, and Li Hao disappeared instantly. He reappeared and slashed again, killing Li Hao on the spot with a sea of blood!Third Saint was frightened, but he soon realized that the blood Emperor's projection hadn't completely cut the river. He heaved a sigh of relief.Soon, Li Hao reappeared. Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé   The battle continued!He had never taken three slashes from his opponent before. At most, three slashes, and Li Hao would die.Each time was more brutal than the last!Above the river, Li Hao was wearing a green robe. The young venerable sovereign was covered in blood. The sea of blood gathered and he slashed again and again, killing every time he came out.The river was becoming more and more fragile.It was as if the power of time was about to be exhausted.This happened three times. The last time, Li Hao appeared, but the other side did not attack again. At this moment, the young venerable Emperor, who had been silent, suddenly spoke. To Li Hao's surprise and shock, the young venerable Emperor said calmly,""You helped the blood saber devour the eight meridians, so I'll kill you eight times and spare your life! It's not because you're strong that you didn't die eight times. I'm the one who spared you eight times!""In this battle, all grudges are settled! Your sword ... Is too weak and has too many flaws. It's not that you can't do it, it's just that you're too weak in nature. I'm a venerable sovereign, a venerable sovereign, I've been a venerable sovereign for a long time!""You can't defeat a real venerable sovereign!"The blood shadow started to dissipate, but the voice still echoed,""You're fighting me, but you're fighting yourself ... You're using up your own power and your own understanding ... Don't summon randomly. This time, the blood saber is enough to support you. Without it, you can't bear it. If you summon the venerable sovereign body again ... You won't be able to bear the price and will die!""To comprehend the Dao in the midst of death ... There is ruthlessness, there is ruthlessness ... However, ruthlessness is not enough to attain the Dao! There were countless battle techniques left behind in the Silvermoon world, including the yuan Ping ancient...But the DAOs of the world, the myriad DAOs, they could look or not look! "If you have the chance, read the 'Zhang family education records'. It records a venerable sovereign's enlightenment from nothing to something. This book doesn't talk about Dao, it only talks about experience and doesn't mix with the thousands of great Dao ..."The blood shadow completely dispersed.Li Hao's eyes flickered, and he hurriedly shouted,""Neo martial is still there?"The void was silent.After a long time, a voice suddenly came,""New martial freedom! I'm an afterimage of the past. If there's no new martial arts, if the main body dissipates, I'll collapse on my own, and there's no me in the world!"In the next moment, there was no more sound.Li Hao's eyes flickered. At this moment, the bloody saber appeared.However, it seemed to be much weaker than before.It seemed to have consumed a lot of energy.As for Li Hao, he also started to become more and more solid. The three Supreme Saints 'apparitions appeared in an instant, and Jian Shu's face was filled with fear."What are you doing? the blood Emperor's killing power is second only to the human Kings. He's one of the few people in the world who can fight human Kings at the same level!"The sword tree was afraid that he didn't understand and would blindly summon, and said,""In the same generation and level, neo martial arts has held several martial Dao conventions. The blood Emperor once fought a human King and did not completely lose. Later, he even integrated the battle heavenly Emperor's comprehension ... He is already a top expert. After so many years, he will definitely improve ... You are simply acting recklessly!"Li Hao smiled. At this moment, he seemed a little weak and emotional."He is indeed very strong! But ... Wasn't this a good thing? In this era, who can defeat me at the same level? "That's good too. This battle has made me realize that the top existences of the new martial era are unparalleled in their strength even at the same level. Otherwise ... I'll be misled by those Heavenly Kings and Saints. They'll really think that I'm invincible among my peers and can sweep away the new martial arts!"

2422 Chapter 404
Speaking of this, he was a little puzzled,"what kind of book is" Zhang family education record "?" Does Silver Moon have one?"The sword tree explained,"it's a martial arts inheritance left behind by a Supreme martial artist. It's called a martial arts inheritance ... But actually ... It's not completely true." It didn't record the true martial arts and combat techniques. It was just a story, a history of growth, including the experiences of the human King, venerable sovereign, and great emperor. The Zhang clan's Supreme venerable had started recording from the rise of the human King and the others. From the beginning to the end, there was no mistake! After that, when the human King ascended to the top of the world, he listed this book as a forbidden book and didn't allow it to be circulated ...""Why?""He has some dark history."Jian Shu said awkwardly,"it is said that the young human King is good with words. He used to ... Used to swindle and deceive venerable Emperor Xue and the others. Venerable Emperor Xue is fine, but a few other venerable sovereigns believed him. It is said that ... Venerable Emperor tie was once ... Once deceived to the point that he almost called human king master. He might have really called him master. In short, it is very complicated. Therefore, this book is not allowed to be circulated in the early stage of neo martial realm ..." Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  "Do you still have them now?" Li Hao laughed.They were all forbidden books!"I don't know, maybe ... Other things aside, there should be one in Yuanping martial arts university, right? Or that Zhang an, he should have ..."Li Hao nodded.The blood Emperor apparition told himself not to pay too much attention to the actual Tao techniques. They were all just appearances. The real Tao techniques were not these.This actually made sense.After being hacked to death eight times, Li Hao had gained a lot of insight. His opponent's saber ... Was really brutal!A saber technique that killed for the sake of killing!It was terrifying!However, this seemed to fit Li Hao's mentality very well. Whether it was saber or sword techniques, weren't they all killing for the sake of killing?Could it be that ... He practiced his sword and saber just to fool around?"Li Hao, why can the projection of the blood Emperor speak and even have a mind of its own?" Jian Shu asked.Li Hao laughed,"it's not that exaggerated. It's actually just some will left behind in the blood saber!" He's been using the blood saber for many years, and it's never changed owners. It's also always been at its peak ... It's like the blood saber is the one speaking. "The few of them were stunned and looked at the blood saber that was extremely quiet.Did this mean that ... Blood saber was talking just now?The blood saber seemed to tremble a little, but Li Hao continued,""It's just that the blood saber is the carrier, not the blood saber speaking. It's almost the same meaning anyway."Jian Shu didn't dwell on this and said seriously,""You can't mess around next time. The blood Emperor is still gentle. At least, he's not too harsh on the younger generation. If you dare to summon a human King over, the human King will cut you to death with one strike!"Li Hao nodded."There's no need for that! The Dao of the human King doesn't suit me. The human King also takes the strong points of a Hundred Schools of Thought, so its characteristics aren't too obvious ... The Dao I walk is actually similar to the Dao of the human King, just not completely the same. "The sword tree was a little stunned. Was it the same?It felt that Li Hao's Dao had nothing in common with his opponent 's. It was similar to venerable sword' s, but why was it similar to the human King 's?Li Hao seemed to have noticed it and explained,""The similarity of Dao is not external, but the origin and essence of Dao! The human King should have also mixed the Dao of all schools, taking advantage of everyone's strong points, removing the weeds and keeping the elites. Therefore, although his characteristics were not obvious, in reality, he was strong in all aspects! The one I'm leaving with is also this type! "The Dao of the revered sword always ends up like this. The strong will continue to be strong, and the shortcomings will be filled ..."Jianshu didn't quite understand this either, so he didn't say anything more. He only asked doubtfully,""Then, can we withstand your combination of reality and illusion?""It's not a big problem!""I'll gather 180 stars first," Li Hao said."When I'm done, I'll borrow a book from senior Zhang an. It might be of some help to me in the Dao integration."He didn't say anything more and sat down cross-legged, not hiding anything, allowing the top three to observe.At this moment, in the starry sky, the long river shattered and turned back into stars. However, they were slightly dimmer, as they had consumed a lot of energy.One star after another appeared, and in the next moment, more stars continued to condense.Stars began to appear one by one. They were condensing very quickly and clearly had some of the characteristics of the blood Emperor. In the void, the blood saber seemed to be observing. The cat in the saber ... At this moment, it was faintly visible and seemed to be opening its eyes.Previously, when the blood Emperor's illusory figure had dissipated, a portion of its will seemed to have fallen into the blade. In addition, the firmament sword had spat out the power of eight meridians. At this moment, this cat really looked like it was coming back to life.Not only that, not far away, the two words "Zhan Tian" also emitted a faint glow. Some special power was being absorbed by the cat. Li Hao actually saw it, but he didn't care.These two words ... He had borrowed them from heaven battling city. After this, he would return heaven battling city.As for how much the cat absorbed, it was none of Li Hao's business. Heaven battling city, the blood saber, and this saber were all left behind by the blood Emperor. His own things were absorbed by the cat he wanted to resurrect ... And it had nothing to do with Li Hao.The number of stars began to increase.160,170 ...The entire world was filled with sword intent. Compared to before, there was an additional special killing power.This continued for a few days. Suddenly, 180 stars circled the sky.BOOM!His spiritual world was in turmoil, as if it had undergone a minor transformation.The 179 stars surrounded the entire time star. It was as if the stars were surrounding the moon, making the time star stand out.Li Hao opened his eyes and took a look. He smiled.

2423 Chapter 404
Not bad!There were 180 truth Dao stars and 180 Phantom Dao stars, just enough to fuse.However ... Which one of the truth stars could fuse with Time and Stars?The other 179 pills were easy to handle!"Or should I say ... It doesn't fuse with time and uses time as its core? To form another Phantom path sword intent star?"This was possible. However, the Time and Stars were still somewhat illusionary and did not really exist."Unless ... I fuse with the real Time and Stars!"He thought of the real Time and Stars, half illusory and half solid. Perhaps, only by fusing this one would he be able to truly fuse the illusory and the real. With this as the core, the illusory and the real would be able to complete the fusion in the true sense."But that star is hard to capture. Even if we capture it, it might escape ..."Li Hao kept thinking about how to stop the other party from running away.Unless there was something fun on his side that was enough for the other party to stay and play.Li Hao shook his head helplessly.A star ... Was actually so difficult to deal with. It was really troublesome.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶A moment later, Li Hao, who had been in seclusion for several days, disappeared again.Li Dynasty. A blade instantly flew back.Heaven's Fate grabbed it and cursed. He felt that this saber had consumed a lot of energy. The next moment, he was stunned. He looked at the cat in the saber and said,""Strange ... Why ... Why do I feel like I'm really going to be resurrected?"Li Hao's blood saber was a little weak, but that wasn't the problem. The problem was, why did he feel that the cat in the saber was really about to completely recover?In this way, it seemed that he did not lose out at all.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Silver City.Heaven battling city.Li Hao appeared in an instant, along with two large characters. They landed on the gate of heaven battling city, and several Saints appeared.The old turtle was a little surprised. Why did the two words "heaven battling" come back?You're not borrowing it?Surprised, general Huai said,""Marquis, you've come at the right time. The Dali King came to the North before, hoping to borrow the word" Zhan Tian ..."""No need!""No need for now." Li Hao shook his head.The other party's "borrow" was nothing more than to resuscitate the cat. Previously, the cat had already absorbed the special energy in it, so there was no need to do so.The others didn't understand either, but since Li Hao said he wouldn't lend it to them, they wouldn 't.The old turtle continued: "Lord Marquis, the void Dao universe has been very quiet recently. Previously, we could vaguely sense some battles ... But recently, there has been no movement at all."Li Hao nodded. He also knew this.If time star ran away, what was the point of fighting?Previously, when he transferred the great Dao universe, Time and Stars even came out."I got it!""Lord Marquis ...""Look for Lin Hongyu if there's anything else. I might need to go into seclusion soon!"Then, Li Hao disappeared without giving them a chance.After he left, the old turtle helplessly said,""Guys, don't you feel that ... This person is getting more and more mysterious?"Now, Li Hao seemed to be less in charge.In the past, they would still care about it.The others looked at each other and didn't say anything. They couldn't do anything about it. The half-step sovereigns and venerable sovereigns could appear and attack at any time. They could understand the pressure on Li Hao.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ At another place.Zhang an was surprised to hear Li Hao's request. He frowned slightly."This book was indeed written by my grandfather ... Although it's called a book, it's actually a record of an era! There are also many battle techniques recorded in it, but they are not in-depth, only briefly mentioned. Everyone likes to read them like Eight Trigrams books. "He was also a little helpless,'later on, he was conferred the title of the human King! Of course, this book is definitely not just for gossip. My grandfather once said that this book was his lifetime's interpretation of Dao ... Of course, some people also said that my grandfather had been gossiping all his life!"He was also a little embarrassed and helpless.""After it was sealed, my grandfather said that since no one could understand it, it was fine! So be it if it's banned. If someone can understand it, it's worth a look! The premise is that you don't have to pay too much attention to the gossip ...""A lot of gossip?" Li Hao was interested."A lot of them!"Zhang an couldn't hold it in any longer and smiled bitterly.""My grandfather ... Loved to eavesdrop on the world! In fact, it was to coordinate and monitor the enemy's spies, but it couldn't stand people slandering my grandfather and insisting that he did it for gossip ... So ... Later on, everyone boycotted the publication of this book!"Li Hao laughed."Then you should still have some, right? I don't want to read the eight trigrams, but the true meaning of the great Dao!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùAre you sure?Zhang an really wanted to say that there really wasn't much true meaning of the great Dao, and 99% of it was all kinds of gossip.However, after thinking for a moment, he still nodded and took out a storage ring.""This might be the most well-preserved set. Silver Moon actually has it in a few places, but only a portion of it has been cut off and not the entire set. The eight trigrams have been removed from it, but it's extremely boring."Li Hao chuckled and took the storage ring."Then I'll take a good look and study it. I don't think the inheritance of the great Dao of a Supreme martial artist is simple ... Your book of Dao seems to only have a superficial understanding."Zhang an nodded helplessly.It was indeed superficial!Li Hao didn't say anything more and quickly fled.Zhang an sighed with emotion. This guy...Did he read the Dao or read the gossip?Forget it, who knows?Let him be!It didn't take long for the entire world to be filled with unbridled laughter. Zhang an could vaguely hear it and couldn't help but curse in his heart.It was obvious that Li Hao was laughing at the gossip."Grandpa, Grandpa ... It seems like ... No one can understand the education records you left behind ..."He shook his head. His grandfather had once said that everyone could understand it and would gain something. In the end, all they gained was gossip. He deserved to be banned. He wondered if Li Hao would gain something and not care about the gossip a hundred thousand years later.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, Li Hao was watching with great interest and laughed out loud.Interesting!Interesting!This might be the most comprehensive history book in the new martial era. It was the kind that was completely true. No wonder the human King wanted to ban this book. If he didn't ban it, everyone would know how shameless the human King was in private.Drilling holes, digging holes, lying, duping ... It seemed that he would do anything. He was shameless and had lowered the style of the human King.If it were me, I would also forbid it!As he read on, Li Hao's laughter gradually stopped. At this moment, what he saw was no longer gossip, but the real historical scenes, which completely restored the history of war, humiliation, and resistance of neo martial arts against foreign enemies.It was also the process, experience, and result of each venerable sovereign's enlightenment.This book was more like the myriad forms of life and the myriad DAOs and origins.The source of Dao!Li Hao watched in silence. What he saw in his eyes was the real history. He was a little lost.This book had recorded almost all the venerable sovereigns 'experiences of how they had reached that level.Such a book was indeed not something that the eight trigrams book could compare to. Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  He read it silently. In the book, there were even some methods of separation and text separation. In fact, it was a kind of reenactment of historical scenes, making you experience it in person. It was a very mysterious feeling."Good book!"Li Hao mumbled. This book was much more complete than "Yuan Ping's Chronicles." Now, it seemed that "Yuan Ping's Chronicles" was only the tip of the iceberg. This book was the essence.The source of any Dao could be found here.At this moment, Li Hao's spiritual sea was also rolling and changing at his will, forming different mantras.

Chapter 2424 The Final Preparations (1)
An education record, a hundred ways of life, a myriad of DAOs.Fighting against injustice, fighting against injustice, and moving forward in the dark seemed like gossip, but it was the history of struggle and sacrifice of neo martial artists.Countless people had sacrificed their lives in exchange for a sentence: "To the human race!"Congratulate what?The despair after every battle turned into hope, and the wounds after every sacrifice reduced the despair of the strong. This was a history of blood and tears that every era was fighting for.In the end, they won.At this moment, Li Hao put down his book.What other people saw was gossip, but what he saw was the neo martial artists not willing to be oppressed and dared to fight!"So ... This is the real neo martial!"Li Hao muttered. Just like himself, he stood up. Resist?I'm also resisting! Best novel online free at ‚ìù0‚ì•‚ìî‚ìõ‚ìë‚ìò‚ìù I resist the harshness of fate, and I resist it as well ... Is this something that every era has to experience?I've underestimated neo martial.He had underestimated that batch of true neo martial artists!I thought ... Zheng Yu and the others could really represent neo martial.Li Hao chuckled with some disdain and contempt. It seemed that ... These people really did not count. Only the blood Emperor and the others who had personally participated in the fight, resisted, resisted, and defeated strong enemies could be considered true martial artists.Zhang an was also a participant ... But he was a little weak and indecisive.Even after experiencing that era, he still hadn't learned to be ruthless.Yes, ruthless!In the neo martial arts rebellion, the general article was about using ruthlessness to fight ruthlessness and violence to fight violence. Even the Supreme Master of the Zhang family, who was praised by everyone, did not hide anything in the book. For the sake of neo martial, he killed enemies, his own people, the ancient people, his descendants, the heavens, and the earth ...The whole article was talking about killing in an extremely relaxed way!Was such a person benevolent?No, this kind of person was ruthless!Compared to his grandfather, Zhang an was much worse.That thick book was actually a history of blood and tears, forged with fresh blood.No wonder the blood Emperor's blade only had boundless killing intent!"Compared to you guys ... I seem to be more relaxed."Li Hao chuckled. At the very least, in this era, neither Zheng Yu's group nor venerable Red Moon Emperor went out of their way to kill those ordinary people, nor did they need to be on guard against them. Only Zheng Yu had a period of time where he hoped to complete the recovery of the world through killing.After the World recovered, that guy lost interest in ordinary people."I'm still alright!"Li Hao murmured and closed his eyes.In his spiritual world, the stars were rolling like an animation.Li Hao looked at it for a while and suddenly thought of something. He smiled. It was not bad to be unpredictable. "The Dao is mysterious and impermanent ..."Li Hao kept thinking about something. The next moment, he disappeared and entered the spiritual world. He looked up at the sky, watching the stars moving and playing, full of mystery.The sword intent spread out. The river of time below was like a swimming pool, allowing the stars to fluctuate and move freely.The entire world seemed to have changed, as if it had become more colorful.Life was about movement ... He suddenly felt that the great Dao universe lacked a sense of life.The stars lacked some exercise and liveliness.Only the time star liked to move around.All sorts of comprehensions once again surged into his mind."Disorder ... Order ... Are secondary. The key lies in vitality. When a Dao loses its vitality, no matter how orderly or disorderly it is, it's still a dead Dao!"At that moment, the Dao meridians in his body were also churning.It seemed like he wanted to join them!Li Hao's eyes lit up. The opportunity ... Seemed to have arrived.Dao integration of nature!The way of Dao was natural. At this moment, the corporeal meridian stars had some movement and were eager to join. This was the opportunity, the opportunity had come."Open the fleshly body heaven ... Fleshly body Dao meridians, and you can become a true Dao master!"At this moment, Li Hao thought of this.Time and Stars were the core, connecting the inside and outside, interacting with the inside and outside.‚Äã Many thoughts appeared, forming an illusory and corporeal world, with Time and Stars as the boundary.Gathering the power of the stars into a single point!The heart of time!He sat cross-legged and stretched his body. His 360 Dao meridians glowed faintly. Li Hao looked at the void, deep in thought. He was still short of 180 stars. Otherwise, 360 Dao meridians and 360 sword intents would be a perfect fusion.However, at this moment, there was no time to open so many.Opening 360 physical Dao meridians meant that he was at the peak of the half-step sovereign realm. He was only one step away from entering the venerable sovereign realm. If it was that easy, he would have opened it long ago. At that level, why would he need to be afraid of these guys?" 360 ethereal and corporeal States ... I can't say that I'm a match for venerable sovereigns, but I'm sure it won't be a problem for me to fight against a seventh level Dao integration cultivator, right?"The seventh level of the Dao integration realm could be considered a half-step sovereign, but it was slightly weaker than some top-notch half-step sovereigns. Li daoheng and Zheng Yu were both top-notch half-step sovereigns, but they would also be considered at the same level by then.At this moment, Li Hao's mind flickered. This time, he had brought 360 stars from the Dao universe and 180 stars from the spiritual universe. He had enough energy for the time being.From the looks of it, everything was ready.The three saints could even withstand the longevity sword intent, so they should be able to withstand the Dao integration.But this location ... Where should he choose?He didn't have much of a requirement on the location for opening the physical body world. He could just open it anywhere.However, if he wanted to capture Time and Stars ... It was best to do so in the great Dao universe."Perhaps I still have to open the heaven of the physical body in the great Dao universe ... However, this way, there are also some disadvantages. It can easily cause the great Dao universe to be attacked ..."

If it was in the past and everything was under his control, then it was fine.Now ... If he opened it there, once something happened, and Hong Yitang had completely integrated into the universe of the great path, it was likely to involve him and even cause the great path to shatter.With such a thought, Li Hao was a little reluctant to drive there.But if it didn't open in the Dao universe, how could it attract Time and Stars?"A void Dao universe opening?"Wasn't that courting death?Now, there were three half-step sovereigns there.When he entered the void Dao universe, those three would beat him to death without holding back.As for leaving the Silvermoon world, that was even more impossible.Or inside the world barrier?But the time star couldn't come out, right?Many thoughts appeared in his mind.Where to merge the real and the virtual to open his own physical realm was a problem.He was constantly calculating and thinking about the possible changes that might occur. If the time star really appeared, how should he capture it? and if the heaven and earth energy increased during this period and allowed a half-step sovereign to appear, what should he do?The three half-emperors had gathered in the void Dao universe, but they did not seem to be fighting anymore. Were they thinking of ways to deal with him?Where was the will of the heavens?Would there be any changes to the Queen who could not accomplish anything but ruin things?He had to take all of these into consideration.A single mistake could lead to a huge problem. During this period of time, could the seal suppression of the eight major cities ... Completely suppress the venerable sovereign?Once the venerable sovereign appeared, what should he do?Are Qian Wuliang and Dao Jian the pawns or the ones chosen by heaven? Best novel online free at ‚ìù0‚ì•‚ìî‚ìõ‚ìë‚ìò‚ìù Would there be any changes to the one in the Li Dynasty in the North?The myriad of thoughts made him feel a little melancholic.It was really difficult!At this moment, he was a little envious of some of the neo martial human Kings. He might still be lacking a Dao protector who could help him resist external changes at a critical moment. However, at this moment, the strongest person beside him was Hong Yitang.However, Hong Yitang might also be someone in the game. It was best if he didn't come out now. Once he did, it might cause an even bigger change.How troublesome!Moreover, Hong Yitang had just merged with the great Dao universe. Although his strength had increased very quickly, he was still far from the level of a half-step Emperor. If he came to protect the Dao ... He would be courting death. Finally, he thought of his cheap wife.She was really a cheap wife. Li Hao didn't lay a finger on her. Should he take away her stars of the great path of Dao this time?Thoughts emerged like a tide.Difficult!The whole book was saying one word: difficult!If he was the slightest bit careless, he would definitely fail.However, since he had chosen this path, he had to continue walking on his knees. He didn't want to make use of people who didn't have anything to do with him. Leaving the sky in the North wasn't a bad choice. Perhaps he would have to fight for his life. He would stay in the Silver City, which was the closest to the seal. He could even release the suppression of heaven and earth and break the seal, allowing the two half-step sovereigns to deal with the venerable sovereign!Would the two of them choose to deal with him or the half-step sovereign?Since he couldn't make a choice ... He might as well use this as the key.Seven of the eight major cities were outside, and they needed suitable and obedient people to take charge. They also had to be careful of being attacked and destroyed, causing the eight major cities to go out of control."I still don't have enough trump cards!"Li Hao thought that this was still not safe. His trump card was not strong enough.He had to get some trump cards ... At the critical moment, he had to be able to deal with the half-step sovereign. Even if it was only for a moment, he still needed to do it.He had to use the power of time!Summon his future self again?Since there was already a crisis, why would he be afraid of a second time?Of course, if he used it twice in a row, he might face certain death if he still hadn't passed the first crisis. However, if he used it, he might have another trump card." 30 seconds back ..."Li Hao suddenly mumbled. He could turn back time by 30 seconds, not by summoning a character, but by reviving the dead for 30 seconds.Perhaps, he could make use of this.Without a Dao protector, he could only protect himself.If he didn't have a trump card, he had to create it for himself!This was nothing!He didn't need to ask for help for anything. This was nothing. He would have more freedom in the future.Suddenly, Li Hao thought of something, and a smile appeared on his face.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The king of Dali was running around.Heaven's Fate had given him a few missions, such as capturing heaven's will, obtaining the bloodline of the eight great families, and borrowing the name "heaven battling ..." In any case, there were many missions, and he had recently given up on trying to dominate the world.He was only thinking of completing a few missions. When everyone got into a fight, he would be able to protect Li Dynasty.It couldn't be helped. He had advanced by leaps and bounds, and he felt that after killing the skeleton, Li Hao, who was such a good person, had even taken the initiative to give him all the bones. How wonderful was that?In the end, he had advanced by leaps and bounds.He had even stepped into the Heavenly King level!In the end, the world's situation changed drastically in an instant. A large number of Heavenly Kings were killed by Li Hao ... Now, he felt that there was no need for him to struggle. He couldn't struggle anymore.Forget it, just lie flat!After struggling for a long time, he still couldn't surpass Li Hao, so he might as well just watch.Just as he was searching for the Heaven's Will, a person appeared.The person who had made him feel pain and helplessness had appeared.Li Hao!There were pros and cons to following Li Hao. The good thing was that he was now a Heavenly King. The bad thing was that he had been tricked by Li Hao a few times. If not for Heaven's Fate, Zhou Chuan's Dao integration ... He would never have been able to complete his mission.

Chapter 2426 The Final Preparations (3)
It was sorrowful!That was why he was afraid of seeing Li Hao. Whenever Li Hao appeared, he always felt that something bad was going to happen to him. He might as well hang out with the God of beginner martial. At least he wouldn't be bothered to plot against him.Moreover, that person was also a good-for-nothing, so there was no need to scheme against him.Fortunately, Li Hao was powerful now, and he didn't need to do anything."Long time no see!"Li Hao's smile was as bright as ever. The king of the Li Dynasty wanted to roll his eyes."Li Hao, I was just about to look for you ...""The two words" heaven battling "have been returned to heaven battling city. Besides, I don't need them for the time being. Some of the things inside have already been taken away by that cat.""Is that so?"Hearing this, the Dali King felt a little more relaxed."That's good. I'm missing a troublesome task.""Do you want to become stronger?" Li Hao suddenly laughed.‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù It's this again!"I don 't!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao was stunned for a moment. He glanced at him and said after a long while,""Your answer makes it difficult for me to continue. You, the King of the North, actually ... Lay flat?"The Dali King was helpless,"then what about me?" Now, it's a battle between a half-step sovereign and a venerable sovereign. I've finally absorbed that powerful skeleton, but what's the result? You even killed a Heavenly King so casually! Both I and the one in the West are sorrowful ... We picked up all the advantages along the way and reached the Heavenly King level, but it still didn't work!"  Best novel online free at n0ŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  What else could he do?"You don't want to become a half-step sovereign, you want to become a venerable sovereign?"The king of Dali rolled his eyes,"what do you think?" If I could do it, you would've done it long ago. Would I even have a chance?"Li Hao smiled and touched his chin.""I like your straightforward personality! I'm too lazy to ask for help from the ancients, but I don't mind talking about the future with cultivators of the same generation ...""I'm not interested!""Are you really willing to lie flat?"The Dali King wanted to say something, but he stopped. It was impossible to say that he was willing.But ... I'm already a Heavenly King!You're probably up to no good when you look for me."Just tell me, what do you want me to do?""Beat a half-step sovereign, beat a venerable sovereign!""Farewell!"The king of Dali cupped his hands and turned to leave."Don't mess around. It's useless. I'll pretend I didn't see you.""There will be great benefits after this!""What if things don't work out?" the king of Dali sneered."Then die!" Li Hao said calmly,'but didn't we succeed in the forbidden Sea? You've directly stepped into the Heavenly King level. Otherwise, it'll be difficult for you to do so in your entire life! You went from the mid-stage Sun Moon realm to the mid-stage Dao integration realm. To be honest, without me ... Would you have been able to reach this level in just half a year? Even though it's very dangerous for me to look for you, I've gained a lot!"The king of Dali rolled his eyes.'Damn it, how dangerous is that!'"Are you afraid of death?""You don't want to gamble anymore?" Li Hao smiled.The Dali King turned to look at him and frowned,"that's unrealistic!" Even those two half-step sovereigns have the possibility of advancing to venerable sovereign. The God of initial stage martial said that this time, if something happens, it may turn into a battle between venerable sovereigns!"Li Hao nodded."It's still possible for them to advance to venerable sovereigns. However, if we succeed, it will be difficult for them to advance!""I won 't!"The king of Dali still wanted to leave, but Li Hao didn't say anything.He looked on silently.After walking for a few hundred meters, the king of Dali suddenly stopped. He turned around and glanced at Li Hao."You ... Won't force it?"Li Hao laughed."No, just leave. Other than you, I can naturally find someone who's not afraid of death!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe king of Dali was at a loss. He gritted his teeth and refused to accept it!He was unwilling!He turned around and gritted his teeth."Tell me. What should I do?""You're not running?"The Dali King snorted,"I'm just testing the waters." Do you think that's possible? However ... The success rate is at least 50%!""Not even 10%!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe king of Dali cursed in his heart. Will you die if you lie?Not even 10%?Ëâπ!This guy, he could still lie to me in the past, but why is he so lazy to lie to me recently?He was a little conflicted, but he still asked,"what do you want me to do?" What was he doing? After it's done, how do we get the benefits?""What you need to do is simple ... When I need you, you can appear at any time. I'll let you go back to the past and the future ... Of course, it's hard for you to succeed, but if I give you the gloves, you'll have a chance to succeed."Li Hao looked at his gloves and thought, this thing ... Whether it's celestial ruler or Supreme Emperor tie's ... It can be used as a vessel! Only these treasures would be able to withstand it! Even if you don't have a future ...""What do you mean?"Li Hao explained,'you might not live to the future, or you might be very weak in the future. So, just in case, I'll give you the backtrack gloves. No matter what, celestial ruler BA or Supreme Emperor tie are both invincible Masters. Even a little of them will be enough to make you stronger!"Li Hao continued,"as for you, when you become stronger, your strength will be very weak. You can probably only last for a few minutes. For these few minutes, I need you to help me block at least one half-Emperor!" Zheng Yu, li daoheng, and the red moon Emperor's clone. He had to choose one of the three! Of course, you might be beaten to death ... The probability is very high, but it all depends on you. Moreover, if I'm not done after a few minutes, you'll definitely be beaten to death!""Other than the danger here, you will be in great danger in the future as well. You might be killed at any time. You will lose your power in an instant, and it was during a battle ..."

The Dali King's teeth ached."Why did you come to me?""Boxing gloves!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù"Just because of the boxing gloves?" the king of Dali was a little angry.Li Hao nodded."The gloves are not simple. Plus, only weapons of this level can carry the past and the future!" Other than you ... There's also Empress Dowager shuiyun. I'm thinking if I should look for her. Her strength is a bit weak, and her strength might not be as great as yours. You should be able to summon a future half-step Emperor, right?"Li Hao sized him up, but he wasn't too sure.""It's hard to say! But with the gloves, it shouldn't be a big problem. ""Are you going to stir up trouble again?" the Dali King was speechless and asked."No, I'm going to cultivate. They might come and cause trouble."What the hell is this?When we cultivate, the half-step sovereigns don't cause trouble, but when you cultivate, they cause trouble?"They can't come out now, right?""But if I cultivate, they might be able to come out."‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù"What are the benefits?"The king of Dali still asked.Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"first, experience what it feels like to be a pseudo-Emperor in advance. The comprehension of a pseudo-Emperor, even if it's an illusion, is a real comprehension! "Second, experience what time feels like. I'll also teach you time magic .... That's no ordinary thing. It's my life magic, and I wouldn't teach it to ordinary people!"The king of Dali rolled his eyes.Of course, Li Hao was right."How about something more practical?" he asked.More practical?Li Hao racked his brain and said,"if we're lucky ... I mean if we're lucky, we'll kill a pseudo-Emperor and you'll take both his body and origin. What do you think?"Ëâπ!Kill a pseudo-Emperor?'I ...'"Why don't you go to the one from the temple?"Li Hao shook his head and said,'the Silvermoon people look for the Silvermoon people, not the ancient people! Besides, other people are willing to lie down and have the right to do so, but you don 't! When people have no desires, you still have desires!"The Dali King rubbed his head. He felt that this job was like hanging his head at his waist and could fall off at any time!The benefits that Li Hao mentioned ... Were not very practical. He could not directly become a half-step Emperor.Just as he was thinking, Li Hao said gloomily,"if I could reach the sky in a single bound, I would've gone to my friend. Why would I come to you?""You can read my mind?""It's all over your face!""Why didn't you go find Empress Dowager Shui Yun first?""Women are not as reliable as you.""Really?""Of course!"The king of Dali nodded slightly. Li Hao continued,""Besides, other people have soft skin and tender flesh. You have thick skin and can take a beating too!"Go to hell!The king of Dali cursed in his heart, feeling a little angry. Li Hao smiled and said,""How is it? To be honest, it'll be hard for you to become a half-step sovereign in this life. As for venerable sovereign ... You can just take a look, you don't have the qualifications!"The Dali King sighed."You are too mean. Why can't I become a half-step sovereign?" "Your talent is average, and you don't dare to risk your life, so how can you reach the top?"Tsk!The Dali King was not happy to hear this, but he had to admit that this was the truth. It was so easy to become a venerable sovereign, so why would Zheng Yu and Li daoheng need to plan for so many years?He thought about it carefully and said,""I have another condition!""Tell me, I'll agree to anything!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe king of Dali was a little angry. You're too perfunctory.Li Hao said seriously,"if you succeed, your conditions will be trivial. If you don't succeed, you and I will both be dead. What else do you care about?" Even if you want to become a venerable sovereign ... That's still a dream!""That's why I'm asking you to be more realistic," Li Hao said with a sigh."I can help you complete some of the tasks. As for the unrealistic ones ... You can only wait until they're completed!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùIt made so much sense."Can I really summon the past and the future like you?""I don't know. Should I try it now?""Just in case ..." Li Hao encouraged,"why don't we try it now? maybe we can succeed.""Try once, a life and death crisis?""Yes,""Hehe!" The Dali King sneered. Do you think I'm an idiot?I'm not trying!"Then let's wait. If we fail, it's your problem. If we fail, I'll just return to the Li Dynasty. A Heavenly King who didn't participate in the battle can't bite me. If we succeed, I'll consider participating!"Li Hao smiled and nodded."Okay, then it's a deal. In a few days, when I need you, you can come again!" Don't tell anyone ... Don't tell anyone about it, not even the one in the temple!""Of course," the Dali King nodded and said,"I'm the one who makes the decision. Do I need to consider what other people think?""That's good!"With that, he was about to leave."Don't be in such a hurry to run!"The Dali King hurriedly said. You haven't told me what you want to do. ""Cultivate!"Nonsense!The Dali King was helpless and could only ask in a roundabout way,""If you succeed, will you be able to become a half-step sovereign?""There's hope ... But even if it's done ..." please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao calculated for a moment."It's a weak pseudo-Emperor. Stronger than a peak Heavenly King, but weaker than li daoheng and the others ... Of course, it has great potential. If it can successfully grab something, it won't be weaker than them."He was talking about time and Stars, but it was very difficult!The king of Dali was speechless.Ëâπ!Could he really improve so quickly?He casually became a half-step sovereign?He suddenly felt that he was even worse than a dog when it came to cultivation!"But ... There are currently three half-step sovereigns. Even if I can stop one, what about the other two?"

Chapter 2428 The Final Preparations (3)
 What to do?When it's three against one ... I'll have to use my head to take the hit!"That's why I'll have to ask Empress Dowager shuiyun ... Of course, she might not be willing to do so. She's a woman after all. Now that shuiyun has integrated into the Star dynasty, she's not under much pressure anymore. She might not be willing to take the risk or fight!"The human Queen's sword, in her hands, even if it could guide the past and future, it would need a strong vessel.Otherwise, it would be very difficult to cross time and space to merge.At the moment, only these few weapons could be successfully made.The king of Dali was speechless again. This guy ... Forget it, let him be. If there was no hope, he would not go out and die.The king of Dali left quickly.He felt that it wasn't a good thing that he had met Li Hao. He felt that he had been tricked again.He didn't know if his agreement was a sign of death.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶As for Li Hao, after some consideration, he decided to go and ask.It was fine if Empress Dowager Shui Yun didn't agree, but she wouldn't force it.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The vast star continent was surrounded by Four Seas.Now, a large number of cities had moved and filled up the original four Seas. The new Four Seas surrounded the periphery of the original continent.This place was the raincloud Army's encampment.Empress Dowager shuiyun looked weak and delicate. As a large number of experts had advanced to the Dao integration realm, she had only reached the ninth level of the sun Moon tier, which was only a step away from the Dao integration realm, because she had been in the outer regions.She didn't fight for anything and just led the raincloud Army to patrol the four Seas without any hurry.She was considered a neo martial cultivator, but her physical body had not been transformed, so she was still a Silver Moon cultivator. Now, she was also cultivating a new Dao, which was considered a new Dao and an old Dao. The energy of the origin Dao all came from that sword.Now, he was cultivating both the Old and New DAOs. Although he was only at the ninth level of the sun Moon stage, his battle prowess was not weak at all, not any weaker than an ordinary Dao integration cultivator.However...The daomerge had only allowed him to become a saint.When even the Heavenly Kings had lost their power, her strength was not very eye-catching, even in Li Hao's camp.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶On the big ship.Empress Dowager Shui Yun was extremely weak. Hearing Li Hao's intentions, she pondered for a moment before saying,"Resisting a half-step sovereign ... I'm afraid it'll be very difficult for me."Li Hao wasn't disappointed. He nodded and was about to leave."It's one thing that it's difficult to resist," Empress Dowager shuiyun continued."Another thing is that there are many talented people under the Marquis's command. I'm not too willing to participate in it and become a target for everyone. From what the Marquis said, as long as the sword is here, it can act as a vessel ... Right?" Li Hao raised his eyebrows and nodded slightly."Even if it's not the human King's inheritance, it should be able to be used ...""Why don't I lend this sword to you, Lord Marquis, and you can find someone else?" she said softly.She looked at Li Hao."I'm only at the ninth level of the sun Moon realm. I can't tell what the future will be like. I don't want to delay Lord Marquis's plans!"Li Hao raised his eyebrows slightly and asked,'borrow a sword? "Although this matter is dangerous, the benefits are also not small. If we really fail, in fact, you and I can't escape. Therefore, the Dali King has someone to protect him, so the danger is small. I'm not surprised that he doesn't agree! "But if you don't agree ... If I fail, you'll die! Now that you're borrowing the sword, it doesn't mean that you're unwilling, but that you have some qualms?""The Marquis is right, but ... I think that Governor Hong Yu is more suitable," Empress Dowager Shui Yun said in a soft and gentle voice."What?"Li Hao raised his eyebrows. Empress Dowager Shui Yun said softly, "She's reached the daomerge, and that's one of the reasons! "Secondly, she practices the saber. The saber and sword are actually similar, so she can also use the sword. Thirdly ... She has more thought and more ideas. The reason she is where she is today is all because of the Marquis. In order to protect the Marquis, she can put in more effort! Fourth, if I really succeed, I'll have a chance to become a half-step Emperor, but she doesn't ... Wouldn't it be difficult to get along with her in the future?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao's head ached."Why are your thoughts so different from ours?" he asked."Why?"I'm thinking about how to succeed!You woman, what you're thinking about is whether there will be a fight after you succeed?Go to hell!He might not even succeed.However, Empress Dowager Shui Yun smiled weakly,"Lord Marquis will definitely succeed!" If the Marquis failed, then Silver Moon would have no hope! I'll lend this sword to Governor Hong Yu so that we can have a good relationship in the future!" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao wanted to roll his eyes."You really ... Think far ahead!""If I don't plan for the future, how can I establish myself in the world?"Empress Dowager Shui Yun took it as a compliment and smiled weakly,"Besides, I know my own limits! "I'm not sure about my future, but if the Marquis succeeds, Governor Lin Hongyu's future will not be too bad! Even if you can summon the past and the future ... You still need a future. Last time, Lord Marquis was able to summon your own future, which means that Lord Marquis's future still exists. If that's the case ... By being close to people, you can naturally go a little further. "These words seemed to make some sense.But ...Li Hao slightly frowned. After a long time, he said,""Forget it, no matter how many reasons you have, it doesn't matter. Let me borrow your sword! Do you have any requests?""There is."Empress Dowager shuiyun did not hold back either."If there comes a day when you walk out of the Silver Moon ... You will definitely become a big Shot. When that day comes, if you are able to meet the strong neo martial artists, I would like to go to the human King's Place to study."This works too?Li Hao was stunned for a moment. After a long while, he laughed and said,""You're really thinking far ahead!"He could even think of this.However, Empress Dowager Shui Yun laughed,"let's go and see. If that day really comes and the Marquis agrees, then it'll be my opportunity!" Otherwise, what can a nobody like me do even if I pick up a sword? The big shots of new martial arts were high and mighty. How could he get close to them? I'm not Lord Marquis, but if Lord Marquis agrees, I'll naturally have a chance!"

2429 Chapter 405
"What?" Li Hao seemed a little jealous."Why? am I definitely not as good as the neo martial King?"Empress Dowager Shui Yun laughed."That's not it. If the Marquis can defeat the venerable sovereign ... His future is bound to be limitless. I can't predict it!" As Lord Marquis's subordinate, I can naturally benefit a little, but ... For a person like Lord Marquis, if he really leaves Silver moon, will he be limited to just one place? For us woman...A figure like Lord Marquis is free and easy, but...It will also be very bumpy. I'm afraid I won't be able to withstand these bumps. It's better to find a good backer and obediently wait in the rear, watching Lord Marquis flaunt your might through the world!"Interesting!Li Hao smiled and didn't say anything else. He nodded in agreement.Even though that day seemed to be very far away.But ... So what if he agreed?The sword fell into Li Hao's hands again. He sensed that he could probably carry it. After all, it was the sword of a human King. Although it was said that this venerable sovereign was a little weaker than the blood Emperor and the others, he was still a venerable sovereign and the wife of a human King. With the support of the human King, he should be strong no matter how weak he was.There should be another weapon in the world that could bear it.The starry sky sword!That was the sword city.However ... The sword city was within the seal, and it was not easy to take it away.However, it could also be used as a backup ... If the seal was really broken or slightly unsealed, sword city ... How about letting Hong Yitang use it?As for the human king's sword, should he give it to Lin Hongyu?She was not a swordsman.Li Hao fell into deep thought. A swordsman ... Actually, the ninth Division commander was not bad.However, li daoheng was his brother after all.In addition, there was another person in the world who was quite strong, Zhang an!Of course, on Zhang an's side, the neo martial artists ... Li Hao was actually not very willing to ask them for help. It was more troublesome."The Queen?"At this moment, he thought of a person. When it came to carrying the past and the future, the Queen's Silver Moon body might be able to do it. The Silver Moon was the core of the world, but ... The Queen and Li daoheng's relationship was too great. Moreover, this was a pig-like teammate ... It would be very easy for her to get herself killed.Forget it!The Queen would give up first. Of course, she could be used as a backup.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao began to run around.He began to perfect his plan bit by bit and prepared all kinds of backup plans. Without a certain degree of confidence, he was not willing to rely on luck completely. Too much luck would cause him to die without a burial ground.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.Void Dao universe.The entire great path universe was filled with some pressure. The entire heaven and earth seemed to sink at any moment.Zheng Yu was sitting cross-legged and cultivating.Suddenly, a person appeared beside him. Red Moon sovereign smiled and said,""You're quite carefree, Zheng Yu. I'm very curious. What have you prepared to face this so calmly?"Zheng Yu laughed,'I'm just a latecomer, what can I prepare? The Zheng family is just a small family, not even the direct descendant of the Zheng family in star suppression city. The only thing I can rely on is my half-step sovereign power. "Red Moon sovereign smiled and said nothing more."If you lose the fight ... Why don't you help me open the seal? actually, there's another way to open the seal, which is to break through the eight cities by force! At that time, I will stop the one in the North, and you will help me break through the eight cities ... What do you think?""You can't go back to neo martial! Just as you said, li daoheng might even have venerable the sword as a guarantor ... Of course, the premise is that everyone is dead and no one knows that he killed the entire li clan! "As for you, whether or not someone leaked the information, I think that Zhang an, li daoheng, and the others are all dead. You won't be able to return to neo martial for sure! Why don't you help me? I'll introduce you to the Redmoon world!" "The Crimson Moon world is more powerful than you think!"At that moment, Red Moon Emperor said enticingly,"in our Red Moon universe, there are more than one palm of experts at the level of the sun god!" Sun God's defeat was no accident. The master of our realm also knows the power of the new martial world's human King, the existence of Emperor Cang, and the strength of the other venerable sovereigns ... But he still dares to invade new martial world. It can be imagined that the power of our realm is far beyond imagination! All these years, our Crimson Moon cosmos has conquered several great cosmoses, and all of them have ended in victory!""That's really impressive ..." Zheng Yu chuckled."It's just that ... We're all trapped in the Silver Moon now, so there's not much point in talking about this.""No!"Red Moon sovereign shook her head and said meaningfully,"Zheng Yu, we've lost contact with Silver Moon. Whether red Moon won or not, it means that new martial arts won't have an easy time. Otherwise, they would have found him long ago! "Since they didn't get it back, it means that neo martial is under a lot of pressure. Even if they didn't lose, they must have encountered a problem, don't you think so?""I ... Suspect ..."He paused."The Silvermoon world. It might be near the Crimson Moon universe!""When we attacked that day, even though we didn't manage to stop venerable the sword, we were well prepared. It's very likely that we moved the Silver Moon to the Crimson Moon through our universe formation!"He looked at Zheng Yu."So, even if we really kill each other here, you might find out that we're in the range of the Crimson Moon if we really walk out!"Zheng Yu's eyes flickered, but he did not speak."You and I don't have much of a grudge," Red Moon sovereign said."On the contrary, you are the first to accept the power of the red moon. There is no harm in working with me!""I'll consider it a little more!""Think about it!"The red moon sovereign floated away. Zheng Yu looked at his back, smiled, and said nothing. Was it within the Crimson Moon universe?It was not impossible!It was just that ... It was hard to say. Perhaps it was at the back of neo martial arts?New martial didn't come to look for him. He just felt that it wasn't too dangerous and didn't bother.Who could say for sure?Looking at the void Dao universe, in the distance, there were also countless stars falling into the mortal world. It seemed that they would soon fall into the mortal world, into the Silver Moon. Was li daoheng anxious?Why was he so eager to get rid of Li Hao?"Maybe ... That includes me."He smiled, closed his eyes, and continued to cultivate. There was a lot of Phantom Dao power here, so it was a good place to cultivate.In the distance, a moon appeared again.It was brighter than before!Yueshen, who had been severely injured several times, had recovered once again. It seemed that she had not been too badly injured.Even further away, there was still some desire overflowing, like the power of the red moon. Zheng Yu knew whose Dao this was.Qian Wuliang!It seemed that li daoheng knew and was planning something. Would Qian Wuliang become Li Hao's weakness?Or was it Li Hao's counterattack?Who knows?Ever since Silver Moon had Li Hao, he had become even more interesting!
