 Hao lianchuan sighed. He was so troublesome.
 The top priority was still the meeting between the four major organizations. This was the key. They had to solve the internal problems first before dealing with the outside world. Otherwise, it would be difficult to deal with.
 The military and the inspection Division should not be a big problem.
 Old Zhao from the administrative Bureau was a stubborn guy and was a little difficult to deal with. Moreover, this time, that guy might be in contact with the higher-ups, which would be even more troublesome.
 Hao lianchuan knocked on the table lightly and thought for a while. He suddenly laughed as if he had thought of something.
 After a while, he picked up his communicator and made a call.
 "Contact Silver City and tell Li Hao to come to white moon City as soon as possible."
 Li Hao!
 At this moment, he thought of Li Hao.
  Of course, Li Hao's strength, status, and reputation were all ordinary, but he had a powerful teacher, and one who was a profound spirit Martial Master. Li Hao, hurry to white moon City. He had something he needed this kid's help with.
 If he had known earlier, he wouldn't have let that kid go back and would have just brought him back.
 ……
 Silver City.
 Li Hao was still devouring the mysterious energy when he suddenly felt a little uncomfortable.
 Did something go wrong with his cultivation?
 It can't be!
 He didn't pay much attention to it. It was just a little abnormal, so he continued to absorb.
 At this moment, it had been 24 hours since he started his closed-door cultivation.
 The continuous absorption made him feel a little explosive.
 His five internal organs were rapidly strengthening.
 ,m At this moment, his five internal organs had finally reached a balance, and each of them had absorbed about 800 cubic meters.  However, the momentum of the sword was not much stronger.
 It was difficult to strengthen one's aura by simply absorbing energy. It was mainly dependent on one's combat prowess and the strength of one's enemies. There was almost no improvement in aura by killing the weak. Only by fighting against the strong could one have a chance of improving.
 Among the small swords, a lot of sword energy had been consumed, and it was already a little weak.
 Li Hao sighed and crushed another divine power Stone. What a waste. This sword had already absorbed three divine power stones. If this continued, he really wouldn't be able to afford it. However, he needed to convert too much mysterious energy now, so he could only use it in such a wasteful way.
 The small sword picked and picked and absorbed some energy, converting it into sword energy. Li Hao didn't waste the remaining energy and absorbed it for his own cultivation.
 As the spleen grew stronger, the five internal organs were balanced.
 At this moment, Li Hao carefully observed the spleen. The earth sword was already very stable. Even if there was some rebellion, the spleen wouldn't be broken again. This meant that the five internal organs were now enough to support the earth sword's outburst.
 Before this, every time he exploded, Li Hao's internal organs would be damaged. If this continued, he would end up like hou Xiaochen, coughing up blood.
 Li Hao fell into deep thought.
  He exploded, coughed, and vomited blood ...  This was often the case when the five internal organs were damaged.
 Hou Xiaochen ... His internal organs were damaged?
 If he wasn't pretending, then it was really possible. The damage to the five internal organs was actually the most troublesome. If Li Hao didn't have sword energy, the damage to the five internal organs would be an extremely difficult injury to heal.
 "Whitemoon city ... Is now the center of the storm, the center of the storm!"
 "I have to keep a low profile when I go there."
 As he thought about this, Li Hao felt that he was not strong enough.
 Even if it had reached the standard of 1000 cubic meters, with the appearance of the earth sword, he was at most at the early stage of the three yang realm. Of course, if he could break out of the momentum, he might be a little stronger. If he could use the blood saber technique ... He might be a little stronger.
 However, it was still not enough!
 Spirit accumulation!
 Accumulating a spirit was still too weak.
 The most important thing right now was to strengthen his five internal organs. After that, he would consider accumulating the second soul. He had made the sword force the superclass, so it would be best to accumulate the five elements sword.
 "The earth sword has appeared. We're still short of the four Swords of metal, wood, water, and fire!"
 No matter what kind of force it was, it was enough to have a general attribute. In the end, it could be slowly polished and integrated into the sword force.
 However, Li Hao's ability to grasp the terrain was actually a stroke of luck. He didn't have much understanding of other types of Shi.
 The current him could be said to have fused the two forces. In fact, Li Hao was treating him as one force.
 Furthermore, after stepping into the thousand warrior tier, it was theoretically even more difficult to comprehend force. This was because the divine intent had been formed. At this time, the original force would hinder the other forces from being comprehended.
 "I have some ideas about water force. If I practice the ninth-refinement force to the extreme, I can sense it according to the waves. That's water force ... If I practice Shadowless Sword to the extreme, I might be able to sense a sword force ..."
 He thought of secret skills. The comprehension of Shi was often related to secret skills.
 Secret skills were difficult to comprehend without mastering them.
 "The five birds technique is what I've cultivated the most, and it's also my Foundation ... The one I've cultivated the longest is the ape technique, and the heart fire ape is also a type of fire ..."
  Of course, if he managed to cultivate it, then the heart fire ape would no longer be an ape, but a sword!
 As he cultivated, he pondered.
 Li Hao thought of many things and began to perfect his own ideas. Martial masters had to figure out their own ways to go beyond the thousand-player level.
 Also, Nanquan had said that the third blood transfusion could strengthen one's bones and muscles ... This was actually a way to strengthen himself.
 Perhaps, he could ask for guidance this time.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Even if every veteran warrior could not find the path to the next stage, they all had something in common in the stage. They had a strong qi and blood, a strong body, and strengthened the five internal organs ... In fact, everyone was strengthening the five internal organs.
 However, these people didn't have the experience of integrating, locking, and accumulating force and didn't dare to do it rashly.
 ……
 On the night of September 2nd.
 On the second day after he returned to the Silver City, Li Hao shattered six divine power stones and converted them into sword energy. He absorbed them all until late at night, and he finally achieved his goal!

 The amount of mysterious energy absorbed by his five internal organs had reached about 1000 cubic meters this time, so he had consumed a total of 5000 cubic meters of mysterious energy!
 It was an astronomical figure ... But Li Hao didn't think it was a waste.
 He had used seven divine power stones, including the one he had used earlier.
 Li Hao only had 18 left. In fact, he only had 12, because some of them were bigger and didn't count as one.
 Li Hao had used up most of his gains from the relic.
 As for how much his strength had improved, he was not sure.
 If he didn't fight, who knew how much he had improved?
 ……
 3rd of September, morning.
 Li Hao walked out of the lounge.
  After taking a shower and changing into a new set of clothes, he felt refreshed.
 At this moment, there was an accessory hanging on his chest. It was the chain that he had used to hang the starry sky sword. Now, he had a bronze mirror hanging on it. It wasn't too big, and he had obtained it from Qiao Feilong. It had the effect of concealing one's aura.
 A Martial Master would not be easily exposed.
 However, once a Martial Master entered the warrior dimension, ordinary people would not be able to sense it. However, as a warrior of the warrior dimension, it was easy for them to sense the other party's Shi!
 No one noticed Li Hao's Shi because he was wearing this thing.
 At first, Li Hao didn't take it seriously.
 But now that he had met many martial masters, Li Hao didn't dare to not wear it. Otherwise, master powerhouses like Nanquan could easily sense the changes in him. In fact, even veteran martial masters like Hong Yitang could vaguely sense it now that he had become a super.
 Li Hao suspected that he had gotten the bronze mirror from the stone gate. It might seem simple, but it was not ordinary. It had a very good aura-concealing effect. Moreover ... The bronze mirror might not have been revived. It might also be an origin divine weapon, but it had been sealed.
 Zhang Ting's shadow snake sword was the reason why he had such a thought. That sword also had the ability to conceal one's aura, which was similar to the bronze mirror. However, the bronze mirror didn't need to recognize its master and could easily conceal one's aura.
 In Li Hao's opinion, it might be even more powerful than the shadow snake sword.
 Li Hao was wearing the bronze mirror pendant, the Earthcover sword at his waist, and the starry sky sword, which he had tied to the inside of his boots with a special strap.
 On his hand, he was also wearing the storage ring that Fei Tian had given him.
 However, at this moment, it was empty.
 Li Hao didn't want to show off the rest of the divine power stones, so he swallowed them again. A Martial master's stomach could also be used as a storage ring at his warrior energy level, but it couldn't store much.
 The 12 stones were the size of glass balls, which was not too big.
 However, he had to spit it out every time he used it, which was a little disgusting. Li Hao really wanted to get a storage treasure. As the number of treasures increased, he almost had no place to put them.
 "Li Hao!"
 Li Hao had just finished packing and walked out of the door when Liu Long put on his windbreaker again. He quickly walked over and said in a deep voice,""I'm going up, but Nanquan has been waiting at the door and is unwilling to leave. It's very troublesome! In addition, are you leaving for white moon City today or tomorrow? you've never been to white moon City, so I've thought about it, and I won't send you there. I'll have Wang Ming send you there. "
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "He's familiar with that place, and the Wang family is also a little powerful. If he follows you, he can help out a little, so he won't be completely ignorant over there. Also, Liu Yan is over there ... Tell her not to come back for the time being. "
 Liu Long quickly said,"a good man has three helpers. Liu Yan's strength is not too strong, but she has broken through the late-stage of 100. She can do some things. Some things need people to do it, and only people you trust can do it. White moon City is not Silver City. There are dangers and traps everywhere ... She will be useful to help you run errands."
 Li Hao didn't know whether to laugh or cry at his words."Boss, I'm going to take a post there. I might be back in a few days. Why is it like going up a mountain of daggers and going down a sea of fire?"
 Liu Long sneered,"do you think that the White moon City can be peaceful now?" Moreover, the ruins will open again next month, so these people won't leave easily. Right now, the White moon City is very lively!"
 "You ... You're the kind of person who makes people worry less?"  Li Hao was speechless."Boss, I've never caused any trouble. I still have a banner. Who doesn't know about my reputation in the Silver City? I'm willing to help others, and I'm hardworking. You can go to the security room and ask. Who doesn't say that I, Li Hao, am an honest man?"
 What do you mean by I'm not the kind of person who can make people worry?
 This was so unfair!
 Liu Long was speechless when he heard the banner. After a while, he said,"Since you know, then continue to be honest! I know that your wings have hardened and you are stronger now, but think about it, can you block hou bu's spear? If you can 't, then continue to keep a low profile!"
 "As for the silver Blizzard city, I'm here. Don't worry, unless the three suns come, even if they do, they might be able to resist."
 "Do we need to take any precautions at the mine?" he lowered his voice.
 Li Hao shook his head."No need. Just let nature take its course."
 Even if someone found out, they wouldn't be able to open it.
 Li Hao then smiled."Then I'll go home and pack a few clothes. I'll go to my teacher's place and see if I should take something with me. If there's nothing else, I'll leave tonight and reach white moon City tomorrow morning."
 Then, he laughed."With the southern Fist around, I'll have one more bodyguard. That's not bad. I'll take him away!"
 Liu Long nodded and whispered,"be careful, the southern style ... Is not necessarily a simple-minded one!" "Also, when you go to Whitemoon city, don't trust others too much. Hou Xiaochen is an important figure, so he won't have the time to take care of you. It's more important for you to use each other and benefit from each other. Your teacher, you, and one of the eight great families" bloodlines are all the things he's used to protect and nurture you!"
 "Don't feel bad ..."
 Li Hao smiled,"boss, I understand!" He's not my father, so why must he take care of me? Teacher took care of me because I was his student, his last disciple. We were like father and son. The boss took care of me because I was his teammate. We protected the Silver City together, fought together, and were like brothers. As for Whitemoon city, I don't even know or know them, so who would take care of me for no reason?"
 Liu Long smiled and patted his shoulder.
 This was the good thing about Li Hao. He was very insightful.
 It was good that he understood. Otherwise, he was worried that this guy would become too dependent on hou Xiaochen, which would eventually lead to problems.
 "Boss, I'll go out first. Oh right, I won't be here for a while, so I can't help you extract that thing ... You can absorb and rush as you like, just don't kill yourself. When I come back, I'll help you heal!"
 If he left, these people could only absorb mysterious energy to strengthen themselves or absorb divine power stones, but they would all be damaged.
 But it didn't matter. When Li Hao returned, the sword could be repaired.
 "Don't be reluctant to use the divine power stones," he added."The only way is to improve your strength. If you keep them, they might end up as other people's spoils of war!"
 "I don't understand as much as you do?"
 "Don't worry!"Liu Long chuckled and nodded.
  "Boss, I'll be going out then. If I'm leaving ... I won't come to say hello!"
 Li Hao waved his hand and exhaled. He would come back. He didn't want to say goodbye to anyone, so he just treated this as a simple business trip.
 After waving at Liu Long again, Li Hao walked out of the basement.
 After he left, Yun Yao and the others came out from behind.
 "Li Hao also left, Captain Liu also left, and the king's troops also had to follow ... Boss, our team is getting smaller and smaller." Chen Jian was a little dejected.
 Liu Long was extremely calm,"what's the rush? he'll be back sooner or later!" The Silver City is the core of the Silver Moon. The few of you, the right path is to cultivate properly. Now, if you haven't reached the thousand warrior ... No, even if you haven't reached the yunshen three yang, it'll be very difficult for you to survive!"
 He didn't look at Li Hao. He believed that Li Hao would return.
 This included Yuan Shuo!
 Silver City had too many secrets.
 The master and disciple wouldn't give up on the ruins in the mine.

 Outside the Silver City.
 Three people, three motorcycles.
 This time, Li Hao's group of three didn't drive.
 The reason why there were three of them was that apart from Wang Ming, who was familiar with white moon City, He Yong of the southern Fist had been following them all this time, never leaving their side.
 He chose to ride a motorcycle like he Yong.
 This old man was very fashionable despite his age. It was said that motorcycles were extremely popular in the central region. There were actually very few in Silver City, but the few big groups in the Galaxy had some reserves. With Li Hao and Wang Ming's status, it wouldn't be a problem to get two.
 The three of them rode the bike at an extremely fast speed.
 The wind was very strong!
 The night was just right.
 However, their conversation was not affected at all.
  "Senior Nan, this bike is pretty good. Do people in the central continent ride this kind of bike now?"
 Li Hao was very curious about the central region. In fact, the central region was a broad division. There were more than 20 provinces in the central region, all of which were part of the central region.
 "It's more convenient than a car, and it consumes less energy!"
 He Yong said loudly and then laughed,""Also, my surname isn't Nan, so don't call me senior Nan!"
 The southern Fist was just a title.
 He Yong had been following Li Hao the entire time. Whether it was Li Hao or Liu Long, they all suspected that this person wasn't just looking for Yuan Shuo. Perhaps he had some other purpose, and even represented the royal family to pay attention to the eight great families of Silver City.
 However, at this stage, if this person chose to follow, or follow openly ... It meant that the other party had no intention of harming or killing anyone for the time being. If that was the case, Li Hao was not afraid.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Having a free bodyguard and helper was also a very satisfying thing.
 How much would it cost to hire a three suns?
 "This is a good thing," He Yong said."It's different from the older generation of cars. As long as you burn your inner strength or mysterious energy, you can drive it. So, as long as you get a Martial Master or a super, you don't have to worry about not being able to use it!"
 When he Yong talked about this, he was also excited."The central region is much more prosperous than you can imagine! It was completely different from the border. If the border is still closed and is in a half-reformed area, then the central region can be said to be a modern country!"
 He sighed with emotion,"the social system there is different from here!" There's even a superpower Academy in the central continent where countless supers are systematically developed!"
 "There's also a Martial Master Academy there. Even though the Martial Master realm has declined, there are still some older martial masters who are still persisting!"
 "There are powerful financial groups there. They are also excavating the archaeological ruins and are rising rapidly."
 "The three major organizations that you know of are developing in the central region at a much faster rate than you can imagine! Although they have not established a country yet and have not really occupied any provinces, some of the central provinces have already started to accept them. They have even set up the Super Academies belonging to the three great organizations in the provinces!"
  These words were like a heavenly book.  Wang Ming was in disbelief and couldn't believe it. As he drove, he shouted,"How is that possible? The three major organizations are dark power organizations. The central region is the core area of the nine divisions and the dynasty. How can they be allowed to recruit new people?"
 This was impossible!
 It shouldn't be.
 "Strength is King!"
 He Yong's face was calm."You must know that the three major organizations are extremely powerful. Take the red moon for example. In the seventh month of the red moon, apart from the purple Moon, everyone else is at the sunrise rank. There is also an Elder Council that also has a group of sunrise rank experts!"
 "Ying Hongyue and the others ... They might have already surpassed this level!"
 "In the past 20 years, the development of superpowers has been rapid. In three to five years, it will definitely enter the next stage: Starlight, Dark Moon, sunlit, three suns, and sunrise. This is actually only the fifth stage. There are more than five super locks discovered. As the ancient ruins are excavated, more and more things are revealed. The middle part ... Is completely different!"
 "Silver Moon is still at the stage he was 20 years ago. To be honest, he's a little outdated, and he's also a little stubborn ..."
 He Yong sighed with some helplessness and sorrow.
 "However, it's not just Silver Moon. In fact, apart from the central region, the entire border area of the dynasty is like this. Apart from the central region, it seems like the entire dynasty is divided into two classes."
 "There are more and more experts in the central region, and they're actually full of disdain for the border. Although they call it the border ... In their eyes, the Silver Moon isn't the border, but the wilderness!"
 The wilderness!
 Li Hao and Wang Ming were both taken aback when they heard this.
 The wilderness ... What did that mean?
  They seemed to understand a little, but ... They still could not understand why Silver Moon had become a wilderness.
 In some books, there was an introduction to the wilderness, which was like eating raw meat and drinking blood!
 So, in the eyes of the central continent's people, our Silver Moon is just an era where we eat raw meat and drink blood?
 "Silver Moon martial forest was indeed powerful twenty years ago," He Yong said loudly. "However, superpowers are developing rapidly now, while Silver Moon is lagging behind. Other than hou Xiaochen, there are only a few three suns to keep up the facade. However, you must know that in the central region, perhaps today, the rising light is still a top-notch existence. Tomorrow, someone or an organization may discover the secret of the next level of the rising light!"
 "There are even some superpower cities in the central region!"
 "What's a SuperPower City?"Wang Ming asked, a little confused.
 He did not understand.
 Or rather, he understood a little, but he couldn't believe it.
 "It's a city made up of supers!"
 He Yong shouted,"supers are very mysterious in your eyes, right?" Do you know how many provinces there are in the central region? How many people? It had exceeded 2 billion! The Silver Moon is a barren land for supers, and in the central continent, there's one in a thousand ..."

 Wang Ming quickly calculated. One in a thousand, ten million would be ten thousand, and one hundred million would be one hundred thousand ...
 Does that mean that there are more than 2 million supers in the central continent?
 2 million!
 He was in a daze. He knew a thing or two about the central continent, but he had never been there before. He had only learned some simple information from those who had been there.
 Two million supers?
 'This ... This is impossible!
 How could that be possible?
 On Silver moon's side, there were not many night watchers in the entire Night Watcher system, including the various branches in the various cities. There were at most 1000 of them, and there were still quite a number of Sunglow 's.
 The three major organizations, swords gate, island of light, and a few other smaller organizations added up to a total of one to two thousand people.
  Hence, there were no more than 5000 supers in the entire Silver Moon!
 This included the garrison, the inspection Division, and the administration Bureau.
 Silver Moon, on the other hand, had a population of a hundred million.
 The central region had a ratio of one in a thousand, while Silver Moon had a ratio of one in twenty thousand. In other words, there would only be one super in twenty thousand people.
 A difference of 20 times!
 "Why is it like this?"
 At this moment, Li Hao was also surprised."Other than being blessed by the heavens, one also needs to draw energy into their body to become a super. Not everyone can become a super. Silver Moon might be a little behind, but a difference of 20 times is too big!" Why are there so many supers in the central continent?"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com 2 million didn't seem like a lot. After all, the population was so large.
 However, two million supers ... That was more than the total population of the two silver cities.
 Li Hao did not think much of supercities before, but now that he thought about it, was it really that difficult to form a city with so many supers?
 He had all sorts of powers.
 If they had the heart, they could instantly build a city even in the wilderness. After all, there were so many people.
 He Yong saw that the two of them were shocked and laughed,""First, Silver Moon has always kept his superpowers a secret, and not many people know about them. Because of the war in the central continent, everyone knows about the existence of supers, so they are not mysterious. Everyone wants to become a super. "  "Second, drawing energy into the body depends on the consumption of mysterious energy. All the large organizations, including the nine divisions and all the core members of the royal family are in the central region. All the benefits are in the central region, so there is no lack of mysterious energy ... Moreover, the constant war has led to the frequent deaths of supers. Under death, the mysterious energy will dissipate. In fact, many ordinary people have accidentally entered the realm of supers."
 "Third, a large number of ancient sites have been excavated in the central region. We've even discovered some secret divine power Stone storehouses ... They might have been strategic locations in the past, and there are a lot of divine power stones stored in them!"
 "Fourth, news travels even faster in the central continent. Once a superpower technique is invented, it's quickly spread, including the method of drawing energy into one's body. In fact, it has already been replaced many times. As for Silver Moon, he's still only using the method you invented yourself and has yet to break away from the Martial Master System!"
 Silver moon's energy drawing technique was actually a modified breathing technique.
 The central region was also completely different!
 It was more suitable for supers to draw energy!
 "Fifth, the central region is the core of the entire starry sky World. The mysterious energy particles are even denser in the central region, while the Silver Moon is only a border region."
 “……”
 Li Hao and the other man fell silent.
 Was the central region ... That powerful?
 Wang Ming quickly thought of something and retorted,"The central continent is so powerful, but why aren't the people from the central continent that powerful? Look at that Xuguang, he was still killed by our department head with one shot! And you martial masters, you're still not as good as teacher Yuan!"
 What are you bragging about!
  You have 2 million supers, you have countless geniuses, you have countless powerhouses ... But, didn't you all still get killed by our side?
 "Young man, Yuan Shuo is the essence of the last generation of martial masters. That's why he's very strong. However, there are many martial masters in the central continent who have Qian Warriors. Some of them have even gone into seclusion to find a way to reach the Qian warrior realm. I can only say that Yuan Shuo is one step ahead of them, but that doesn't mean that he's invincible among the martial masters!"
 "As for superpowers, hou Xiaochen is one in a billion. He might have been a warrior master a long time ago, and he's a genius in martial arts. After all, superpowers have only been around for 20 years ... But that doesn't mean he'll always be strong!"
 He Yong continued,"there will be some geniuses and monsters everywhere. However, we can't use them to represent the strength of the entire region. We can only say that they don't have universal power. Do you understand?"
 "Some of the geniuses and experts in the central region actually look down on the border and don't want to come here," he continued. You have to know that some of the heaven-blessed priests started at the radiant sun, and soon reached the three suns, and then the rising light in a few years ... Now, some of the heaven-blessed priests have already gone far on the path of the rising light, and even have the hope of breaking the sixth Super Lock and becoming the next Master after the rising light!"
 Li Hao smiled.
 What he Yong said might be the truth.
 But why did he say all this?
 Li Hao said,"senior, since the central continent is so powerful, why do we still care about Silver Moon?" The three great organizations have stationed many people here. Senior, you've also come, and many others ... There are even people who are afraid that the Marquis tribe will do something. Since the Central Plains are confident that they can quickly resolve all their problems ... Why would they still care about a Savage expert like the Marquis tribe?"

 You're already so powerful, and you're still afraid of this?
 "It's not that I'm afraid ... Forget it, there's no need to belittle Silver Moon. After all, this is our home. Hou Xiaochen and the others are indeed amazing, but I'm only saying this so that young people like you can understand that it's not a good thing to be ignorant!"He Yong laughed.
 "To put it bluntly, if I hadn't left Silver Moon back then, I might still be a cultivator who has broken through 100 perfection. But after I left, my horizons have been broadened, so even though I haven't reached the spirit accumulation stage, I've still managed to create my own experience in the path of Qian Qian!"
 Li Hao didn't say anything else. Perhaps this person was right.
 With more knowledge and a higher vision, it could indeed broaden one's horizons.
 For example, if he had always been compared to the demon hunting squad, he would have long become the strongest. However ... When he saw that sword, that back, that crazy murderer ...
 He suddenly felt that even if hou Xiaochen was so powerful that he could shake the entire world, what would happen?
 There was no' then '.
 Li Hao wasn't too shocked. He was just shocked that hou Xiaochen had hidden his strength so well and was quite powerful. But to say that hou Xiaochen was invincible in Li Hao's eyes ... That would be a joke.
 Whether it was the sword of his ancestor or the ancient people he had seen, Li Hao felt that hou Xiaochen ... Could be easily crushed.
  If someone appeared right now and killed hou Xiaochen with a single slap, Wang Ming and the others would be in disbelief and might even go crazy.
 But Li Hao felt that ... Oh, there were such experts in the modern world too.
 Therefore, Li Hao didn't think He Yong's suggestion to go out and see the world was wrong. However, did he Yong and the others really see a world that was more open than Silver Moon 's?
 Not necessarily!
 The Silver Moon was a unique historical site. Li Hao felt that even the central continent might not have it.
 For example, the ruins of the stone gate, or this heaven battling city. Were the ruins in the central region more powerful than these?
 ……
 The three cars moved quickly.
 Li Hao, who couldn't drive a car, was like a fish in water in this one.
 Wang Ming was still immersed in the world He Yong had sketched out, unable to extricate himself and somewhat remorseful.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao, on the other hand, had stopped thinking about it.
 What's wrong with the central region?
 He Yong had actually been observing them all this time. Seeing that Li Hao's expression did not change and he continued to drive as if he was not affected or affected, he could not help but laugh and said again,""Li Hao, do you want to go to the central continent? If you want to, you can come with me to stellarsky city instead of white moon City. "
 "You must know that Heavenly Star City is the center of the entire world! Over there, you've never seen so many good things. What you feel is extremely precious today might just be some people's toys ..."
 "There are many martial masters and even more superpowers there. Countless experts are gathered in stellarsky city."
 "There are famous super Academies in the royal family and the nine divisions. There are countless priests blessed by the heavens. Even large organizations will send people here to exchange pointers and promote the development of supers ..."
  Li Hao was extremely calm."Forget it. I'm from a small place and have never seen the world. Perhaps I'll go there in the future, but I'm just a country bumpkin in Silver Moon who has never seen the world. I've never even been to Whitemoon city. Going to Whitemoon city will be enough for me to gain some knowledge."  He was a country bumpkin!
 It was very, very uncouth. He had only been to one or two cities in his life, and they were all similar to Silver City.
 White moon City, a large city with a population of 30 million, he had never been there before.
 Was that place prosperous?
 He did not know.
 What would a big city with a population of 30 million look like?
 He did not know.
 Sometimes, even Li Hao couldn't imagine how prosperous a native of white moon City like Wang Ming was.
 Sky Star City was too far away.
 The journey from here to stellarsky city spanned across many provinces. Even sunguang would need three days to arrive. According to He Yong, they would need to take a plane, a fast bus, and many transfers before they could fly.
 Didn't he say that he would fly over directly?
 If he flew over directly, he would die.
 Ten thousand miles away, even the rising light couldn't withstand it, it was extremely far away.
 Seeing this, He Yong didn't say anything.
 He was just making a casual remark. It would be strange if Li Hao really went.
  Li Hao was not interested in asking anymore.
 Wang Ming came back to his senses at this time. He couldn't hold back his curiosity and wasn't afraid of another blow, so he asked again,"Senior Nan, I've heard that the central region is in constant war and chaos. The people are displaced ... But why is it that the central region is still prosperous?"
 "The central region is too big!"
 He Yong smiled."The chaos you speak of is only in a small part of the region. Moreover, the number of battles is decreasing and it doesn't really affect the ordinary people. Even if a City War breaks out, it's not worth mentioning to the entire central region!"
 "Silver Moon province has more than 30 cities, and there are close to 1000 cities in the central region ... A battle of one city can cause a huge commotion in Silver Moon, but in the central region, there are more than 1000 cities. How many people would care if a city is in chaos?"
 Wang Ming nodded. He had almost sent the car flying, but he couldn't help saying,"Well ... A 20-year-old sunray is rare even in the central continent, right?"
 I'm only 20 years old!
 "Haha!" He Yong laughed and said,"that ... There's quite a lot! Of course, the main reason is that there are a lot of god tier Masters. In some of the Super Academies, some of the 17 - 18-year-old children are already at the radiant sun level ... Of course, there aren't many of them. If you go to the central region, you can be considered a little genius. "
 Little genius?
 Wang Ming was speechless.

 Li Hao, on the other hand, was still calm. Seeing that Wang Ming seemed to have suffered a blow, Li Hao calmly said,""What senior said might be the truth, but I'm afraid that the superhumans and God tier Masters that senior mentioned are all living under the protection of powerful people ... There aren't many who can really fight, right?"
 He Yong did not say anything.
 Li Hao continued,'Silver Moon martial forest was very famous back then, and everyone said that they wanted to fight. Perhaps, in their eyes, this is the only good thing about the Wildlands. At least, we've all seen blood!"
 Wasn't the wilderness like this?
 Whether it was the martial masters or superpowers of Silver Moon, they didn't feel much after killing someone. Killing was something that was ingrained in their bones. Whether it was Li Hao or Wang Ming, it was their first time killing someone, so they didn't feel much.
 After all, didn't the Silvermoon people, martial masters, and supers all go through the same thing?
 Although there were many wars in the central continent, those geniuses were probably slowly growing under protection, right?
 "You're right, Silver Moon has his own merits,"He Yong laughed.
 Li Hao continued,"senior, you're a Martial Master who left Silver Moon. You've also said that there are many mid-tier douqian, even in the royal family. However, you were able to mingle with the royal family like a fish in water. I think that's because of your experience in Silver Moon." Am I right?"
  "Not bad!"
 He Yong agreed."You're right about this. There are many Qian fighters in the central region. However, if you say that they can compare to us ... Then you've really overestimated them!" "Of course, the younger generation may not be able to do so. For example, your boss, Liu Long, may have some experience, but he may not be the best in the central region. However, your master, me, or any of the famous martial masters from Silvermoon back then, if we go to the central region, we'll all be grandfathers in the path of martial masters!"
 That was enough.
 Perhaps this person was boasting a little, but it was a fact that he was doing well in the royal family. Otherwise, why would they let him go wherever he wanted?
 He might even have been given some missions?
 Li Hao didn't say anything else, as there was no need to.
 The central region ... Was too far away.
 ……
 Silver City was thousands of miles away from the crosscut Canyon.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com After crossing the crosscut Canyon, they still had to travel another thousand li to reach the White moon City. In total, it was more than two thousand li.
 It was a new popular motorcycle, and it was very fast.
 It wasn't difficult to drive a hundred miles in an hour, but by the time the sun rose on the 4th, Li Hao's group had only just crossed the transverse Canyon. It would probably be night before they reached white moon City.
 On the other side of the transverse Canyon.
 Li Hao's group of three were also considered experts. They carried the motorcycle out of the canyon, drove it in the canyon, and then carried it to the other side. Ordinary people couldn't do this.  At this moment, the three of them were tired.
 After running around for an entire night, he was not physically tired, but he was mentally exhausted.
 After crossing the cross-section Canyon, a road appeared in the distance. It looked quite neat. In the distance, there were city buildings. They were from other cities. Whitemoon city was still far away.
 It was different from the desolation in the Silver City.
 Li Hao watched silently. He even saw people working in the fields in the distance.
 In Silver City, too far away from the city was a no man's land!
 The few of them sat down, rested, drank water, and ate some biscuits to fill their stomachs.
 Seeing Li Hao staring into the distance, Wang Ming came over and said,"The closest one here is Valley City, only a few dozen miles away from us. If we keep going, we will pass yaoguang city, and then another two hundred miles and we will reach white moon City!"
 Li Hao had seen the map.
 He nodded and looked into the distance."Whitemoon city has a population of 30 million, but I've looked at the map and calculated. Whitemoon city doesn't seem to be too big. It's at least not as big as 30 blizzards. Don't you feel crowded normally?"
 Wang Ming laughed, and so did he Yong.
 "Why would I!" Wang Ming laughed.
  "Li Hao, you underestimate white moon City too much. Let's put it this way, most of the buildings you see in Silver City are three stories. The higher ones are six stories, and the higher ones are at most ten stories."
 "But in Whitemoon city, 30-story buildings are everywhere!"
 Li Hao also laughed."I understand ... It's building up one floor at a time. If the space isn't big enough, then we'll rely on the higher-ups to solve the pressure. In this case ... Don't you feel uncomfortable?"
 "It's all high-rise buildings. I feel very pressured to survive."
 "I don't think so!" Wang Ming shrugged.
 He Yong interjected."White moon City is still okay. There are many buildings that are more than a hundred stories in stellarsky city. There are even some super buildings appearing now. For example, an earth element sunguang might be able to build a super building that is a hundred meters or even a thousand meters tall in a day ..."
 Wang Ming also said,"Li Hao, don't embarrass yourself too much when you go to white moon City. It's different there; white moon City has more cars and people. Also, it's different from Silver City in that the inspector's office practically has the final say. Over there, the administration Bureau, the inspector's office, the night patrollers, and the garrison troops are all the same. The night patrollers actually don't participate in these daily management, so the administration Bureau has the final say."
 "Also, a small city is actually a bit good. There are no people we can't afford to offend. In Whitemoon city ... We have to keep a low profile. For example, if we accidentally bump into the son of a commander or the grandson of the director ... Other than these, there are many large groups in Whitemoon city. They have even begun to develop into financial groups. They have also recruited many supers ..."
 Wang Ming was afraid that Li Hao wouldn't know these things and would easily cause trouble, so he patiently introduced them to him one by one.

 "Of course," he added,"you were personally recruited by the Minister, so no one would dare to provoke you. But ... We can't just look for the Minister and the others for everything, right?"
 Li Hao nodded slightly.
 ? Wang Ming chuckled and said,"but don't be afraid, I'm here!" My Wang family is also a little powerful. "
 Li Hao didn't ask this question before, but this time, he was interested.""Your family is also from the Tiger wing Army?"
 "That's not it!"
 "The garrison is divided into three parts," Wang Ming explained. "The Tiger wing Army is only one of them. The Silver Moon Army is the central Army, which is also the nominal Central Army of the three armies. Also, the White Dragon Army. My master is here. "
 The White Dragon Army.
 "Is your father a commander like Hu dingfang?" Li Hao asked again.
 "Cough cough ..."
 "How could that be?" Wang Ming said embarrassedly,"Commander-in-Chief ... Definitely not!" Otherwise, with my status, how can I be a night patrol? My dad ... My dad is nothing, but my Grandpa is the most important. My Grandpa is the Vice Commander-in-Chief of the White Dragon Army. "
  In his Wang family, the highest-ranking person was his grandfather. In fact, he wasn't bad, or rather, he was very powerful!
 However, Li Hao didn't feel that it was too impressive.
 The main reason was that he had seen Hu dingfang, the commander of the Tiger wing Army.
 No wonder he didn't seem to know Wang Ming when he greeted him last time ... It was actually normal. Hu dingfang was equivalent to the White Dragon Army's Commander-in-Chief, and he definitely knew the Vice Commander-in-Chief. However, the grandson of the Vice Commander-in-Chief ... Really didn't enter Hu dingfang's eyes.
 "Hu dingfang doesn't look old. How can he be the commander of the Tiger wing Army?"
 Li Hao was somewhat curious. Was it because of strength?
 However, did the military only look at strength?
 Wang Ming thought for a moment and said,"commander Hu isn't that old, about 40 years old." He has been in charge of the Tiger wing Army for eight years. He was already in charge of the Tiger wing Army when he was in his thirties. "
 "I'm not too sure about the details. I only know that it seemed to be more than ten years ago. At that time, the Tiger wing Army had some problems. I don't know if it was a rebellion or a superpower attack ... Anyway, many people from the Tiger wing Army died that time. I think commander Hu almost died that time ..."
 He continued,"later, there seemed to be some turmoil in the Tiger wing Army, which lasted for several years. Then, Marshal Hu stood up and pacified the chaos with his powerful strength and decisive personality. The Tiger wing Army was reorganized. After that, he became the leader of the Tiger wing Army. He killed many people at that time."
 "Because some senior generals are dead. Although commander Hu is young, he is still very prestigious in the Tiger wing Army!"
 Li Hao was deep in thought. Hao lianchuan said that Hu dingfang knew the five birds technique and the breathing technique of five birds ...
 Hu dingfang's rapid progress to the late stage of three yang realm was related to the breathing technique of five birds?  Who taught him this?
 It was definitely not his teacher. Otherwise, his teacher would not have kept quiet about it.
 Senior Sister?
 Li Hao slightly frowned. He knew that he had a Senior Sister in white moon City.
 He was in his 30S. Li Hao didn't know his name, but his teacher had mentioned him a few times, but he didn't mention it again. He would subconsciously mention it and then change the topic.
 If Hao lianchuan knew about it, the teacher probably also knew that Hu dingfang knew the breathing technique of five birds, right?
 Since he didn't kill him ... He didn't know if it was because he wasn't strong enough or for some other reason. However, his teacher didn't mention it. Perhaps he silently agreed, or perhaps he felt that there was no need to mention it.
 Li Hao nodded and didn't ask further.
 "Hu dingfang is indeed a good seedling for the military, but the one with the most prestige in Silver Moon is still that commander Yu of the Silver Moon Army!" He Yong said.
 He knew that Li Hao didn't know him, so he explained with a smile,""Commander Yu is an old general. He has been in charge of the Silver Moon Army for 30 years. When I left, he was the commander of the entire Silver Moon Army!"
 "This person is the one you need to pay attention to."
 "There's no other reason. Back then, this person was quite famous in Silver Moon martial forest. "
  "He's from the martial arts world?"
 Li Hao was stunned, and he Yong shook his head,"no, but he is a Martial Master!" When your master was at his peak, no one dared to fight him! We don't know who won or lost, and neither of them said anything. But since then, your master has helped the military complete a few missions. The outside world knows that your master may have owed a favor or made a friendship. "
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Those that your master has a good relationship with ... Or rather, those that he didn't kill, all have their own reasons. Of course, he might not dare to kill that person. After all, that person is not an ordinary person."
 "Actually, we're not too sure about that person's strength. He doesn't need to rely on his strength to suppress the martial arts world. Back then, the martial arts world and the military didn't provoke each other. However, you can indeed pay attention to this person. We're not too sure if he's a super or a Martial Master."
 Li Hao nodded.
 "He's very low-key, but he does have a lot of prestige,"Wang Ming said." When my grandfather mentions commander Yu, he mostly admires him. Out of the three armies, only the Silvermoon Army has really participated in the war. The other two armies don't have much killing intent. "
 "A great battle?"
 Li Hao felt that he was ill-informed again."Why is there a war?"
 "You don't know,"
 Wang Ming explained,"it did. About twenty years ago, there were rebellions in a few provinces in hopes of breaking away from the dynasty's rule. The Silvermoon Army was ordered to go south, and it was commander Yu who led the Silvermoon Army South to fight the rebellions. We were close to them, so before the central Army had even moved in, commander Yu had already defeated more than 500000 troops of the three province coalition Army ... I'm actually not sure how they fought, but at that time, the Silvermoon Army only had more than 100000 people. This was very inconceivable. They won with fewer people and directly quelled the rebellion!"

 "It's related to the three major organizations."
 He Yong added,"the rebellion in the three provinces has the shadow of the three major organizations. Back then, they might have discovered the secret of the superpowers. The reason for the rebellion is still unclear. After all, it was better to keep a low profile back then ... But later, some people said that the three major organizations might have already been established at that time. They discovered something important and fought over it, which eventually led to changes in the three provinces!"
 "Commander Yu suppressed the rebellion and defeated the many with a small number of people ... The central government has some information, but they are all blocked. As far as I know, maybe commander Yu finished off some of the experts from the three major organizations. As for the details, I'm afraid only he knows."
 “……”
 The two of them continued to provide Li Hao with new knowledge.
 Wang Ming was easy to deal with, but He Yong didn't know what he was thinking. Some things and some information had actually been collected by the imperial family, and he had told Li Hao everything without any restraint.
 Gradually, Li Hao gained a better understanding of white moon City.
 This huge city with a population of thirty million was a hundred times more complicated than Silver City!
 Many big shots who could not be provoked were here.
 The core of the entire Silver Moon was also here.
  In addition to these current big shots, there were also some big shots who had retired from the central continent, some big shots whose families held important positions in other provinces, and many, many more ... In any case, Li Hao couldn't afford to offend them.
 Hou Xiaochen wasn't his father, and even if he was, there were still people that the second generation couldn't afford to offend.
 If hou Xiaochen hadn't rebelled yet, then his status in Silver Moon wasn't the highest.
 Li Hao quickly took note of this.
 In the end, Wang Ming remembered something and was about to get into the car when he said,"Right, there's also the inner circle of the night patrollers! Remember, within the night patrollers, hou bu is the most powerful. However, the second is not Hao bu, but chief Yu!"
 "Chief Yu ... The woman who has been following the Marquis?"
 "Right!"
 Li Hao knew that the woman ... Was very powerful, very powerful!
 The rising light!
 Before, Li Hao wasn't sure, but after seeing the red-haired man's death, he knew that the woman was at the level of suguang.
 "She is the wife of the Marquis?"
 "No."
 "But I think they're very close," Li Hao said, feeling strange.
 "Who knows? just don't talk nonsense."
 Wang Ming chuckled and said,"chief Yu has been taking care of the Marquis all these years, so it's not that ... It's actually pretty much the same." The Marquis does not personally participate in many of the night patrollers "matters, big or small. It is often her who gives the orders."
 "If I were Hao lianchuan ..." He Yong sneered,"I would've quit a long time ago. A woman is riding on top of me!"
 Wang Ming didn't care what he said and continued,"The third is Hao bu. He's a good person and easy to talk to. If anyone has a problem, they usually look for him to solve it. If they can't solve it, they go to chief Yu."
 At this point, Wang Ming chuckled."Chief Steward Yu can be quite mean sometimes, but if you have trouble and go to her, she says she can solve it ... She can solve almost everything! As for department head Hao ... He readily agreed, but he can only solve half of the ten problems. "  Li Hao laughed.
 At Wang Ming's words, Li Hao felt that Hao lianchuan was really quite sorrowful. His subordinates all thought the same, so it was clear that his ability to do things ... Was just so-so.
 The car continued to move forward.
 The three of them did not stop.
 Even when they encountered some people and some towns, they didn't stop.
 The three eye-catching motorcycles also attracted a lot of attention, but no one had any thoughts about it. He Yong looked very tough at first glance. Who would dare to provoke this big bearded man?
 ……
 White moon City.
 Hao lianchuan walked out of the administrative Bureau tiredly, his head aching.
 Not long after they left, a man walked towards them. He was not old, in his twenties. He was also wearing an inspector's uniform, but it was more brightly colored than Hao lianchuan's and the others ', with some gold lining.
 This young man had long hair with a tinge of green.
 As soon as he saw this person walking toward him ... Hao lianchuan felt a headache.
 They were from the night patrolmen headquarters!  This time, five people came from the headquarters. Except for the leader who didn't show up much, the others had been running around these two days.
 The person in front of him was not simple either.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Yu Xiao, 26 years old, male, three yang initial stage!
 Yes, there were almost No 26-year-old three suns in Silver Moon, but there were quite a few in central continent. There were even 20-year-old three suns, not to mention six years older. In this era, six years was not even enough to be considered a person of the same era!
  They were from the Nightwalker headquarters, and they were especially here to handle border matters. Of course, they were not weak.
 In fact, this guy was the weakest one among the people who had come this time!
 It could be seen that the headquarters were not too careless this time. One sunguang, four three suns, and two of the other three suns were peak level.
 "Minister kun!"
 Yu Xiao strode over with a fake smile. When Li Hao smiled, no one actually felt that it was fake. But when Li Hao smiled, Hao lianchuan immediately felt that it was very fake.
 "Special Commissioner Yu!"
 "The special Commissioner is working for the general Administration?" Hao lianchuan also smiled.
 "No."
 Yu Xiao's smile was a little fake."I'm here to see Minister Kuang. Minister hou said he was in seclusion. It's already the third day. Is he still not done?" Why don't you let us take a look? the headquarters also sent us some precious medicine to treat injuries this time, and the effects are pretty good ..."
 "This ... I'll ask chief Yu later."

 Hao lianchuan didn't really want to talk to him, but he had no choice but to give him a perfunctory reply.
 Yu Xiao nodded, as if he didn't care too much, and said,""In addition, the headquarters are also very concerned about Yuan Shuo! I've heard that Yuan Shuo's disciple is about to come to white moon City, and it should be within one or two days. In addition, this person is rumored to have the bloodline of some eight great families ..."
 Hao lianchuan nodded slightly."Yes, that's right."
 "The headquarters 'intention is that if we can obtain the method of accumulating spirit energy ... Of course, this can be discussed. We actually just want to meet this li ... Li Hao and ask him some information. He's also a Night Watcher, so it shouldn't be a problem, right?"
 Hao lianchuan frowned."This ... Works too!" "However, the special Agent also knows that there are some rules in the martial arts world. When it comes to secrets, they can't be spread ..."
 "He's a night patrol, not a martial arts practitioner!"
 Yu Xiao chuckled and said,"besides ... Where would there be a Wulin?" The pugilistic world ... Was long gone! Department head Hao, don't keep talking about the pugilistic world. What era are we in now? If we're talking about martial arts, how could a country bumpkin like Li Hao join the night patrolmen?"
 He was speechless towards the fatty in front of him.
 What pugilistic world?
 What year had it been?
  Superpowers had been on the rise for more than twenty years. Now, the pugilistic world was gone, and so was the martial arts world. Some of the great martial masters in the central region could only struggle on whilst at death's door.
 Even if Yuan Shuo stepped into the spirit accumulation realm, he would only be equivalent to the three yang realm.
 However, were the three suns ... Very strong?
 Was it rare?
 In the central region, some of the sunguang's were already dead, let alone the three suns.
 He, Yu Xiao, was 26 years old and had three suns!
 And he would soon reach the mid three yang realm. Although Yuan Shuo had killed sun Yifei, but ... Yu Xiao didn't feel that he was inferior to sun Yifei. That old man had long fallen behind the times!
 He wasn't really interested in the art of accumulating spirit energy.
 What he was more concerned about was that even someone like Ying Hongyue cared about the so-called bloodline of the eight great families. In fact, they cared more about Li Hao himself. As for Yuan Shuo, perhaps those martial masters, or rather, some big shots, cared more about him because they had to consider the entire organization.
 And he didn't need to.
 The few who came this time did not need it.
 They were more concerned about whether the bloodlines of the eight great families could provide them with some opportunities or merits, such as whether they could use Li Hao to bring him back to the headquarters and lure Hong Yue into the trap.
 Hao lianchuan raised his eyebrows slightly. When Li Hao comes, I'll have him meet the special agents. "
 He didn't refuse.
 Yu Xiao also revealed a smile."That's good. Don't worry. We're all family. Why would we hurt him?" After all, there are more treasures in the central region. If he likes it, the divine energy stone is not a very precious treasure ..."
 Hao lianchuan didn't want to say anything.
 "Is there anything else, Special Commissioner?"
 Yu Xiao frowned slightly, but it quickly dissipated. This fatty ... Seemed to be eager for him to immediately get lost. This made him feel a little uncomfortable.
 However, he still endured it and said,""There's one more small matter. The headquarters sent us here for another purpose. We're here to check the system, finance, number of people, and allocation of the Silver Moon Nightwalker!"
 "This ... Is there any problem with department head Hao?"
  Hao lianchuan laughed,"no problem!" After all, there's always a situation where we don't get paid well, but we don't do such things. Go ahead and investigate, and if there's a need to cooperate, just say the word. "  "Then I'll get straight to the point. I heard that ... There's a Silver Moon military guard ... This organization doesn't exist, and there are no statistics ..."
 "This?"
 Hao lianchuan was confused."I really don't know much about the military. It's obvious that it's the military's system. Why don't you go and ask commander Yu?"
 Yu Xiao frowned. After a long while, he said,"we'll investigate. That's all. Inform us when Li Hao comes to white moon City!"
 "Alright, I will!"
 Hao lianchuan watched him leave. When he disappeared from his sight, his smile gradually disappeared.
 He sighed with some disdain and helplessness.
 How pitiful!
 "I, Hao lianchuan, am only a three yang now. The other party is just a little kid, but he is also a three yang. The point is, he is so arrogant that I can't refute him."
 Thinking of this, he laughed again.
 Li Hao ...
 Sure enough, everyone still cared. Eight great families ... This kid, coming to white moon City this time, he didn't know if he could bring him any surprises.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Just as he was thinking, his communicator rang.
 "Hao bu, Wang Ming and Li Hao have come to report."
 "He's here?"
 "Yes, it's at the door."
 "Wait for me. I'll be back soon. Before that, no one is allowed to take Li Hao away!"
 "Understood!"
 Hao lianchuan hurriedly got into the car and quickly drove toward the night patrolmen's headquarters.
  He's finally here!
 This guy, if he still didn't come, I would have gone to Silver City to rush him.
 ……
 At this moment, Li Hao was standing in the lobby below the night patrolman, looking around curiously.
 This is the Nightwalker's Silvermoon headquarters?
 It's so small!
 Along the way, he saw many skyscrapers. He thought that the Nightwalker headquarters would be rich and magnificent. In the end ... There was only a small building, and it was an old one with a large courtyard.
 And then ... Nothing!
 Of course, there were many orbs.
 Unfortunately, Hao lianchuan didn't seem to be around. Chief Steward Yu was, however. That big ball of light was so eye-catching that Li Hao didn't look too much and didn't see hou Xiaochen. Or rather, he couldn't see him.

 Li Hao didn't dare to look at him too much, as he found him to be very glaring. However, he couldn't see him clearly from a distance. It was similar to the feeling he had when he first saw Qiao Feilong, and he couldn't see him until he was in front of him.
 At this moment, Li Hao was looking around like a country bumpkin.
 To determine the strength of the entire Nightwalker.
 The three suns really didn't seem to have one ... How sad.
 Xuguang was the only one, and Hao lianchuan was probably the only one from the three suns. Hou Xiaochen's strength unknown. Could it be that this was all the strength of the entire night patrol team? if that was the case, how could they fight back? the elites were all in the Wei Wu Army?
 However, the Wei Wu Army were all martial masters.
 Li Hao had originally thought that he had hidden some of his strength.
 However, at least in this place, he really didn't find any hidden strength.
 While looking around, Li Hao saw that Wang Ming was talking to someone. Li Hao suddenly turned around. At that moment, a young-looking woman walked in from outside the hall. When she saw Li Hao, she seemed a little excited and said, "You're Li Hao?"
 Li Hao was a little dazed, but he nodded.
  "You've finally come ..."
 The woman had just said a few words, and before she could say anything more, a fat man ran over in a hurry from behind and laughed.""Little Hao, you've finally come!"
 Then, he took a step forward and quickly hugged Li Hao.
 Li Hao was dumbfounded. Why were they so enthusiastic?
 She heard Hao lianchuan's voice,""This woman, ignore her! The people on Hu dingfang's side are his wife's guards. You've just arrived in white moon City, so don't get involved in anything!"
 Li Hao didn't say anything, but he understood.
 The guards of Hu dingfang's wife ... None of them were Hu dingfang's guards. The breathing technique of five birds ... Senior Sister?
 Understood!
 Hu dingfang was her Senior sister's husband, and she was the one who taught him the five birds breathing technique.
 However ... His teacher didn't allow anyone who wasn't from his sect to practice the breathing technique of five birds.
 At this moment, Li Hao instantly understood many things.
 He was still in a daze and seemed to be in a daze. He wanted to say something, but he was pulled upstairs by Hao lianchuan. He waved at the woman as if he was saying goodbye.
 Meanwhile, Hao lianchuan cursed in his heart. 'F * ck, why are you dragging me away?'
 Do you know where my office is?
 You're dragging me away ... You're quite strong!
 "Department Hao ... I haven't reported yet ... Why are you pulling me ..."
 Li Hao was "dragged" upstairs, and he was dumbfounded."Hao bu, no, uncle Hao, I haven't been assigned to a dormitory yet. I can't live in your house. It's not appropriate ..."
 Who the hell invited you to stay in my house!
 Hao lianchuan rolled his eyes. 'What's up with this kid?'
 The two of them quickly went upstairs. Li Hao's smile only returned after they were out of everyone's sight."Hao bu, I was scared to death after coming here. Finally, I see someone I know. Seeing Hao bu, I feel like I'm seeing my deceased father ..."
 艹!
  Hao lianchuan was completely speechless. He looked at Li Hao and suddenly laughed. He patted Li Hao's shoulder and said,""Well done!"  “……”
 Li Hao glanced at him. Seeing that he seemed to really be complimenting him, he also smiled shyly.""It's alright. Hao bu, I won't listen to anyone but you! In the White moon City, you will be my parent in the future, and you are even more worthy of my respect than the Marquis. I will look for you for anything in the future!"
 Hao lianchuan's smile was a little stiff."You're depending on me?"
 "No, I didn 't!"
 Li Hao chuckled."Hao bu, I'm so close to you. When I saw you, I felt like I was seeing my family. I was scared to death just now. Really, when I saw you, I suddenly relaxed and felt like I was home!"
 Hao lianchuan was completely speechless.
 I've underestimated this guy. He wasn't this shameless before. Why do I feel like he's even more shameless after coming to white moon City?
 "Cut the crap. Let's go to my office. Hou bu is still in seclusion. I'll see him after he's out ..."
 "Uncle Hao, whatever you say!"
 Li Hao nodded. I'll follow your lead!
 They were unfamiliar with the people and place in white moon City. Although Lao Wang said that he could help with anything, you, a sunlight ... Who would care?
 The three suns were still the best!
 Moreover, he had power and status, so he should quickly get close to the old woman.
 At this moment, Li Hao and Hao lianchuan looked at each other and smiled.
 As he laughed, Hao lianchuan sighed,""You're really like my son who passed away!"
 Li Hao's face stiffened.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Hao lianchuan ... Was single!
 What nonsense are you spouting!
 Wang Ming had told him about this before.
 This person didn't speak the truth.
  ……
 As Li Hao arrived at white moon City, his name quickly spread in some circles.
 The eight great families "successor, Yuan Shuo's disciple.
 These two identities were enough for him to be noticed the moment he stepped into this place.
 Even if Li Hao was only a Martial Master with a cultivation of over 100.
 However, at this moment, his name was still frequently mentioned by some experts.
