Zhang an was a little absent-minded.He had persevered for so long ... Should he give up now?"Senior, do you still remember li daoheng?" Li Hao asked.Zhang an was stunned. Nonsense, how long had it been?"If li daoheng had not been aiming too high and pursuing too much, he would have become a venerable sovereign a long time ago. If he had become a venerable sovereign a long time ago, he would not have waited for the Silvermoon great Dao universe to appear. He would have killed the bone corrosion venerable sovereign and rescued Silvermoon. By then, he would have been at least a second or third stage venerable sovereign!""He made a contribution, returned to neo martial arts, and participated in the battle against the Crimson Moon. Now, neo martial arts has conquered the great world. According to the reward, he can also forcibly step into rank-4. His comprehension of Dao is not weak, and there is even hope for him to reach rank-5 or rank-6!""He's also someone that Sword Saint values, and Sword Saint is now able to fight Grade 7! Once the sword Master officially enters the seventh level, with the guidance of the sword Master and the fact that the sword Master is extremely powerful, he will be able to establish his own universe. Once he enters the sword Master universe, wouldn't the sixth level be easy to capture?" Li Hao continued,'at that time, would I still die in Silver Moon like today? The descendants of the sword supremacy aren't very strong. In addition, the sword supremacy is half a teacher to the human King, so the human King will also value such a valiant general. Once he breaks through the seventh-rank great cosmos, it might be his chance to enter the seventh-rank!"He had planned out the path he had given li daoheng.According to what he said, the seventh-rank was difficult, but the sixth-rank ... There was really hope, a great hope.Li daoheng's talent was definitely not bad.They could be considered the top group of people in the late stage of neo martial arts.His family background could be considered illustrious!He had talent, family background, strength, and ability ... But in the end, he had to seek more in Silver Moon, and in the end, he had nothing."This generation ..." Zhang an was dazed for a moment. He ... Had a tendency to develop in the direction of li daoheng.Moreover, his recent cultivation had caused him to lose his mental balance.Just like li daoheng, Zhang an was unwilling to be shrouded and looked down upon by others. Li daoheng had once said that Zhang an was actually very similar to him. However, there was one thing about Zhang an that was fine. He could still control his inner desires and hold on to some things.Therefore, after 100000 years, Zhang an had not changed.But now, not long after he left Silver Moon, Zhang an's balance was somewhat unbalanced. Back then, he had watched the rise of the human King, and now, he was watching Li Hao's rise.Zhang an closed his eyes and said nothing.Seeing this, Li Hao ruthlessly said,""Senior, principal Fang Yuan likes decisive men. She admires domineering men like her brother. He's a man of his word and does what he says. Even if he fails, he's still a hero in her eyes! According to neo martial arts, principal Fang Yuan would be blind if she took a fancy to such a sissy senior! New martial arts only has one style-fight!""You ..."Zhang an was a little angry!The next moment, he laughed bitterly.Girly?This ... Did he have it?In fact, it was not, but in neo martial arts, maybe ... Maybe it could really be said that way.He felt a little helpless."I know, but ...""If you add a" but,"senior will have no hope!" Li Hao sighed. Zhang an was speechless.After a long time, he said,"if I advance to venerable sovereign now and quickly step into the third stage ... In Silver Moon, I will be shackled by the master of the great Dao, but if I take the new martial Dao ..."Zhang an exhaled."First, the original universe is not here. Second, even if it is here, it's difficult for me, a new venerable sovereign, to get a position ..."Li Hao thought for a while and said,'it's fine. I think it's only a matter of time before my neo martial artist enters level eight! Senior is now worried about being shackled by the Silver Moon and the problem of the origin of the neo martial art ... It's okay, I'll help you. I'll first place your great Dao in my River, and it just so happens that you can comprehend different DAOs!""What?""Myriad DAOs!" Li Hao smiled.What myriad DAOs?"Dao of myriad worlds!"Zhang an was even more confused.Li Hao laughed,"a book of great Dao bears the myriad world Dao!" "To be honest, if I don't need senior's help right now, although I'm not stingy, my own Dao is not perfect yet. Others can forget about trying to pry into my Dao! But today is a rare opportunity. Senior, such an opportunity ... Might only come once!"He was not lying. Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  His own Dao wasn't perfect yet.He wasn't stingy, but at this stage, he wouldn't easily open up to outsiders.However, if he hoped that Zhang an would succeed in impersonating a Supreme martial artist and that the book of great Dao contained the myriad world Dao, then he would have a chance to peek into Li Hao's Dao. This was an opportunity!At any other time, Li Hao wouldn't have opened up the myriad Dao River to Zhang an so easily.Zhang an was startled, and his expression changed slightly.At this moment, he seemed to have made a decision. He gritted his teeth and nodded."I ... Vindicate Dao!"He took a deep breath."I'm a venerable sovereign who first proved the origin Dao. Of course, I can't return to the origin. I can only stay in your River temporarily. In this way, I can avoid the neo martial Thunder tribulation!" Don't worry, when I encounter a new martial artist, I'll leave Changhe and won't make things difficult for you. ""Senior, have you made a decision?"Li Hao was puzzled. Zhang an was actually a very determined person. Otherwise, he would not have persisted for so long.Although he tried to persuade Zhang an, Zhang an seemed to have agreed rather readily.Zhang an looked at him for a long time before he said,""Because I've figured out one thing ...""What?""You're not peerless yet, but you can still get a wife. You still have some tricks up your sleeve. Perhaps ... I should listen to your opinion!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùWhat the hell?Li Hao was stunned.Zhang an ignored him. That was what he was thinking. Li Hao seemed to be pure-hearted and had few desires, but in fact, he was a very attractive guy. Even the king of men didn't have a wife before he became invincible.

Chapter 2941 Finally Caught (3 In 1)_6
Look at Li Hao, Qing Song had caught a fianc√©e, and there was still a group of people waiting in line behind him ...Li Hao was speechless. Had Zhang an gone mad?What was this guy thinking?Zhang an saw his depressed look and suddenly laughed.""I'm just joking. Actually, I've been thinking about it recently. To be honest, I've been a little affected by everyone's rapid progress! He had watched as Hong Yitang and the others gradually grew from weak to level three venerable sovereigns! I actually can't sit still anymore. If this continues, I'm afraid I'll go into Qi deviation!"He sighed."At this point, I have to make a decision. Otherwise ... I'll really be possessed by the devil and become the Zhang family's Li daoheng. I'll bring shame to the Zhang family ... Then I'll let my grandfather down, and I'll let my father down even more!"The Zhang family was a loyal and righteous family, so he could actually feel the changes in himself.He was completely out of his mind.At this moment, since Li Hao had given him a choice, a rather good choice ... He naturally had to accept it.Just as Li Hao said, if you miss this opportunity, do you want to miss it again?He looked at Li Hao."I also want to see what the myriad world path is. How can it compare to my book of Dao?"Suddenly, she felt a little proud.My book of Dao is very powerful!Li Hao glanced at him. After a long while, he laughed dryly and said nothing. If you say that the Supreme book of the great Dao is powerful, I'll accept it ... Yours ... You have gathered many DAOs, but the key is that you are not very proficient in them.What was there to be arrogant about?Zhang an, are you trying to get back some dignity from me?"Then let's make it quick. Hong Yue's venerable sovereign can come back at any time. I still have to arrange for senior to go out ... It will take some time. Let's talk as we walk. It's best if you don't use it, but if you do ... Senior will have to think about it. If you're exposed, you'll be instantly torn to pieces!" Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã  Deceiving a rank eight venerable sovereign!Zhang an's heart trembled!"You're saying ...""Old rules, just like when I opened the Silvermoon Stargate and pretended to be a neo martial artist. This time is even more exciting! This time, he might need senior to intimidate the level eight Red Moon master and directly impersonate him from the neo martial world! You impersonated your grandfather and second cat impersonated Emperor Cang ..."Ëâπ!Zhang an suddenly felt a little regretful."Level 8 ...""What are you afraid of? Senior, if you want to quickly reach the seventh step and don't take the risk, would it be a free lunch?"Zhang an was helpless."No, it's just that it's hard to impersonate me. My grandfather is at least at the peak of the sixth rank. Moreover, Emperor Cang is at the peak of the seventh rank ...",m "It's fine. With the help of time, senior second cat is mysterious to begin with and can't be investigated. As long as you act well, there won't be a big problem. The book of the great Dao bears the weight of ten thousand worlds ... With one look, good fellow, this isn't level six, it's more than Level Seven!"Was it?Zhang an smiled bitterly."Alright, whatever you say."How exciting!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶When they entered the river of Dao and saw the small realms ... Zhang an was stunned for a moment and glanced at Li Hao.Li Hao ignored him and said,""Senior, please take a look first before vindicating your Dao. I won't accompany you!""You ...""You go take a look first, I'll have a chat with senior second cat."Alright!Zhang an's interest was indeed piqued, and he quickly flew towards those little realms.Li Hao, on the other hand, quickly went downstream along the river and called out,""Senior second cat!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùAfter a long time, a cat appeared at the end of the river, its huge body floating. Soon, it appeared in front of Li Hao with a little dissatisfaction."I told you, I want to sleep."What are you doing here again? "Senior ... I need your help with a small matter. Impersonate Emperor Cang and cooperate with senior Zhang an to impersonate a neo martial artist! Senior doesn't need to do anything, just shout a few times in the air and it'll be over. "Second cat looked at him. Was this a small matter?The person who was clamoring was at the eighth rank, right?You call this a small matter?You're really not a good thing!After eating your fish, you're really not being polite now!He looked at Zhang an, who seemed to have been duped. Duping a level 8 ... Only Li Hao dared to think of it!"Eighth-rank?" second cat was speechless."It's beyond imagination. If you find any clues ... You'll all die!"Li Hao nodded."That's right. So, when that time comes, it'll all depend on senior second cat and senior Zhang an's abilities. If they can scare the other for a moment, they'll choose to suppress Senlan. Once they choose their opponent and discover that it's a fake, they won't be able to hold back!""It's not impossible ..." Second cat thought about it and said,"but to take the others away, we need the river of Dao to surround them, the power of the world to appear, and black Panther and the two Dao Masters to work together!"With the river of Dao and the power of the world, there were signs of neo martial arts.Otherwise, he would be easily seen through.Li Hao frowned slightly. So many people had left at once. It would cause too much of a commotion. Moreover, it would be easy for others to discover that they had escaped ...However, what second cat said made sense. Since it was a neo martial attack, there was no river of Dao surrounding it, no world power emerging, only the book of Daoism and Emperor Cang ... If things went wrong, people might think that the neo martial world was not here and might take a risk!"Alright, I'll make the arrangements!"Li Hao nodded."When a disaster strikes, you'll all run away. It's normal." Does that mean senior second cat ... Agreed?"Second cat looked at him and said after a while,"What do you think?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao smiled in embarrassment. Second cat said,"No need to be embarrassed. I'll charge you 30 small fish this time!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThat's good!Li Hao smiled and nodded."Then let's wait for this guy to advance!"Second cat looked at Zhang an and shook his head.""Not everyone is suitable for the myriad DAOs. This guy ... He's lacking something."It didn't say what it was, and it wasn't good to say.However, it could tell at a glance.Zhang an might have a chance to reach the seventh rank, but it would be best if there was someone above him and forcing him to make a decision for the rest of his life. He was a passive guy who would not take the initiative to do anything.It was commonly known as a wife-strict wife!This guy, he either had someone forcing him to do it, or he found a powerful wife, or he would fight if he didn't do it. He did have some talent, and second cat felt that he was quite good at judging people. This way, Zhang an would have a future.On the other side, Zhang an was already inexplicably shocked. This ... Was no longer the myriad DAOs realm. Li Hao was going to create the myriad worlds!After a long time, Zhang an finally came back to his senses.His heart trembled. Dao of myriad worlds, book of Daoism ... This time, he chose to agree. Perhaps ... This was really an opportunity. The book of Daoism contained myriad worlds. Each page contained a Dao, each page contained a world!There was no such opportunity at all.For a moment, Zhang an was extremely excited. He no longer felt depressed. I, Zhang an, have finally grasped such an opportunity. It was too difficult!For a moment, they had the urge to cry.From the neo martial era to the Silver Moon era until today, he had missed the opportunity again and again. This time, he didn't seem to miss it.On the other side, Zhang an was so excited that he wanted to cry.Li Hao and second cat looked on silently. Soon, both of them shook their heads and were on the verge of tears. They were really a little sissy. They hoped that Zhang an would be a little more domineering after he passed his testimony.

2942 Chapter 484
Zhang an absorbed the shock and comprehension brought by the myriad world like a hungry man.Although time was tight and the Crimson Moon could arrive at any time, Li Hao didn't rush them.It didn't matter if he succeeded or failed. If this plan didn't work, he would change it. Proving the way was a big deal. He couldn't force others to become trash venerable sovereigns.Fortunately, Zhang an also knew that time was not enough.Reluctantly, he walked out of a little realm.He took a deep breath and said,""I'm going to vindicate Dao! Your idea of the infinite worlds has been of great help to me. I don't have enough time to study it today ... I hope I still have time in the future!"As he said this, the book of Dao appeared and the Taoist connotation circulated.One had to admit that Zhang an's book of Dao was quite interesting.Li Hao glanced at it. It was even stronger than before.His Taoist connotation was even more abundant!Zhang an quickly said,"then today, I will vindicate my Dao in your long river of Dao!" You want my book of Dao to take over your realm, so I'll make a request ...""Speak," he said."I want ... The book of Dao to fuse with the world!"What?Li Hao was stunned and glanced at him. What did he mean?He understood the general idea, but ...Li Hao frowned."I'll take back the boundary!"If the book of Dao fuses with the world, then if I take it back, you'll blame me for life?Zhang an took a deep breath."I know. It's no big deal to take it back. If I take it back, I'll give up on the book of Dao!""What do you mean?"Li Hao frowned slightly and looked at him."The book of Dao is the core of your Dao. Senior Zhang an, we have a good relationship, but you won't expect me to give up these sectors because of this, right? If I was stronger, then it wouldn't matter, but now, I've paid a huge price to create these realms ..."There were some things he had to say first.If Zhang an felt that he would be too embarrassed to take it back, he would be wrong.This had a lot to do with it!Li Hao had more or less determined his path. He wouldn't give up the world he had created with great effort for some reason."I don't have that thought."Zhang an shook his head,"the reason my book of Dao melded into the world was actually to peek into your Dao on a deeper level!" "If I can gain more, I'll just give up the book of Dao, but that doesn't mean I'll give up my Dao! Perhaps ... I can obtain even more. "He looked at Li Hao."I just hope that I can completely integrate myself into the Dao world and sense the true unity of the Dao world!" He said.Li Hao glanced at him for a long time, then nodded.""Sure!"I don't mind if you're willing.Anyway, I can't give you my realm completely. If I do, I'll be in trouble.Zhang an didn't say much. In fact, he had long hoped to advance to venerable sovereign. However, at first, he was reluctant to give up any of the DAOs in the book of Dao, and then he hoped to accommodate the Dao of the two worlds. Zhang an was a little indecisive, and he only became anxious when someone forced him.He was used to being controlled by others, perhaps because his grandfather was a Supreme martial artist. He had been controlled since he was young and had almost never left the jurisdiction of the Zhang family's Supreme martial artist.At this time, Zhang an did not say anything more.A book of Dao appeared in the river.The pages of the book of Dao flipped open.Shadows walked out one after another. Originally, these shadows had the shadows of other people, such as the human King, the blood Emperor, the sword venerable, and so on ... Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã  However, slowly, these illusionary images started to change.It was toward Zhang an!Li Hao's eyes flickered. This was somewhat similar to him opening a realm. A domain appeared, and a boundary appeared. An illusion suppressed them. One Wen for One World, one Dao for One World.Zhang an had never been free from the influence of those people.Today, it seemed that only his figure had changed, but it had the intention of separating himself from the influence of others. This was the first top-tier expert that Li Hao had known. When almost all of Silver moon's members were below the apex, he was a top-tier Saint with the strength of a quasi-Heavenly King.When Li Hao had become a rank four venerable sovereign, and when many venerable sovereigns had appeared in Silver Moon, he had only been a half-step sovereign.In fact, it was not considered slow for others, but for Zhang an ... Only he knew how he had lived through these few years.It was a huge difference!In Silver Moon, he had also made the wrong choice and missed a few opportunities. Otherwise, he might have advanced to venerable sovereign a long time ago.At this moment, Zhang an was much more relaxed.The pages of the book of the great Dao slowly appeared. They turned into shadows and great DAOs emerged.The great Dao directly merged into the river!The illusionary figures walked towards the little realms.The pages of the book wrapped around the little realm and gradually began to merge with it.At this moment, Li Hao had some enlightenment. Various great Dao inspirations surged into his mind. The saber of the human King, the sword of the sword venerable, the book of the Supreme venerable, the arrow of the blood Emperor, the forging method of the divine Creator, the suppression method of the Heavenly King ...This person Knew Too Much.He was a top-notch venerable sovereign of new martial arts. He knew almost all the Tao techniques.As for Zhang an, a star suddenly appeared above his head. This star came from the Silvermoon universe and from the Silvermoon Dao. At this moment, he could no longer completely accommodate the Silvermoon Dao.He could only give up!He had to choose one.Zhang an let out a breath. Suddenly, the star above his head began to change. The star gradually began to melt. He reached out and began to forge. To Li Hao's surprise, he didn't destroy the star.It was ... Weapon forging!Zhang an gradually cast the star into the bone of a book. Tens of thousands of DAOs spread along the bone like threads toward the surrounding small worlds. At this moment, Li Hao's small worlds were actually moving toward the bone in Zhang an's hands.

2943 Chapter 484
Those little realms vaguely showed the shape of a page.He wanted to ... Forge the world into a book, and forge the book into his Dao!At this moment, Li Hao completely understood!To be honest, Li Hao had reached level four and had seen many Level Seven and even level eight venerable sovereigns. To a half-step sovereign ... He could easily crush them.However, at this moment, he felt something different.Zhang an, the grandson of the Supreme martial artist, showed him many new martial arts. He wanted Li Hao to see with his own eyes whether the orthodoxy of neo martial arts was as reckless as the outside world said!It wasn 't!Li Hao's heart trembled. At this moment, Zhang an suddenly stretched out his hand, and a small world was formed into divine text ...Li Hao's expression changed. This ... Zhang an knew the divine language ..."Holy prose?" Zhang an's voice was heard,"isn't that the evolution of the secret skills in Saturn city?"Li Hao was stunned for a moment before he nodded.He had almost forgotten the source of the divine text.He was a little embarrassed. He just remembered that the most famous combat technique in neo martial Star Town City was the character formula. It was just that what Li Hao had seen back then was only a weak inheritance that had been passed down for countless generations.In fact, he had never seen anyone use the real unique skills in Star Town City.At the same time, a page fell on the book bone and instantly merged into the book. On the page, the word "black fire" appeared!The fire World!The illusionary figure that merged with the fire World also had the power of fire. The two cats muttered,"The Dao of forging!"In the path of forging, the element of fire came first.Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. An incomparably strong person with a giant hammer in his hand seemed to appear in his mind. He created heaven and earth, forged divine weapons, created heaven and earth, and forged a divine envoy for neo martial!In the next moment, a sword-shaped page was quickly absorbed into the book. It turned into a single page, and a one-word bi 'an sword appeared!Another person appeared in Li Hao's mind. Unparalleled sword, longevity termination, neo martial art longevity sword!Page after page of the book was collected.Zhang an's aura instantly skyrocketed!With the Silver Moon Dao as his bone and the neo martial Dao as his heart, he had not completely given up on the Silver Moon Dao. He had only turned the Silver Moon Dao into the foundation of his great Dao!It was somewhat similar to opening a realm and a long river by himself!Zhang an said as Li Hao sat cross-legged on the ground. Li Hao made things convenient for him. At the same time, this was not only an opportunity for Zhang an, but also an opportunity for Li Hao to gain more knowledge.He had seen too many people.At this moment, the Dao integration realm allowed Li Hao to witness the strength of the venerable sovereigns of new martial arts and the mysteries of their Dao techniques.The venerable sovereigns of new martial arts all had their own unique ways.The iron head Emperor's dominance, the Qin Emperor's supremacy, and the blood Emperor's archery ...Zhang an's understanding might not be comprehensive, but he knew much more than Li Hao. At this moment, Zhang an was proving his way, and Li Hao was also trying to understand the differences.One by one, the small realms disappeared from the two sides of the river.As for the river, it was fluctuating wildly.Zhang an's body gradually fell, and the book in his hand began to become heavy. Not only that, he looked at Li Hao and suddenly said,""It's actually better to have the river as my bone. However, the river isn't my Dao Foundation! If there's a chance, I suggest that you try to absorb everything, merge the Dao into one, and turn the river into your bones!"The long river was the bone of the book of Dao.Li Hao's heart moved.The firmament sword now wrapped around the long river, which was actually a form of compression. What Zhang an meant was ... The book of Dao contained in the sword?Using the realm as the divine text, using the divine text as space to write the Dao of myriad worlds?The sword contained books, and the book contained swords!Or perhaps, a book in one hand and a sword in the other. Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã   It was a combination of civilization and barbarism.The combination of civilization and force!If logic didn't make sense, then he'd use his sword to cut it!Zhang an's aura surged as this thought came to his mind. At this moment, with the book of Dao in his body, he advanced to venerable sovereign in an instant, much more relaxed than the others. Li Hao, on the other hand, had a myriad of insights.At this moment, the long river was turbulent, and it gradually shrank a little.There was no venerable sovereign lightning tribulation, as the place of Zhang Anrong's Dao marks was not the source world.He had become Li Hao's incomplete Emperor of the river, and his great Dao was based on this.It was similar to Lin Hongyu.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time, Li Hao opened his eyes and looked at Zhang an. He smiled and said,""Congratulations!"Zhang an also smiled. There were no earth-shaking changes, no venerable sovereign lightning tribulations, and no chaos lightning tribulations, but ... He was already very satisfied. At this moment, the world in his eyes had changed.The pages of the book of the great way appeared in his body, and his Taoist connotation overflowed."Thank you!" Zhang an bowed slightly.What for?Xie Lihao had provided him with the opportunity to fuse the myriad worlds into one. Xie Lihao had given him a place where he could fuse with the great Dao. This would allow him to temporarily not become an itinerant cultivator and absorb the chaos Dao. If he did so, it would be very difficult for him to improve.He also wanted to thank Li Hao for forcing him to vindicate his Dao and become a venerable sovereign. He suddenly felt emotional ... Perhaps ... This is the path I should take."Many thanks, senior!"Li Hao's eyes flickered, and he laughed. "I've also gained some enlightenment regarding the order of the myriad DAOs of the myriad worlds ... I can write it down into a text to fulfill some of my old dreams, some of my unrealistic fantasies!"Li Hao smiled."Perhaps ... I'll write a chapter of myriad DAOs that belongs to me!" In the past, I wanted to leave behind the text of my great Dao in the Silver Moon ... In the future, perhaps the entire primordial chaos will be my goal!"He sighed,"I'll use Dao words to present Dao techniques, and I'll use Dao techniques to describe my Dao! One day, with a single word, I'll be able to rule the world. That might be the time when I'll be able to complete my cultivation!"

2944 Chapter 484
The river was the bone, and the world was the book.Cast myriad world Dao book!Zhang an laughed, suddenly feeling a little proud.The book of Dao was not created by him, it was his grandfather.Li Hao, on the other hand, clearly felt that this Dao integration technique had its merits. He wanted to learn from it, which was a good thing and also a form of recognition. He knew that Li Hao was an extremely proud person.But today, he mentioned it again. Merging the book of ten thousand DAOs and forging the book of ten thousand DAOs. This meant that he felt that turning the ten thousand worlds into words and words into Dao techniques was a method worth learning.To be acknowledged by someone like Li Hao ... Was actually something to be proud of.Second cat added,"the book contains thousands of DAOs. One book is chaos. The book is a kind of culture, a symbol of civilization. In fact, it is also in line with the Dao of heaven and earth. That is how cultivators should be!" A boorish man cultivating the Dao has fallen into the style of Dao. "‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao looked at second cat ... Who are you implying?When second cat saw him looking over, he explained,""I didn't say the neo martial King. He just pretended not to know how to do it. In fact, he knows it very well in his heart. I mean big cat!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao chuckled. Best n0vel online free at n0ŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  'You ...'Forget it.Big cat seemed to miss second cat quite a bit. Second cat, on the other hand, was teasing big cat all day long. Be careful that Emperor Cang would find out and press down on your head to beat you up.However, big cat was probably the one that second cat mentioned the most.Obviously, it wasn't that second cat liked to mock anyone. Perhaps ... It missed the cat that came from the same origin. The war in this world was over. Perhaps Emperor Cang was the person closest to it.Li Hao didn't say anything more. He looked at Zhang an and said,""Can it create the image of a Supreme Being?""Just a little bit more,"Zhang an shook his head."I'm still too weak. I'm only at rank one. I just entered!" Even if you know my grandfather very well, it's hard to completely create an illusion that can confuse an eighth step. "Li Hao frowned slightly."But it's not like there's no way at all." Zhang an smiled again."Senior, why are you keeping me in suspense?""Just say it!" Li Hao smiled."Give me a small realm, or a medium-level world ... The realm will explode, thousands of DAOs will roar, the aura will shake the sky, the river of DAOs will surround it, senior two cats will be in charge, and I will use the book of DAOs ... At that time, who will believe that I am a first stage venerable sovereign?"Li Hao was startled and somewhat distressed. He still had to spend money!Recently, he had been spending money like water.The world ... I don't have it anymore.There were two of them before, but he had destroyed them.The neo martial artists who could explode the world were still very violent in their bones. Li Hao exhaled."Alright, I'll try. Right now, I can only borrow it from Senlan!"Senlan, there should be little realms.As mentioned before, killing a 4th tier could be exchanged. Later on, he directly gave himself a medium-level world. The other party should still have a small world, but there was a high probability that there was no medium-level world.Just as well, sending him out required the cooperation of the Senlan realmlord. Otherwise, it wouldn't be easy for him to hide his tracks.Li Hao stood up,"then it's settled. Once the red moon sector Lord descends, he will definitely cause a huge commotion!" We have a safe base outside of Senlan world, not too far nor too close to Senlan. It's just enough! You will hide among them ..."After giving some instructions, he did not say anything more. He stood up and left the river.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Yan Fang quickly appeared.This time, Li Hao didn't contact Senlan sector Lord. It was just a small world, so he could just look for Yan Fang. A stage four world Lord looking for a stage six world Lord for no reason wasn't appropriate."A small world ..."Yan Fang was slightly startled. A small world was practically useless to Li Hao now.What was the use of having this?As for their Tier 3, they had only just advanced, so they weren't of much use.At this critical moment, he wanted a small world from him ...Yan Fang was still deep in thought when Li Hao spoke,""Senior, I can use Dao crystals to exchange. I still have some Dao crystals here ...""There's no need for that. Fellow Daoist myriad DAOs, you're slapping my face by saying that. My Senlan was invaded. Fellow Daoist myriad DAOs, you worked for us, but now, we're forced to draw a line ... A mere small world wants to collect great Dao crystals. Do you still want to keep my face?""There's still the forest orchid of the small world, but ... It's not too powerful. It's just a small world that has been created not too long ago ...""That's fine!"Li Hao smiled, and Yan Fang quickly said,"Please wait a moment, fellow Daoist. I'll have Ji Hao bring it over as soon as possible!"He didn't even ask sector Lord Sen LAN, nor did he need to.He still had the right to decide on a small world.Then, Li Hao said,"this time, the attack of the Crimson Moon will be very dangerous. I've thought about it ... Other than the three who have fused with the great Dao, and me and fellow Daoist death, I want to send the rest of them away in advance!""Senior, is it convenient for you?"Sending someone away?Yan Fang glanced at the others. In this group, there were only two middle-rank experts. It was actually nothing much that they had all left.But ...They were a group of low-level venerable sovereigns who had cooperated well with Li Hao before. They would be safer with them.Of course, it would be more convenient for two middle-rank venerable sovereigns to take action."Of course, no problem!"Yan Fang also agreed readily,"there are many rifts in the forest orchid now!" There are three places that are not under our control. Fellow Daoists, please be careful. As long as you don't expose yourself ... It won't be a big problem. If it really doesn't work, fellow Daoists, I'll have to trouble you to attack one of the rifts to draw the attention of the others and make an escape posture. In addition, these fellow Daoists can pretend to attack the one that Senlan is guarding ... This way, Senlan can give an explanation. "

Li Hao nodded. This was not difficult.The two sides quickly came to an agreement, and Yan Fang also left first to make arrangements.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶After Yan Fang left, everyone turned to look at Li Hao."We're all leaving?"Lin Hongyu frowned.Li Hao nodded and said,"let's go!" "There won't be much use for you to stay. On the contrary, it'll be dangerous. Of course, it's not safe to leave either. It might be even more dangerous! I'm not asking you to wander around, but you have a mission. "King Huai and the others didn't need to leave. They were part of Li Hao's plan and were in danger. Best n0vel online free at n0ŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  Everyone had to take risks if they wanted to eat meat.Lin Hongyu didn't say anything pretentious and just reminded him,""Then you and brother kongji should be careful ..."As she said this, she looked at Kong Ji with a weak expression,""Elder brother, my husband is still young and his strength is not as good as yours. This time, I hope that elder brother will put in more effort!"Kong Ji was a little embarrassed.These words!"I ... I'm just a bystander. The plan was proposed by Li Hao, and the final decision is made by venerable the sword. I'm only at the sixth step ... Alright, I get it. At the critical moment, my father might descend. Is that what you mean?"Kong Ji was smart and quickly understood what the woman was thinking. He smiled and nodded.""I'll do my best!"Li Hao was speechless and didn't bother to say more.Do I need anyone to take care of me when I'm wandering the martial world?"Alright, there's no need to say more!""After we get out, we'll listen to senior Zhang an and senior second cat's arrangements!" Li Hao said to them.After Li Hao finished speaking, he glanced at zhiruo.""Daoist zhiruo, if you don't want to stay in Silver Moon after you leave, you can leave on your own after you're out of danger!""What are you talking about? I can't wait to stay. Why would I leave ..." Xun RUO's heart jolted.Li Hao looked at him for a long time before he said,""Forced by the situation that day, a forcibly twisted melon is not sweet, it's fine if you are willing! I won't force anything. As long as we're out of danger, we can leave at any time. "Zhiruo still wanted to say something, but Li Hao said,""That's all. Whether you stay or not is up to you, fellow Daoist! You didn't take the initiative to attack Silvermoon, so I'm willing to give you a chance to make a choice. "Zhiruo sighed and nodded.He knew what Li Hao meant.Xun RUO's performance had been average. He was a third-rank venerable sovereign, but he wasn't even as effective as Chan Xiu, who was a second-rank venerable sovereign. He wasn't as active as Yi, who was a first-rank venerable sovereign. Perhaps Li Hao felt that there was no need to keep him here.Zhiruo felt a little helpless. Actually ... It was just a common problem for itinerant cultivators.At the critical moment, who would go all out if they held back?All rogue cultivators were like this!It wasn't just one or two people. As long as there were more people, they would attack together. Li Hao obviously didn't agree with this habit.In other words, if you continue to do this, I won't keep you even if you want to.Once you're out of danger, you can leave on your own. Seeing that you didn't attack Silver Moon with Minghao and the others that day, I'll give you a way out.The others didn't say anything.Li Hao was the one who made the decision for Silver Moon. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶After waiting for a while, Ji Hao sent over a small world. They did not stay for long, and both sides contacted each other in secret.After obtaining the pocket dimension, Zhang an and ER Mao left the long river. However, Zhang an's book of Dao was now closely connected to the long river, so it would not be separated.Apart from Li Hao and Kong Ji, the others were in a group. Li Hao and Kong Ji were going to attack a crack and pretend to escape.He would attract their attention so that they could leave smoothly.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶BOOM!The sound of an explosion reverberated through the world, and the might of a venerable sovereign once again covered the entire Senlan.Outside the realm, Shi hun and Wushang, the two venerable sovereigns, attacked at the same time. The power of their great DAOs shook the world."Suppress them!"Wan Dao and the others wanted to run.How was that possible?At the same time, many venerable sovereigns appeared around them. They attacked at the same time and suppressed Li Hao and su mo. A great battle broke out.Some of the venerable sovereigns were itinerant cultivators, while others came from the three great worlds.It was because they knew that someone from the red moon had come.Moreover, he received the news even faster than Sen LAN.This time, four rank six venerable sovereigns came from the red moon.The myriad DAOs Academy was finished this time.,m At that moment, chaos broke out in the distance. The area where monarch Senlan was in charge of also broke out in chaos. Wushang looked into the distance and his expression changed slightly. The next moment, he shouted,""Don't worry about it, just suppress them and don't let them leave!"The others were all small fry.Perhaps they were deliberately throwing out cannon fodder in hopes that they would split up. It was impossible this time. They just had to keep an eye on these two big fish. Splitting up ... They had suffered once before, so how could they suffer again?As for these low-stage venerable sovereigns, they were not fast. As long as these two were killed, none of them would be able to escape!BOOM!Li Hao and Kong Ji's attacks were also very loud, shaking the world and causing the cracks to tremble. The group of venerable sovereigns outside suppressed them, not giving them any chance to escape.The two sides fought for a while, but they didn't gain any advantage.Li Hao and Kong Ji only left the battle after saying a few harsh words. As for Supreme Emperor Sen LAN ... He had a middle-stage venerable sovereign in charge, but someone still managed to escape. Red Moon and the venerable sovereigns of the three worlds were well aware of this.Sen LAN had deliberately gone easy on him.It was very normal!However, he couldn't say much at this moment.As long as Sen LAN didn't let the myriad DAOs and death god go, everything would be fine. However, if she let the two go, things would be different.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The battle had ended.Everyone knew that the venerable sovereigns under the command of the myriad DAOs sect had all fled. Many itinerant cultivators, including some venerable sovereigns from the three worlds, were still pursuing them.

2946 Chapter 484
The key point was that they once again focused on Li Hao and Kong Ji.At the same time, sector Lord Sen LAN also received the news.Red Moon had sent out four tier 6 Warriors, and they would soon arrive at Senlan.Six rank six venerable sovereigns!With such strength, if the forest orchid sector Lord didn't act, he would be able to sweep through all four corners of the world.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Primal Chaos void.The four venerable sovereigns moved forward quickly. Behind them, a rank seven venerable was hiding in the dark with a cold look.Senlan, we're almost there.The four rank six venerable sovereigns were also silent. Their mission was simple. They were to kill anyone who resisted, including the venerable sovereigns of the Senlan realm. In addition, they were to take in the local wandering cultivators.According to the instructions of the realm Lord, Hong Yue had suffered a great loss recently. There were many new places for venerable sovereigns, so she could take in some of the Rogue cultivators.Although the Crimson Moon was currently in decline, it was still an unparalleled temptation for these individual cultivators to join the great world."When you arrive, don't be in a hurry to take action. Take in the Rogue cultivators. The rank six rogue cultivator Yu Xiu is also a top rogue cultivator in the red moon region. He was the master of a world in the past. However, his world was destroyed and he chose to wander the chaos.""In addition ... I have to dig out all the other venerable sovereigns hidden in the forest orchid world, just in case!""There might be some fifth or sixth rank venerable sovereigns hidden among them ... Dig them all out. That Dao of life and death cultivator is not weak. If possible, let the Rogue cultivators exhaust them first. I heard that the Dao of life and death venerable sovereigns have extremely strong recovery abilities!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùOne of the sixth rank venerable sovereigns spoke up and made some arrangements.In order to ensure that nothing went wrong, they felt that even six grade-6 experts were not enough.He had to be more careful. This time, he couldn't make any mistakes. The realm Lord was already furious. If there was another mistake ... Everyone would be punished."Sen LAN currently has 8 rifts. When we get there, try to control all of them. Otherwise...The Sen LAN sector Lord might side with them and create a chance for them to escape!""Don't worry about offending Senlan. Senlan doesn't know how to appreciate favors. If they dare to interfere this time, it will be the time for Senlan to be destroyed!""Don't worry, we're clear!""Mm, in addition ... Drive away the venerable sovereigns near the forest orchid world. They can either join us or ... Directly kill them. If they don't leave, kill them all!"One of them, Red Moon sovereign, said with an extremely cold look,""It's not that easy to take advantage of Hong Yue. Now that Hong Yue has suffered heavy losses several times, it has become a joke to everyone. Some of the individual cultivators even dare to covet Hong Yue. They don't know what they are doing!""I want to show my determination to get it. I also want Senlan to understand that resistance will only lead to death!""Don't worry!""Understood!"One by one, the venerable sovereigns spoke. This person who could give orders was naturally not simple. He was one of the venerable sovereigns in Hong Yue who had the most hope of entering the seventh rank. He was called the bloodthirsty venerable sovereign.He mainly cultivated the Dao of slaughter, which was also a kind of desire. A sixth level peak venerable sovereign!He was also a venerable sovereign that the red moon sector Lord had high hopes for. The few rank seven venerable sovereigns of the red moon sector had lacked such strong venerable sovereigns who were born of killing.This time, although there were six venerable sovereigns carrying out the task at the same time, he was the leader.He was also the main force in dealing with the venerable Emperor of life and death.At the crucial moment, he was the main force against the forest orchid realm Lord. They were both at the peak of the 6th step but compared to the forest orchid realm Lord, he lacked control over the Dao universe.Hong Yue had lost three rank-7s and now needed someone to fill in the gaps. This person had a great chance.This time, if he could kill the two troublemakers and make a contribution, no one in the red moon would object.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.Outside the forest orchid region, Shi hun had also received the news."There are four of them, and they're led by bloodthirsty. Even this guy is here ... This is going to be a good show."Wu Dian was speechless. Good show?This bloodthirsty fellow doesn't recognize anyone. He's going to teach us a lesson.Although they were both at the sixth rank, not only did he kill those at the peak of the sixth rank, he was also extremely powerful. He could not afford to offend him."Cut the crap ... Bloodthirsty sent a message. He wants us to take in the wandering cultivators and block the crack. We can't let those two escape!""It's fine if some of the small fries run away," Wushang said in a deep voice."If the two of them run away without a sound ... We'll really have no future!" The realm Lord has ordered that this time, he will take in 10 venerable sovereigns, with intermediate venerable sovereigns taking priority ... If it's a rogue cultivator, he can even increase the number of spots!"There were still itinerant cultivators who were willing to be cannon fodder in the great world.They weren't afraid that they wouldn't be able to recruit any wandering cultivators.Sure enough, as the news spread, more and more itinerant cultivators gathered around the two venerable sovereigns, including a few middle-level ones. More than half of the people who were recruited by the itinerant cultivators ran away.It was better to follow the great world than to follow an itinerant cultivator.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Li Hao's group also received the news.Six tier 6 experts!Moreover, it might not be just that, because on the surface, there was a sixth-tier rogue cultivator who had not joined them yet. It was hard to say what would happen next. Perhaps there would be even more. And this was only the sixth-tier, there were still fifth-tier, fourth-tier ..."Is it exciting?" Best n0vel online free at n0ŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  Li Hao looked at Kong Ji and smiled.""Before they gather, the sword Saint won't make a move. We'll have to fight them!""If you're not afraid, why would I be?" Kong Ji laughed.I'm at the sixth step after all!Li Hao laughed."This time, we don't have to worry about our identity being exposed. We can't rely on venerable sword alone ... We have to play a part. Not to mention those at the sixth rank, those at the fourth and fifth rank, and even those at the lower ranks, we have to let them have a taste of our power!"

2947 Chapter 484
At this juncture, it was better to expose himself."What do you plan to do?"Kong Ji asked, and Li Hao smiled."We have to give them a hard time!"Then, Li Hao said telepathically, I've provoked a lot of Thunderbolts recently ... But none of them have descended. I'm just afraid that he'll scare sector Lord Sen LAN ..."Again?Kong Ji was also speechless. The primal Chaos lightning tribulation was about to become his.However, it was rather interesting.Kong Ji wasn't willing to let Li Hao Do what he wanted either. He also said,"You can play with Thunderbolts. I also have some methods to test ..." He said."What kind of method?""I need you to cooperate with me!""Just say it."Kong Ji quickly sent a voice transmission,'I've gained some enlightenment recently. It's the fusion of the Dao of revival and the Dao of life! The Dao of life can replenish life force, extract life force, replenish energy, and revive the world ... Forming a cycle. However, I haven't completely fused with it yet, so it's very difficult to activate it. I need your time to cooperate with me and speed it up. I'll give them a big attack and directly throw it down ... It might be able to kill a group of venerable sovereigns in an instant!""Kill them. I will create a Flower of Life in the Nirvana world ... It'll be perfect for venerable the sword to use. This way, it can make up for his consumption. You don't need to reverse time anymore. It's a great price for venerable the sword to reverse time once!"Li Hao gave him a thumbs up. Good brother, you know how to take care of others.Venerable the sword consumed a lot of energy and it was difficult for him to recover. This guy wanted to extract the vitality of other venerable sovereigns and bloom his own Flower of Life ... Li Hao was a little envious. "I've also been resurrected by life, death, and Nirvana. I can't fuse them as quickly as you can. ""You've comprehended too many things!"Kong Ji shook his head. He didn't say that Li Hao was not good. Li Hao had his own path. However, he was only focused on studying the six paths, which was actually a lot, including life, death, Nirvana, light, and darkness.Where's Li Hao?Li Hao studied all DAOs, but he was not very proficient in them. If an ordinary person did this, he would roll his eyes and look down on them.However, he felt that Li Hao's actions were rather bold. Best n0vel online free at n0ŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  Anyway, he did not have such thoughts at the moment. It was enough to focus on the three great paths of the two extremes. It was enough for him to cultivate to Level Seven, and it was more than enough.Li Hao didn't say anything else. There was no point in being envious. Right now, he didn't really want to just study these techniques. He could take it slow.Soon, the communication Jade in Li Hao's hand flashed."Red Moon Emperor has arrived!""They're here!"Li Hao let out a breath. It was pretty fast.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Outside the realm.Following the arrival of the four venerable sovereigns, a wave of killing intent permeated the entire Primal Chaos. Even the Senlan sector Lord was startled. The great Dao universe trembled slightly.Bloodthirsty venerable sovereign just glanced at him and ignored him.In the next moment, a Grand voice that was solemn and cold resounded through the forest."All non-Senlan monarch, leave Senlan immediately! The ten thousand Daoist thieves killed my fellow Daoist. Their crime is unforgivable! In order to avoid any misunderstandings, kill all venerable sovereigns except venerable sovereign Senlan!"The sound of the bloodthirsty great Dao shook the entire world.He was also extremely Savage!Apart from venerable sovereign Senlan, he would kill any other venerable sovereigns he encountered ... It sounded nice, but if venerable sovereign Senlan really made a move, he would probably kill him as well.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ In the forest world, many venerable sovereigns were panicking. There were also some who held onto their fantasies and were unwilling to leave.The local venerable sovereigns were more or less angry.Some people hoped that the sector Lord would step out and say a few words. However, the forest orchid sector Lord didn't say a single word.At this moment, the Senlan realm Lord was already making preparations for his advancement in the Dao universe!This time, if venerable the sword and the others could not kill these people ... He would also make a move.In order to reach Grade 7, he couldn't care less. Today, Sen Lan's face was stepped on the ground. Wasn't it because she was weak?Sector Lord Sen LAN was very clear that even if he threatened now, it would be useless. Bloodthirsty was at the peak of the Crimson Moon stage level 6. As long as he wasn't at the level 7, bloodthirsty wouldn't even fear him.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶As some of the venerable sovereigns walked out, nearly 30 venerable sovereigns gathered around the six venerable sovereigns in the blink of an eye. More than half of them were low-level venerable sovereigns, but there were also quite a few middle-level venerable sovereigns. Apart from Hong Yue's side, there were seven or eight middle-level venerable sovereigns.This kind of strength was enough to flatten Senlan!In the end, the rank six itinerant cultivator, venerable Emperor Yu Xiu, was a little helpless and emotional. In the end, he joined the red moon's team, and the red moon Lord gave him some conditions.If he joined Red Moon and made a contribution this time, he would not be so easy to reach the seventh rank. However, if there was a chance next time, he could be considered first.To wandering cultivators, this was already the best outcome.At that moment, there were seven rank six venerable sovereigns in the group.And they were not in a hurry to besiege Li Hao's group.While everyone was waiting, bloodthirsty venerable sovereign took out countless great Dao crystals. Under everyone's shocked gazes, he fused the great Dao crystals into the cracks. The three cracks from before began to close.The voice of the bloodthirsty Emperor resounded again,""This time, for disturbing the forest orchid world, there will be compensation for the killing! I've prepared a large number of great Dao crystals before I came. They're enough to repair the crack that was formed after Dao master senlanyin died!""The eight cracks can be repaired. Venerable monarch Sen LAN, just gather at the realm gate and suppress it. We will repair these cracks!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùWithin the Dao universe, sector Lord Sen LAN frowned.He was really ... Willing!Repairing the eight cracks had consumed countless great Dao crystals. As a top-tier level 8 great world, the red moon had no shortage of great Dao crystals. In order to put an end to Li Hao's hopes, they had to repair all the cracks!Clearly, the escape of those people earlier had let them know that Senlan might let those two people go at any moment. Since that was the case, they would repair it first. If Senlan couldn't even guard the realm gate, then she would be too useless.As he bled, the cracks began to close up.Monarch Sen LAN, who was guarding the crack, was helpless. However, he had also received an order from Yan Fang to retreat and repair the crack. This time, Hong Yue was serious. If she didn't agree, it would definitely cause a war.The group of people were not in a hurry at all. It took them a day to repair all eight cracks.There was only one realm gate left in the entire Senlan. It was a trap!Or ... A sheep entering a Tiger's Den?Dozens of venerable sovereigns entered the Shenglan realm from the realm gate. Their strong wills swept through the Shenglan realm."Over there!"Soon, they found the traces of the two. With bloodthirsty words, the group of venerable sovereigns went straight to Senlan's side.There were also three fourth-rank experts left near the realm gate. They were not there to seize the realm gate, but to keep an eye on the two. If the two really escaped here, Supreme Emperor Senlan would not be able to show mercy.The other venerable sovereigns had locked onto Li Hao and his companion.

2948 Chapter 485
It's here!There were seven level six venerable sovereigns, many middle-stage venerable sovereigns, and dozens of low-stage venerable sovereigns. It was a force that could sweep across the world.The bloodlust of a peak rank six expert shook the heavens and earth.In the distance, the rank six Yan Fang was far away from them. He followed them but did not get close. There were also a few middle-stage venerable sovereigns beside him. However, compared to these people, the gap was huge.Yan Fang only brought along realm Lord di Zun.As for the venerable sovereigns of the Daoist master's lineage, they were guarding the realm gate. In this way, the red moon's side could rest assured.Ji Hao's face was filled with unwillingness as he transmitted,"Old Yan, they've gone too far!"The venerable sovereigns beside him were also unwilling.This is me, Senlan!But now, it had completely become the red moon Emperor's home ground.Yan Fang didn't say anything. Falling behind meant being beaten, a famous saying from ancient times."Wait!"Yan Fang didn't say anything and just followed them in silence to prevent these people from starting a war in the densely populated areas. Once so many venerable sovereigns started a war, it would affect the entire Senlan. Although the population of Senlan was large, it couldn't withstand their torment.The major cosmos absolute beings still pitied their people. The people were also the foundation for a major cosmos to grow stronger.Without a large number of cultivators, the Dao of the world wouldn't be able to grow.Unless he wanted to become a wandering cultivator. In front of them, bloodthirsty and the others didn't care about him. They locked onto Li Hao and his friends and went straight for them.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, Li Hao began to set up a formation.One level after another, the power of all kinds of great DAOs filled the void.It was like the weaving of a Dao net!Li Hao was weaving a defensive shield with the power of a great Dao. Beside him, Kong Ji was also setting up his own Tao technique. The two of them didn't try to escape at all. At this point, it was better to wait for an opportunity.Kong Ji was also surprised to see Li Hao weave a great Dao. Although Li Hao was only at level four, he seemed to be stronger than before, and his understanding of Dao was deeper.When they dug the hole together, it was actually also a kind of web woven. At that time, he felt that Li Hao was slightly weaker than him. It hadn't been long, but the web woven by Li Hao had become so stable."You're improving so fast!"Kong Ji sighed as he set up his formation.Li Hao said casually,"I've dismantled a small world and a medium world. You can try it next time. Just try it more!" With my time backtrack Dao net's construction process, you can reverse engineer it and dismantle it ... The results will be quick! If you manage to get your hands on the world, I'll help you backtrack. You just need to give me half of the Dao net you've torn apart!"You're not short of money. I'll ask your father to send you dozens of medium-level worlds.There was silence.The great light world was rich, but money should not be wasted like this. Most importantly, he did not want to rely on his family. Besides, the light Supreme Emperor had a great world to take care of. It was fine to give his son some special treatment, but to give the light world's wealth at once ... Would the other Supreme emperors be happy?He had to find a balance.However ... Kong Ji turned his head and thought that if he succeeded this time, he could get a share of the money. Although he said last time that he didn't want to share it with him, he also agreed that he would get 20%. There was still a little.That works too!There was a benefit to tearing apart a world ... Of course, the prerequisite was that one had to be able to tear it apart. Without turning back time, it would probably be very difficult. There was no need to care about what one could tear apart, and there was no use in caring about what one couldn't tear apart.The two of them were still relaxed.It was true that they were no match for the other party. There were so many venerable sovereigns. They were definitely no match for them, but ... Didn't they still have venerable the sword? Best n0vel online free at n0ŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  In this battle, they were the vanguards, and venerable the sword was the decisive character.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.Venerable the sword's palms were sweating.Ëâπ!"These two guys trust me a lot. They think I'm awesome ..." Venerable the sword thought so too."I'm awesome. "But ... There were seven level six, many mid-ranked, and dozens of low-level ... Dozens of venerable sovereigns!He was powerful, but to say that he could fight dozens of venerable sovereigns alone, including seven sixth-rank ones, was an overestimation of him. Even a true seventh-rank venerable sovereigns would be a little difficult to deal with.More importantly, I'm not even at the seventh step.If he wasn't careful, he would also fall.This was much more powerful than a medium-level world.Look at Senlan, it was a great world. Before the Dao master died, there were only three rank six venerable sovereigns.Venerable the sword had destroyed a medium-level world before, but this time, he was also terrified."Seven rank six and one peak rank six!"Venerable the sword quickly calculated that it was difficult to kill!If he launched a surprise attack, he might be able to kill one of the Tier 6 experts in an instant. If the other party's reaction speed was slow, he could kill another one. However, if the other party's reaction speed was fast, the remaining six would join forces and he would be in trouble.Therefore, he had to kill two of them as quickly as possible. As for the remaining five ... If Li Hao's group could hold off one of them, he would deal with the remaining four tier 6 ones. This way, the pressure would be much less.As long as he could kill about 4, he would have enough Foundation to break through.Hurry!Otherwise, if he killed too many Red Moon Thearch, Red Moon master would definitely react quickly.Venerable the sword started to sweat.It was very exciting!This was even more exciting than killing Sen LAN alone. No matter how strong sector Lord Sen LAN was, he was just one person. Killing him alone wasn't too much of a pressure for Sword Saint."A life of being a blade!"Venerable the sword suddenly mumbled. The first half of his life had been to clean up the mess for that kid Fang ping. Now, he had gotten to know these two little guys in the primal Chaos. In the end ... He had to clean up his own mess. Of course, if he succeeded, he would gain a lot.If he didn't reach Grade 7 now, he wouldn't be able to participate in higher level battles.

2949 Chapter 485
Fang ping was about to step into rank-8. If he did not step into rank-7, it would be difficult for him to be of any use.In order to enter the seventh rank ... This time, he had to be ruthless!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶One figure after another quickly stopped.In front of them was a great formation. The power of the bed filled the sky and the earth. The killing intent was overflowing. The two venerable sovereigns were in the center of the formation, continuously setting up the formation and throwing out all kinds of bed crystals. Countless energy swept over from all directions, covering the formation.Bloodthirsty stopped and didn't directly attack. Best n0vel online free at n0ŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  A sixth stage venerable sovereign of life and death had set up a formation. The current situation was unclear. If they rushed in rashly, there was still a possibility of death. The six of them were sixth stage venerable sovereigns from the Crimson Moon. They could not afford to lose any more people.With so many people, if even a Tier 6 died, bloodthirsty would not be able to report back.The sixth-rank Warriors were the reserves of the seventh-rank Warriors. Hong Yue was confident that she could recover her vitality quickly because there were enough sixth-rank Warriors to replenish. If too many sixth-rank Warriors died, it would be troublesome.Bloodthirsty didn't say anything. He just looked at the grade 6 expert beside him.The venerable sovereign had a bright smile on his face and looked very kind. His voice was gentle and sincere."Death god, myriad DAOs venerable sovereign, my master has heard that you two cultivate the five elements and life and death, so he values you very much!""If the two of you are willing to join us, there will be almost no rank six among the fellow Daoists. As for fellow Daoist death ... You know our origins. This is a rare opportunity. Perhaps you can get a glimpse of the secrets of rank seven!"Wooing?The wandering cultivators were a little shocked, not knowing if it was true or not.In fact, it was half true and half false.It was not impossible for them to surrender. They were obviously talented venerable sovereigns. If they joined the Crimson Moon, they would be included in the Crimson Moon's great Dao system. They were potential talents.Of course, it was obvious that these two had someone behind them, so the possibility of them joining was low. This move was only to test the waters.Inside, Kong Ji raised his head and felt the power of the great path flowing into the formation. That person's voice of the great path was very confusing and alluring. This person might be an expert who was good at beguiling.He also laughed,"it's not impossible!" Venerable sovereigns, since you're from a big force, why don't you try my and fellow Daoist myriad Daoist's small array one by one? if anyone can break in and break the array, we'll naturally surrender!"His eyes were cold and bloodthirsty.After carefully observing the formation, he frowned slightly and a killing intent shot out from his eyes. The killing intent struck the formation and it trembled slightly, but it did not break. His bloodthirsty eyes moved slightly. What a stable formation!How did he do it?For venerable sovereigns like them, at their level, the power of a formation set up with the power of the great Dao was limited. It was difficult to cause any harm to a sixth-level venerable sovereign. Of course, it was a threat to those lower-level venerable sovereigns.For example, the eight trigrams array inside the Silver Moon had trapped the bone corrosion Imperial Emperor for many years.However, that was because Emperor Shi Gu was weak!He was a bloodthirsty sixth level venerable sovereign. He could even break through an intermediate world. Now, this small formation's defensive power was no weaker than an ordinary intermediate world. He's really quite capable!"Did you join a domain?"He could feel that it was a little domain. It was said that venerable Emperor myriad Dao had a monarch weapon and was given the power of Dao domain by a top-tier venerable Emperor. It seemed to be true.Beside him, Shi hun transmitted,"attack!" This formation doesn't look weak, but we have the numbers. If we attack it, we'll definitely break it!"As they were talking, Li Hao said,""This formation is connected to the terrain of the forest orchid. Once it is forcefully broken, the forest orchid will definitely be destroyed!"Li Hao sneered."Yan Fang, Senlan realm Lord, my brother and I have provoked strong enemies for Senlan and fought a bloody battle. In the end, not only did you not dare to offend these people, you even tried to steal our spoils of war. Now, you've even sealed the realm gate. Once this formation is forcefully broken, I want to see how many people of Senlan will die!"In the distance, Yan Fang's figure appeared.At this moment, he frowned slightly.A divine light shot out of his eyes. That formation indeed affected the surrounding terrain. For the time being, he couldn't determine whether this was an agreement between Li Hao and the sector Lord or ... A private decision. "You already said it's the forest world ..." Bloodthirsty sneered.Li Hao sneered too."Hundreds of millions of people have died in Senlan. The great Dao of the world is bound to decline. Do I need to tell you where you're from?" Why didn't he directly attack Senlan, but instead took it slow? Were all the venerable sovereigns in the world idiots? If you really kill Senlan, billions of lives will die, and the great Dao universe will weaken. Is this the result you want? I also want to see if you've made a contribution or a mistake by killing us, as you're so fond of killing venerable sovereigns!"Bloodthirsty frowned, coldly looking at them.What an eloquent fellow!Did they care about the death of Senlan?He didn't care!However, if Senlan suffered heavy casualties and a large number of civilians died, the world of Senlan would definitely weaken ... It was hard to say how much it would weaken, but annexing Senlan was to restore and strengthen the Crimson Moon.If too many of them really declined, wouldn't it be useless to Annex them?"Cut off his main formation!"Bloodthirsty suddenly messaged Yan Fang,"get your sector Lord to come out and control the world Energy to cut off the connection between their formation and Sen LAN region!"Yan Fang's eyes were filled with helplessness, he transmitted: "The realmlord is in closed door cultivation.""Hmph!"Bloodthirsty coldly snorted.It wasn't impossible. Maybe he was really trying to break through to the seventh rank. But at this moment, was there really no way?You let an outsider contact you so easily?
