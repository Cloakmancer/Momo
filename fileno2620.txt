"No!"The other party shook his head and pondered for a while before saying,""It's probably a Sword Saint! Firstly, he still had some feelings for Silver Moon. Secondly, the loss of Silver Moon was also due to the lack of strength of the sword Lord. To the sword Lord ... This was also a humiliation! In order to wash away their shame, the neo martial artist would not live up to the title of the neo martial Swordmaster if he did not kill eight or ten venerable sovereigns. ",m He laughed and said,"it's said that venerable the sword has already entered the sixth rank. He's also a sword cultivator and has extremely strong combat strength!" Therefore, this time, it's very likely that there will be an advanced venerable sovereign!"Li Hao took a deep breath and said, I can't afford to offend this person!"You still dare to provoke me?"Kong Ji laughed,"I'll just listen. If you want me to go back to the Dragon Temple, I won 't!" Whoever was willing to go could go! Fellow Daoist, you're really ... Bold! You can borrow power in tianfang, but in the chaos, you can also borrow power? In my opinion, it's not possible in the chaos!""It's difficult in the chaos!"Li Hao nodded."Isn't that it? The Supreme martial artist of new martial arts isn't someone to be trifled with. I'm thinking that there'll be a fierce battle. You and I can just watch the show. Why should we get involved?""I have no choice, I owe karma! It's hard to return a favor. ""That's true!""That's right!" Kong Ji nodded and sighed."A debt of gratitude ... To us cultivators, if we don't repay it, even our Dao hearts can't bear it!""This is it!"As the two of them conversed, the giant pincers at the side felt ... A sense of shock and awe that came from the bottom of their hearts.Venerable sovereign Kong Ji had always been a man of few words.However, today, he was having a great time chatting with this person.As for the information he had reported and Li Hao's true identity, the other party didn't seem to care too much.Why was it like this?Also, this Li Hao ... He actually spoke his mind. Was he really not afraid?There were too many doubts in his mind!Li Hao continued,"it's hard for me to stay for a year without damaging Huilong temple!" I just want to have a proper identity, that's one. "Second, I want to kill a few enemies and need some convenience. I hope that I can obtain some convenience! "Third, after killing someone, I want to exchange some Dao crystals. Can the Dragon Temple provide me with some channels? Fourth, Daoist friend is good at the Dao of nothingness, the Dao of void, and the Dao of death. Although they are not one, they are somewhat similar. If I advance, I'm willing to advance through life and death so that Daoist friend can observe the Dao. However, Daoist friend, can you make it convenient for me to create a world of nothingness for me in the tianfang realm when I advance?"Kong Ji nodded."That's possible. You're very knowledgeable. The Dao of void is best at hiding. However, if you provoke a lightning tribulation, I can't do anything about it!""I won't ... If I don't mess around, it's just a small improvement. It won't attract lightning tribulation."  Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  "That's good!"Kong Ji didn't seem to be surprised that he advanced at the risk of life and death. He smiled and said,"I also want to see what's so special about the advancement of the Dao of life and death! Life and death, yin and yang, these were all well-known great DAOs in the chaos! My Dao of void is only a minor Dao ... It's a rare opportunity to see a cultivator of the great Dao!"At this moment, the two of them did not understand each other deeply.However, they seemed to be having a great time.When he saw Kong Ji, Li Hao could tell that he was a true cultivator with profound Taoist connotation. For such an existence ... Killing people and snatching treasures were not important.The key was Dao enlightenment!He and Li Hao might be the same kind of people.It was just that their DAOs were different!It didn't matter if they had different DAOs. They just had to seek common ground while reserving their differences.Let's exchange some ideas.The other party was powerful, but the great Dao was for communication. It could not be forcibly taken away. If it was taken away, it would only be taking away what was present from others, not the future or potential.Therefore, snatching the Dao was not the key!People like them, once met, could actually be discussed. As long as it did not involve the other party's core interests, there was nothing that could not be discussed.Kong Ji added,'by the way, in order to give the Abbey Dean an explanation ... Don't cause trouble in the Dragon field! If you have an idea, you can go to other places. Moreover, there's a big world behind the dragon Temple! As for whether the Abbey Dean would make a move on the neo martial artists ... That was their business. Once they left tianfang world, it was up to them! However, I'm the one who's testing you this time, so ... Please don't make things difficult for me!""It's inevitable!""Definitely not!" Li Hao nodded."Fellow Daoist, are you doing this for the tianfang great Dao universe?""Not entirely, that's an opportunity, but whether you can obtain it or not depends on luck! It's best if you have it, but it's fine if you don 't. What I need to gain enlightenment of is Nirvana ... And Tian Fang is a huge world of Nirvana!"Li Hao didn't hide anything. At this moment, Kong Ji didn't seem to care. He explained,""Tianfang's experts have disappeared, and the great Dao is in a vacuum. It's a great world, a top-notch great world. In fact, it's best if the great Dao universe doesn't appear, but it's fine if it does. Silence gives birth to vitality, and from nothing to something, the day it's born will be the opportunity for me to advance to level five or even level six!""Void ... Vitality!"Li Hao nodded thoughtfully and clapped his hands."Yes, not bad! If a great Dao universe is born here, and it's a top-notch great world, it's indeed your chance! This was somewhat similar to the Dao of illusion, life and death, and the Dao of yin and yang! In that case, the myriad DAOs in the world should correspond with each other, some real and some virtual!"

Chapter 2621 Fellow Daoist (6)
"Right!""That's what I was thinking!"Kong Ji laughed."Fellow Daoist is right, I agree!"The more they talked, the more excited they became.Li Hao had once controlled the great Dao universe, comprehended the river of chaos, experienced the rough 10000 DAOs, experienced time, comprehended life and death, and received guidance from several high-tier venerable sovereigns. His comprehension of the great Dao was also top-notch.And this person was also extraordinary.The Dao of nothingness ... Li Hao had never come into contact with it before, but it did not stop Li Hao from understanding, comprehending, and experiencing it!This might also be a pretty good Dao.Solitary nothingness, from nothing to something!The more the two of them talked, the more they felt the joy of the great Dao. Off to the side, the giant pincer didn't understand what they were talking about, but it was able to remember everything it had heard.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ One of them was only a level one venerable sovereign, while the other was a level four venerable sovereign.They had known each other for less than an hour and started to discuss Dao with each other. They did not avoid the giant pincer. To the giant pincer, this might be the greatest opportunity in his life!These two people ... Gave him the feeling that they were even more mysterious than some rank six venerable sovereigns!As for stronger ones, he had never seen one.He had only seen a sixth stage venerable sovereign!For example, his own Abbey Dean used to think that he was unattainable, but today, he suddenly felt that the usually weak venerable sovereign Kong Ji seemed more ... More like a venerable sovereign than the Abbey Dean!He was unable to describe that complicated feeling.He only knew that today, being able to pour wine for the two venerable sovereigns was perhaps ... Something that he would be grateful for and even proud of for the rest of his life!……After a long time.Both sides had great gains. Kong Ji also finished his last glass of wine and smiled,""That's it, then. When fellow Daoist advances, you can call me. I'll create a Nirvana world for fellow Daoist! It's still possible to hide it from a few rank six venerable sovereigns. It won't cause too much of a stir. ""Thank you, fellow Daoist, for helping me!"Li Hao also stood up and smiled."I've gained a lot today. I need some time to digest it. When I come out of seclusion and kill that level three venerable sovereign, the power of death should be enough. The power of life ... Should be enough!" "Then I'll have to congratulate you in advance, fellow Daoist!""Same to you!"Li Hao laughed."You're almost level five, fellow Daoist. Anything below level Seven will not be your threshold.""Thanks for your kind words!"p Kong Ji laughed and his figure gradually faded."If you have time, you can come to my place, but it's better not to. The Abbey Dean is there too ... I'll give you a title with the excuse that you're in closed-door cultivation. Within a year, the Dragon Temple won't look for you. After a year ... It's up to you!""Many thanks!"At this moment, the empty figure disappeared.As for Li Hao, he let out a breath and smiled.""The chaos is interesting. Who said venerable sovereigns are all fake Dao cultivators?"Li Hao laughed heartily. He felt that he had gained something.He looked at the giant pincers and smiled."You should go too. Whether you're in seclusion or guarding outside, you can comprehend it yourself. I don't dare to say that it's a venerable sovereign, but a half-step sovereign ... I think it's not too difficult for you!""Thank you, venerable sovereign!"The giant pincer was excited, but it didn't dare to say anything more. It quickly walked out of the volcano and sat down cross-legged outside.It was as if he was protecting the Dao .... Even though he was a Heavenly King, protecting the Dao was a joke.But ... It was fine as long as he got the meaning.With the identity of the Huilong temple, ordinary venerable sovereigns would have to give him some face.Li Hao smiled and looked in the direction where Kong Ji had disappeared. He sighed with emotion. This ... Is definitely a level six venerable sovereign. Although I'm only a level one venerable sovereign, I feel that way.Returning to the Dragon Temple was actually quite interesting.I wonder if I'll be able to comprehend some of the Dao of nothingness when I advance.From nothing to something, perhaps, it's somewhat similar to my life towards death!The other party obviously had the same thought. The day he advanced ... Might also be the day he advanced to Tier 5. Was this person really a cultivator from the Huilong temple?Wandering cultivator?Not necessarily!

Chapter 2622 I Hope She's Fine (1)
(1st, cast your guaranteed monthly vote!)Within the fire element divine mountain.As Kong Ji left, Li Hao fell into deep thought. Gradually, he generated energy from the void.The river of life and death appeared.At this moment, in the long river, the power of the great DAOs was clearly divided.Separating and rejoining, this was the normal state of the Great Dao.A giant star surrounded a life and death Star. The power of time flickered as if it would disappear at any moment. At this moment, in the depths of the river, a tiny star was being swallowed by a cat.Second cat!This time, no one had followed them to the tianfang world except for the cat. It had followed them because of the star of time, but it had never appeared. Instead, it had hidden in the depths of the river and played with the star of time.Li Hao was in no mood to pay attention to it.The stars appeared once again. The river of life and death was like a starry sky.Traces of the power of life and death began to gather, forming many bridges.One, two ...All the energy from the venerable sovereigns he had killed earlier began to gather.The bridges of life and death weaved through the stars like cloth. Li Hao silently experienced and sensed them.As the bridges appeared, the great Dao of communication became more and more compact.Like a spider web, it began to cover the river of life and death.10 bridges, 20 bridges ... All the way to 50 bridges that connected the corporeal and unreal great DAOs. There were a total of 50 stars. At this time, the power of life and death was exhausted, and no new power of life and death was born.Li Hao's aura had also changed.However, it was still not at the second rank.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  It was actually very difficult for venerable sovereigns to advance."I'll definitely be a third level venerable sovereign if I can successfully form 360 bridges! If you want to enter the second level of venerable sovereign, you'll need at least 120 bridges to be built successfully,"As Li Hao thought about this, he could only build 50 bridges even after exhausting all his energy.Within it, the power of various great DAOs intersected with reality and finally gathered on the life and death Star.The firmament sword was also wandering in the river.At this moment, Li Hao looked at the end of the river and had an idea. The two ends of the river were open, which meant that every time he used some of his remaining power, he would attract the chaos lightning tribulation.This thing was the key to exposing himself.What if they blocked both ends?Would he be able to completely block the primal Chaos lightning tribulation?"A Stargate!"At this moment, Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. If the Stargate acted as a portal on one side and temporarily sealed off the river, what would happen on the other side?"Second cat?"A thought appeared in his mind again. Could this cat be used as the second thing to block the river?If he could completely block off both sides, he might be able to avoid attracting the chaos lightning tribulation. At the very least, a small-scale gathering of time energy would not attract the attention of the chaos lightning tribulation.Perhaps ... It would work! With this in mind, Li Hao had an idea. Without saying anything, the Stargate that had been dismantled earlier instantly turned into a huge gate that flowed down along the river.Soon, at the downstream of the river, at the end of life and death, a door appeared. It stood in the river, with one end sealed.This Stargate was also extremely powerful.In the past, it was even able to resist the invasion of venerable sovereigns and seal them. It was created by the joint efforts of several Masters, such as the new martial artist human King and the God-casting venerable sovereign. It was said that the number one forging master of the new martial artists was also a fifth or sixth-stage venerable sovereign.For Li Hao, the Stargate was still extremely powerful and could meet his needs.One end of the Stargate was sealed."Senior second cat, can you expand your body and seal the other side?" Li Hao asked.At that moment, second cat was a little impatient. What a troublesome person!"Why do you want to seal it? If it's sealed, why didn't you seal it from the start?"Li Hao chuckled."How can that be? sealing off the city is only a temporary measure. If we seal it off from the start, won't it limit Changhe city's development?" For now, I'll seal myself off for a period of time so that I can prepare for my reunion. "Second cat mumbled a few words, then its body enlarged and expanded infinitely.Soon, the end of the river was also completely blocked!One was the Stargate, the other was the second cat.At this moment, the river was completely sealed!There were good and bad things about being sealed off.The advantage was that the power of time might no longer leak out.However, there were also disadvantages. The river could no longer freely absorb Primal Chaos energy. Previously, the two ends of the river had been able to freely absorb the energy of the river.After the river was sealed, Li Hao tried to gather the power of time again.This time ... He didn't feel threatened.There was no sign of the lightning tribulation.Li Hao exhaled. Good news.For now, it was better to seal it off.Of course, this was not a long-term plan."Not even the power of life and death!"Li Hao had no choice. In fact, he had killed several venerable sovereigns, but the Beast of Chaos had helped the Black Panther. Red Moon, a level-three cultivator, had used up a lot of energy when she was reborn. After that, she scattered a part of the world and did not leave much energy.As for the venerable sovereign that he had killed earlier ... If he purified it, he would not have much energy.As a result, he had only condensed 50 bridges of life and death after killing several venerable sovereigns.It was too little!To advance to Tier 2, he would need at least 120 or more, right?He still needed at least 70 bridges. "I have to kill a rank three venerable sovereign!"Li Hao fell into deep thought.Killing venerable sovereigns wasn't for Dao seeking, but because he lacked the energy to advance and build his own Bridge of Life and death, which would eventually turn into a life and death Star.2nd rank ... There was a high probability that it would not be enough.

Chapter 2623 I Hope She's Fine (2)
Tier 3 should be about right?However, stage three experts were hard to kill!Of course, the other party was only a venerable sovereign from a medium-level world, so he was definitely not much. There was no great path universe, so he must have cultivated a chaotic way. If he was really talented ... He would not have been ignored by the major forces.As the thought emerged, the killing intent rose!There was no need to hesitate.The enemy of new martial arts was his enemy at the moment. Besides, he had already killed a venerable sovereign ... If he didn't get rid of the root, there would only be more and more trouble."Senior second cat ... Are you interested in killing a venerable sovereign with me?" he asked."Meow, cats don't fight and don't kill!"Second cat mumbled. Don't fight, don't kill, don't learn from big cat.To be a good cat!Li Hao laughed and nodded. I won't fight or kill anyone, but if I use the power of time, it might cause some trouble, such as ... Primal Chaos lightning tribulation!"At the end of the river, the cat suddenly turned its belly up!He felt like he had nothing to live for!How annoying!Why was this person the only one who had the power of time?Why did he kill people for no reason?Big cat followed the killer and started killing people every day. Now, this guy was like this too. How pitiful.I don't want to be a Bad Cat like big cat!I want to be a good cat!"Another Primal Chaos lightning tribulation?"Second cat looked like it had nothing to live for."I can't take it if I eat too much ..."Li Hao smiled shyly."Just once ... After this, you don't need to absorb the chaos lightning tribulation anymore. It shouldn't be too strong this time!"“……”Bullshit!You're already a venerable sovereign. The one you've provoked will definitely be stronger.How troublesome!"Why did you kill him?" second cat asked."There's not enough energy,""Then I'll cultivate on my own!""We don't have enough time."Li Hao sighed."Actually, I don't mind wasting more time, but that human King from neo martial is too good at causing trouble. I owe him a big favor ... You can say that I don't want to pay him back, but it's fine. At most, I'll go the opposite way and not meet neo martial. It's nothing." "But ... We're still alive, aren't we?"If you were alive, there were some things that you had to acknowledge even if you were reborn.This thing could not be considered karma.It was ... A debt of favor!This thing was the most troublesome. Any powerhouse, a truly shameless powerhouse, would be afraid of this thing. Sometimes, even if you risked your life, you still had to pay for a favor!Otherwise, how could he be considered a Martial Master? The Martial Master of the underworld is my root!To repay the neo martial arts human relationship ..."It's bigcat and the others again ..."Second cat mumbled," the teacher did it for them last time!"Yes, it was the same last time.This time ... This person was again.New martial, human King, Fang ping, big cat ...These people were really troublemakers.Big cat even gave me dried fish ... I don't want it anymore.However, this matter concerned big cat and the others. As for whether Li Hao could be of help to big cat and the others, second cat thought for a long time ... There should be ... Hope, right?This person, deep down, was actually a little like a teacher.The teacher was actually very strong, but in the end, he chose to commit suicide, which was also a pain for second cat.To such a person, there was nothing worth reminiscing about in the world. Such a person might go to the extreme.Since I'm not afraid of death, why should I be afraid of death?I've already played all the interesting things in this world, so why should I stay?With this thought in mind, second cat replied,""Just this once! Next time ... Don't come to me!""Alright, just once!" Li Hao smiled."It's agreed, don't change!" Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  "Definitely!"Li Hao nodded. In fact, second cat had given him a lot of help. Although it had something to do with time, second cat had helped him block the lightning tribulation several times. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to deal with it so easily.Since he had made his decision, Li Hao stopped his cultivation. It was only for a short period of time. It had been five days since Kong Ji left.As expected, the cultivation of venerable sovereigns really had no time difference.It took five days to build 50 bridges.Five days had passed in the chaosverse. Before Silvermoon had opened her Stargate, that would have been decades.Of course, that was not how the time was calculated."After I kill this person and advance to Tier 2, I'll make a trip back to Silver Moon!"He wondered how Heibao was doing.It should be nothing serious. Lin Hongyu's life and death Star was still with him. If something really happened, he would know something.There should be many people searching for them now.More importantly, the other party might know that the Silver Moon had disappeared because of the beasts of primordial chaos. As such, the beasts of primordial chaos would become the target of everyone's attention. The Black Panther was too big, and even though it was not much in the primordial chaos, once it was discovered ... There would not be many chances for it to escape.A second level venerable sovereign was nothing in comparison.Heibao was not him.Of course, that was only relative to a world Lord.All sorts of thoughts emerged.Li Hao walked out of Mount Huoxing. At the entrance of the mountain, the giant pincer hurriedly stood up. In fact, it did not dare to continue engrossed in its cultivation. Even so, the aura of the giant pincer seemed to have changed after five days.Li Hao did not give him any benefits, but the giant pincer felt that it had gained so much that it might even affect its chances of becoming a venerable sovereign.At this moment, he became even more respectful."Your Excellency, the temple has already issued an order. Your Excellency is now the 17th venerable sovereign of the Huilong temple!" In addition to you, there are 16 venerable sovereigns in Hui long temple. Among them, the sixth rank temple master, the fifth rank Green Dragon venerable Emperor, the fourth rank void venerable Emperor and Wuhuan venerable Emperor, and the remaining 12, three third rank venerable sovereigns, six second rank venerable sovereigns, and three first rank venerable sovereigns ..."

Chapter 2624 I Hope She's Fine (3)
16 venerable sovereigns!Such a force could not be considered weak.It was much more powerful than the average mid-tier world.Of course, it was not as good as the great world.p Under normal circumstances, a great world could only accommodate 100 venerable sovereigns at most, and the stronger great worlds might even accommodate more.However, there were a total of four middle-ranked venerable sovereigns, which was not a small number.Some middle-level worlds might only have one or two.The weaker ones might be medium-level world Lords who had just entered Level-3 ... Under normal circumstances, such medium-level world Lords had just advanced not long ago. Under normal circumstances, they could enter level-4 very quickly.The Silver Moon was special, too weak!Li Hao nodded, and the giant pincer said,""Venerable sovereign Kong Ji vouched for you. You don't have any missions and don't have to do anything for a year. However, if you're still back at the Dragon Temple after a year, you'll have to do some missions for it ... Of course, if you don't do any missions, you're not qualified to go to the Taoist connotation where the Dragon Temple is located unless you're willing to carry out a mission!"Li Hao nodded again. It was fair and reasonable.If you don't work, of course you won't get any benefits.When you work, no matter what you do, at least you have the heart. Of course, you will be given some benefits." 17 venerable sovereigns ... The southern region and the other nine small regions, even if they are slightly weaker, are usually at the fourth level. There are still several venerable sovereigns, five in each region. Doesn't that mean that the southern region has more than 60 venerable sovereigns?""There are more than 200 venerable sovereigns in the entire tianfang world and the four regions? In addition to the chaotic rogue cultivators, there should be at least 300 venerable sovereigns in the entire tianfang world, right?"Li Hao took a deep breath.He didn't have a clear understanding of it before.At this moment, he knew how many venerable sovereigns there were in this place.Where did so many venerable sovereigns come from?The giant pincer did not hide anything at this moment. It even ... Whispered,""Your Excellency, there are definitely more venerable sovereigns. However, these venerable sovereigns, in fact ... Will overlap!""Overlap?" Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  "Yes." The giant pincer nodded and said softly,"for example, some well-known venerable sovereigns from some macro worlds may be here, but they may not be called as they were before! Some of the medium-level world Lords ... Might also be here, but they don't have that name!"Li Hao understood.Many of them were actually powerhouses from large and medium-level worlds. However, they used aliases here. Venerable sovereigns of the Hui long temple could also be venerable sovereigns of some forces.Therefore, there were not that many venerable sovereigns."It seems that they all have some plans against Tian Fang!" Li Hao laughed. "That's for sure!"The giant pincer was much more at ease this time."After all, it's a great world and it's an ownerless great world. More importantly, it's a great world where a level nine venerable sovereign lives!" No one can really not care!"That emptiness, was it really emptiness?"He said it himself. I named him because it was compatible with my Dao. It doesn't mean that he doesn't have any other identity. His original name might not have been this."Do you have any information on Yunyang's third-stage venerable sovereign?""Yes, Lord Kong Ji gave it to me!"The giant pincer sighed with emotion. Venerable Emperor void attached great importance to this person. On the second day of Li Hao's seclusion, all the news from that person had arrived."After the Yunyang world was destroyed, only two venerable sovereigns survived. One of them was the one who died before! The other one was called Rainbow Rising venerable sovereign! He's a rank three venerable Emperor and specializes in the rainbow Divine Art. He doesn't have many special characteristics. According to venerable Emperor void, he's very fast!""He knows the rainbow transformation technique. When the sword Master killed the master of Yunyang, he escaped in the rainbow transformation technique. The sword Master didn't care much about him, which gave him the opportunity to escape.""If we want to kill this person, the key is speed. Or, we can just not give him the chance to escape!"Even though he knew that the person in front of him was only a first stage venerable sovereign and the giant pincer, he still thought that the other party was dead for sure!It was just so ... Inexplicable."He's waiting for the right price and hasn't joined any force yet. However, a venerable sovereign from a medium-sized world, even if he's a level three ... Isn't as popular as I thought, especially now that venerable sovereigns have escaped from The Dark World and the Elysian world. They're all venerable sovereigns from major worlds.""The attention of the various factions is focused on these two sides. This makes Yunyang's Rainbow Rising venerable sovereign no longer important.""He's currently in the Tianhe zone of the southern region. The Tianhe zone Lord is a fourth stage venerable sovereign, and he's currently in contact with the other party. The four major forces are all busy getting in touch with the two fifth stage venerable sovereigns, so this man has been in contact with the Lords of some small zones recently!"Li Hao kept nodding.The information was quite detailed.For a venerable sovereign, it was already very impressive that he could give such detailed information and even his best abilities.Seeing that Li Hao was satisfied, the giant pincer smiled and said,""In addition, the venerable sovereign who went missing ... Venerable sovereign Kong Ji said that if we use this as an excuse, there's hope of luring him out!""Many thanks!""Please thank Emperor void for me!" Li Hao exclaimed.As expected, he had to rely on his friends when he went out.Although they couldn't be considered friends, neither Li Hao nor Kong Ji took Yunyang's Rainbow Rising venerable sovereign seriously.It wasn't a bad idea for Kong Ji to use this opportunity to do Li Hao a favor."Yes," giant pincer said hurriedly."I'll pass on the message ... Also, if you want to go to the Tianhe zone, I can accompany you. As a venerable sovereign of the Dragon Zone, you're also qualified to go! It's just that ... It's hard to hide the news!"

Chapter 2625 I Hope She's Fine (3)
If Li Hao went, the news would be hard to hide.In addition, if a level three venerable sovereign really died ... Li Hao would also be suspected. The previous death could be considered to have been blocked by the void, but if another one died ...That would be a huge commotion! Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Li Hao fell into deep thought.There wouldn't be emptiness every time.Of course ... If the commotion was small, it would not be a big problem."Is there a place with Taoist connotation in the Tianhe zone?" he asked."There are!""The place where the heavenly River Thearch is located is a place of Taoist connotation," the giant pincer said immediately."It is said that it was once the place where a sixth-stage venerable sovereign cultivated. However, the power of the Taoist connotation is very strong, so it has more Taoist connotation than the Coiling Dragon Well and fire Mountain we saw before!""Venerable sovereign Tian He, who is this fourth rank venerable sovereign? A good person? Bad guy? Or bandits? A Bandit?"The giant pincer's heart trembled slightly as it transmitted a message,""My Lord ... To be honest, there are almost no good venerable sovereigns in tianfang world or even the chaosverse ..."When he said this, he seemed to have included Li Hao.He immediately added,"of course, not all of them are like this!" However, this venerable Emperor Tian He is not a good person. ""What do you mean?"At this moment, Li Hao seemed to be a bit pedantic and pretentious.If he wanted to kill, he would kill.If I can't kill him, then I won 't.He even had to ask for more details to comfort himself and find an excuse.The giant pincer did not dare to think that way and immediately said,""This person once devoured a small world in the past. It was the small world he was in. Within the small world, billions of living beings were all devoured by him ... Is he considered a good person?"Li Hao shook his head.It was not easy for a fourth stage venerable sovereign to come from a small world.Of course, no matter how bad he was, it had nothing to do with her.This was equivalent to killing his entire family, and Li Hao had no interest in seeking justice for his family. If they did not provoke him, he would let it go, but if they did ... Perhaps he would finish them off in the Tianhe zone before he left!Such a thought flashed through his mind.Soon, Li Hao said,"you don't have to go. I'll go by myself." You can just draw the other party's appearance to me!""Yes!"The giant Pincher did not dare to say anything else. It quickly sent Li Hao a portrait of the rainbow Rising venerable sovereign.Soon, another portrait was sent over. It was a somewhat sinister portrait of venerable sovereign Tianhe."My Lord, this is the heavenly River Thearch!"Li Hao nodded again.He looked at the giant pincers and thought for a moment before saying,""Your original form isn't human. You're a demon. Your original form ... Should be a shell-type demon, right?" "Right!""Yes!" The giant pincer nodded hurriedly."My original form is a giant crab. My race is also considered a mutation of chaos beasts. It's rumored that there are real giant crabs that can even crush a world!"Li Hao nodded."I don't know much about the demon race. However ... You can try to combine it with the Dao of weapons. Giant crab, giant pincers, giant pincers ..."This could be considered a weapon.Of course, if it was as simple as combining weapons, Li Hao wouldn't have needed to say anything.Anyone would be able to think of this.Li Hao continued,"with the pincers as the vessel, they contain the Dao of weapons!" You can try to absorb the power of the ten thousand chaos DAOs and gather all the other powers in your body. Only the weapon Dao and the division Dao can be gathered in the pincer ..."The giant pincer was stunned and said carefully,"my Lord, the path of cultivation is too complicated. To me, I'm just ... Just a Heavenly King!" It's difficult to cultivate one Dao, but you still have to cultivate 10000 DAOs. Then ... Won't you have no hope of becoming a venerable sovereign in your life?"Li Hao nodded and said,"under normal circumstances, that's definitely the case!" Even if you had a pair of pincers and were extremely powerful, it would still be difficult for you to become a venerable sovereign! "However, it's too troublesome. You won't understand even if I tell you. If you really reach that stage, you won't be able to enter the venerable sovereign level because of your mixed Dao paths ... If I'm still here, perhaps you can find me. You can find me and I'll help you once to dispel the chaotic Dao in your body. This way, your Dao path will be pure! Otherwise, if you only cultivate one Dao and just eliminate the other DAOs, it will be difficult for you to become a venerable sovereign in your life!"The giant pincers were ecstatic!Really?For a Heavenly King ... If it was easy to become a venerable sovereign, would he even have a chance?Which venerable sovereign didn't go through countless hardships to become one?But ... If this person agreed to help him once, even though he was only a first level venerable sovereign ... Who would care?The giant pincer knew that this person was not simple.The path of dispelling chaos!This was something that even 90% of venerable sovereigns in the world could not do.As for what Li Hao did or whether he could do it, he didn't care.p The next moment, the giant pincer was overjoyed. It did not even care about anything else and directly prostrated on the ground."Thank you for your help, Sir! If there is a chance for me to reach the venerable sovereign realm one day, no matter where you are, I ... Will go to you and seek this opportunity!"This was an opportunity!No matter how many years later, no matter what, as long as Li Hao was still alive, with his words, he would be a venerable sovereign if he found him!The premise was that he would not die on the road.However, for the sake of becoming a saint Emperor, what was this little bit of danger?At least, there was hope.It wasn't to the extent that there was no hope at all. People were most afraid of having no hope. On the path of cultivation, if there was no hope, that would be true despair!"There will be a chance!"Li Hao smiled and looked around."Where is the Tianhe zone?""Head south for 30 Primal Chaos iron ruler. Your Excellency will arrive in a day!""Alright!"Li Hao didn't waste any time and disappeared.

Chapter 2626 I Hope She's Fine (1)
After Li Hao left, the giant pincer was somewhat excited.Do I ... Have a chance of becoming an Emperor?A first level venerable sovereign's promise had made him so excited. It was hard to understand. He had just become a venerable sovereign. Under normal circumstances, he would have treated it as a fart.However, at this moment, he really felt that he had a great chance!……At the same time.Back to the Dragon Temple.There were many great halls, and each Hall was the place of a venerable sovereign.One of the halls was extremely quiet, as if all living things had been destroyed.At this moment, a figure suddenly flickered in the hall. In the middle of the hall, Kong Ji, who was cultivating with his eyes closed, suddenly opened his eyes and looked at the person who had arrived. This person was also very powerful."He has already gone to the Tianhe zone," the messenger said softly."You're confident!"Kong Ji smiled."How bold! A rank 1 venerable sovereign taking the initiative to find a rank 3 venerable sovereign, and even in the territory of a rank 4 venerable sovereign. There are even several venerable sovereigns in the territory ... How audacious!"Kong Ji laughed."Go and take a look ... Of course, from a distance. Also, if you're really discovered, there's no need to hide it. Just say that I want to see how he can do it. A rank one against a rank three. I also want to see if he can really borrow power ... There's no need to hide anything!"The person frowned slightly."It's fine!"Kong Ji laughed,"there's nothing you can't tell others!" "It's no big deal. To him and me, I'm just curious. He probably won't care too much. As for you, you don't have to test me. Otherwise ... If you're killed while testing me, I won't care!""Your Highness, I'm at the fifth rank!" The man was stunned and laughed.You must be joking!With my strength, I can't say that I'm invincible, but a fifth rank venerable sovereign is a top existence anywhere.Even if the Dragon return temple's monastery master was very powerful, he wasn't afraid. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 I'm a venerable Emperor of a major world!I control the power of the great Dao of the great world!Although it wasn't as good as Grade 6, if they really fought, they might not lose."You!"Kong Ji chuckled,"up to you!" If you're not afraid, then go ahead and try. ""I don't dare!""His Highness thinks highly of me, how would I dare to provoke him!" The person said."As you wish!"Kong Ji laughed and seemed to be indifferent."Also, you don't have to keep calling me that. You can call me solitary, Nirvana, Kong, anything ...."The person laughed."I wouldn't dare. No matter what, I can't call Your Highness by his name. If you really mind, why don't you call me fellow Daoist? that way, we'll be of the same generation ...""Fellow Daoist, forget it!" Kong Ji's expression was indifferent.“……”The venerable sovereign was stunned. He looked at Kong Ji with a strange expression and said after a long time,""Then I'll still call you Your Highness!""As you wish!""Your Highness, I'll take my leave first!"He didn't say anything more. Seeing Kong Ji nod, he quickly left. Only after they left the main hall did he slightly frown.Fellow Daoist ... What's wrong? Why not?I could've just called you by your name. I was just saying it in passing. In the chaosverse, that's a way to treat someone of the same generation as me, and there's even some respect in it. Why are you so cold to me?He had some thoughts in his heart, but he didn't want to think about it.This person had a strange personality.After coming to Tian Fang, he had become even weirder than before. He no longer thought about it. However, he thought about the weak venerable sovereign called venerable Hao Yue. A first rank venerable sovereign ... Why was his Highness so interested?In fact, he was even warning himself.……In the main hall.Kong Ji didn't care. It didn't matter if that person was obedient or not. I've warned you. If you want to try and get killed, I won't care.Fifth rank venerable sovereign?He was very strong!This was something that could not be denied.However, that person had previously said to borrow strength ... Borrow strength from whom?He revealed some of his secret to the Hui long temple. What if the one who went was not me but the Hui long Emperor?That was a sixth stage venerable sovereign!Was there a way to deal with it?There was a huge difference between a first level venerable sovereign and a sixth level venerable sovereign. Why was he so confident?Huoxing mountain, a seventh level venerable sovereign, where Daoist huoyan cultivated.It was said that that person was extremely powerful back then.The fire element was a path of explosiveness.When he went there, Li Hao seemed to be comprehending something.He had some guesses in his heart, but he couldn't deduce them for the time being. How could he borrow the strength of Daoist huoyan?In addition, tianfang world had countless venerable sovereigns and countless powerhouses in the past.Could it be that he could borrow strength from them?Would they use such a method this time?If a first rank venerable sovereign was able to kill a fourth rank venerable sovereign, he must have used a heaven-defying move. At that time, the chaos lightning tribulation would definitely descend. Such a heaven-defying move would not be weak and would cause a huge commotion.How would he deal with it?Even if they managed to deal with the lightning tribulation, there would be powerful venerable sovereigns after that ... At least one powerful venerable sovereign would be sent to the southern region. How would he deal with such a situation?One thought after another appeared in his mind.He couldn't help but think about the new martial world, the yin-yang world.The other party's human King, Supreme, sun god ... These people were all strong and outstanding people without exception. However, now, all parties were thinking about neo martial. Most of them did not think highly of neo martial, but thought highly of the Crimson Moon world.After all, it was a powerful world guarded by an eighth rank venerable sovereign!But ... Could he really win?The group of crazy cultivators in neo martial arts, although they had not made any big movements in the past thousand years, were definitely not people to be bullied!

Chapter 2627 I Hope She's Fine (1)
In the tianfang region, many people were ready to divide up neo martial.Was he thinking too much?Why was no one willing to talk to neo martial?Did he not have the opportunity, or did he feel ... That it was unnecessary?At this moment, Kong Ji suddenly smiled. What does it have to do with me?I cultivate my Dao!As for the great world he was in, if it chose to join the red moon Alliance ...Some thoughts flashed in my heart. After a long time, I shook my head. I can't change anything. I once said that neo martial arts had a chance of winning, but if they don't believe me, what can I do?"Solitary nothingness, resurrect!"He mumbled to himself as he looked at the sky.Who could revive the great Dao universe of this world?Is the time of recovery my chance?"I don't want to be able to comprehend the fifth or sixth rank. I want ... The seventh rank!Was there hope for the Dao of nothingness to reach grade seven?I've already left the great world and the great path universe. Can the Dao of Nirvana revive me?Li Hao cultivates life and death. Can I comprehend some key points and combine life and death to perfect the Dao of nothingness?As for the Tianhe zone, he no longer cared about it.Since Li Hao had gone ... One venerable sovereign, two, or even more might die there.What does it have to do with me?……At the same time.The Tianhe zone.In a Palace.Several venerable sovereigns were conversing.The person above laughed loudly. His eyes were cold, but he was smiling."Fellow Daoist rising rainbow, you can stay in the Tianhe zone as long as you want! No matter how bold the neo martial Swordmaster is, he wouldn't dare to cause trouble in the tianfang world!""If they really come, we don't need to do anything. The few powerhouses of the sixth step won't let them be so presumptuous here! Besides, the cultivators of the yin-yang world are hated by everyone, but they don't dare to come here!"Below, the rainbow Rising venerable sovereign, who was slightly older, nodded slightly. He didn't care too much and said in a deep voice,""I've already sent a message to Yun Cang, but he hasn't come yet. As far as I know, a venerable sovereign has died near the southern realm gate recently ...""He must be an outsider," venerable Lord Tianhe said with a smile."Daoist yuncang has been returning to the Dragon field all this time!""That's hard to say ...""Daoist Tian He, can you check the list of venerable sovereigns in the southern realm gate ...""This ..."Supreme Emperor Tian He was in a difficult position. This was the exclusive right of the Dragon Temple.If he overstepped his boundaries, it would easily cause the other party's dissatisfaction.Of course ... It was not a big deal to just check the list as long as it did not involve any key points. He thought for a while and in order to win over this third level venerable sovereign, he finally smiled and said,""Alright, I'll ask Huilong temple to give me a list as soon as possible! Fellow Daoist rising rainbow, you can just wait patiently ... Fellow Daoist yuncang, you might have been delayed by something, or ... You might have just seen the Dao accumulation and are currently comprehending the Dao!" He laughed and said,"the opportunity has come, and it can't be stopped!." Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 "I hope so!"Shenghong nodded slightly and did not say anything else.A venerable sovereign had suddenly disappeared and he couldn't contact her. He was a little uneasy.In addition, a venerable sovereign had recently died ... Ever since the destruction of the world of Yunyang, he had been feeling a little nervous and uneasy. He would often think of the glory of that sword.One sword!A world Lord had fallen, and the world had shattered. How terrifying was this? Sword Saint!It had become his nightmare!Originally, he had wanted to join a few major forces and great worlds. He wouldn't have much status there, but it wouldn't be a bad idea to join the Hui long temple and the others. As they were discussing, the end result was ... The Dark World and the blissful world were destroyed!It really made one feel helpless!The two fifth level venerable sovereigns had become highly sought after, while he, a third level venerable sovereign, was no longer in high demand.Although the other party was also trying to rope him in ... At this moment, they were both offering conditions to the two rank five venerable sovereigns. The importance they attached to him had instantly dropped, and the conditions they offered were unacceptable to him.Although Tian He was only a fourth rank venerable sovereign, the treatment he was offering was really good.The Tianhe zone only had one middle-stage venerable sovereign.As for third level venerable sovereigns, they were blank.There was still one rank two and two rank one venerable sovereigns below. The rank three ones would almost never rely on a rank four venerable sovereign.Now that he was here, he would be the second-in-command of the Tianhe zone.With Yun Cang and two venerable sovereigns, it was not a weak force, and it could gain a firm foothold in the Tianhe zone.As for the Tianhe zone, with his addition, although it was not as good as the Dragon returning temple, it was still stronger than the other small and big zones.In addition, the other party had promised that he could use the land of Taoist connotation as he pleased ... This was an opportunity for him to advance.Tier 4 was indeed difficult ... But it didn't mean that there was no chance at all.The venerable sovereigns conversed for a while. Suddenly, venerable sovereign Tian He looked in one direction and frowned slightly. It seemed that a venerable sovereign had entered the realm.An idle venerable sovereign?It was better to return to the Dragon field than the Tianhe zone, but he couldn't manage all the venerable sovereigns. He sensed around and didn't care anymore. As long as they didn't cause trouble, he couldn't be bothered.Unless the other party came to the area where the Tianhe protectorate was located, they would not interfere with each other.In the region, there were no treasure lands or secret lands. The only place that existed was here, the only place with Taoist connotation.He just thought that he was passing by the venerable sovereigns. He might even go and take a look or say hello when he was not around.But today, with the rising rainbow here, he was no longer interested.Even if the person who came was a third stage venerable sovereign, he could not afford the price of a second third stage venerable sovereign.……At the same time.Li Hao returned to the Dragon field. At this moment, he seemed to have passed through a barrier that was not too strong and posed no hindrance to venerable sovereigns. He entered another small domain."Is this the Tianhe zone?"Li Hao murmured. He looked in a direction and frowned.It seemed like ... It was really near the governor's estate.This was not good news.This meant that both sides had come into contact. Furthermore, Shenghong had not left. Perhaps he had some thoughts of seeking refuge. To him, this time, he might not just be facing a third level venerable sovereign!"The result I don't want to see the most!"Li Hao exhaled. This was not the result he wanted to see."But now, for the sake of cultivation, for the sake of solving problems, for the sake of preventing future trouble ... Perhaps I should kill them all!Let's hope it works!"I also hope that the primal Chaos lightning tribulation isn't too powerful. I hope that it'll be able to cover both sides and have some effect. Otherwise, I'm afraid that it'll strike the two cats to death!"If that's the case, I'll be letting down the blood Emperor!Big cat, that Emperor Cang might turn me into dried fish!Today, Li Hao finally knew what dried fish was. It wasn't a good thing.

2628 Chapter 437
The Tianhe zone.Tianhe city.There were many cities in the tianfang world, but the cities with venerable sovereigns were the core of the entire domain. Cultivators and mortals almost all lived in these areas.As for the other regions ... They were actually very dangerous.The entire tianfang world was filled with cultivators.The energy here was so rich that even mortals could become cultivators after staying here for a while. The premise was that they had the ability to cross the void or an expert who could cross the chaos and bring them across the world.Countless cultivators were gathered in the huge city.Some were farming, some were working.The cultivators here were no different from mortals.In a world where venerable sovereigns existed, ordinary cultivators had almost no ability to turn the world upside down.​ At this moment, Li Hao was walking in Tianhe city.The guards at the gate didn't recognize Li Hao.Supreme Emperor Tian He had actually sensed Li Hao's presence ... But in order to receive the rank three Supreme Emperor, he did not show up even when Li Hao arrived, because Li Hao was only a rank one Supreme Emperor.The other party had actually sensed it, and Li Hao had not concealed his aura.As venerable sovereigns, there was no need to do this.He even wanted to give a heads up ... If the other party was willing to come and meet him, perhaps they could have a talk.However, at this moment, the other party did not seem to be willing to meet him, a level one venerable sovereign.On the other hand, the third level venerable sovereign's aura was with the other party. The other venerable sovereigns of the Tianhe zone were also there. There was a fourth level, a third level, a second level, and two first level venerable sovereigns.The five venerable sovereigns were all gathered there.Li Hao sensed for a while and came to a conclusion. The rising rainbow of the Yunyang realm had been waiting here all this time ... Perhaps he was not going to leave.Li Hao was not in a hurry.Instead, he sensed again. In the distance, where the venerable sovereigns were, there was a faint Taoist connotation. It was very faint, but it really existed. This was probably the place where the level six venerable sovereigns 'Taoist connotation was mentioned by the giant pincer.It was said that it was the place where a Water-type venerable sovereign cultivated.As a Water-type venerable sovereign, the sky River venerable sovereign was unwilling to leave this place, as the Taoist connotation here would be of some help to him.Li Hao continued forward.He walked towards the sky River Prefecture.……At the Tian He mansion. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Venerable sovereign Tian He was still chatting with Shenghong. At this moment, they were really having a good time. One wanted to join him, and the other wanted to win him over. If it wasn't for the fact that both sides wanted to save some face, they might have already hooked up.Even though rising rainbow had yet to make his stance clear, Tian He's eyes were already filled with joy.Success!As for the first level venerable sovereign ... He ignored him and was even a little impatient. This was the time for him to show his attitude. He had a good conversation with Shenghong, so he could just play with himself. What are you doing here?If Shenghong felt that he had neglected him, then he would be like a duck that had flown away.It was still rising rainbow. At this moment, he also sensed Li Hao's existence and smiled. In fact, he had sensed it for a long time, but he had not said anything. At this moment, he took the initiative to smile and say,""Fellow Daoist Tian He, it seems that a foreign fellow Daoist has arrived at the sky River Prefecture. Aren't you going to go and meet him?"He was at least a venerable sovereign!This was a little too disrespectful.Tian He smiled."Is that so? I had a good chat with fellow Daoist rising rainbow just now, and I didn't pay much attention to it ... I'm sorry to have embarrassed myself!"Then, he turned to look at the only second level venerable sovereign and said with a smile,""Daoist Yuji, since someone has come, please go and meet him and entertain him. Just say that I have something important to do and can't go!"Monarch Yu Ji quickly stood up and smiled.""Alright, I'll be right back. Let's have a good chat, fellow Daoist rainbow.""Okay!" Rising rainbow nodded.He could feel the importance of the Tianhe zone.Even if it was just for show, leaving a venerable sovereign alone was already giving him face. One must know that such a result was likely to offend a venerable sovereign.In particular, the other party was obviously coming for the Tianhe Prefecture.He didn't hide his aura either, which meant that the other party had the intention to visit.Of course, he didn't say anything since it was only a first level venerable sovereign.……At the Tian He mansion.At the main entrance.The two cultivators were in a difficult position. The person in front of them ... Seemed to be ... A venerable sovereign?However, there was no venerable sovereign in the mansion.This was actually inappropriate!It was actually very impolite for a venerable sovereign to come to the door without anyone to welcome him. The other party did not hide his whereabouts and identity. He had come openly.However, something went wrong in the Tianhe mansion today.Of course, the guard knew that it should be related to another venerable sovereign. Several venerable sovereigns had gone to accompany him in the mansion.Just as they were in a difficult position and were a little timid, fortunately, a life-saving voice rang out,""I've failed to welcome you! Yu Ji of the Tianhe zone greets fellow Daoist!"Li Hao looked into the mansion and smiled.""Return to the Dragon Temple, Haoyue!"Dragon Temple?Yuji was stunned. He knew all the venerable sovereigns of Hui long temple ...He suddenly thought of something. A few days ago, it seemed that the Hui long temple had recruited another first level venerable sovereign. So it was this person who had come.A first level venerable sovereign, and a newly recruited one at that.Yuji was slightly more at ease. Although Hui long temple was strong, this person was not a direct descendant of Hui long temple. He had just joined them, so his identity and status were nothing.Of course, he still had to keep up appearances. He immediately smiled and said,""Greetings, fellow Daoist Hao Yue!"

2629 Chapter 437
Soon, he stepped out.With a wave of his hand, he dismissed the guards around him. He looked at Li Hao and sized him up from the corner of his eye, then said with a smile,""We have been a little slow this time. It just so happens that the rainbow Rising Emperor of the Yunyang realm is here as a guest ... In order to entertain him, fellow Daoist Tian He and I did not release our spiritual senses to sense our surroundings. Thus, we did not notice your arrival.""Fellow Daoist Hao Yue, are you just passing by the Tianhe zone, or ...""Rainbow Rising venerable sovereign is here?"Li Hao didn't rush to say anything, but asked a question instead.Yu Ji nodded with a gentle smile."That's right. That's why the Tianhe zone is entertaining you. If you don't mind, you can come in for a while."What he meant was that they were entertaining third level venerable sovereigns, and you were returning to the Dragon Temple. Go as far as you could, we still had things to do.If you're sensible, you can go on your own.If there's anything, come again next time.Of course, he didn't have to say it so directly."I'm here to look for Rainbow Rising venerable sovereign,"Li Hao said slowly after some thought.The other party was startled?Why?Li Hao continued,"it's said that the Yunyang realm was destroyed by the neo martial Swordmaster from the yin-yang world!" The Yunyang realm also has a venerable sovereign who was killed in the return Dragon field after provoking an expert ... So, I wanted to inform Rainbow Rising venerable sovereign. "Yuji was stunned again. Killed?How was that possible?Could it be ... No way!There was news that a venerable sovereign had died. Was it Yun Cang?If that was the case ... It would be a little troublesome.He had thought that Li Hao had returned to the Dragon Temple as a representative. Now that he heard that it was a serious matter, his expression changed slightly, and he quickly said,""Fellow Daoist, please follow me!"Li Hao nodded slightly.It would be best if he could trick Shenghong away.Unless it's absolutely necessary ... I, Li Hao, have no interest in dealing with these people. Otherwise, there are five venerable sovereigns here. If I kill one, I'll have to kill two ... If I kill two, I'll have to cut the weeds and eliminate the roots!Being able to trick Shenghong away was the best outcome.……In the huge Hall.Tian He and the others all sensed that Yu Ji had brought a newcomer. Tian He frowned slightly, but his brows quickly relaxed."Maybe something happened. Otherwise, Yuji wouldn't have brought people over. I'm really sorry for treating brother Shenghong so slowly!"At this moment, the friendship between the two sides had deepened again, from fellow Daoist to brother.Sheng Hong smiled."It's fine. We have important things to do. The Tianhe zone's business is the same as mine."The moment he said that, both sides looked at each other and smiled.This was good!Soon, Yuji entered with another person. They all looked at the venerable sovereign, and they all became slightly solemn. It didn't seem ... Simple!He had an extraordinary temperament.To Tian He, it was as if he was looking at another Kong Ji ... He had seen Kong Ji from the Huilong temple before. Although they were both at the same level, the feeling that he gave him was not good. He was very arrogant.There was always a feeling of indifference.It was as if he was telling everyone that he was different from her. This kind of temperament was not likable to many people.There was no sense of intimacy.It was the same for Li Hao. Tian He didn't like Li Hao at all. A first level venerable sovereign should at least give a flattering smile when meeting a fourth level venerable sovereign, even if he didn't bow.In the end, he didn 't.He didn't show it. At this moment, when the other party entered the hall, he directly said,""Yuji, what's the situation with this fellow Daoist?"Yuji was in a difficult position. She didn't say anything, but looked at Li Hao.Li Hao didn't mind. He said,""It's like this. Yun Cang from the Yunyang realm was killed in the Dragon field. I know that the rainbow Rising venerable sovereign is here, so I came to inform you!""What?"At this moment, the smile on the rainbow Rising venerable sovereign's face turned into a cold and stern expression. A wave of murderous intent rushed toward Li Hao. He was somewhat angry."What did you just say?""Supreme Emperor Yun Cang has been killed!" Li Hao said.Before Shenghong could speak, Tian He suddenly shouted angrily,""Who is so bold? Impudent! How dare you kill a venerable sovereign of the Tianhe zone!"Suddenly knowing that Yun Cang was dead, he was also shocked.He was also worried that there would be problems with the agreement that they had just reached. He hurriedly expressed his stance. He had to stabilize Shenghong first and show himself. As for Yun Cang's death ... He was a first level venerable sovereign, so what if he died?Li Hao slightly frowned.Before Shenghong could speak, this ...p From the looks of it, they had really hooked up."I'm not sure who it is," Li Hao said again."I heard that it might be related to the neo martial world!"Li Hao's tone was calm."The first reason I'm here is to pass on a message. The second reason is to bring some news from various parties, including ... Neo martial has given an order not to take in the remnants of neo martial's enemies!"He looked at venerable sovereign Tian He."The Tianhe zone. Are you trying to take in venerable sovereign Sheng Hong? are you going to be an enemy of new martial arts?"Tian He was shocked at first, but in the next moment, he suddenly came back to his senses and snorted coldly."Who are you? "Rising rainbow is already in an alliance with me. Although neo martial is strong ... So what? This was the Grand world of tianfang, neo martial? What are you?" Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 He was almost frightened for a moment, but he quickly regained his senses. This was the tianfang world, not neo martial. What was there to be afraid of?What a joke!The venerable sovereigns of The Dark World and the Elysian world were all there, and everyone was trying to win them over. No one was afraid.This guy was actually trying to scare him.Who was this person?"This is Supreme Emperor Hao Yue, from the Dragon-returning temple!" Yuji said hurriedly.
