Silver City.In the sky above the city, Li Hao was reading and cultivating. He was also opening his apertures. One, two, three ...The power of great DAOs surged, and a portion of them was also extracted.Of course, Zheng Yu still kept his promise and gave Li Hao an energy stone.It wasn't that he wanted to help the enemy ... But that Li Hao wanted to help the enemy himself.When new DAOs appeared, energy stones were inferior to the power of great DAOs.Energy stones were beneficial for opening apertures, but their effects were indeed inferior to the power of a great Dao. On Li Hao's side, he only absorbed a few energy stones every day, and the rest was taken away by someone every day. Zheng Yu had also arranged for someone to investigate ... He had really taken them away to pay his salary!This scene was unbelievable to anyone.Li Hao had come to negotiate with his greatest enemy, provided the enemy with the power of the great Dao, exchanged some money, and used it to pay his salary ... What was this guy thinking?It was very inexplicable!On the third day.Li Hao, who had been silent all this time, suddenly closed the book and said slowly,""Zheng Yu, are you willing to exchange ideas about the great Dao with me?""What?"Zheng Yu, who had always thought himself to be broad-minded and extremely talented, was really stunned at this moment.Li Hao didn't mind. He said,""Is Ying Hongyue still here? "If you're here, you can also participate. Although our three sides have deep blood feuds, we don't have any grudges against the great Dao. If we explore the great Dao, whether it's a new Dao, an old Dao, or a cultivation Dao, in the end, all DAOs will return to one!""I have a deep understanding of the new Dao, but I have almost no understanding of the great Dao of origins. I don't have much feeling about the Dao of beginner martial arts either ... Zheng Yu, you're a half-step sovereign, so you must know the charm of great Dao. Are you interested?"Dao discussion?Everyone was shocked!At this moment, who would dare to believe it?Ying Hongyue had always been calm and graceful, but today, she scratched her head and felt that she was completely dumbfounded. She couldn't understand what Li Hao was thinking.Was the great Dao heartless?Or Taishang Wangqing?Ever since his master's death, Li Hao no longer had any feelings. Was the Dao the only thing in his heart?Li Hao, on the other hand, wanted to use his knowledge of the new Dao as the price to discuss the old Dao with them!This person's attitude of not putting the world in his eyes caused Zheng Yu's heart to move slightly. After a long time, an illusionary figure appeared and stood proudly in the air. He said indifferently,"You want to discuss the Dao?""Yes,""Sure, but ... What can you say? What are you willing to say?" "There's nothing you can't say to others!"Zheng Yu raised his brows slightly. At this moment, Ying Hongyue also appeared directly. She was at ease and at ease, and her smile was gentle."Li Hao, are you really willing to say anything?""Naturally,""You have a scheme?" "This is not Dao."Ying Hongyue was speechless.Li Hao said,"we don't trust each other. It's too difficult to discuss the Dao. If we explain the great Dao to each other, we'll definitely feel that we're at a disadvantage. Why don't we ask each other questions?" Each of us will ask a question. If you can't answer it three times in a row ... You can quit. We only discuss Dao with those who are more knowledgeable!"The two of them were interested.At this moment, in the ruins, the Queen seemed to be a little anxious because outsiders probably couldn't hear what they were saying. She said anxiously,""I ..." p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "You can 't!"Li Hao said calmly,"what do you know?" You don't know anything! Gods are born with DAOs, but they don't sense DAOs, don't cultivate DAOs, and just rely on their old capital. You don't have the qualifications. "The Queen was furious!This was an extreme mockery and humiliation!Li Hao ignored her. The power of his great Dao spread in all directions. For a moment, it seemed that there were only the three of them in the world.Li Hao looked at the two of them.Ying Hongyue and Zheng Yu looked at each other. At this moment, they were both in disbelief.Li Hao was the enemy they were determined to kill.The point was that this guy was the cultivator who had explored the new Dao the most and the most in-depth one. He could even be considered the founder of the new Dao. This man ... Was willing to share the new Dao with them?With an attitude of giving it a try, Zheng Yu spoke first,""New Dao and new martial arts can be cultivated?""Sure!"Li Hao said softly,"your question is too simple. I won't take advantage of you. Let's talk about how neo martial artists cultivate the new Dao. Neo martial arts are divided into beginner martial arts and origin martial arts. Beginner martial arts have no Dao to speak of. You can directly cultivate the new Dao by transforming your body and reconstructing your Dao meridians! There were two types of origins. The first was to start from the beginning and reconstruct his body and Dao meridians from scratch! Second, the transplantation of the great Dao of origin can penetrate the bright star Universe and rebuild the Natal star. The starting point of strength is very high, but the difficulty is greater!"Zheng Yu's eyes flickered.He did not ask any more questions.At this moment, Ying Hongyue's heart was moved. She opened her mouth and said,"The new Dao Natal stars are all in the great Dao universe. How do you distinguish them?""There are countless stars of the great Dao, and it's difficult to distinguish them ... If I were to enter the universe, I would be able to sense them! Other than that, if others want to distinguish it, they can only judge it by its strength, luster, and attributes. "At this point, Li Hao frowned."Your questions ... Don't count!" He said.Then, he ignored her and said,""You all owe me a question!""Legend has it that the venerable sovereign's Dao is a fusion of great DAOs. Even if one loses their source, they can still maintain their original power without any additional support ..."Zheng Yu was just about to nod when Li Hao asked,""How do I merge them?"“……”艹!Zheng Yu cursed in his heart!I thought you were asking for the truth, but you're asking me how to merge them?He frowned and suddenly felt that his question was not worth it.

If he had known, he wouldn't have asked.After thinking for a while, Zheng Yu said,"the universe of origin is also densely covered with stars. The neo martial human race has the Sanjiao gate and the bridge between heaven and earth. Finally, they start from rank-9 and walk on the great Dao of origin. They break the three gates, control the stars, and absorb the stars into their bodies. They become venerable sovereigns! When the stars enter the body, it means fusion. You have to break the three gates and see the stars!"Breaking the three gates to see the stars, and the stars entering the body?The stars ... Were actually the manifestation of Dao.It was the same for Xindao.There were some differences between the great Dao of origin and the great Dao of luminous star. The biggest difference was that there was only one star of the great Dao of origin, and he had to continuously expand it.And there were countless new DAOs.And he had more than one Natal star.There were similarities between the two, but there were also some differences.Devouring stars into the body was a venerable sovereign.Li Hao fell into deep thought. Could the stars in the universe of the great path swallow stars into the body?However ... The stars were the Dao meridian stars in his body.That's why the Dao was in his body from the beginning.Return to true?Li Hao pondered for a while and looked at Ying Hongyue."The Silver Moon Martial Master focuses on momentum! Some people say that force is the connection between man and Dao. Do you have any thoughts?"Ying Hongyue raised her eyebrows slightly.Momentum!He was also a Silver Moon Martial Master, and one of the 36 heroes of the Silver Moon clan. Back in the day, he was one of the top-ranked martial masters.Li Hao didn't ask anything else, but about force.He considered for a moment and said slowly,"force ... In my opinion, it's a manifestation of will!" "Dao is ethereal and traceless, and so is momentum. Momentum and Dao, in my opinion, are actually one! Whether it was the origin Dao or the new Dao, as long as the power existed, the Dao would exist! Even if the new Dao disappeared and a new Dao appeared, Shi could still merge with the Dao! It can even ... Connect to the Dao of the Crimson Moon!"He looked at Li Hao and said,"force is a special product of the disappearance of the great Dao. Perhaps only the Silvermoon humans can cultivate it. Or rather, only in this era can it be cultivated!" In any universe, any world, or force, it can be connected to the new Dao as an intermediate product. "Li Hao's eyes flickered.He still wanted to ask, but after thinking about it, he stopped and looked at him. "You're asking me,""Apart from you, can anyone else enter the great Dao universe?" Ying Hongyue asked bluntly.Li Hao frowned and glanced at him,"you're asking questions that have nothing to do with Dao!" Forget it, it's up to you. You're too utilitarian ..."Ying Hongyue was speechless.He had actually been taught a lesson by Li Hao, who said that he was too utilitarian. What a ridiculous fellow."Sure!" Li Hao nodded."It's not difficult for me to enter the bright star sector. But for outsiders, it'll be very difficult!" I was the first person to enter, or rather, the first new Dao cultivator to integrate the system. Heaven and earth formed a character of their own, which was actually the key to my entry into the luminous Star Universe ..."He displayed the Dao text. In an instant, their auras fluctuated for a moment, and the next moment, the Dao text disappeared. Li Hao slowly said,""Don't even think about snatching it. It's useless. It's the key to enter in my hands. You'll be useless if you take it away." p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  After that, he stopped talking.Ying Hongyue was a little angry and looked at Zheng Yu. Zheng Yu instantly spoke,"Then how do outsiders enter?"Li Hao laughed, you want to enter the Dao universe to kill me? You're so eager?"The two of them remained silent.He only looked at Li Hao and thought,"it's good that you know."Do you dare to answer?"First," Li Hao said after some consideration,"you can tear apart the great Dao universe with your unparalleled strength ... There's hope for venerable sovereigns. You two ... Go to sleep!""Second, locate your Natal star. As long as your cultivation in the new Dao is profound, you can sense it. Right now, as long as you penetrate the universe, you can also enter ... But it's easy to get lost. You need a divine weapon related to your life as a guide and an object to locate the outside world. Only then will you have a chance of returning. Otherwise, once you enter, you won't be able to come out.""Third, obtain enough blessings from heaven's will!"Their expressions changed slightly. Li Hao said,""Or perhaps it's not a blessing from heaven, but a blessing from the gods ...""What?"Zheng Yu and Li Hao were stunned. Li Hao smiled and said,""That's also a problem! Godly spirits were born and nurtured. They were a direct embodiment of the great Dao and could even be considered the children of the great Dao. If a godly spirit had a deep enough understanding of the great Dao, it could even lead some people into the great Dao universe! It's just that ... Almost all of the gods have fallen, and her Majesty ... Is only the second moon Goddess. She doesn't have a deep understanding of the great Dao and is an idiot at cultivation. She has only absorbed some of the blessings of her predecessors, but in reality, she doesn't have much of an understanding of the great Dao. You guys probably have no chance. "The two of them pondered whether Li Hao was telling the truth. Really?Would it work?He didn't know!Li Hao might not be telling the truth, but he couldn't lie about everything."Is there a shortcut to comprehending the great Dao of origins after you reach rank-9 in your neo martial arts?" Li Hao asked.“……”Zheng Yu frowned. Do you really want to cultivate the great Dao of origins?"Don't you know this after you've subdued heaven battling city?"Li Hao shook his head."It's not that I don't know. It's just that some of the methods they mentioned can't be used now." "Because my essence has been isolated, I want to ask if there is any shortcut right now. Otherwise, I will only cultivate my body, blood, and mind, not my essence!""Simply put," Li Hao said,"is there any way for me to connect to the origin of neo martial arts again?"Zheng Yu frowned.He looked at Li Hao again and fell silent.

2182 Chapter 367
Li Hao smiled and said,"can't I?" If you can 't, how did you cultivate to the level of a pseudo-Emperor? how did your pure physical body, blood essence, and spiritual power reach this level? He's at the limits of a Saint, not a half-Emperor, not even a Heavenly King. "Zheng Yu kept frowning.After a long time, he spoke."You want to know? sure. But I need to ask you a few more questions. Otherwise ... It's not worth it!""Sure!"Li Hao nodded. Zheng Yu pondered for a while and decided that it was fine to tell Li Hao. If Li Hao really wanted to cultivate the great Dao of the origin of neo martial arts ... That would be a good thing. There was no way for him to continue on this path!Even if it entered the origin, he would not be able to continue cultivating.He could not absorb the power of the origin.Thinking of this, he was in no hurry to ask Li Hao. Instead, he said,""There are a few ways. First, directly invade the great Dao of origin of the neo martial cultivators! Their great Dao of origins still existed, and they could not be broken or invaded! In fact, heaven battling city should know that in the early stage of neo martial, there are many people who try to seize the Dao, and they use this method. ""The second is to go to the ends of the world ... Although the Silver Moon world has been sealed and the Stargate is the entrance, there are still some gaps at the ends of the world that connect to the outside of the universe!""The universe of origin still exists outside of the Silvermoon world ... It's just that it's very difficult to absorb much origin power, but you can barely sense a little bit of the great Dao of origin ... If you have the ability, you can also connect with the great Dao of origin in these places, but the price you have to pay is ten times or even a hundred times higher than the new Dao!"It was not worth it at all.He couldn't wait for Li Hao to give it a try. A guy who had mastered a new Dao universe actually wanted to cultivate an origin great Dao ... Sure, go ahead.With this time, you can open many Dao meridians for your new Dao.Li Hao fell into deep thought, but he was overjoyed.What he wanted was not a way to connect to the great Dao of origin, but a way to turn neo martial combat techniques into divine text. Divine text ... To comprehend power and turn power into divine text, the great Dao of origin seemed to be simpler and easier.This was because it was relatively easier for a Silver Moon Martial Master who cultivated a neo martial technique to comprehend force.This could disappear from the universe of origin and be difficult to come into contact with. In desperation, it was a product of compromise.If he cultivated the neo martial arts and tried to connect with the origin path, there was a high chance of failure ... But failure was a good thing, because it might give birth to momentum.He finally asked the key question!Li Hao quickly looked at Ying Hongyue and asked,"Can 't' momentum 'transform into multiple' momentum? I see that you have eight meridians and eight 'momentum', and the eight meridians have merged into one. It's somewhat similar to the 'momentum of five birds' of my five birds sect ... But it's also somewhat similar to martial uncle Hong 's' one sword transforms into ten thousand 'momentum ... How did you manage to cut' momentum ',' merge 'momentum', and also be able to have different attributes?"Ying Hongyue frowned again and didn't say anything.He didn't want to answer."If you're willing to answer," Li Hao said,"I'll tell you a secret. I'll also tell Zheng Yu at the same time. Consider it my answer to the question just now."The two of them were stunned. What secret was it that Li Hao had to ask two questions? Ying Hongyue hesitated for a moment before saying,"What if we don't acknowledge your secret?""As long as you're not deliberately looking for trouble, you can ask me again."Hearing him say this, Ying Hongyue nodded."Alright, it's actually not difficult. Eight meridians and eight cultivators!""What?" Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ "One line of cultivation, haven't you tried it before?"Ying Hongyue said bluntly,"eight types of bloodlines, eight types of Dao meridians, and cultivating the same cultivation technique!" "Eight meridians cultivated together, eight meridians comprehended together, eight meridians cultivated one kind of power. Once the divine power Meridian is cultivated, it will be a power of different elements ..."Li Hao was stunned. Practice the same cultivation technique?Previously, he had used the divine text to train on his own. However, in order to match his attributes, he had cultivated different techniques.However, at this moment, Ying Hongyue was saying that she was cultivating a cultivation technique.Divine power Dao meridians had different attributes to begin with. If he succeeded, he would have eight different types of power.This ... Was another variant of the five birds technique?The five birds technique was also a cultivation technique, but it could cultivate five types of forces.Li Hao was a little moved and regretful.""I see ... If I'd known earlier, I wouldn't have asked. It's a pity that my teacher left. Otherwise, if I asked such a question, my teacher would beat me. He didn't expect me to even ask such a question. Isn't this the eight birds technique?"Ying Hongyue didn't say anything.It was indeed so.This was a variant of the five birds technique. What he cultivated was actually based on the five birds technique spread by Yuan Shuo, with some adjustments made. If Yuan Shuo was here, he would probably really attack Li Hao.You've forgotten about our own abilities!Li Hao sighed."As expected ... You're all useless cultivators. If I were here, these problems wouldn't even be worth mentioning! It's a pity that I've also forgotten all of this. Compared to my cultivation talent, I'm not as good as teacher. "The two of them were silent. After Yuan Shuo's death, Li Hao had been sighing. This guy wouldn't go crazy at any time, would he?He laughed at himself and said,"alright, I was the one who brought up the sparring. I'll tell you a secret!" The human body had more than one side! The universe of the great path has more than one side!"p "I rarely set foot in the spiritual level to investigate because my spiritual power is not strong! I've almost never opened the Dao Meridian in my mind ... However, according to my deduction, there may be two sides to the Dao universe!""On one side, there are attribute-less Dao meridian stars, divine power Dao meridian stars, and on the other side, there are spiritual Dao meridian stars!"

Li Hao continued, one side is real, the other side is fake! I control the corporeal Meridian universe. The other side of the universe should be the void Meridian great Dao universe!"Li Hao thought for a while and said,"the universe of the great path has a Center. This Center is not the center on the surface, but the center of the virtual universe. Right now, I only control the real pulse universe and the virtual pulse universe. I wonder if there's anyone who can control them."The two of them were stunned!True meridians?Void Meridian?One was physical, while the other was spiritual.Is that true?They naturally didn't know as much about the great Dao universe as Li Hao did, but Li Hao's words still stunned them.How was that possible?This meant that ... The Dao universe might give birth to two masters?Then ... Didn't that mean that as long as the void Meridian and the spiritual Dao Meridian were opened, everyone would have a chance?At this moment, even Zheng Yu, who was a half-step sovereign, found it unbelievable. Why would Li Hao tell them such a huge secret?  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  It was impossible!It must be fake, a trap!Ying Hongyue's expression was also constantly changing. Fake ... Would Li Hao tell such a secret to others?Who would believe that!Li Hao said softly,"it's very dangerous. I've only found one spiritual Dao Meridian so far. If I want to open a void Meridian universe, I'll need at least more. Let me think ... I don't have much hope without more than ten!""If you drive the wrong car or drive recklessly, you'll die ... I hope you'll try it. It'll serve as a lesson for me. I'm happy to see you drive yourself to death!""In addition, I suspect that someone has opened an empty Meridian universe!"Zheng Yu's expression changed slightly,'impossible! If you haven't opened it, who would open the void Meridian universe?"Although Li Hao's words might not be true, how could he open a void Meridian universe when he didn't even know about void meridians?Li Hao thought for a while and said, it's not an baseless guess! I thought you guys opened it in secret, so I told you. Am I wrong?" He frowned and thought,'for example, the Prophet God's Dao Meridian is actually a kind of void Meridian! A Dao Meridian on the spiritual level has been activated ... I haven't been able to find his Natal star! I thought it was because I couldn't find it. The universe is so big, it's normal to not be able to find a star!""But ..."Li Hao shook his head."I'll find out soon enough. It's not that I can't find it. It's just that the opponent's Natal star isn't on my side!" Last time, you guys tried to resurrect this guy, but you didn't succeed, right?"Ying Hongyue nodded. She and the Queen had been trying to resurrect this God, but they had indeed failed. They thought that Li Hao had completely killed him, which led to this.Li Hao continued, I'm actually happy to see you resurrect him! "In fact, I can't wait for you to try. Perhaps I can lock onto his location ... In the end, when you tried to call and resurrect him with the power of belief, I discovered a problem ... The consumed power of belief didn't enter the great Dao universe! Or rather, he didn't enter my side of the great Dao universe!"Li Hao said softly, at that moment, I had a guess ... This person's Natal star is not under my jurisdiction! It's not even in my side of the Dao universe. It has entered another side of the Dao universe!""He's not the only one!"Li Hao continued,'some people are the same, such as BA Dao, who cultivates spiritual power and spiritual saber! However, in the Dao universe, I found the corresponding Natal stars of other people but not BA Dao 's. This is very strange. Everyone is here, so why isn't he here?" "Also, I don't know if you still remember a few of the gods, the God of misfortune, the God of fate ... These few have not completely fallen! That day, I killed a large number of godly spirits, and many of them could be seen at a glance, including the sun god and the dark god at the Saint level. However, these godly spirits with special systems were not killed directly!"“……”The two's expressions changed.At this moment, they all recalled it.When deities died, the world changed colors. Some of them knew which deities had died, and those whose Natal stars had been destroyed by Li Hao.And it seemed that the few people Li Hao had mentioned were not completely dead.The Dao meridians with special properties and were related to the spiritual level ... Had not been discovered.One was an exception, two was a coincidence, three or four ... Was that still a coincidence?At this moment, the two of them actually believed it.Unless Li Hao had set up a big plan and deliberately did this from the moment he killed the gods, this would not happen.After saying that, Li Hao continued, if my speculation is true, it means that the universe of the great path has two sides. You don't have any doubts about this, right? Even my teacher and I have only discovered a large number of physical Dao meridians. Who could have discovered a large number of virtual Dao meridians? Unless this person had a deep understanding of the new Dao and his research on the spiritual level had reached a limit and an unbelievable level! "Moreover, I've also come into contact with some spiritual-level deities ... I've thought about it ... Only the moon goddesses have such a possibility! Do you think that the moon goddesses have secretly controlled another side of the universe?"He looked at the two of them and said,'why don't the two of you go back and capture the Queen? we might be able to find something!' Perhaps, both of you are smart enough to see if you can find any clues and take her down ..."The two of them ignored him.

However, he really kept this matter in mind.If the void universe of the great path really existed, and if someone really controlled it, who would it be?If no one was in charge ... Did it mean that they had a chance?This required a strong spiritual energy ... Zheng Yu's spiritual energy was strong enough, but he was a pseudo-Emperor!Ying Hongyue was actually not weak either.The two of them fell into deep thought. Li Hao smiled and said,""This secret should be enough to answer my previous question, right?"The two of them nodded and did not say no.Whether it was true or not, it was still a possibility.Li Hao laughed again."Also, if you two have really discovered the location of some spiritual Dao meridians, you can exchange them for the location of some physical Dao meridians. We can communicate with each other to perfect our new Dao!" Only when one's Dao was perfected could one cultivate. It was very difficult to expect a person to perfect their Dao! Besides, if the physical Dao Meridian was a sword, was the spiritual Dao Meridian also a sword? Or was it something else? "This point can be used as a reference for the two of you. In any case, your spiritual power is strong, and you won't die if you try a few more times ...""Li Hao!"At this moment, Ying Hongyue had a complicated expression on her face."Regardless of whether what you said is true or not ... You've made us waver. I've watched you grow up, and I've studied the eight great families for many years, but now it seems that I can't see through you."Li Hao chuckled, it's an honor to be watched by the enemy who destroyed my family! Ying Hongyue, when I kill you, I'll fulfill one of your wishes ... I'll let the eight great families "bloodline completely merge with yours! If you die, I'll fulfill your wish. I'll use my blood to fuse with you bit by bit, devour you, fuse with you, and crush you into minced meat and blood, okay?" “……”Ying Hongyue glanced at him and instantly disappeared.At this moment, Li Hao's words were casual, but the pressure he felt instantly skyrocketed. It was more serious than ever, and he even felt the aura of death and destruction.This fellow ... Could really do it!Even Zheng Yu slightly raised his eyebrows. He glanced at Li Hao and instantly disappeared.The calmer this guy was, the more they feared him.Even a pseudo-Emperor felt that Li Hao would explode at any time like a bomb. Such a fellow had to be killed as soon as possible. No one would feel at ease if he wasn't killed."He runs really fast!"Li Hao laughed. I'm serious.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  Not only was this sentence serious, but the words before that were also serious.Also, li daoheng ... If my guess is true, could you have already grasped the void Dao universe?If we're in the same universe, why didn't I sense it at all?Although it was only a guess, Li Hao felt that what he said made sense.Actually, there was very little research on the spiritual Dao Meridian.However, if someone like li daoheng had paid attention to them earlier, he might have known that the Prophet God and the others were special. Since the truth universe was controlled by Li Hao, would he continue to venture deeper into the truth universe with his style of not willing to be inferior to others? "The Prophet God has never been resurrected ... Is there really no way to resurrect him, or ... Are you not going to resurrect him? Because his resurrection might expose many things. "Zheng Yu, you can try.If he told Zheng Yu directly, Zheng Yu might not believe him. Moreover, it would also ruin li daoheng's plan. At that time, Li Hao would be the one in trouble.But now, it was only a reasonable guess ... If Zheng Yu was interested, perhaps ... Something interesting would happen.Li Hao continued his training.He wanted to cultivate many cultivation techniques to the extreme. At this moment, he was no longer cultivating random cultivation techniques. Instead, he was trying to cultivate every Dao Meridian, be it a divine power Dao Meridian or an attribute-less Dao Meridian.Next, he wanted to head to the edge of the great wilderness and try to connect with the great Dao of origins. If he failed, he might be able to create a special product, Shi!It didn't matter if he didn't have a teacher to guide him. He could still guide his enemies.As long as the benefits were enough, the enemy would also become your nourishment.……Li Hao, on the other hand, cultivated in peace.At this moment, Ying Hongyue and the others could no longer sit still.After returning to Hurricane city, Ying Hongyue looked at the Queen a few more times. The Queen's brows were furrowed. Ying Hongyue hesitated for a moment, but still asked, "I've always been curious about one thing. Is the Silver Moon's power a spiritual-level power or an elemental power?""What do you mean?"Ying Hongyue saw that she was on guard and could only say,"Is your mental power strong enough?""Hmph!"Ying Hongyue was helpless. It seemed that he was just ordinary.In that case, this person was not considered a spiritual-rank cultivator."I've been failing to resurrect the Prophet God all this time. Perhaps we're not strong enough ... Why don't we ask Lord Zheng for help? we can try it with the power of a half-step sovereign. Not only him, but I know that fate, misfortune, and the other godly spirits haven't completely fallen. How about we try to resurrect them?"The queen's heart moved. So kind?"This ...""If he's resurrected, we'll have more coordinates in the Dao universe. It'll be easier to deal with Li Hao ..."The Queen thought about it. It was not a loss for her, but was Zheng Yu willing to do it?Just as he was thinking, Zheng Yu's voice came,""If you need any resources, just name them! The enemy of my enemy is my friend! If you need my help, just ask!"As soon as he said this, the Queen felt even more strange. So kind?After some consideration, he nodded and agreed. However, his previous failure might have been due to the insufficient power of faith, vitality, and great Dao! Gods can resurrect infinitely as long as the great Dao is not destroyed ..."

Since the two of them were in a hurry to help, she didn't mind using their hands to resurrect the God.Soon, she made many requests.As for Zheng Yu, he did not say anything and fulfilled all his requests!Even when the other party needed the power of belief, Zheng Yu didn't say much. He immediately sent a large number of Saints out of Hurricane city to escort them to the West to absorb the power of belief. Even ... His clone went out again.He would follow them to the West and try to resurrect the gods.……In the Western Region.Altars were raised one after another. This time, Li Hao did not cause any damage, and no one else did either. There were sufficient resources, such as a massive amount of spring of life, energy stones, and all kinds of power of faith.Countless amounts of energy seeped into the void.A few statues were standing on the altar.However ... With the disappearance of countless energies, the few gods had not been resurrected for a long time. This made the Queen anxious and depressed. Why couldn't they be resurrected?When a God fell, as long as they did not die completely, they should be able to be resurrected.But ... He couldn 't!A large amount of energy seemed to have disappeared into thin air.​ ……Silver City.Zheng Yu's main body was still there, and he had been observing Li Hao all this time. Li Hao was still cultivating on his own, not causing any trouble or doing anything in secret.However, at this moment ... Over there, the gods had yet to be resurrected.He could feel the disappearance of countless energies, as if they had disappeared into thin air.At that moment, Zheng Yu's expression changed slightly.Why was it like this?He knew very well that the gods could be resurrected.This meant that ... The other party's Natal star might really be in another Dao universe, and there might be a controller on that Dao universe!It was the same as Li Hao!"Damn it!"Zheng Yu's expression changed. The unknown was the scariest.Did such a person really exist?Perhaps ... There was!……At the same time.On the moon.The temple stood still."They want to resurrect the Prophet God and the others ..." The female voice said."What should we do?"In the Shen Hall, the xiuzhe with the long sword looked down silently. His expression was calm. After a long time, he said,"This ... Seems interesting!""What?" The sword-bearing man chuckled and said playfully,""Li Hao easily discovered that they resurrected those gods. In the end, Li Hao didn't care, Zheng Yu didn't care, and Ying Hongyue was also busy ... It was as if they had reached an agreement ..."After a long time, he smiled again."Did Li Hao ... Deduce something?""He's an interesting person! The surname Li is indeed not bad ... Since ancient times, there have been the most powerhouses with the surname Li. Neo martial arts 'heavenly suppression King, nether King, venerable sword ... Since the surname was spread, the Li surname is the most common among venerable sovereigns. "Yueshen didn't seem to expect him to say this. After a while, she said,""What I want to ask is how we should deal with it. Should we allow them to recover, or ... Continue suppressing them?" Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Who asked you what happened to li?"What do you think?"Yueshen was slightly stunned. After a long while, she said,""Revive! "Now, the second generation is too weak. Not only that, but she's also trapped in Hurricane city with no one to help her. The will of heaven has left, allowing the Prophet, misfortune, fate, and disaster to recover to the level of Saints. With these few here, they can help her. She's too young and has too little experience. There's no way she can resist those people."The sword-bearing man was silent for a moment before nodding his head lightly."Then do as you wish. It's fine as long as they forget everything. It's normal for them to regain consciousness and forget some things.""Yes."Soon, the power of the great Dao was faintly visible, and the moon seemed to be a little illusory.A few huge stars were shining.At this moment, the Queen was overjoyed and excited.""It's starting, they can be resurrected!"It began!The four statues flickered with light. Fate, misfortune, calamity, and the Prophet were all about to be resurrected!Ying Hongyue's expression changed slightly, and Zheng Yu's clone also raised his head to look at the sky.He was resurrected!This time, they were a little confused. If he didn't resurrect, they were sure that there was something wrong. But now he resurrected ... Where did he resurrect?Zheng Yu kept searching for the place where the energy had disappeared.However, they would eventually lose contact.He had been paying attention to Li Hao all this time, but Li Hao had been cultivating himself. He didn't care about it at all. It was even more confusing now.Li Hao ... Was what he said about the virtual and real universes true?……At this moment, Li Hao also turned to look west. He also sensed something different.It was as if the gods had begun to awaken.Li Hao suddenly smiled and glanced at the Galaxy in the universe of the great path. There was nothing unusual, nothing unusual, and no star was shining at this moment.Judging from their auras, they might have even recovered to the Saint path.A divine path star was extremely eye-catching.But ... He didn't see a single one.Li Hao looked at the universe. Li Fuhai had said that he had found the center of the universe and that the center was where his Natal star was. Where was this Center?The void Dao universe should really exist."However, they shouldn't be as powerful as me. After all, there are only a few who cultivate the Dao of spirit. But ... Even if they aren't as powerful as my Dao universe, they are still very difficult to deal with. If they aren't in the same place, it's hard to kill them.On the other hand, the other party could invade the truth Dao universe at any time."Which star is Qian Wuliang's Natal star? Was it truth path or Phantom path? Or...........Reality and illusion?"

At this moment, he thought of someone. He didn't ask Qian Wuliang for details before because he didn't like to probe into other people's cultivation secrets unless they were willing to share it with the public. Qian Wuliang did share some of the Dao meridians that had some special effects, but none of them were as good as his.Was it because he didn't understand it himself, or ... Did he understand it but didn't dare to say it because he hadn't found his Natal star?If it really belonged to Phantom path, then Qian Wuliang and BA Dao might be controlled by someone else, and it would be the kind of control that even they themselves couldn't detect or even know.That was because they didn't have the power of the Crimson Moon. They could freely enter and exit the great path universe without being targeted."Does this count as ... Placing a piece next to me?" At this moment, Li Hao devoured the world like a whale and absorbed a large amount of origin power, all thanks to Zheng Yu. In an instant, he disappeared."I'll go to the four poles and try to cultivate the way of origin. Zheng Yu, stabilize the seal in case red Moon Emperor comes out!"Zheng Yu frowned slightly.What a bastard!In the past few days, with that fellow around, it had been inconvenient for him to do anything. Now that he was gone, he actually wanted him to stabilize the seal. The more he thought about it ... The angrier he got!'Also, several gods have awakened ...'In the West, the Queen didn't seem to want to come back anymore. The four deities had all recovered and had the power of saintly way. The five deities had reached the level of Saints. These guys probably didn't want to come back.Did Li Hao really go to cultivate the great Dao of origins?If that was the case ... It could only be said that this guy was a little obsessed.At this moment, Zheng Yu didn't say anything. He just returned to his own palace. The next moment, another Zheng Yu appeared in the palace. It was exactly the same, but the strength of his aura was different. This weak Zheng Yu was opening his aperture and stirring his mental energy.The two Zheng Yus looked at each other. Their minds were connected. One of them cultivated the origin while the other cultivated a new Dao.After a long time, origins Zheng Yu said softly: "do you think ... If the void Dao universe existed, who would cultivate it?"Zheng Yu, the new Dao, seemed to be thinking. After a long while, he said,""Could it be the Li family?""Li daoheng?""Maybe, maybe it's someone else ... I can't think of anyone else other than the Li family," The origins Zheng Yu nodded slightly, his eyes cold. After a long time, he said,""Ying Hongyue is still not strong enough. I'm afraid he can't go to the ruins in Saturn city to seize some things. Father's battle strength is not enough, and he needs to at least have the battle strength of a Heavenly King to merge his eight meridians ... But if he really becomes a Heavenly King, won't I be raising a Tiger and bringing trouble to myself?""You decide."The origins Zheng Yu sighed,'I make the decision? Aren't you me? I'm a bit confused about the new Dao and the origin. That Li Hao is also very interesting. I've felt something different in this trip to the silver Blizzard city. It's just the power of a Saint, but I feel pressured. Is it really so difficult to become a divine Emperor?""Be more confident ... Maybe someone is planning more! However, we still have the upper hand today ... Let's think of a way to upgrade Ying Hongyue. No matter how dangerous it is, she's not a venerable sovereign. If we can't even win against a villain from the new era ... Then we're really useless! He can't be more difficult to deal with than the venerable sovereigns!"  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  The origins Zheng Yu nodded and said,'that's true! Ying Hongyue didn't leave because she most likely had the same thought. Wait until I help him become stronger ... This person was also very interesting. He grew with the flow and was actually not abandoned by others. Everyone supported him according to the situation! I've failed to kill him several times, but he's become even stronger ... I might need him to deal with Li Hao. "New Dao Zheng Yu did not speak anymore. He closed his eyes and started cultivating.At this moment, origins Zheng Yu also closed his eyes and fell into deep thought.Li daoheng?No matter who it was, they had to try to find out.As for Li Hao, it might not be easy to cultivate the origin. Alright, let's do it.……At this moment, Li Hao had once again stepped into the great wilderness. He went deep into the great wilderness until he reached the limit.In this place, he actually felt a bit of weak Origin Energy.Li Hao was overjoyed!As for whether I can achieve Dao ... I hope I can 't. If I really do, I'll cry. It's just that I can't achieve 50%. If I fail, I'll turn into Shi, which is the result I need.Momentum was a product of a failed great Dao. It was extremely special. This place might be a treasure ground for him to turn the situation around.At this moment, Li Hao began his real training.This time, he was going to comprehend force!

2187 Chapter 368
Great wilderness, chaotic region.Li Hao started practicing.The five birds technique was the core of this exercise. Compared to Yuan Shuo's five birds technique, it was a little more different and had integrated some other inherited combat techniques.The five birds were the foundation and the ten thousand Arts were the auxiliary.Countless energy stones were burning. Li Hao stood in the chaos and used his Dao integration stage power to practice some cultivation techniques that could kill 10 or 100 martial masters.It ran and jumped like a wild beast.Myriad existences and myriad DAOs, myriad DAOs and myriad forces ...It was like a coiled Dragon or a snake, or a Phoenix spreading its wings.The Tiger came out of the cage and roared.At this moment, Li Hao was like a beginner in martial arts, seriously comprehending the force of heaven and earth and the force of martial arts.He had put aside his research on Shi for a long time.However, he wasn't unfamiliar with it. The five birds were the foundation and the key to comprehending force. The breathing technique that he hadn't used for a long time also began to tremble his body. Dao meridians appeared one after another, and a great force appeared."Roar!"Suddenly, Li Hao roared like a wild beast. A cheetah appeared in the air, and he pounced at the void with great speed and agility!The cheetah transformed into a great force, as if it wanted to connect with the origin. In the depths of chaos, the void trembled.At this moment, Li Hao's eyes flickered, as if he could see the void crack in the distance that connected to the chaos outside the Silver Moon. The universe of origin ... Was still there!It was really still there!It was still there, which meant that neo martial was still there and had not been destroyed.Although it was expected, this scene proved this point even more. New martial arts had not been destroyed. Of course, perhaps it was Hong Yue who seized new martial arts, but the great Dao of origin had not been destroyed.However, as long as the great Dao of origin was not destroyed, the neo martial artists would not be destroyed. The stars of origin of the neo martial artists were in the universe of origin. As long as the universe and the stars were not destroyed, the neo martial artists would naturally still exist.As expected!Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. At this moment, as he watched the leopard Force Sweep toward the depths of chaos, he was a little worried about whether it would connect to the great Dao of origins.The reason why he didn't face such trouble before was because he was weak.Secondly, it was very far from the edge of the world.At this moment, he could also practice from a distance, but this way, his comprehension of Shi would be much slower, and Li Hao would have to compete with some people for time.He was a little apprehensive.However, the facts proved that ... He was overthinking.When the cheetah's momentum was indomitable, as if it was going to break through the chaos and the universe to connect with the origin ... In the next moment, there was a loud rumble, and the world barrier shook, turning everything into nothing.Some of the origin that he had just sensed disappeared instantly.The cheetah's aura trembled violently, and the next moment, it completely lost its connection with the origin. It roared unwillingly and retreated back into Li Hao's body helplessly.Li Hao also cursed in his heart.He was very worried.However, he didn't succeed ... Not only did he not succeed, but he didn't even come into contact with the origin universe. He seemed to be a failure and incompetent.Those that couldn't be obtained were in a commotion! Li Hao would have cried if he had connected the great Dao of origin, but if he hadn 't, he felt that the great Dao of origin was looking down on him."I'm so talented. Your great Dao universe should have broken through the world barrier to connect to me.""You have no eyes!"At this moment, Li Hao ridiculed. In this deserted area, he suddenly revealed a smile.Forget it!I don't care about the universe of origin.There were too many experts in that great path universe. Human King, Emperor Cang, Supremes ... Neo martial experts were all cultivating the origin. Who would want to learn from others?Who wants to be a Phoenix's tail?I want to be the head of a chicken!Even if the new Dao universe was very weak, it did not matter. He was the boss here, but he was the underling in the universe of origins ... He did not care!The aura of a cheetah melded into his body.p However, he hesitated a little, as if he didn't know where he belonged.If the power merged with the Dao Meridian, it could be easily integrated.However, at this moment, this leopard seemed to be hesitating, not knowing what to do.Li Hao wasn't surprised.The momentum he had comprehended now was purely from martial arts. Although there was momentum, it was a shortcut and not from the heart.In his heart, he did not have a deeper perception.He needed to comprehend it himself to bring it into his body."Cheetah...Fast, agile, sharp claws ... Like a killer in the night ..."All of this appeared in Li Hao's mind. The foundation of the other party's cultivation technique was the five birds technique, and the cultivation technique that gave birth to the cheetah force originated from the Silver Moon Martial master's inheritance, the "night killing technique," left behind by an unknown Martial Master.Killers liked to practice this kind of secret skill.Li Hao's mind was wandering. The cheetah's aura was also in turmoil inside his body, as if it was struggling to decide which force it should belong to."Speed ... The wind is freedom, speed ... Cheetah ..."Burst!An instant burst?The metal attribute was also an explosive force, and the metal force was very powerful.However, the cheetah's explosive power was instantaneous. It would retreat after missing its attack, which was more in line with the style of an assassin."Is explosiveness also a type of momentum?" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  If it was power, what kind of Dao Meridian would it belong to?At this moment, Li Hao didn't think about the Dao Meridian. He opened his mind and merged with the cheetah's force. The power that erupted in an instant should be an explosive force.Soon, the cheetah's might seemed to agree with Li Hao's idea.Gradually, the force merged into his body.At this moment, Li Hao absorbed Qi, blood, life, and the power of great DAOs, blending them with Shi. In the blink of an eye, a divine rune began to form and circle around his body.

2188 Chapter 368
"Explode!"The word 'explode' was not 'explode'.The divine text appeared!Li Hao's aura weakened a little and became even more restrained, like a killer in the night. Suddenly, he threw a punch, and the metal force and the explosive force instantly merged together.Chaos exploded!Li Hao's eyes lit up. It worked.The first one was slower.He still had many things to try, so it would take a little longer. However, after settling the first one, the rest should be fast."As expected, potential is a special product that the origin can not connect to. However, potential can connect to the new Dao ... This means that the new Dao and the origin are still closely related."With this thought in mind, Li Hao continued his training.At this moment, he didn't care about the others. He didn't care about how Ying Hongyue and the others were doing. He only cared about himself. He didn't even care if these people would come out and kill in all directions.Li Hao really didn't care.That was because he only knew one thing. If he could control the great Dao, he would be able to resurrect all the dead, just like the human King.If I can't ... Then I won't be able to protect everyone forever.He just had to take life and death lightly.The core was still on his side. Zheng Yu and the rest's goal was not to destroy the world, but to control the world. Therefore, killing people was actually not advisable.Moreover, everyone's cultivation now would help more powerhouses come out, and Zheng Yu would most likely not have the mood to kill anymore.One divine rune appeared. In addition to the previous one, Li Hao now had 12.However, 12 was definitely not enough to build a domain.​ Li Hao had explored the great wilderness before. If he wanted to cover the great wilderness, he would need at least 20 or more chaotic auras, even if he had to compress a portion of them. It would be best if he could gather 36 chaotic auras.……At the end of the wasteland, Li Hao was focused on his training.Regardless of the world.At this moment, the world had encountered an era of prosperity that was hard to come by in ten thousand years.Millions of supers were frantically completing the construction work as wide roads ran through the entire planet.In the four Seas, many experts were carrying large cities.The Saint could finally walk out.It wasn't just the Saints of Hurricane city, but also the Saints of other places.One city after another was lifted up.Fill up the land of the four Seas!At the same time.There were also some changes in the ancient cities. The Hong family's thunderstorm city, the Zhou family's Galaxy city, the Zhang family's set Sky City, and the Zhao family's martial Union.The four main cities also started to move.Outside martial Union.That was because Saints could walk out. And now, the demon-hunting Army led by Liu Yan was already hard to suppress.However, the other party didn't seem to want to make things worse.It was because of Li Hao's deterrence.Previously, when the sky screen appeared and Li Hao and the others killed the Heavenly King, Li Hao killed Zheng Hong Yuan in front of Zheng Yu. He was so powerful and so cold that even neo martial Saints would be affected.At this moment, the second elder's main body walked out. As a Saint of martial Union, he revealed his true appearance to Liu Yan.His face was a little pale, and his hair was also white.After so many years, it seemed that because he had consumed too much energy, his body had only been Reforged."General Liu! Now that heaven and earth can withstand the emergence of a Sage, although it has not completely recovered for the second time, it is not too far away. We already know that the Zheng family has rebelled, and we will never join the Zheng family in their evil deeds ...""Not only the Zheng family, but also the Liu family and Zhou family. We will also take extra precautions against them. We will also obey Heavenly star's laws. Can you release martial Union's seal?" the second elder asked politely.Outside the city, there were people guarding it, which was equivalent to imprisoning them.They had not been out for many years.Now that the world had recovered a lot, they could walk out of it. If this continued, the people in the city would go crazy. As for Li Hao, they would have turned hostile if they weren't really afraid.Liu Yan's expression was cold.Just as he was about to say something and was ready to turn hostile, a figure floated over and Qian Wuliang said with a bright smile,""Senior of martial Union, there is no need to be anxious, nor do you need to be angry. Lord Marquis is also doing this for everyone's safety ... Previously, Lord Marquis was worried that everyone would be assassinated by the Zheng family. Now that a Saint has appeared in the world, Lord Marquis's worries have lessened greatly.""Everything the Marquis has done is to protect everyone, to protect the new martial seniors ...""Then please help me thank Marquis li," the second elder said politely."It's what I should do. Lord Marquis doesn't need any thanks ..."Qian Wuliang smiled brightly."I'm just worried that there might be some traitors in the major cities. Of course, I'm not saying for sure. It's just a possibility.""What Lord Marquis means is that everyone can leave if they want to!" He said softly. If you want to go out, just go out ... As long as you follow the law, it won't be a problem. "Liu Yan's expression turned ugly. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  The second elder was surprised."But ... Just in case, the Marquis said that the city Lord seal and the main city can't be touched!" Qian Wuliang continued."What do you mean?"The second elder was startled and frowned.Gan Wuliang laughed."Once the main city is activated, it's very easy to cause an upheaval. Moreover, we don't have enough energy, so it's difficult to activate it now. It's better to stay where we are!""In order to stabilize the world and the Silver Moon ... Out of the eight main cities, Hurricane city is definitely occupied by the Zheng family. Sword city is still sealed. As for the other six main cities, Zhan Tian has already entered the bright star cosmos, and Wu Li is currently patrolling the surroundings. Therefore, we can't move the remaining four main cities. If we move again, something will happen."Qian Wuliang said in a low voice,"in addition to the non-traitors" city, the energy is insufficient, and it's hard to move it even if we want to. " Lord Marquis ordered me to come and negotiate with the seniors. The people can leave, but the city will remain. And if you want to leave ... All of you must come out!"

2189 Chapter 368
"All of them?" the second elder's expression changed slightly."Yes, I am!"Qian Wuliang nodded."There's one more thing you're worried about, Lord Marquis. If the traitors are still hiding and haven't made a move, they'll activate the main city once the powerhouses leave. Won't that be troublesome?" So ... Everyone had to evacuate! Just leave the empty city behind!"Before the second elder could say anything, someone said angrily,""Just directly say that you want to take the main city! How was that possible? As long as the person lives, the city lives!"Qian Wuliang was beating around the bush.Li Hao wasn't that worried about the Saints and undying beings of the eight main cities, but the main cities ... Were not allowed to be taken away.Once the main city was activated, it would be extremely powerful.If a main city was guarded by many saints and was fully activated, its defensive and offensive capabilities would be extremely powerful. Furthermore, the main city indeed had the ability to suppress the heavens and earth. If the eight main cities were all in chaos, the heavens and earth would also be in chaos.Many of martial Union's members had recovered. When they heard these words, they were all very dissatisfied.This main city was theirs.Li Hao's meaning was clear. They could either leave the city or not even think about leaving.The seventh elder, who had dealt with Li Hao before, took the initiative to speak,""Isn't this a little inappropriate? The main city is the foundation of our families. As long as the city is here, we will be here. We are the people who stayed behind to guard the city. If we abandon the main city, What is the difference between that and betrayal?"Qian Wuliang smiled and nodded,"I understand your difficulties, but you must also understand the Marquis" efforts. " The Marquis understands that seniors wish to leave, so he is willing to let you all leave ... But if you all leave and something happens in the city, that would be a disaster for the world. ""If only a portion of the people go out, I won 'T. I'll still hold the fort. With my strength, even if there's a rebellion ..." The second elder said softly."Even commander Wu Peng has betrayed us. Even the head of the Zheng family has betrayed us. Who can say for sure?""Nowadays, there are at least two or three saints in a city," Qian Wuliang said in a low voice,"guarding the monster plant, the commander of the military, and a chief executive. Unless all three of them don't leave, but if one of them leaves ... It'll be easy to break the balance!""If the Zheng family had planted a traitor, under normal circumstances, they would have at most one Sage ... If they had more than one, they wouldn't have to wait until today. They would have taken over the main city long ago!""Therefore, the sages of the three sides should either all leave or ... Not a single one of them should leave!"The second elder's expression was grave.What Qian Wuliang said was reasonable, but ... It would be too dangerous for the undying and the peak realm cultivators to go out.Furthermore, Saints also needed to recover. They needed opportunities and opportunities.If he walked out now, he might have a chance.If he stayed here, he might really be waiting for death.Just as these people were in a dilemma, the void suddenly flashed and a man walked out. Qian Wuliang and the others "expressions changed. Not only that, but at this moment, someone appeared in the air. The eyes of the overpowered ocean bull were somewhat solemn.Not far away, there was a man in Black armor. It was the Managing Director's armor. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  Zhang an's expression was calm as he looked at both parties. His voice was not loud, but both parties could hear him clearly."Has martial Union betrayed us?"The second elder's expression changed. The second elder hurriedly bowed."Division Chief Zhang, please be clear that martial Union will never betray us!"Zhang an glanced at him and slowly said,""Neo martial has already disappeared. If you no longer recognize neo martial, you can choose freely and stop using neo martial's signboard! If you acknowledge neo martial, then lead the crowd and leave the main city now. Leave with me. ""Director Zhang!"Before the second elder opened his mouth, Qian Wuliang said in a low voice,""Senior Zhang, you want to take them away?" Zhang an glanced at him and said softly,""I can 't? Didn't li Hao want the main city? Then leave the main city behind, I want to take them away, can't I?"Qian Wuliang frowned."Zhang an, you don't have the bearing of an Overlord, the courage of a King, and even less the wisdom of a Supreme ... Why don't you just be honest and help the Li family to regain its glory!" Why bother with this mess ..."Zhang an glanced at it and said calmly,""Power can overturn the ocean, and a fine bird will break a tree to rest. I don't care what you choose, and I don't blame you! "The traitors of neo martial deserve to die. I don't care. "However, some people never betrayed us. They still have the heart of a new martial artist. You're a demon, so you don't have to care, but I ... Am a human!"Li Fuhai was speechless.It understood what Zhang an meant.Some of the new martial artists were still unwilling to surrender or compromise. If this went on, it would be very troublesome. They might even be killed by Li Hao!At this moment, Li Hao didn't have much time to care about this.But sooner or later, he would interfere.It wouldn't be too long!Not only Li Hao, but the Zheng family would also interfere. They would either be subdued or killed. In any case, these people who had new martial arts in their hearts and were unwilling to surrender would not end well.And Zhang an ... Was going to take this group of people away.This time, it had come to take charge of martial Union's side, just in case. Now that Zhang an had appeared, it pondered for a moment before speaking,"Then don't make things difficult for me! The people can be taken away, but the main city must be left behind. Not only the main city, but the buildings, factories, spare armors, and military facilities must all be left behind!"Zhang an looked at it for a while and then turned to Qian Wuliang.Qian Wuliang smiled."What the sea-guarding envoy wants is what I want ... The Marquis has ordered us to do everything according to your wishes." He said.
