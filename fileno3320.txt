At this moment, the two people and the dog looked at Li Hao and fell into deep thought.Black Panther was somewhat absent-minded,"should I change paths to cultivate?"Cultivate the path of order?Or perhaps ... The path of calamity?"But I don't know much about it. It knows how to use the power of the Thunder element. It has inherited some power of the bloodline. Neo martial's demon subduer is actually good at the power of the Thunder element, but ... The black leopard is mainly good at water.He had already reached the fifth step and was about to reach the sixth step. Would it be possible for him to change paths to cultivate now?Li Hao looked at the three of them and continued,"the reason I'm doing this is because I hope to completely merge Silver Moon into one and advance to the seventh step!" Otherwise, if Silvermoon wanted to step into the seventh step, he wouldn't have been able to do so just by devouring a few worlds!""It'll be quite difficult for Silver Moon to enter a class 7 world, but if he can grasp the path of calamity, there might be hope!""The reason why I'm letting the Black Panther try it now ... Is because if the lightning pillar is similar to the Dao chess as I think it is, then there's still time for me to start from the beginning! I didn't know much about the DAOs back then, but senior Dao chess gave me a lot of help!"Li Hao looked at Dao chess and said,"also ... Since senior is here, I have a presumptuous request ... I hope senior can let me, the Silver Moon emperors, enter Dao chess to gain enlightenment!" "I'll pay for all the resources you'll need. Senior Dao Qi contains the Enlightenment of the great Dao left behind by a rank nine venerable sovereign. For everyone, this is a huge opportunity. You can become stronger if you master one Dao, but you have to dabble in other DAOs. Only then can you know yourself and your enemy. Only then can you broaden your vision and enter the fourth and seventh rank earlier!"Dao Qi hesitated slightly, but after some thought, he still said,""Actually, not everyone is suitable to go in and comprehend ... I'm worried ..."One shouldn't bite off more than one could chew!Li Hao nodded."I understand. But I ... Believe in the Silver Moon martial masters!"He looked at everyone and said,"I'm just asking you to broaden your horizons. It doesn't mean that you have to walk the path of the myriad DAOs combination!" What suits you best is the best, but expanding your knowledge and broadening your horizons doesn't conflict with these. As long as you don't completely indulge in it and only want to merge the ten thousand DAOs into level nine, I think it'll only be good for you!"The Silver Moon martial masters looked at each other, and soon, Nan Quan said with a smile,""Don't worry. I'm too lazy to cultivate all kinds of DAOs ... But I can try to cultivate Qian Wuliang and Hong Yitang. I just realized that they know too little and can only provide us with a small amount of enlightenment. On the other hand, we have been providing them with enlightenment all the time ... What a loss!" “……”  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  The two Dao Masters were helpless. There was nothing wrong with what he said!They didn't have much comprehension and had been pushed forward by everyone. This couldn't be helped.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly said,"we can learn from senior uncle Hong's Dao and the path of the Supreme neo martial artist!" And Qian Wuliang ..."He looked at Qian Wuliang for a while and said slowly,""If I were you ... It's not the same to keep waiting like this. You don't have to be too afraid of me. As long as you don't do anything rash, I rarely punish anyone ... You can borrow the kingdom of God ... The kingdom of God is actually not very good. I think you can cooperate with the king of Dali."The Dali King was stunned. What does it have to do with me?Qian Wuliang's eyes flickered."What you mean is that the humans under the command of Dali King are relatively intelligent and cunning. They don't believe in gods and have complicated thoughts. I ... Should go deeper and try to understand them?"Li Hao nodded.The humans in the divine Kingdom were relatively simple-minded, while the humans on the side of the king of Dali were ... Well, how should I put it? they were more complicated. Even if the Queen tried to bewitch them, they did not believe in her. It was easy to imagine that they were people with complicated minds.As for the Dao of emotions and the Dao of the human heart, Li Hao said,""I suggest ... If you're not afraid of split personality, you can create some clones and enter them. You can experience different lives, different characters, and different people's hearts ... In the past, you actually improved very quickly because you rose from the bottom and experienced all kinds of life. But now, you're actually outdated ..."Qian Wuliang was a bit embarrassed. Li Hao said, "I'm not criticizing, but everyone's improving too quickly. This is something that can not be blamed! But you, what you want to walk is the Dao of the human heart. If you don't go deep into it, how can you comprehend? Qian Wuliang, I actually think highly of you. I even think that your Dao is the most special one among all the other DAOs. The human heart is the most difficult to control!""The DAOs of others are simple, not complicated, not fickle ... Even space, tribulation, and time can be traced. Only the human heart can not be traced!" "There is more than just desire in the human heart. It is also part of the Dao of the human heart. The Dao of desire alone is enough to make a person reach level eight. If you can really control the human heart, it is not impossible for you to reach level nine. Although I am only a level six venerable sovereign, I have seen too many DAOs ...""I originally thought that if martial uncle Hong was a little more simple-minded and you had a little more insight into the Dao, you would be able to push martial uncle Hong and the entire Silver Moon to improve ... But now, I don't see any signs of that ..."

Qian Wuliang was a bit embarrassed. Li Hao said, "You're too afraid of me ... This isn't good. I didn't say that I would disturb your Dao Comprehension ... As long as you don't kill people for no reason, you can do whatever you want with your Dao Comprehension!"Qian Wuliang took a deep breath and said,"thank you for your guidance, my Lord!."Li Hao nodded."It's just a suggestion. I'm not saying that you have to follow my instructions. After all, what suits you is the best. If you think it's feasible, you can try it. If it doesn't work, you can try another method." "No, Lord Marquis is far-sighted, and I agree with Lord Marquis's words!"Qian Wuliang seemed to be flattering him, but he also seemed to be not.He was rather serious as he tried to understand the human heart, transforming into thousands of people, blending into the complex world where thousands of worlds converged, experiencing different identities, different roles ...  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  'This ... Might really be my chance.The people of the divine Kingdom were too simple and pure. There was nothing much to understand about such humans, but the group of humans under King Dali's control was definitely worth it.Why had the king of Dali not become a venerable sovereign?This was because he hadn't managed to get the humans to trust him or believe in him. He hadn't even made them see him as their leader.The path of the King of Dali was actually very difficult to walk.If he had taken another path, he might have become a venerable sovereign long ago. However, taking this path was very, very difficult!However, if he really succeeded, not only would he not be like the Queen, who could advance as easily as drinking water, he would not be much slower than the Supreme neo martial artist. It was also an extremely complicated way to gather the People's hearts.Moreover, it was even more troublesome. In any case, neo martial was still a human race of the same world, so they more or less had some sense of identity.However, the humans that the Dali King controlled ... Came from different worlds, spoke different languages, had different habits, and had different cultures ... Other than being human, there was almost no difference.To merge these people into one ... The king of Dali's path was too difficult, but Li Hao had high hopes for it!This path was not urgent, it was a long process.Li Hao was even considering sealing the king of Dali in it. Like other worlds, he could make time flow differently and use time as the price to drive the fusion of the entire world!This way, he could speed up the process of the entire world's fusion.As for the improvement of the humans "power ... That was secondary. Unlike Silver Moon, who pursued power, the humans of this world should be pursuing harmony and happiness, not the improvement of power.Perhaps, countless years later, the first generation of the human race would die, and the subsequent generations of the human race would gradually unite. As he thought about this, Li Hao glanced at the king of Dali. Ever since Yuan Shuo had advanced to venerable sovereign, Silver Moon had reached level six. Now, the remaining elders, whom Li Hao was familiar with, had almost all become venerable sovereigns.This included his cheapskate Junior Sister Li Meng, Junior Brother Hu Hao, Hao lianchuan, Wang Ming, these old friends, and even Liu Long's son Liu Yin.and the members of the demon-hunting squad back then ...even people like empress dowager shui yun had become venerable sovereigns.Only the King of Dali, who used to be the Overlord of The Way of Kings, was still at the immortal soul third level.One had to know that he was one of the two half-emperors under Li Hao, the Queen and the king of Dali. Now, he was the only half-Emperor of the older generation!Of course, this so-called 'back then'... Was actually only three to four years ago.But in the eyes of others, it was as if it had been a lifetime!Now that they were on this topic, Li Hao said,""Dali King, I want to seal your Dali realm and let Qian Wuliang enter it with you. I want him to help you to unite the human race! To truly unify a dynasty ... Civilization, words, habits, customs, measurements ... These are all extremely troublesome and time-consuming matters. It is impossible to succeed in a short period of time, and it is very common for it to take ten to a hundred years ...""after sealing off the great li realm, i will not be able to provide any energy to you all this time. hence, your realm might not have any progress at all, and it will be the same for you as well ... are you willing to do so?"he looked at the king of dali and then at the people around him,""i've said it a long time ago ... i actually want to be more independent and travel the world. however, i also hope that everyone won't just look at my back and watch me leave alone ... i hope that everyone can keep up.""i know that i'm moving too fast, but i'll wait for you. now, almost all the people i'm familiar with have entered the venerable sovereign realm and have long lifespans. i also hope that king dali can go further ... is there anyone else willing to enter with him and assist him?""Yes!" Jiang Li stood up and bowed slightly."I'm willing to help my King!"Li Hao nodded."I would like to try as well," director Zhao suddenly said."I would like to try to integrate different worlds, different cultures, and different civilizations ... I have been in charge of administration for many years, and silver Moon has been in charge for 500 years. It should be able to provide some help to the king of Dali."At this moment, several venerable sovereigns spoke one after another.The Dali King's eyes were a little complicated as he said,""So you mean ... I ... Should bring some people to explore the land. If I can't unify the land ... If I can't prove my Dao as a venerable sovereign, I ... Don't have to come out again?"Li Hao looked at him."I understand!" The Dali King sighed and nodded.If I can't succeed, what's the point of coming out?

Chapter 3322 Lightning Territory (2 In 1)
"The people around me have become venerable sovereigns, but I haven 't. This is the path I've chosen. No matter how difficult it is, I have to continue!Li Hao continued,"actually, it's not just the Dali King ... I hope that more people can enter this world and comprehend different DAOs, including life and death and faith. Lingyue's faith is too superficial. It needs time to settle down!" Hong Yu's Dao of death requires time to be constructed. What you lack now is not energy, opportunity, or comprehension ... But time!""I used Time and Stars to suppress the great li realm. This is another kind of Mystic realm! A time secret realm!""An instant in the outside world is equivalent to a year in the inside world. Apart from being unable to absorb energy from the outside world, an ordinary person, even a seventh or eighth level venerable sovereign, would find it difficult to completely seal off a sixth level world. But we have such an opportunity now!"This was actually an opportunity. He continued,"everyone's progress is too fast. I'm happy in my heart, but I'm a little worried. It's too short! "Even if neo martial arts is rising rapidly, it has been a thousand years. I, Silver Moon, have three years!""Crazy devouring. Crazy killing. The only thing missing ... Is the accumulation of time!"As for himself, Li Hao really didn't lack anything.He had walked through new martial arts, he had seen Tian Fang, he had walked through life and death, he had gone through reincarnation, he had fought hundreds of battles and not died. Physically, he might only be in his 20s, but psychologically ... He had long passed that age.Even if that human King had lived for a thousand years, in reality...He might not have experienced as much as I did. He's actually not old. He's still very young and hot-blooded, and I'm physically younger than him, but mentally, I might be older than him.The Thunder monarch listened silently by the side.At this moment, there was only shock in his heart.He would not give up!This Silver Moon King wasn't willing to give up on anyone and hoped that they could grow together with him. How difficult was this?How many seventh rank venerable sovereigns were there in this world?However, the Silver Moon King seemed to be hoping that these people would all reach Level 7 or 8. This was simply a fantasy!However ... When Li Hao arranged a path that suited them for everyone and let them walk and try ... The Thunderbolt master was a little envious and felt inferior. 'I've never done this before. The emperors of the Thunder World are actually very simple. They all walk the path of the Thunder element!'In comparison ... The venerable sovereigns under my command are really quite miserable.At this time, the king of Dali took a deep breath and stood up.""Since you are willing to help me ... Then I will not be polite. I ... Will go to the great li realm and continue to open up new desolate lands! If ... I still can't vindicate my Dao as a venerable sovereign, then I'll just die of old age in there. If the others want to come out, you can lead them out!"Seeing his acquaintances walking toward the path of venerable sovereigns one by one, and only he himself stopped, he was actually very anxious. Since there was such an opportunity today, he would try it!"I once buried a human Emperor's star in the river of the great Dao," Li Hao said."Now, I'm buried in the Li realm. If you really can't walk, then ... Try walking this path!"The Dali King knew that it was something condensed by the Queen. It had instantly gained the trust and trust of hundreds of billions of people. It was very terrifying.He took a deep breath and nodded.Li Hao said no more. A realm appeared in second cat's belly. King Dali and the other venerable sovereigns entered it without saying anything. Li Hao took out the Stargate forged by the new martial artists and sealed the gate.As for a rank 6 world, even if the world gate was closed, it wouldn't enter another space-time. During this period, the suppression of the time star was needed. This allowed the entire world to be enveloped by the time star. This would allow this world to sink into the depths of chaos and produce the intersection of space-time.At this moment, the lightning Emperor was also looking on in a carefree and relaxed manner. Dao Qi, Kong Ji, and the others also looked on silently. They sighed. The time star was really a good thing!Li Hao, on the other hand, was also looking at the time star.After a long while, he suddenly said,"I've always planned before I acted. I've always waited for the day when I've fully comprehended time. Then, I'll comprehend time and rebuild it ... Perhaps, I'll burn my boats and cauldrons a little earlier!" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  What did that mean?No one understood.Only Li Hao himself knew that perhaps it was time for him to break through time, not now, but he had to do it quickly. Otherwise ... He might not be able to reach Level 7. Or rather, he could only rely on time to reach Level 7!"At that time, perhaps ... I will no longer have the courage to break time!"Before I reach Level Seven, I must break time and reforge the time that belongs to me. Even if it's not time, it's just a Dao domain. Only then will I have hope of truly perfecting my Dao!The Dragon Lord's appearance made Li Hao realize that the spacetime star forged by Zhan Tiandi at the sixth step wasn't perfect. Zhan Tiandi could discover it. Because Zhan Tiandi was too weak, only at the sixth step, some of the DAOs in the spacetime star were actually very weak.As for Li Hao, an outsider, he couldn't repair or strengthen it at all. If he continued to walk the Dao of time, there was likely to be a problem ... He could push the entire time star to the ninth level, but even at that level, Li Hao wouldn't truly understand what time was! He could guide others on how to cultivate, but no one could guide him. Perhaps, he could only rely on himself.As he thought about this, he suddenly looked in one direction. The next moment, second cat and Thunderlord also looked in the same direction. Thunderlord was a little nervous, and Li Hao was also a little strange.Second cat was even more confused and mumbled,""That guy ..."The blood Emperor!Yes, Li Hao sensed it too. The blood Emperor was approaching, because there were some fluctuations in the world of Silvermoon, or rather, the firmament sword.The word 'heaven-battling' had been absorbed by the firmament sword.But now, there seemed to be some fluctuations.It was said that the venerable sovereign, who was known as the mentor of the human King, was the one who guided the human King's enlightenment in martial arts. He had long heard of his name, but had never met him. In the past of neo martial, Li Hao had seen him a few times, but he had never really met him. Today, he might have the opportunity to meet him."New martial ..."Li Hao murmured. Neo martial was still very magical. The most magical thing was that the human King, Supreme, blood Emperor, and sword venerable might all know the existence of the time star, but no one cultivated it!At this moment, he really wanted to see the blood Emperor. He wanted to ask,"why didn't you cultivate?"You're known as the reincarnation of Zhan Tiandi. Why don't you want to inherit it?What an interesting group of people.[PS: after 12 o' clock, the monthly votes will be doubled. Everyone can vote a little.]

Chapter 3323 Do As You Please (1)
He had just settled the others down when he sensed the arrival of the blood Emperor.The Thunderbolt master had also sensed it and was somewhat vigilant. Li Hao did not wait for him in the Thunder World. After all, the Thunder World was the Thunderbolt master's territory.If a seventh rank venerable sovereign entered the inner region and broke through the boundary, it would be very dangerous.Even if the Thunder monarch had just advanced to the eighth step, it would not do.Moreover, the blood Emperor might not be the only one."Senior second cat, let's go out and meet them."Second cat mumbled something but didn't tell Li Hao anything. Soon, the man and Cat Rose into the air and flew out.Seeing this, the Thunder Emperor, Kong Ji, and the others thought for a moment and followed.Even though the neo martial expert had a deep relationship with Silver Moon, he still had to be on guard at this moment. After all, he had just killed a bunch of powerhouses from the Dragon field, so it was still dangerous.……In the lightning territory.Thunder and lightning struck.With the blood-red long saber in hand, he cut through the lightning. Behind him, Supreme Emperor Wushan reached out and extinguished most of the lightning. At this moment, he was also covered in dust."It's said that this is still the peaceful period ... If he's already so difficult to deal with, then if this were the rebellion period, even tier 8 experts would be in danger of dying. "After saying a few words, monarch Wushan saw another lightning pillar and quickly dodged.In the lightning territory, the lightning tribulation near the lightning pillar was stronger. After entering, he had suffered a few losses and finally had some experience, so he quickly avoided the lightning pillar.He then looked at the blood Emperor who was leading the way ... He could not help but sigh. There was a reason why Neo martial arts could grow.The blood Emperor wasn't very famous in the chaos.However, when he followed the other party out, the other party was calm and composed. Compared to the human King, he felt much more grounded. On neo martial arts 'side, there were too few people who made people feel grounded. He was worried about meeting another human King before ... It seemed that it was not that bad.If he was a human King, he might have already started fighting with the lightning tribulation.Suddenly, the blood Emperor said,""They're here. "Sovereign Wushan sensed it as well, but he was slightly surprised. He glanced at the blood Emperor. His perception was not bad. He was at the eighth rank, but the blood Emperor, who had just entered the seventh rank, could sense it."Eighth-ranked?"He was suddenly startled and surprised."Is it ... The lightning Lord from the Dragon field?"He wasn't very familiar with this person, but it was said that this time, Li Hao had joined forces with him and killed a large number of experts. It seemed that ... The other party might have silently devoured many worlds and reached level 8.They were similar to him, the kind that had just entered the realm.However, the other party had the Thunder World, while he did not have a realm. If they were to really compare, he was probably slightly inferior.However, the Thunder World had only just advanced. Even if the other party was slightly stronger, there was a limit to how strong he could be. If he were to settle down for a period of time, there was a high probability that he would not be as strong as this fellow.Thunder Emperor, level eight.Wushan thought to himself. It seemed that this side wasn't weak either.In the blink of an eye, a few figures appeared.Li Hao laughed before he arrived."So it's senior Wushan. Congratulations on reaching the eighth step!" As soon as he finished speaking, he appeared and saw the neo martial blood Emperor, Wang Jinyang.He still looked the same as the blood Emperor in his memory. He had a crew cut, a long bow on his back, and a blood saber on his waist.What Li Hao remembered the most was that the other party had split Silver Moon into eight with one strike!In his memory, he had actually said something to the void ... It was possible for the world to have a consciousness, but he hoped that the world of the Silvermoon would not have one ...Back then, he might not have understood it.Today, he had some enlightenment.Perhaps the other party had said that it might not be Silvermoon's consciousness, but ... Time?Who knows?"Silvermoon Li Hao greets senior Wang!" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao cupped his fists and took the lead in greeting.On the other side, the blood Emperor looked at Li Hao and sized him up. He nodded slightly and smiled. "I've long heard of your great name! Neo martial artist Wang Jinyang, my respects!"He also cupped his fists and spoke out of courtesy.Then, he looked at second cat. Second cat also looked at him with wide eyes and seemed to be curious.The blood Emperor laughed."Second cat.""Meow."Second cat meowed, not sure if it was a greeting."Congratulations!"Second cat wagged its tail. What's there to congratulate?It smelled a familiar scent on this person, but it was not quite the same. It should be the scent left behind by a teacher, but it was not exactly the same.It was said that neo martial artist Wang Jinyang was the reincarnation of a teacher. It seemed to make some sense, but it also did not make sense.Second cat didn't say much but asked, "Where's the scholar?"Scholar, Zhan Tiandi's page boy.The only living being in the illusory space, a real living being.The moment Zhan Tiandi cut off the past and left behind the illusory space, the other party had been following him until Zhan Tiandi's past body completely disappeared. The other party had left the illusory space under Zhan Tiandi's arrangement.It was also the living being that second cat was most familiar with."At new martial," the blood Emperor said softly."Why didn't he come?"Er Mao looked at him and the blood Emperor explained,""The red sun has been broken through. He doesn't have enough yang energy. He was absorbing the power of yang energy earlier and was still in seclusion.""Oh!"Second cat didn't say anything more. He didn't know you very well, so there was nothing to say.The blood Emperor smiled and looked at Li Hao.""Thank you for resurrecting the two cats ... You've completely materialized them in the world and turned them into real living beings. This has also settled one of my worries."

Chapter 3324 Doing As One Pleases (2)
"You're welcome, it's what I should do. "Li Hao also laughed."It's senior second cat who helped me many times. Being able to revive has its pros and cons. It might not be a good thing.""That's true. "The blood Emperor laughed and turned to look at Wu Shan, then at the Thunder Emperor and the others.""I lost my composure when I saw second cat and neglected you seniors. Li Hao, you're very familiar with senior Wushan ... I won't introduce you.""Yes, this is the Thunder Emperor, this is the void ..."Li Hao also introduced the people on his side. Although this was the first time he had met the blood Emperor, he was not too unfamiliar with him.Both sides had actually found some similarities in each other.Perhaps it wasn't much, but when the two of them looked at each other, they actually felt a sense of familiarity.They all knew the reason, but they didn't say much.At this moment, the Thunder Emperor also looked at Wu Shan. A level eight venerable sovereign ... It was really surprising. Didn't they say that only light and the others were level eight in the three regions?He also knew about this monarch Wushan. He had actually reached level eight!As for monarch Wu Shan, he didn't say much, but he felt a little emotional.Whether it was neo martial or Silver Moon, they were indeed passed down from generation to generation.Whether it was the human King, Supreme, or Silver moon's Silver Moon King, all of them had their own unique points. They did not seem to care how strong the others would become. For example, it was actually very difficult for Wu Shan and the Thunder Emperor to step into the eighth stage ...However, these people didn't seem to be afraid that their allies, even allies who hadn't signed any agreements, would become level 8 and surpass them. They didn't seem to be afraid that these people would turn against them or even become the host.Why?Many experts, including eighth rank venerable sovereigns like Yun Xiao, were actually extremely afraid of the strength of the experts under them, especially those who surpassed them. They hoped that you would become stronger before you surpassed them.However, when your strength is enough to threaten them, these people, or rather, most people, will be afraid.Were the human King and Li Hao really not worried?He had allowed himself and the Thunder Emperor, who were foreign venerable sovereigns, to enter the eighth level. At this moment, Li Hao didn't say anything. He just smiled and said,""We were just preparing to come out and observe the lightning pillars in the lightning territory, but we didn't expect that the two of you would come. Why don't we observe while we chat? at the same time, we can also talk about the changes in the tianfang great Dao universe ...""Alright!" The blood Emperor nodded.Then, he looked at the lightning pillars and said,""The lightning pillar might be one of the Dao nets. You should be able to tell that it's quite dangerous. If you get close, you have to be careful of triggering the other lightning pillars!"Li Hao nodded. It was not surprising that the other party had also seen it. It was normal. These well-known venerable sovereigns of new martial arts actually had a good comprehension of the Dao. There was no one who had a weak comprehension of the great Dao. The so-called recklessness was just a superficial phenomenon.All of them were as smart as monkeys.At this moment, Wu Shan also quickly added,"Yunxiao and chiyang are both dead. Guangming and the neo martial artist King have joined forces. They're fine now, so Kong Ji can rest assured! Neo martial should have officially stepped into the eighth rank. I was lucky to have the help of the Supreme neo martial, which allowed me to devour the cloud world and achieve the eighth rank. "The Thunderbolt master's heart trembled!The two level 8 martial artists were dead?How was that possible?This was a true Overlord of the three regions."Hongyue has joined the Dragon Lord," Wu Shan continued."Yunxiao and the other rank eight venerable sovereign from twin realms were both killed by the Dragon Lord. He's been waiting for an opportunity in tianfang universe. He's extremely powerful and can easily kill a rank eight venerable sovereign! Chi Yang was killed by the human King ..."He sighed."They are all veteran level eight cultivators. Even without the great Dao universe, they are still stronger than us ... In the end, they were still killed on the spot!" Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 He glanced at Thunderlord and only wanted to say that the two of them, who had just advanced to level eight, were actually nothing in the four-sided domain.Currently, the Dragon Lord was definitely the strongest in the four-direction region.Second, it should be Emperor Cang and the human King working together. If they were alone, even if they entered the eighth step, there was a high probability that they would not be a match for the Dragon Lord. The third would be the light Thearch.If it's the fourth ... It might not be us, level eight!He might be a Supreme neo martial artist!The fifth ... Might be the Crimson Moon, and then they.Of course, the Thunderbolt master had the support of the great Dao universe and the existence of a world. He might be slightly stronger than him, but there was a limit. It could be said that the two of them were definitely at the bottom of level eight.The Thunderbolt master was extremely shocked."Hong Yue has joined the Dragon Lord?""It's said that those who didn't submit would die. At that time, there were seven seventh level venerable sovereigns under the Dragon Master's command ... Red Moon sovereign must have signed a great Dao Alliance agreement with the other party, so he was completely taken down."Wu Shan quickly explained the situation and then said,"Now, they've reunited with the experts of the chaos race. Two level eights and more than ten level Sevens ... Oh, right, we met another level eight venerable sovereign from twin realm domain in the Crimson sun World. He left Sifang domain, and the Supreme neo martial asked me to pass you something ..."Then, a jade pendant flew toward Li Hao.Li Hao reached out to take it. Before Wu Shan could say anything, the Supreme martial artist's voice appeared in Li Hao's mind."We can attack the Twin realms. Of course, a rank 8 can't be underestimated! For the time being, it's not appropriate for the four-sided region to clash head-on with the Dragon Lord ... Even if the neo martial realm advances to rank eight, it may not be able to match the other party ..."The Supreme martial artist left behind some information. Li Hao listened in silence and said nothing.

Chapter 3325 Doing As He Pleased (3)
He was also used to such methods.Although he hadn't seen much, there were such things in neo martial's memory. Supreme martial artists were everywhere. It wasn't surprising that the other party had targeted the eighth level venerable sovereign.However, to be able to make a tier 8 undetectable, this new martial Supreme's strength could not be underestimated.Twin realms?A level 8 world, or a double level 8 world, or a double Dao universe?Even if it wasn't a dual-Dao universe, it was an extremely huge level-eight universe. This was a huge piece of meat, but it was very difficult to eat it.Yunxiao and Chi Yang were both dead.Two rank eight worlds were gone.There were seven seventh rank venerable sovereigns on the Dragon Lord's side. Including the previous ones, there were a total of 14. Feng Yan was already at the peak of the sixth rank. This time, there was a high probability that he would enter the seventh rank.At least 15 Level 7 venerable sovereigns!Also, many of them were sector Lord level existences, their strength wasn't weak.With Red Moon and the Dragon Lord, even if neo martial and silver Moon joined forces, there was still hope of taking down the other party ... But it might not be a sure thing. The Dragon Lord was a master with great talent and strategy, and he himself was at the peak of the eighth rank ... Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 The grade 7 subordinates trusted and worshipped him."If I were the Dragon Master ... With such heavy losses this time ... Neo martial and silver Moon are both threats. How should I deal with them?"He thought for a moment and put himself in the position of the Dragon Lord. If I were the Dragon Lord, what would I do at this time?Was he waiting for death?Although they were powerful, new martial and silver Moon were both new worlds. They were rapidly becoming stronger and posed a great threat!"Right now, I can either strengthen my own strength or ... Let go of the two clans, take a roundabout route, and go to the outer realms to either rope them in, subdue them, or kill a portion of experts and worlds to strengthen myself. Then, I can come back and deal with the two clans.In addition, the difference between the chaos beasts having a great world and not having a great world wasn't big. Under such a huge loss ... The world could easily become a burden and a nourishment for Li Hao and the others ...Perhaps, he could let the sixth step devour it and try to advance to the seventh step?That was what Li Hao had been doing all along.The human King was the same.After seizing a world, they wouldn't leave it behind and would directly devour it to create more experts. As for having greater potential for development, that wasn't something they would consider. Would the Dragon Lord, an Overlord, make such a choice?If that was the case, the other side also had the six great worlds apart from the dragon world. In that case, they might be able to produce six more Type 7 powerhouses ... That would be more than 20 Type 7 powerhouses!If it wasn't for the huge losses this time, the Dragon Lord would've succeeded, and there would've been more than 30 tier 7 subordinates. In addition, he was at the peak of the eighth step ...That would be truly terrifying!It was enough to sweep across the four regions. In an Ordinary Level 8 world, there would only be one level 8 and four level 7 experts. No matter how strong they were, they would still be blown up by the Dragon Lord."In that case, I've really offended the other party this time ..." If they were to seize the Thunder World, connect with the outside world, take down the five demon clans, and charge some demon experts ...Li Hao sighed with emotion. If he didn't cause trouble, perhaps ... The square domain would really have a master.Of course, it was not just him. New martial was also causing trouble. If he did not trap the other party, perhaps Dragon Master could take it slow and have the hope of completely invading the entire square region.Li Hao felt a bit more at ease after receiving the news.This way, the Dragon Lord might not find trouble with him in the short term.……He digested all the information.Li Hao met up with the two of them.The blood Emperor was very quiet and did not say anything. Even when Li Hao suggested that they look for the lightning pillar, he did not say anything.He followed them.It was as if he was invisible, as if he had only come here to look at Li Hao and second cat.Li Hao pondered for a moment. Before the other party could speak, he took the initiative to say,""There's something that I'm curious about. Can I ask senior if senior has ever discovered the time star?"The blood Emperor smiled and nodded."I can sense it. It's not very obvious. However, I know that it might exist.""Then ...""You want to ask me why I didn't stay in Silver Moon, or why I changed my cultivation?""Right!"Li Hao nodded.The blood Emperor seemed to recall something. After a long time, he said,""Back then, I wasn't the only one who realized that Silver Moon had suddenly left neo martial and transformed into a new world. Actually, Fang ping and I went to investigate a few times ... We have a rough idea of the situation.""There are many reasons why we don't cultivate this Dao. First, this isn't our Dao.""Second, Zhan Tiandi's personality is actually different from ours. Neo martial arts is about fighting! As for Zhan Tiandi ... He won't fight!"The blood Emperor shook his head."Actually, we have a difference in our beliefs. A huge difference!" Although we've never really met Zhan Tiandi, and it's only a projection, we all know something about him. He's a genius and a cultivator, but ... He's also a coward!"“……”Second cat was a little angry.The blood Emperor did not mind and continued,""His ideas are greatly different from ours! "I don't deny that his Dao might be stronger, but he is suitable for teaching, for research, for quiet cultivation, and even for being a gardener ... But he is not suitable for neo martial arts!"It was not suitable!Li Hao fell into deep thought.The Dao of time was incredibly powerful, and yet, the only reason he didn't cultivate it was because he said ... It wasn't suitable.Li Hao still said,"but the Dao is cultivated by humans. Even if you don't cultivate it, you can learn, observe, and ..."

Chapter 3326 Do As You Please (1)_4
"No!""No!" The blood Emperor shook his head again."There are huge traps in Celestial Emperor Zhan's Dao!"A trap?Li Hao looked at him, and the blood Emperor chuckled.""Time is the biggest trap! Cultivators who could control time were too easily trapped. His Dao was very strong, but it was precisely because of this that it was even more dangerous! Do you think that Zhan Tiandi's death was simply because he didn't want to live anymore?"Li Hao was stunned.The blood Emperor explained,"he must have traveled through the past and the future. He must have seen and seen a lot. In the end, he might not even want to face the future. He just wanted to hide in the past. Zhan was a genius, an expert, and a seed of cultivation ... But he was also a coward. He might not be willing to face some things, so he chose to self-destruct. "Of course, it's also possible that he's walked too many paths in the past and future. He was caught up in his own Dao and died ...""This is also the reason why I came to see you.""His Dao is very good!" The blood Emperor sighed. But ... Because of this, it was too good, so good that he couldn't help himself! Before the human King came, he asked me to tell you that if you really want to surpass him, you might need to let go!" The blood Emperor looked at Li Hao and sighed.Put it down?How could it be that simple!If he could let it go so easily, the human King would have long devoured time. However, the more he understood and the more he cultivated, he would discover that time was truly unparalleled among the myriad DAOs in the world!How to put it down?Without time, Li Hao, who had unified a thousand worlds, might be a heaven-defying existence to fight against a level 7.However ... Without Shi Guang, there were still many things that Li Hao could not do even though he had made it this far. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  There was no way he could reverse time, no way he could freeze time, no way he could forge a river of time, no way he could draw in countless chaos lightning tribulations ...Every battle had the contribution of time.Sometimes it was obvious, and sometimes it wasn 't.Li Hao, on the other hand, fell into deep thought. He didn't say much, nor did he say that he would let it go. He was just somewhat puzzled."Zhan Tiandi should have been able to walk out of the neo martial world back then. Others might not have been able to. The neo martial world back then was most likely closed ... But the neo martial world has long been a Tier 6 world. I'm actually a little puzzled as to why it has been closed."Neo martial, Tier 6 world.That was the case back then.Under normal circumstances, such a powerful world would not have been sealed off a long time ago. One could have walked out of it a long time ago. Why was it that in the end, the human King was the first to walk out?"It's probably Zhan Tiandi who did it. "The blood Emperor didn't mind explaining,""In fact, neo martial arts have always been sealed. In fact, it was only when Fang ping entered rank-7 and brought the entire neo martial art into rank-7 that the seal was broken and they walked out of the original darkness!""Zhan might not want us to go out...Maybe he's telling us that chaos is very dark. In fact, chaos is indeed chaotic and dark. He might have good intentions, but he might not be sealing off the world as we want." At this moment, the blood Emperor seemed to be instilling an idea into Li Hao's mind. The decision to fight might not be accurate.Zhan Tiandi was a person who didn't like trouble and chaos.He preferred to be free and enjoy himself behind closed doors.If the outside world was chaotic, then they would seal the world.Shi Guang did have the ability to do so.The blood Emperor continued."When Fang ping left that year, there was a path of darkness near neo martial that could make people lose their way. This was the key to his loss. Later, as the Silver Moon passed away, this path of darkness disappeared.""If I'm not mistaken, it has something to do with time ... Perhaps the end of the Dao of darkness isn't the four-sided domain, but the outer domain!""Zhan Tiandi might hope for neo martial to leave the square region directly. If he really does leave, he shouldn't stay in the square region. The biggest special thing about the square region is tianfang world. These two might be related!"“……”He told Li Hao everything he knew.As for the rest, it was Li Hao's business to analyze and guess.Four regions, tianfang world!Li Hao nodded slightly.The blood Emperor continued,"the Thunder region is also a place that traps and protects the surroundings. Tianfang is the core ... It must be related to tianfang world!" "There's a high chance that the master of tianfang is still alive, but he's not coming back. Whether he's in danger or is plotting something in the dark, no one knows. He might not be a good person. Of course, this is just a guess. "Li Hao nodded again.The information he knew was slightly less than that of neo martial, but he had also judged some things. The master of Tian Fang was definitely still alive.And the entire Tian Fang ... Might completely return!Yes, a complete return.Everyone!Tian Fang's disappearance was all in preparation for their return. Perhaps, soon, all the experts in this world would return to the four-sided domain from another place.The two of them talked as they walked in the Thunder Zone. Blood Emperor was the one talking while Li Hao was the one listening.When he was with the blood Emperor, he didn't feel too much pressure. The other party didn't give off an overbearing feeling. That was the kind of human King.He was a very gentle person and had the feeling of a big brother next door.Even if the words he said were a warning, they did not have that kind of deterrent power. He just calmly and calmly told you that some things might be more complicated and that you had to think about it before making a decision.

Chapter 3327 Doing As He Pleased (Part 5)
As he spoke, everyone arrived near a lightning pillar. The blood Emperor continued,""You'd better not cooperate with neo martial. Although the current situation is more complicated and difficult, if you can walk on your own, then walk on your own!"Li Hao was a little surprised. Although he had never considered this, but ...Why did the blood Emperor say that?"The human King is a person who cares about his face, and he's also a person who doesn't admit defeat. He will become stronger when he meets a strong opponent! In his ideals, he was the one and only, one of a kind, and also the strongest. He would be able to surpass the Dragon Lord sooner or later! With your personality, you're not suitable to compete with him. Otherwise, you might turn against him in the future. You might not be used to many of his habits, and he might not like your habits either ..." "In neo martial, we can only agree on one thing. The human King is the strongest ..."Li Hao laughed,"then senior is also in new martial ...""That's why I think he's the strongest. "The blood Emperor laughed."Of course. We are friends. It's okay. You'll get used to it." You'd better not go to new martial arts. If you go ... In a few years, you'll become a great general under the Supreme martial artist. The Supreme martial artist is indispensable for new martial arts. To outsiders, the Supreme martial artist is an unscrupulous person. ""It's actually the right choice for Wu Shan to leave neo martial arts. Otherwise ... He would've been one of the most capable generals in neo martial arts for three years at most!""At that time, it will be difficult to leave!""Senior ... In that case, the Supreme martial artist and the human King have found out ..." Li Hao laughed in spite of himself."They know it very well, and they don't care about what others say.""The reason why I'm telling you this is that you have control over time," the blood Emperor said."You need to have some strength. Once you're subdued by the neo martial artists and lose this strength ... You won't be able to escape time! I actually hope that you can walk out of Zhan Tiandi's influence and walk out of the influence of time ... But I'm worried about second cat's recovery. I'm worried that you've been greatly affected and second cat thinks you're Zhan Tiandi, so he chose to come. "Li Hao was deep in thought.The blood Emperor laughed."But you don't have to worry too much. Just live your own life. Everyone has their own way of living. I'm just giving you some suggestions. If you think that the Dragon Master is dangerous and need to join forces with Xinwu, Xinwu will not refuse.""Many thanks."Li Hao didn't ask any more questions. The blood Emperor's arrival seemed to be just for a look. He didn't say anything specific, but it gave Li Hao some thoughts.Looking at the pillar of lightning in front of him, the power of lightning appeared in the surroundings, and it was extremely powerful.At this moment, the Thunderbolt master and sovereign Wushan were both resisting the lightning tribulation.The two grade 8 experts had blocked the lightning tribulation for them. This was a rare experience.Li Hao stopped talking about Shi Guang and turned to the pillar of lightning, smiling."This should be Dao, but Dao is an existence that has a physical form. It has turned into a pillar of lightning. How strong is that?" "What's the difference between the Dao and the world?"The blood Emperor laughed."I've heard that you've transformed your Dao into a realm. Why can't that lightning pillar be a realm?"Li Hao was stunned. He looked around and said,""You're right. ""The lightning pillar in the middle is actually not dangerous. The danger lies at the edge. The lightning pillars at the edge are equivalent to the exit of the Dao net. The opening must be very sharp and can't allow people to leave at will ... So if you want to try, you can try the lightning pillar in the middle. Try as little as possible at the edge."The blood Emperor then added,""Your strength is not inferior to mine, and your knowledge is not less than mine. I'm just giving you a suggestion. Besides ... Your Dao world seems to be on the outside. I don't really understand your path, but I know one thing. The human King has turned his Dao into an inner world!"He continued,"your Dao is somewhat similar to that of a Supreme Being. A Supreme Being's 1000 bodies merged into one. A book of great Dao, a Dao on a page, a monarch on a page, and finally became a book of great Dao. Your connection with the thousand realms may need to be closer. I realized that you have a sense of external Dao towards the thousand realms, the long river of great Dao, and the Dao domain. You did not hide it. Do you have other thoughts?"He didn't say that Li Hao was wrong. At Li Hao's level of cultivation, he had even reached the seventh-rank in a short time. He wouldn't say that Li Hao was wrong.However, he was a little confused.It was also a reminder.The river of Dao had always been outside, and the thousand worlds had always existed in the river of Dao. In fact, Li Hao had a flaw. It was just that not many people paid attention to him at the moment. They only felt that Li Hao was very powerful!But ... Was Li Hao's original body very strong?No, not strong.If someone really took advantage of this, as long as they could find a way to avoid the river of Dao and the sword of thousand worlds and deal with Li Hao's main body, Li Hao would not have much defense or counterattack power.Of course, an expert at that level might be able to kill Li Hao without using this method. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  However, neo martial arts emphasized the unity of man and Power.The inner world of a human King was the greatest embodiment of this. In fact, human Kings did not care much about the power of the Yin Yang world. That was only the external. What was more important was the strength of the inner world.Even if the yin-yang world was broken through and the human King suffered some losses, it might not be as terrifying as one might imagine.At this moment, Li Hao thought for a moment. He originally didn't want to say it, but now he took the initiative to tell the whole story."Right now, I'm trying out a few different cultivation methods. My ultimate goal is to return to my original self and become one with all the DAOs! The so-called one is still me!""The release of the long river of Dao is also for the convenience of separation and experimentation ... So as not to cripple yourself."

Chapter 3328 Doing As One Pleases (6)
"I have some ideas," Li Hao explained."My blood is the river, my bones are the foundation, my Dao meridians are the boundary, and my cells are the walls ... I can cultivate my own chaos! The river of Dao is one of the methods I'm using to simulate this method ... So, in the end, this River will definitely be abandoned ... Of course, I can't be sure if it will succeed, it's just an idea ..."The blood Emperor was silent.He glanced at Li Hao for a long time, then said softly,""I've underestimated you. Maybe ... The human King and the others have underestimated you too! However, you'll have to spend a lot of energy and effort to do that. Your winding river has been trained to be very powerful, so powerful that it's unbelievable ... You ..."Li Hao, however, didn't care much."It's all stolen power. I didn't cultivate it myself!"Li Hao explained,"in fact, the power is very mixed. It's not integrated. It only appears to be integrated after devouring an eighth-tier universe. This gave me some ideas on how to transform myself into a universe and completely seal myself so that my power won't leak out ... It's a relatively successful attempt."It was rare for Li Hao to encounter a powerhouse from the neo martial world. At this moment, he took another example."Senior, the myriad DAOs of time are ever-changing. Time will pass, and the human cells will also constantly split and change. New life will replace the dead, and this is the key to the loss of lifespan!""Are there any similarities between the two?"He was confused,'if there is, does it mean that time and longevity are actually a great Dao, and the Dao itself comes from the human body? If the cells could be divided into 10000 DAOs and 10000 DAOs were stable, did that mean that they were immortal? It's said that when one dies, one's Dao will disappear. This so-called death of one's Dao, is it the Dao gone, or the person gone?"The ten thousand DAOs of time were fluctuating and changing.The cells in the human body were actually constantly dividing. Some died, and some were reborn.Both of them were moving forward.Dao meridians originated from the human body, and they were the source of Silvermoon's Dao. This actually meant that the source of the Dao was actually within the human body! The universe of the great path, it's just that you're too strong, and the human body can't bear it. Let your power leak out and find a place to settle it.The home of Dao was actually in the human body.When the body died, the Dao would disappear ... It meant that when the body died, the Dao would be gone, not the Dao would die and the body would disappear!At that moment, even the blood Emperor was a little dazed.He glanced at Li Hao. This guy ... Really had a lot of ideas.He was silent for a while before exhaling."I can't give you any more advice. You seem to have always been firm in your thoughts and have never changed. Perhaps, the human King and I have misunderstood."They might have really misunderstood. This person wasn't focused on time but was observing it. In the end, he incorporated the characteristics of time into his own system.This person ... Was he really just a Silver Moon person, an extremely young Silver Moon person?If he had inherited the talent and will to fight, Li Hao might have inherited wisdom.Or rather, a thirst for knowledge!This person seemed to like and hope to study the Dao thoroughly, to completely become ordinary, to be completely connected with the human body. In his eyes, the fragile human body seemed to be a treasure, the true source of the Dao!According to Li Hao ... Everyone's greatest treasure wasn't their Dao universe or anything else, but themselves!This idea was actually quite terrifying.At this moment, Li Hao said,"I have another idea ... I've never been able to realize it before. I didn't have the opportunity to realize it either. Now, you're here, seniors. Senior Wushan is here, and senior Thunderbolt master is here too ..."Li Hao thought for a while."Today, since everyone is here," he said,"perhaps I can try. I wonder if you are willing to help me?"Everyone looked at him. At this moment, they were still immersed in Li Hao's concept of the Daoist origin of the human body.Li Hao looked at Dao Qi."Senior Dao Qi, I want to place my Qianjie into the chess board of Dao Qi. Then ... Today, I want to separate time a little and introduce it into the corresponding Dao ... Then, I will be in it and correspond it with my Dao meridians. Then ..."He paused for a moment before continuing,"then, seniors, you tore me apart completely. Do me a favor, seniors. Bury me under the pillar of lightning in accordance with my Dao and in the corresponding order! I want to try and see if I can completely envelop the lightning territory with my Shi ... And temporarily become the master of the lightning territory to observe its specific composition ..."Even the blood Emperor was stunned.Li Hao explained,"it's too troublesome and cumbersome to observe them one by one!" Don't worry, this isn't the Dao of seeking death. I think that DAOs, especially when all DAOs are one, actually have some similarities. They won't die easily, at most losing a part of the body ...""If I succeed, perhaps I will have a deeper understanding of the human body!" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  At this point, Li Hao was a little excited."I've always felt that Dao, chaos, worlds ... And even worlds might just be derivatives. The real treasure lies in the body!" "It's US. We've never been cultivating the Dao, but rather, developing our own potential ... The origin of the world gives birth to people, or perhaps life ... That life should be the origin and the end ..."He said it fantastically, but the few people's expressions kept changing.

Chapter 3329 Doing As One Pleased (7)
The blood Emperor was silent for a while before he said,""The human King cultivates yin and yang on the outside and heaven and earth on the inside. He also believes that the human body is the greatest treasure, but he's not as crazy as you, so he won't do it rashly, because...There are too many uncertainties! Right now, you have more important things to do ..."Li Hao shook his head."Wrong, I don 't. The human King's goal is to protect the new martial artists, but I ... Don't have a clear goal. If I do, it's ... I want to know what Dao is."Li Hao laughed."I admit that I don't owe anyone ... Alright, I owe a few Dao universes. I won't mention this. However, I don't have the absolute responsibility and obligation to protect everyone. Besides, with neo martial, I don't think the Dragon Master will be a big threat!""I want to ... Seek the Dao, ask the Dao, and understand the Dao!"Li Hao exhaled."Perhaps, I want to trace the origin of Dao and figure out the past, present, future, life and death, order, chaos, creation, and destruction in the true sense! In that case, I'll be the one cultivating Dao, and not the Dao cultivating me!"He laughed."This time, I've met you, senior. I've finally fulfilled one of my wishes. You're not fighting, and I'm not fighting either!" "I don't want to become a warrior, but I can't deny that he has affected me. His Dao, to me, may be the strongest, most complicated, and most invincible Dao I've ever seen and experienced ... So, I want to see how he can transform such a complicated Dao into time's Dao ... I also want to try it at this point. He's at level six, and I'm also at level six. Why can he master so much while I ..." What if we can only follow the route he set?"The blood Emperor was completely silent.The Thunderbolt master and the others 'expressions changed slightly.If he wanted to cultivate, he should just cultivate properly. Wasn't the purpose of cultivating to become stronger?What's the point of you getting to the bottom of this?Could it be that you'll be invincible if you figure it out?Why did he have to take the risk?They looked at the two cats and said,"you guys try to persuade him. He's gone crazy. He wants to cut himself up and try to merge with the lightning territory. If he's completely destroyed by the lightning pillar, won't he die?"He didn't die at the hands of the Dragon Lord, but played himself to death. Perhaps ... This was the greatest sorrow?Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't care. This wasn't a tragedy. If he really died, he would die on the path of Dao. 'I want to take a look and see the essence.'Only when I see it clearly will I know if my choice is right or not.If he were to succeed this time, he would have a thorough and clear idea of his future path. At that time, he would be his true self. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t   As for dying here, what would happen to the Silvermoon?Everyone has their own meaning and value in life, and silver Moon won't completely disappear without me. Even if he really does, it's inevitable. Li Hao isn't the king of men.The human King, the human King of neo martial arts. Li Hao did not think he was the human King of Silver Moon.He only hoped that the silvers could rise to power, and not that he had to protect them forever.It just so happened that the two rank eights and the blood Emperor were here today. This expert who played with the way of blood Qi might be able to help him.Li Hao was eager to try. He found it very interesting."Dao chess, Thunder region, and time. The three great DAOs in the world are all with me. I might be able to find the common point completely and create a great Dao system that belongs to me. Who said that time is the only one?Perhaps, ten thousand DAOs could be changed at will?To become whatever one wanted to become, to do as one pleased, perhaps that was the true essence of Dao.Time, tribulation, and space were just one of the many forms of transformation.Li Hao fell into a fantasy. At this moment, he was like a child, full of wild and imaginative thoughts. He was even more excited.
