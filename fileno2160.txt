The ninth Division commander's mind wandered for a moment.He recalled some past events.After a long time, he nodded and said,"yes!" "When we were young, he was more powerful than me and had more talent than me. However, he always liked to act weak. Once ... He had a private fight with some of his playmates. He beat everyone up. Everyone knew about it and saw it ... But in the end, everyone except him was punished. The elders warned us not to always bully him! "At that time, he was very weak, but we all knew that he was stronger than us ... Everyone was very aggrieved, but even if we explained, our family wouldn't listen or believe us ..."Everyone had clearly suffered losses and been beaten up by him. In the end, the one who was punished was someone else, and he was the one who everyone was concerned about. This was something that the ninth Division commander could still remember clearly.He sighed and continued,"after that, he used the excuse that he was working hard to become stronger. He was very strong, stronger than all of us. He beat everyone up again. This time, the elders still didn't punish him. Because ... He said that he was working hard to take revenge! The elders praised him again, saying that he would take revenge for any grudge and fight for his martial arts. He was indeed a good man of the Li family! "Then ... My playmates and I were taught a lesson by my family. There were so many of us, but we couldn't even beat a sickly person ... My parents said that you helped outsiders bully your brother ..."What kind of grievance was that!"When?" Li Hao gasped."Seven or eight years old!"“……”Li Hao clicked his tongue and thought, this method ... Is amazing! First, I beat you up in secret, then I beat you up in public, and you were even beaten up by your parents twice ... In other words, you were beaten up four times, but you couldn't do anything about it ..."The ninth Division commander was embarrassed. Yes, that was the case.So ... When he reached the peak, he didn't even stay in sword city. He left immediately. It was too unbearable to be with that person. Ever since he was young, he had been a bad example. His brother, on the other hand, was the child of other families that everyone talked about.However, his friends all hated him, but there was nothing they could do about it.At this moment, Li Hao smiled,"if that's the case ... It's normal for him to do such a thing!" I want everyone to know that I was a part of it, but I was just a foil. The real protagonists are the Zheng family ... They also took the opportunity to cover up many things. Amazing!"At this moment, he was certain.Li Hao quickly did some calculations. There were some things that no one would believe even if you told them.If you go to Zheng Yu and the red moon sovereign and tell them, they will think you are an idiot.Li daoheng?We know!He was just a minor character!You still want to scheme against us?What a joke!We're a venerable sovereign and a half-step sovereign, how could we be tricked by him?How was that possible?"The young master of the Zheng family is a burden ..."Li Hao suddenly laughed."Zheng Yu wouldn't say that about himself. He wouldn't admit that he's a burden. But in fact, in your brother's eyes, he's just a burden. A burden to everyone!" Self-confidence, pride, complacency, and arrogance! Such a Zheng Yu, with his strong talent, was very suitable to become the leader of the rebel army on the surface! When everyone thought so, say, in the end, your brother came forward to clean up the mess. Wouldn't everyone be grateful to him? "Perhaps ... After returning to neo martial, even human King would look at him in a different light. Everyone thinks that he endured the humiliation and finally turned the tables, saving silver Moon and neo martial ...""He betrayed ..." The ninth Division commander said."What if he said that he was being controlled and broke free from it, then he endured the humiliation to kill Zheng Yu and get rid of the red moon sovereign? All the insiders are dead. Who can prove that he really betrayed us?"The ninth master was distracted for a moment.After a long time, he nodded."If he really deals with the Zheng family and the red moon Supreme Emperor, resurrecting the Silver Moon and opening the Stargate to return to new martial arts, everyone will be grateful to him!" You're indeed the Li family's Qilin son!"At this moment, he somewhat believed it because that was his brother. He had always been like this since he was young. Everyone would praise him!However, at this moment, her feelings were even more complicated.According to Li Hao, his brother was even more terrifying than venerable sovereigns ... How could that be possible? "Then ... What about the rest of the Li family?"He suddenly asked, and Li Hao said softly,""They're dead, all dead!""What?""He killed me!""That's normal," Li Hao said calmly."The Li family must know something, including the seal ...""Impossible ..." The ninth master was stunned."If they all die, how did you ... Get the Li family bloodline from the outside world?" he suddenly asked."First, the bloodline he left behind."Li Hao laughed."Second, let's get a random member of the Li family to come out with the starry sky sword. Not everyone will know the situation.""Third, strip some dead people of their bloodline and convert them. Is it that difficult for experts?""Fourth, perhaps there is no such thing as the Li family bloodline. It's just that some sword venerable aura remained on the starry sky sword and changed some people. Why can't the real Li family bloodline control the starry sky sword?""What?" Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ "The starry sky sword has always been in your hands ..." The ninth Division commander was stunned."I'm using the starry sky sword. It has nothing to do with bloodline!"“……”The ninth Division commander was completely dumbfounded."Hehe ..." Li Hao grinned."If that's the case, li daoheng must be very surprised. The starry sky sword has actually been used ..."At this moment, Li Hao was laughing heartily.What does it have to do with your teacher?Li Hao smiled but didn't say anything. From the very beginning, he had used the starry sky sword because of the five birds technique!Li Hao still didn't understand why the starry sky sword could be used in the five birds technique.Why?This had nothing to do with bloodline!His teacher could also use the Zhang family's saber, but it couldn't be said that his teacher had the Zhang family's bloodline. The five birds technique had broken through some bloodline restrictions.The five birds technique corresponded to the five types of Shi and the five elements ...Perhaps it was related to the great Dao!All kinds of thoughts emerged in Li Hao's mind again. He looked at the five elements region and began to miss it. Teacher, when will you be resurrected?If you were still here, perhaps I would have an easier time.Also, the great Dao and Shi should have an even closer connection. Li daoheng had been unable to find the great Dao universe all this time. Perhaps it was related to Shi, or perhaps the other party had never paid attention to the appearance of Shi.That was until he and his teacher used force to enter the Dao universe.Momentum originated from heaven and earth!The Dao originated from heaven and earth!

Momentum was a fusion of heaven and earth and originated from heaven and earth.The most crucial point of the new era's martial masters was momentum.As for Li Hao, he had fused Shi with the divine text, and the divine text had fused with the great Dao. Thus, when he used the divine text, he was using Shi. Thus, he entered the bright star sector.At this moment, Li Hao fell into deep thought.Even without Shi, one could still comprehend the great Dao.,m However, with this, there might be some differences.He recalled the time when he had just comprehended force and the five major forces. His teacher once said that force could form a domain, and a domain could form a world of its own. The only use of Li Hao's domain was to act as a protective shield for neo martial artists.Shi increased one's strength, but it was not as fast as breaking one's meridians.Thus, Li Hao only cultivated his force and didn't delve into it.Back then, he had wanted to comprehend the force of ten thousand DAOs, comprehend ten thousand DAOs, and fuse ten thousand divine texts ... But later on, he realized that it was too troublesome. He had to break his meridians and open his Dao directly. That would be faster.However, at this moment, he fell into deep thought.Force domain!It enveloped the world!It was independent of heaven and earth, and even rejected the interference of heaven's will and heaven and earth.The aura seemed to be unusual.The key to the five birds technique was actually the fusion of the five major forces. His teacher had used the power of the fusion of the five Forces to hold back a Saint. At that time, his teacher had only been at the middle stage of the sun Moon realm.It was incomparably terrifying to fight above one's realm!Previously, Li Hao had already stopped caring about force due to his rapid progress.But at this time, because of li daoheng, he fell into deep thought again."Power forms a domain, gaining insight into the heaven and earth, and even annexing the heaven and earth, devouring the heaven and earth ... The ancient king used his inner world and devoured the universe of origin, thus becoming the master of the great Dao and the master of the world ..."The field that his teacher had been studying had some shadow of the ancient King's inner world.This was also a broad path!He looked at the Galaxy again. There were thousands of great DAOs, but Li Hao was only relying on the divine text of the word "Dao" to maintain some control. In fact, because he did not have much insight, he had given up on the Enlightenment of the supernormal Dao Meridian and focused on cultivating the attribute-less Dao Meridian, hoping to convert it to sword arts."Li daoheng ... According to what I think, he might have already entered the bright star sector. He might even ... Be like me, in another region of the great Dao universe, ruling over a part of the great Dao stars ... For example, the stars of the Prophet God and the others have yet to be discovered.""If a conflict were to break out in the great Dao universe in the future, the only thing I can rely on in the great Dao universe is the 'Dao' word divine text ... It seems ... I might not be able to defeat him!""The first moon goddess's star might also be among them. As the first God since ancient times, her Natal star might be terrifyingly powerful. Right now, it might also be in li daoheng's territory."The universe was too vast. So far, Li Hao had only explored a small part of it. For example, he didn't know where Zhang an's Natal star was.In fact, he didn't even know where many of them were.The speculation he had just made gave him some ideas and a sense of urgency. The enemies on the surface were all revealed.This time, the enemy he had come to the West to find was the Li family. However, things seemed to be more troublesome than he had imagined. He had imagined that li daoheng of the Li family might also be a Heavenly King.However, he, who had killed a Heavenly King before, was not afraid.But what if ... The other party was not just a Heavenly King?"Now, all my methods have been exposed, and I no longer have any secrets. Everyone knows about my situation and some of my arrangements in the great path universe, including the existence of heaven battling city!""And the moon ..."  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. The moon's existence was perhaps to monitor everyone, to monitor the entire world.Li daoheng didn't create the moon just to hide it.Instead ... The entire world is in my eyes!Nothing can escape my sight.Perhaps, everything that everyone did, no matter big or small, be it conspiracies or schemes, was all in the eyes of the other party.This person ... Might really be monitoring the world.This was the real mastermind behind the scenes.As for Zheng Yu and venerable Emperor Red Moon, they were both trapped in relics or seals and did not know much about the world. It was the same for Li Hao and the others, which was why they were defeated time and time again.Thousands of thoughts emerged.Li Hao came to a conclusion. Right now, li daoheng didn't care about anyone and was only watching the show. Perhaps he had absolute confidence in suppressing everyone.In his eyes, everyone was probably just a clown.And he was actually being monitored by the other party.Even when he opened his Dao Meridian, he was under the other party's supervision."Force is intangible and formless ...""Form a domain, engulf the heavens and earth, and isolate the will of the heavens ..."At this moment, he finally understood what the martial masters of the new era needed."The sword Dao divine power formed by attribute-less Dao meridians is very powerful. This is inevitable! However, the other party might know that attribute-less divine arts can form sword Dao divine arts. If he studies the Dao Meridian, he might know what my trump card is ... Sword Dao divine arts!"That meant that he had nothing to hide in front of the other party and no secrets to speak of.Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle!Li daoheng knew him well, but he didn't know li daoheng well enough."If he wanted to refine the red moon sovereign ... The seal would not have been broken so easily! Zheng Yu and the others have been worried that the seal would be broken once they walked out. Perhaps ... Li daoheng gave them the wrong impression to trap them!"

2162 Chapter 364
Li Hao thought to himself.If his guess was right, would li daoheng let Red Moon Emperor break the seal and walk out so easily? It won 't!That was why the father and son of the Zheng family had never dared to walk out ... They didn't even dare to try. They had such a thought in their hearts. If I come out, the seal will be broken. How did such a thought come to be?Someone must have been influencing him or interfering with him through heaven's will and the heavens. The most suitable person was the moon goddess!The moon was here!Thinking of this, Li Hao came to a realization. If Zheng Yu forced his way out, perhaps ... It wouldn't have much of an impact. Even the spatial slicer couldn't do anything to him, but he could actually walk out!"This is ... Laughable!"Li Hao suddenly laughed in a self-deprecating manner. Zheng Yu must be a chess piece, but he himself didn't know that. He always felt that he could change everything, that he was the favored child of heaven and earth, and that he was an existence with unparalleled talent.He felt that the moment he came out was the moment Red Moon Emperor was unsealed. Perhaps ... It was all an illusion!It was useless even if he came out.The seal would not be broken. The key to the seal was the Silver Moon where yueshen was, the eight trigrams Qiankun formation, and Ying Hongyue, the key chess piece."There's one more thing. Li daoheng has the power of the Crimson Moon. In fact ... He has more than me! The moon goddess's body is still above the red moon Emperor. The red moon Emperor used the power of the red moon to resist the seal. The moon goddess's body may have been constantly absorbing the power of the red moon. If li daoheng was absorbing it and transmitting it through the Silver Moon's body, he would have entered the universe of the great Dao ... That means that this person may have absorbed the power of countless great DAOs!"Li Hao's expression changed slightly."In this case, his strength will definitely improve rapidly and even surpass mine. However, I've mastered the divine text of 'Dao'. If he wants to break through his limits, he must do one thing ... The favor of the heavens!"Li Hao was favored by the heavenly Dao, so he could become infinitely strong.Li daoheng should have been a step slower than him. The other party might be infinitely powerful in the Dao universe now, but if he wanted to walk out, he had to do one thing-the favor of heaven's will!The will of the heavens!Li Hao's eyes flickered. In that case, li daoheng could either find a way to obtain the approval of heaven's will or ... Directly plunder it!How to plunder?Without a trace of heaven's will, it was actually very difficult to plunder it, unless heaven's will was gathered near some people, such as the king of Dali, Li Hao, the moon goddess ... And the fake Moon Goddess.In addition, there was the great wilderness!The White Horse.After dealing with that White Horse, heaven's will would definitely gather and invade the great wilderness, strengthening heaven's will ...At this moment, Li Hao continued to deduce.He wasn't making wild guesses.As long as one line was determined, the other lines could be derived.Therefore, if li daoheng wanted to come out of the moon, he had to do one thing, which was to plunder the will of heaven."He might not be able to make it out himself ... At least for now, if he surpasses me, he won't be able to make it out! Heaven and earth won't allow a new Dao to surpass me ... It will attract the attention of the will of heaven and the heavenly Dao. " "Therefore, heaven's will is his top priority!""The Heaven's Will in my body is also very dense ... This might be very dangerous! "The fake moon goddesses and the real Queen are also favored by heaven's will, and they are one of the key steps in his plan to obtain heaven's will. If I had killed the Queen before, she might have instantly broken through to the Saint-level! However, if I don't kill her, the Queen won't be able to break through ... The other party is also controlling the speed of her improvement. "At this moment, he was enlightened!Li Hao had seen through the use of the Queen."Ying Hongyue must also be a chess piece that he set up! First, weaken the power of venerable sovereigns! Second, it could interfere with the judgment of Zheng Yu and venerable Red Moon Emperor. Third, it might also be a step to attract the Heaven's Will ...""Even I ... Am a pawn!"Li Hao suddenly thought of something. The Li family's starry sky sword is in my hands, and it's very likely that li daoheng brought it out on purpose. Perhaps it's also used to attract the will of the heavens.Even without a new Dao, the other party would still be able to capture heaven's will.  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  What about the king of Dali?The one who still had the will of heaven was the king of Dali.Was the king of Dali his chess piece?"Good move. You're using everything in the world as chess pieces?""Sun Xin's survival might not be an exception. He left it behind on purpose. Through sun Xin's mouth, he revealed the Zheng family's betrayal. He also revealed himself. The Zheng family was the main force while he was the support. Some things could be explained reasonably ...""The bloodline of the eight great families ..."At this moment, Li Hao's eyes flickered. What was so special about the bloodlines of the eight great families?Perhaps it wasn't the bloodlines of the eight great families that were special, but rather the duties and missions of the eight great families.Who was it?The blood Emperor!Li Hao's expression suddenly changed.Yes, blood Emperor.His blade could only be approached by the bloodline of the eight great families. The eight divisions of heaven and earth was actually separated by him. Even the eight trigrams Qian Kun Grand formation was set up by the blood Emperor, which was the Grand formation that was sealing the venerable sovereign.This wasn't set up by venerable the sword, as he wasn't good at setting up formations."Blood Emperor ..."Li Hao murmured again. At this moment, he seemed to have seen through more things.He vaguely understood some things. The eight great families weren't special, what was special was that when the eight great families were building their city, the other party had even personally gone to heaven battling city, giving it a special meaning.The blood Emperor might be planning something in the small world.As a result, the eight great families had been given a mission by him, which resulted in the eight great families "bloodlines being special because their mission had not yet been completed.

2163 Chapter 364
Ying Hongyue's gathering of the bloodlines of the eight great families must be related to the saber of the blood Emperor and the item in the saber.The blood Emperor might have just set up a trap. He might not have done it to guard against Red Moon Emperor. He might have done it for the cat in the knife. Li daoheng might have known something and used it to trap Red Moon Emperor.Some riddles were becoming clearer.As for venerable the sword ... Did he play a role in this?Venerable sword was unhappy with what the blood Emperor had done to the small world, so he had ordered li daoheng to do something?But ... He had seen the blood Emperor persuading the sword Master to devour the small world.Could it be that the blood Emperor was trying to do something because the sword Saint was unwilling to devour it?"Who cares!" This, he would not consider it for the time being.At this moment, Li Hao smiled.Perhaps he had learned of the eight great families "uniqueness.As for li daoheng, he also probably knew that the eight great families weren't the only special ones, but the eight divine weapons. These divine weapons had been left out in the world for the sake of bestowing the so-called bloodline power of the eight great families to those who were outside.As for the bloodline of the eight great families in the ancient city, they must have come into contact with the eight great divine weapons in the early years.Old turtle!At this point, he thought of the old turtle, the only divine weapon that still had its own consciousness.Whether the eight great families 'divine weapons or their bloodlines were the key ... The old turtle might know. Of course, he might not know the key, but he definitely knew whether his birth was related to the blood Emperor.At this moment, the old turtle was not there.However, there was someone beside him.Li Hao turned to look at the ninth Division commander, who had not left yet, and said,""Who forged the turtle Guardian?""What?""I say, who forged this tortoiseshell?"The ninth Division commander was stunned for a moment. He thought about it and said,""This ... I've had it since I was very young. I don't know ... But general Huai might know."Li Hao instantly disappeared.In the next moment, he appeared in front of general Huai.General Huai hurriedly transformed into a human. Li Hao did not make any small talk and directly said,""Who created the turtle Guardian?"General Huai was also stunned for a moment. He thought for a while before he said,"Guardian turtle ... Using the souls of demons to forge divine weapons has actually been abandoned a long time ago. After the human King unified the world, it was no longer allowed! Therefore, turtle Guardian's main body was born in the early stage of the new martial arts. "He then added,'it should ... Should be from the blood Emperor! This was because the Wang family was a branch of the blood Emperor. In the past, they were also from yang city. Yang city was the home of the human King, the blood Emperor, and the strongest beginner martial God, the sun god. The turtle protecting the body must have been a protective item given to the Wang family by the blood Emperor a long time ago, right?"It wasn't sure, but the fact that the monster race's venerable sovereigns dared to use a divine weapon made with the soul of the monster race in the later stages meant that they didn't say anything. He definitely had a background.Otherwise, the monster race also had venerable sovereigns. Would the Wang family dare to use them?And he even used it so openly?Li Hao heaved a sigh of relief and nodded."Is the creation of the starry sky sword related to the blood Emperor?""This ... I'm not sure. It's rumored that it was jointly created by the human King and the forging sovereign.""How's the relationship between the blood Emperor and the sword Lord?"Li Hao asked after some thought."This ..."General Huai was a little apprehensive, but he still said, "It's good, it's pretty good! His Majesty, the human ruler, the iron head Emperor, the blood Emperor, the God-splitting Emperor, the sword venerable, the Supreme venerable, and Emperor Cang all had a very good relationship with each other! In the new martial era, there was actually another faction that was very strong, and that was the star suppression city! The heaven suppression Supreme Emperor of star suppression city had unparalleled combat strength and was the disciple of sun god. Sun god was the strongest beginner God and a top existence who traveled the universe alone. He could even fight against World Masters! Therefore, because this faction is too strong, although they have a good relationship with the human King...In comparison, they are slightly weaker. "Li Hao nodded slightly. Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ "When the eight main cities were established, the blood Emperor personally came to Silver Moon?" he asked."Yes.""Does the sword Saint know?""Of course! The name heaven battling city was given by the blood Emperor, so it's only natural that Sword Saint knows about it. "Li Hao nodded, somewhat enlightened."Emerald light sword, longevity sword, bloody Lion King fist, celestial ruler boxing glove, human king's sword, blood Emperor's saber, soul-splitting spear technique ..." He continued."Do these inheritances all belong to the human King and blood Emperor?""Yup, Azure light sword, bloody Lion King fist, they're both combat techniques from mcmau's powerhouses!"Li Hao continued."The ancestor of the Zhang family. I'm talking about the sabersmanship of the Zhang family in dingtian city. It should be from the line of the human Emperor, right?""Yes,"At this point, general Huai could not help but say,"Everyone belongs to the human King's side. I'm just saying that there are two groups under the human King. I'm not saying that star suppression city doesn't belong to the human King's side. Please don't misunderstand me, my Lord."It's not a good thing that you can distinguish things so clearly.He said it as if neo martial had an internal strife.Li Hao didn't mean it that way, but he had a general idea that Silver moon's heritage was not from the system of Star Town City, while the secret techniques of Star Town City were actually passed down from the Zheng family and the other families.Of course, this was not that important.However, he deduced that the venerable sword and the blood Emperor must have made some other agreements. They must have other goals that they wanted to achieve in Silver Moon. It was just that they did not have the time.The inheritances that the two of them had left behind should be more inclined to their side.

2164 Chapter 364
After some consideration, Li Hao said,"the concept of force didn't appear in a short time. In the neo martial era, there's also the concept of force, right?""Yes,""It's just that there wasn't a detailed system at that time. It only said that people who gathered invincible might wouldn't specialize in cultivating might, right?""Yes,"General Huai was confused by the question.Li Hao thought for a while and continued,""So, the combat technique system of neo martial actually has some connections with momentum. When cultivated to the extreme, one can even form momentum, right?""I ... I don't know."How would I know about this! It was very depressed. 'I'm just a tree, and I've never cultivated neo martial combat techniques.'However, it thought for a moment and said,""If people today cultivate ancient martial arts and can cultivate force, it might be related to the disappearance of the great Dao of origins! Before the great Dao of origins disappeared, combat techniques were cultivated to the extreme, which should be comprehending the origins! To form one's own Dao within one's essence, there were sabers, Spears, swords, halberds, axes, hooks, forks, metal, wood, water, fire ... All DAOs in the world were no different from this! "Force, according to my understanding, should be a form of essence that can no longer be cultivated, so it will spread out and form a special system ... A system that can attach itself to heaven and earth, to a new Dao! "In reality, force should also be able to attach itself to the Dao of origin and form the great Dao of origin!"Li Hao's eyes flickered. This statement was very interesting!The appearance of force could be due to the disappearance of the origin and the inability to connect to the great Dao of origin, thus forming force. Now that a new Dao had appeared, it could be attached to the new Dao. It could be considered a product that connected to the great Dao.As for Shi, it could form a domain that could connect and block the heavenly Dao and heaven's will at any time."Thank you, senior!" Li Hao kept nodding.General Huai was a little confused, but he didn't say much.Why are you thanking me?It didn't reply. As for its thoughts on Shi, they were just normal thoughts.But now, Shi didn't matter.Since Li Hao had begun to cultivate attribute-less Dao meridians and had given up divine powers and divine runes, it made no difference whether he had force or not.Just then, Li Hao suddenly said,""If, and I'm saying if ... When heaven and earth were first created, how could a world be created?"“……”This time, general Huai was dumbfounded.'This ... How would I know?You want to open a world?He was so high up!That was too far away!Li Hao didn't want to open up the world. He wanted to cut out the vast wilderness and cover it in his domain so that it wouldn't be invaded by heaven's will. Even if he expelled chaos, it would only remain within his domain.In this case ... Even if li daoheng succeeded in his plan to seize heaven's will, it would only be the present heaven's will, not the powerful one.He was going to devour the world!That's right, since everyone is trying to take over this world ... I'll cut out a part of it and use my domain to isolate it. I'll make it impossible for you to obtain the complete Silvermoon world!Would this work?He definitely could! Li Hao thought to himself, I'm not creating another world. I'm just putting the places that were invaded by chaos into my domain. In fact ... Why can't I capture the will of heaven?If chaos were to dissipate and heaven's will were to gather, why can't I capture heaven's will when I use my domain to cover a new world?He was in a trance!At this moment, both the ninth Division commander and Huai Shu were dumbfounded. They did not quite understand what Li Hao meant.Open a world?Does it have anything to do with you?Silver Moon is such a big world, and it's a question whether you can control it in your lifetime.Do you still want to open another world?Li Hao didn't ask any more questions. He only said softly,""That's all for now. By the way, don't think about what I said today, and don't ask. Just keep it in your hearts!"The two of them nodded and didn't say much.As Saints, they were extremely powerful. Even venerable sovereigns couldn't spy on them if they didn't want to say it."Then ..." The ninth Division commander asked."Murder!"Li Hao laughed."They won't die so easily if they kill Ying Hongyue and the Queen. I was worried that they would release that venerable sovereign if they died ... But now I'm sure that if I hunt them down, they'll definitely keep getting stronger!" Until you are strong enough ... To be my match!"The two of them frowned. Really?Become stronger just because you want to?You're a Saint!Furthermore, ordinary saints were no match for Li Hao.At this moment, Li Hao laughed. He was certain that those two wouldn't die so easily. Li daoheng wouldn't let them die. When Ying Hongyue was about to die, the power of the Crimson Moon would definitely surge into his body and help him become stronger!When the Queen was about to die, the power of the Silver Moon would enter her body and help her grow stronger.Moreover, the two of them might have thought that it was their own ability that had done it.They definitely wouldn't think that someone had given them this.Since they won't die so easily ... And the seal won't break so easily, then I ... Of course have to continue hunting them down and get them to provide me with more nourishment.Let them have no way to go to heaven or to hell!At the same time, it's also to gather more heaven's will by my side.In addition ... The king of Dali!Li Hao thought, the king of Dali is also favored by heaven's will, so how can I strip him of it?The more heaven's will he gathered, the more territory he would be able to occupy once his domain was formed. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Ying Hongyue actually doesn't have much heaven's will on her ... Is it because heaven's will doesn't favor him, or does he know that it's not a good thing for heaven's will to favor him?"This was also a problem.

If he knew, it would mean that this fellow had also figured out something.This is even more interesting!"Finally, I need to strengthen my domain and comprehend more Shi! Condensing more divine runes isn't to open Dao meridians, but ... To expand the domain!"What his teacher had wanted to do back then was to expand his domain and swallow the world.p Unfortunately, Li Hao didn't care.After discovering the Dao universe, he threw this matter to the side. He had already comprehended the Dao universe, so why would he still need a small domain?"So, teacher's death...Was it really just an accident? Or am I forced to face such an outcome ... Because he can not allow teacher to continue expanding!"At this moment, Li Hao's eyes turned sharp.It was his own decision to deal with boundless city. However, at that time, the situation forced him to do so. He had no choice, and neo martial was unwilling to help. The situation had been pushed to this point, so he had to do this.In that case ... Was there someone behind all this?Zheng Yu's clone had suddenly come out of seclusion and was bent on killing him. He had allied with the four countries and put the greatest pressure on him. He had not died, but his teacher's death might have been inevitable.There were three saints. If his teacher didn't use the five-element Dao Meridian fusion technique, how could he fight against one Saint?Other than himself, only his teacher had the ability to fight against a Saint!With the teacher dead, no one would go back to the research field.That was because everyone was studying the great Dao and the Dao Meridian. Who would have nothing better to do than to study a field that was not of much use?"It's probably ... Like this! In the end, my teacher still died on the five birds technique, on research that was beyond the era ..."Li Hao came to a conclusion. His teacher's death was not an accident. It was inevitable.His domain had already interfered with some things.Li Hao smiled. In that case ... Do you think I'll let you have your way?You haven't activated it yet because you still can't deal with venerable sovereigns, right?Then ... Let's race against time!At this moment, Li Hao instantly drew out several divine runes from the world. They were "metal, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, Thunder, light, dark swordsmanship". There were 11 divine runes in total, which were the 11 types of forces that Li Hao had comprehended.The power of the five elements was the strongest. For the other elements, the sword power was alright and the character of Dao was naturally given to it. The other elements were slightly worse.The 11 divine runes, with the 'Dao' rune as the core, united together. In an instant, they formed a ring of light. In the great Dao universe, they even formed an independent space.The ninth master was surprised to see this.Li Hao, on the other hand, thought for a while and extracted some power of a great Dao to break through this domain. In the end, his power of a great Dao couldn't be integrated into it.Li Hao's eyes flickered. He had never used the power of a domain in the Dao universe before.Only now did he realize that he could even isolate the power of great DAOs.Interesting!He looked into the depths of the universe. If li daoheng was also in the Dao universe, the power of his great Dao might be stronger than his ... But what if ... He isolated the power of his great Dao?Unfortunately, he was still too weak. There were only 11 divine runes.He was getting stronger and stronger, but he had abandoned the divine text and power. Perhaps this was the result that the other party wanted to see.Since when did he feel that his force and divine text were not powerful enough?Right!When he was dealing with the Queen, he felt that opening meridians and opening more Dao meridians would make him stronger. Divine arts and Dao meridians were too slow!After dealing with boundless city, this feeling had become more and more intense. Best novel online free at nσνEℓnєXт  The divine power Dao Meridian had to be comprehended every time. It was too troublesome ... How could it be compared to the attribute-less Dao Meridian, which could be opened as one wished?"If this is also part of your plan ... Then you're too capable!"Li Hao thought to himself,"you're really capable if you're able to take into account all the techniques I've cultivated."And this time, he had found some clues in the West.If li daoheng had been there when he approached the moon, would he have been surprised and nervous?Maybe not, maybe he would be even more excited?As Li Hao thought of this, the 11 divine runes disappeared.The next moment, he disappeared from the bright star sector.……In the Western divine Kingdom.Li Hao appeared in the world, but he didn't merge the divine runes into the world to form a territory.He suddenly smiled. There was one good thing about the Western divine nation. There was a lot of power of faith, a lot of great DAOs, and a lot of gods. As a result, some of the power of faith here actually had very unique attributes.He might be able to comprehend some unique forces here and form a unique divine text system.Attribute-less cultivation and Shi comprehension did not necessarily delay cultivation.However, this time, it wasn't to open meridians, but to ... Divide heaven and earth!He walked around, looked around, and comprehended heaven and earth ... It had been a long time since he had done this. Back then, he had suffered a lot in order to comprehend force, but now, he had abandoned it. It was such a pity.In an instant, Li Hao merged with the wind and disappeared. Behind him, the Black Panther quickly followed and also disappeared with the wind.……In the distance.Several figures quickly fled.Ying Hongyue kept frowning.Beside him, flying sword immortal and clear sky Mountain Lord had faces full of anger and despair. They had escaped time and time again. Until today, only the three of them were still fleeing from the three great organizations and clear sky divine mountain.The Queen's face was ashen.

The God nation was even worse!She was the only deity left.He had originally thought that a dozen undyings would have a high chance of defeating Li Hao, but what happened?The result was that the other party had brought a large number of experts with them."Shameless scoundrel!""Damn it!" The Queen was furious."He actually hid heaven battling city in the great path universe!"Who would have thought of this?Ying Hongyue didn't say anything. She looked around and said, "It's too late to say all this now! Find a way to contact the Zheng family and the red moon ... Their people were killed, and they should know that Li Hao has to control himself, or it'll be too late!"The Queen looked at him suspiciously.Li Hao didn't chase after them crazily. He had only killed them before letting them go. He had even told him some meaningful words at the end.And now, Ying Hongyue wanted to contact some experts ... Why did it seem like she was ... Continuously adding fuel to Li Hao's fire?Not only that ... Ying Hongyue's strength had been improving all along the way, and it had not slowed down at all.It seemed that every time someone else suffered a loss, his strength was actually constantly increasing.At this moment, the Queen was also a little more vigilant.This person's strength improved very quickly.Li Hao had been through hundreds of battles. He had dealt with all kinds of experts, killed without equal, discovered the great Dao, and even mastered the great Dao universe. He had killed Saints and Heavenly Kings ... To this day, Li Hao had only become a saint.As for himself, he was the reincarnation of the moon goddess.p However, Ying Hongyue ... This fellow had never fallen behind. Although she wasn't as good as a saint now, she wasn't that far off either. What he did was to keep running away. Was this even possible?The more he thought about it, the more he felt that there was a big problem with this person!Ying Hongyue shot a glance at the Empress and said in a soft voice,"Your Majesty, the more people we have, the safer we will be! Perhaps we can discuss this further. Hopefully, we can both reach the Dao integration stage! As for the dead ... At this point, we can only take care of ourselves. "At this moment, the heavenly clear sky Mountain Lord who had been silent all this while suddenly said softly,""Ying Hongyue, most of the others are already dead. You've been carrying me and the flying sword immortal all this time. We've been a burden and have worked hard ... Why don't you let us leave on our own?"There were so many people, but he didn't save them or care about them. Instead, he brought them along. No matter how dangerous it was, he still fought to save the leaders of the three great organizations and the heavenly clear sky Mountain Lord. Anyone would be moved.He was too loyal!But at this moment, the vast sky Mountain Lord was about to leave.Ying Hongyue raised her brows slightly and said in a soft voice,"Haotian, it's too dangerous for you to leave with your flying sword! Li Hao won't let you off so easily. With us here, you'll still be safe. Without us, you ... Will find it hard to survive!" The heavenly Mountain Lord didn't say anything else.As for flying sword immortal, his expression changed.""He might not come after us ...""No, no, no, I definitely will! He wants to get rid of my wings and make me feel lonely and desperate. Thus, he will kill everyone around me ... He won't be in a hurry to kill me. "Was it?The two of them did not say anything more, but the Queen seemed to have noticed something strange.Ying Hongyue was an unfeeling person!However, at this moment, it was still understandable if he had to bring flying sword immortal along. Ying Hongyue was famous for being lustful, but if he had to bring vast sky Mountain's Mountain Lord along ... It would indeed be a bit of a burden.Was he really that kind?And these two people were leaving ... Did they also sense something?Ying Hongyue didn't say anything else. She only looked around and said softly,"If he stays in the West and doesn't leave, we'll be in trouble! I can't die so easily, and neither can Her Majesty ... Red Moon sovereign didn't say anything, but the Zheng family understood ... We have to ask the Zheng family to send more powerful cultivators. Even an immortal might not be useful ... I'll try to make the forbidden Sea flip a little, and maybe we can increase the limit of the world again, and even let the Saint walk out!"The Zheng family was worried that the seal would break, so they definitely couldn't let Ying Hongyue and the Queen die.Therefore, no matter what, they would send someone to help.However, an undying fighter couldn't defeat Li Hao at the moment. It would be better if some Saints came."Saints can walk out?"The Queen was a little surprised. Ying Hongyue said softly, "I'll try! The forbidden Sea was still very powerful! Li Hao has reached the sage level, and the limits of heaven and earth change with him. Even if he can't walk out of the late-stage of the sage level, some early-stage sages might be able to. If one can't do it ... Three, five, seven, eight, or even more will be enough. ""The Zheng family still has so many sages?" p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The Queen was shocked."Where did so many come from?""It's been so many years and the other side has mineral veins. They still have a few sages. Furthermore, some of them even had the hope of reaching the Heavenly King level ...""Like this?"The Queen sank into deep thought. Ying Hongyue continued,"You and I need to reach the Dao integration stage as soon as possible. The Zheng family will open the door for us, and so will venerable Red Moon Emperor. If you and I become stronger, the power of the Silver Moon will weaken, and so will the seal. He'll be happy to see that happen ..."The Queen did not say anything.The red moon sovereign hoped that she could draw more of the Silver Moon's power to weaken the seal. The Zheng family also hoped that Ying Hongyue could draw more of the red moon's power to weaken the venerable sovereign and strengthen the seal.Therefore, the existence of the two of them barely maintained a balance.Now, neither side was willing to break this balance.

And this was their chance.However, the Queen was thinking in her heart,"why is Ying Hongyue so certain?"This guy seemed to be hiding a lot of things.'Damn it!'Why did it feel like everyone knew a lot of things, while he himself didn 't? Li Hao's words were inexplicable, and so was Ying Hongyue.She was a little angry, but there was nothing she could do.Because she didn't know anything, she could only follow Ying Hongyue. Otherwise, she was afraid that she would be killed by Li Hao if she was alone!At this moment, a sword will pierced through the sky and earth.The Queen's expression changed. Damn it, it's here again!Ying Hongyue also frowned slightly.It was too fast!That shouldn't be ... Li Hao hadn't waited for the Zheng family's people to arrive. According to Li Hao's thoughts, they shouldn't have arrived so quickly. He should have waited for the Zheng family's people to arrive before reaping their harvest, not now!Was there a problem?His expression changed slightly. This Li Hao ... His killing intent was so strong that he seemed to really want to kill them all!"Run!" p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Ying Hongyue shouted sternly. Li Hao attacked once again, breaking some of his plans. It seemed that he no longer wanted to be deserted by his friends and family. It was as if ... He just wanted to kill him!BOOM!The sword Qi soared into the sky, and the world changed colors.Behind them, Li Hao stepped on air with a Broken Sword in his hand. He was full of killing intent, but his face was very gentle."I'm afraid ... You can't escape!"Li Hao chuckled."Ying Hongyue, after playing for so long, it's about time we hit the road. It might be more interesting once the seal is broken!" I can't wait to see it ..."At this moment, Ying Hongyue didn't say a word and quickly fled.The Queen was also furious. She gritted her teeth and said,""Li Hao, you killed us and the red moon sovereign broke out of the seal. Is this what you want?""Only after killing them will we know if we can break the seal. If we don't kill them ... How do we know if we can break the seal and escape?"Li Hao's smile was gentle, and he was still laughing.A longsword swept across the sky and earth. At this moment, the few of them were extremely nervous. They kept fighting back and blocking while also running away. The Queen felt more Silver Moon Power entering her body and secretly heaved a sigh of relief.She was worried that she would not be able to use the Silver Moon's power.Ying Hongyue's expression, on the other hand, kept changing.How could that be?Li Hao ... Why did he want to kill him at this moment?Was he really not afraid of the seal breaking, or was there some other reason?This was because Li Hao seemed to be serious. He disappeared in an instant, and in all directions, li Haos appeared one after another. All kinds of great Dao divine abilities appeared, and the void cracked open. Heaven battling city even vaguely appeared!Suppressing the heavens and earth! This was not giving them a way out!The power of the Crimson Moon swept out from his body. At this moment, the forbidden Sea in the North suddenly trembled. The forbidden Sea was in chaos!……The forbidden Sea ran through the world.At this time, it seemed that everyone had received the news in advance. Silver Moon experts appeared on a huge Sea Road. The forbidden Sea swept in all directions, and countless energy burst out!In the Cang mountains, a large number of demons were suddenly devoured, and their screams resounded through the world.The Li Dynasty was also in constant turmoil, and the mountains were collapsing. The forbidden Sea spread rapidly and corroded everything.The Dali King's face was extremely ugly. He kept roaring and suppressing the forbidden Sea.On the other hand, although the forbidden Sea had also appeared in the central region, li Fuhai had appeared in borderless city, controlling the ancient city and suppressing the violent Forbidden Sea between heaven and earth!The energy instantly became incomparably dense.At that moment, the sky screen appeared and Lin Hongyu's voice resounded through the sky. She looked confident and calm."The number of new Dao cultivators in the world has increased, but there isn't enough energy. In order to give the cultivators a better cultivation environment, Marquis li ... I'm Governor li, has opened the seal of the world and the forbidden Sea area. Everyone, don't worry and just focus on your cultivation. However, don't step into the forbidden Sea area, as it has the effect of corroding everything!"In an instant, cheers and exclamations rang out from all over the world.Fanatical!They became fanatical again.The governor, no, the Marquis really took care of everyone. He knew that we didn't have enough cultivation energy, so he opened the seal of heaven and earth, the forbidden Sea ... No wonder there was such a big commotion!The Marquis was indeed a God. When he didn't make a move, it was fine, but when he did, it was enough to shake the earth and mountains!The entire world seemed to be changing.The energy was getting denser.At the same time, the experts continued to absorb energy, including some of the Crimson Moon's power.Ying Hongyue had once released a large amount of Crimson Moon Power in the forbidden Sea. Today, this Crimson Moon Power had also started to spread out. All the Silver Moon experts knew about this, but no one stopped them from absorbing the energy.This was also an order from the Marquis ... As for whether or not something would happen, the Marquis would deal with it.……In Hurricane city.Zheng Yu's expression changed. The forbidden Sea had awakened!And the people they sent out were all dead!Obviously, something had happened.Even if he hadn't contacted them, he knew that it was Li Hao who had killed everyone. He must be chasing after Ying Hongyue now. Ying Hongyue moving the forbidden Sea was also a message ... He couldn't hold on any longer!They needed reinforcements!Zheng Yu looked up at the sky. The seal was still there, but it was a little unstable. His expression changed slightly, and he said in a low voice,""The recovery of heaven and earth energy can barely accommodate some initial-level divine Dao cultivators ... I'll split my body. The others, come with me to the West!"Then, he pointed at a few people. In an instant, 8 Saints and his clone left together. There were a total of 9 Saints.It wasn't that he didn't want to do more, but if he left too much, he was worried that the seal would have problems and he wouldn't be able to suppress it in time.Li Hao!You're really crazy!You clearly know that you can't kill Ying Hongyue and the West's moon god, but you still insist on doing things your own way ... It seems that your teacher's death has already made you completely crazy!This was a mutual destruction!At this moment, he was not confident that he could deal with a venerable sovereign, even if the latter had been sealed for many years.If he could master the Silver Moon and the new Dao, he wouldn't be in such a passive position.The nine experts instantly left Hurricane city and disappeared in the blink of an eye.Zheng Yu's original body was still standing in the city, looking up at the sky. At this moment, the red moon sovereign was probably very happy.He kept frowning. If this went on, the seal would become weaker and weaker. Even if Ying Hongyue kept extracting the power of the red moon, it wouldn't work. He was a little anxious, and he thought of the ruins of Saturn city.Maybe ... He should send more people to the ruins in Star Town City.What he was afraid of was that the Saints of heaven battling city would all be there, which would be very troublesome.Zheng Yu gently rubbed his temples and sighed in his heart. It was really troublesome. A small new era cultivator actually gave him, a half-step sovereign, a huge headache.He really was a bastard!

2168 Chapter 365
- Western continent-Li Hao continued to attack.A powerful sword intent enveloped the area.At this moment, the energy concentration between heaven and earth increased. The power in Ying Hongyue's body was also constantly increasing. At this time, she was a little dejected.His face was extremely solemn.Li Hao was serious!He didn't think that Li Hao would really kill him. Li Hao was a smart person, and the smarter he was, the less likely he would kill him. Why did everything change?BOOM!The sword pierced through heaven and earth. Ying Hongyue's expression changed. In an instant, a long whip pierced through the void. It was the Zheng family's nine-section whip.Bang! Bang! The long whip was swept away. Behind him, Li Hao reached out and grabbed it. The long whip struggled violently, but Li Hao caught it firmly.The divine weapons of the eight great families, the wind-chasing boots, the Zhang family's stone saber, the starry sky sword, and the Hong family's hammer, had all been shattered by Li Hao. The Zheng family's nine-section whip, the Wang family's Black Tortoise armor, the Zhao family's boxing gloves, and the Zhou family's spear were all in Ying Hongyue's hands except for the Black Tortoise armor.At this moment, the nine-section whip was firmly grasped by Li Hao, which gave Ying Hongyue a chance to quickly escape.In front, the Queen was running faster than him.Ying Hongyue's expression also changed as she continued to flee. She was a little puzzled as she turned around to look at Li Hao. Was he acting ... Or was he really doing it?Just as he was thinking, suddenly, a bright light appeared between heaven and earth.At this moment, many figures suddenly appeared in Li Hao's vision. Divine runes turned into Li Hao, and all kinds of magical powers gathered. Li Hao's blood and Qi soared. With a roar, he shattered the Zheng family's nine-section whip and integrated it into the broken starry sky sword.He slashed out with his sword!BOOM!A deafening sound rang out.At the same time, Ying Hongyue's body trembled and a mouthful of blood spurted out. In the eight trigrams diagram above the Silver City, the eight trigrams belonging to the Zheng family instantly dimmed.At this moment, in Hurricane city.In an instant, Zheng Yu's clone appeared and instantly turned into qi and blood, fusing into the eight trigrams diagram. Zheng Yu, who was in the city, had an ugly expression.Li Hao ... Was really determined to kill Ying Hongyue. Furthermore, he was determined to break the seal.He should have known that every time a divine weapon was broken, the seal would be weakened.But even at this point, Li Hao was still breaking.This could only mean that Li Hao had really gone crazy!……Ying Hongyue had also completely given up on Li Hao's idea of not killing her.He would kill them! At this moment, Ying Hongyue didn't roar or feel despair. She was just extremely solemn as she rapidly fled. She still brought flying sword immortal and vast sky Mountain Lord with her. Even at this moment, she didn't give up on the two of them.The eight great bloodlines continued to shake.Li Hao had actually broken the Zheng family's nine-section whip.He should understand what kind of effect it would have if he continued to shatter the divine weapon.……Behind them.Li Hao broke the nine-section whip, smiled, and said softly,""Ying Hongyue, the Zhao clan's fist, the Zhou clan's spear, why don't you take them all out? By the way, you've been taking such good care of flying sword immortal and Haotian ... When are you going to take their lives?"The expressions of the two people caught by Ying Hongyue changed slightly.Ying Hongyue entered the void and said in an ethereal voice,"Li Hao, in order to kill me, you've resorted to all kinds of means. How can you say that I killed the two of them?"Li Hao unhurriedly followed them."How would I know?!" I only know that a lecherous demon like you doesn't even care about the death of your woman, let alone a few who will drag you down? All I know is that they were with you during the first revival, and they were all corroded by the Crimson Moon ...""I only know that the three great organizations are of the same breath and branch. Oh, maybe the four great organizations!""I only know that these two people participated in the recovery in the past, so their physiques should have been changed. Perhaps, they are more suitable to store the power of the Crimson Moon. Too much Crimson Moon Power will cause you to lose control a little ... However, they can be used to save your life at critical moments.""Are those two your Crimson Moon energy storage devices? Or am I thinking too much, and I'm just in love with them?"As soon as these words came out, the two people's expressions changed.Ying Hongyue, on the other hand, was still unflustered. Her voice and tone were as calm as ever."Li Hao, you're thinking too much. The two of them are only at the middle stage of the sun Moon realm. How much Crimson Moon Power can they save? Aren't you underestimating me by using them as memory devices?"Li Hao's eyes flickered.The two of them had the power of the Crimson Moon, but it wasn't as strong as he had imagined.However, he also couldn't think of why Ying Hongyue kept bringing them along.He had previously guessed that these two people might be tools that Ying Hongyue used to absorb the power of the red moon at critical moments. In the end, was he wrong?Ying Hongyue's words were not without reason.  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Of course, Li Hao was sure that these two people would be useful. As for what their use was, he was not a God, and he couldn't be omniscient.He was too lazy to guess.If they continued to pursue her, Ying Hongyue would definitely activate it when she reached a dead end.The void shattered again.Li Hao's speed increased.At this moment, Ying Hongyue's figure also became illusionary. Her speed also became faster and faster, and she had already caught up to the Queen. When the Queen saw that he was chasing after her, her expression changed. She turned around and wanted to leave this guy.Li Hao's desire to kill him was greater than killing him.Just as she had this thought, Ying Hongyue sent a voice transmission to her. "Don't run! If we join forces, we can still hold on for a while. If nothing goes wrong, someone will come to save us very soon. The moment we separate ... That will be the time of our deaths! If Li Hao really wants to kill someone now ... He won't be spared!"

2169 Chapter 365
The queen's heart moved.Ying Hongyue continued,"continue to mobilize the power of the Silver Moon. The Silver Moon is the foundation of the entire world. Its power is endless! With the Queen's power, if you were to fully recover, only venerable sovereigns could kill you in the past ... It wouldn't be that easy for Li Hao to kill us!"Then, he turned around, only to be shocked to find that Li Hao was only a few feet away!In an instant, Ying Hongyue was greatly alarmed. Suddenly, an eight-trigram diagram appeared like a seal. Eight streams of qi and blood roiled, and the power of the Crimson Moon overflowed as it headed straight for Li Hao!Li Hao slashed out with his sword. With a loud bang, the eight trigrams only trembled violently, but did not shatter.The eight trigrams enveloped Li Hao.At the same time, the Silver Moon Power in the Queen's body surged. With an angry roar, a scepter pierced through the air and smashed at Li Hao. Li Hao punched out, and the scepter was sent flying. Li Hao also staggered slightly. The next moment, the eight trigrams once again tried to seal him."Good move!"Li Hao was a little surprised.  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  This thing was used to seal venerable sovereigns in the past.This Ying Hongyue actually had such a method.BOOM!At this moment, a huge city came pressing down. The two words "battling the heavens" flickered with light as if they were pressing down from the great path of the universe. With a loud bang, the eight trigrams shattered!Ying Hongyue couldn't stop vomiting blood. At this moment, her expression really changed.This Eight Trigrams diagram was his many years of hard work.Li Hao's path had been blocked before, and he couldn't even break through it, which proved the power of this diagram. In the end, when heaven battling city descended, it directly shattered the eight trigrams diagram!"Li Hao!"Ying Hongyue's voice became cold. "I'm guessing that you might know something. Kill me ... Can you really do it? We're both pawns ... We should've joined forces ...""No, no, no, I'm not a chess piece. You are. I'm the disrupter!"Li Hao chuckled."Since I've decided to mess things up, it'll be more interesting to kill you. I also want to see what the consequences are for killing you." I also want to know if you regret killing my parents and friends. You should have killed me earlier, not now. "Ying Hongyue felt that she had nothing to say to Li Hao.With Yuan Shuo's death, this person could no longer be explained.In the past, Li Hao had wisdom, great wisdom. This guy could see through many things and had his own ideas. He would not have taken such risks. If he really wanted to kill him, he might have released a venerable sovereign.But the current Li Hao ... Didn't seem to care.It was useless to say anything when he met someone who didn't care.Once the eight trigrams diagram shattered, Ying Hongyue no longer retaliated and focused on fleeing.The Queen wanted to fight back. Feeling the powerful Silver Moon Power in her body, she turned around and attacked a few times. It was extremely powerful, even close to the power of saintly way.However, this was not the first time Li Hao had killed a Saint.Even a Heavenly King had a fierce battle!There were still two saints in heaven battling city, so even if she had the power of a Saint, what could she do?"Break!" The void trembled at her bellow. A bright moon seemed to have descended from the sky and charged at Li Hao through the Queen's hand. It suppressed the world and the surroundings. Even the entrance to the great path universe was sealed, as if it was going to lock the great path universe.Li Hao raised his head and looked at the sky.Was this the Queen's doing, or ... Someone was just borrowing the Queen's hand?Very strong!Suddenly, the Heaven's Will churned in all directions and suppressed the moon. Li Hao murmured,""Kill the evil spirits and strengthen the world. Help me, heaven and earth!"BOOM!The Heaven's Will stirred in all directions, and the Silver Moon's shadow shattered. The Queen spat out a mouthful of silver blood with a look of disbelief. Even she herself was surprised by how powerful her attack was.In the end, he was still suppressed by Li Hao!Not only that, the Heaven's Will that had favored her seemed to have sensed an even stronger force of heaven's will and felt that Li Hao was more worth investing in than she was. At this moment, heaven's will was about to leave her and go to Li Hao.Heaven's will, ignorant.Thus, it was split into many parts and did not gather as one. Heaven's will's consciousness existed in every part of the world. It was a single entity, but it was also split into countless individuals.Li Hao had gathered the largest piece.In fact, there were quite a few Queens gathered, but at this moment, they gradually dispersed and merged with Li Hao. After fighting with Li Hao several times and losing several times, Tianyi felt that the Queen was no longer reliable.As for Li Hao, he also took a glance and looked up at the sky again.The Heaven's Will gathered!Actually, it wasn't a good thing. They were all gathered together. Perhaps, this was what a certain someone wanted.But it didn't matter!Before you do anything, I will capture these heaven's will.At this moment, you might be happy to see this. The more mature heaven's will is, the more it is gathered together, the easier it is to capture it, right?At this moment, Li Hao suddenly looked into the distance.Powerful auras filled the air.Someone was coming!​ Heaven and earth shook.It had just recovered a little, and at this moment, it was enough to accommodate the appearance of the divine path, so Zheng Yu couldn't wait to come to help.He was really proactive!From the looks of it, he felt that the Silver Moon belonged to him, and that he was the one who suffered the most when the seal was broken.Ying Hongyue and the others also felt the aura and heaved a sigh of relief.Someone's here!If no one came, the two of them really wouldn't be able to hold on any longer. Li Hao was even more powerful than they had expected. This guy was definitely not an ordinary Dao integration expert. He was even more difficult to deal with than some late-stage Saints.
