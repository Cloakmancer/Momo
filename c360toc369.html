ple were standing beside the huge rock.
 The clothes he wore were slightly different from the ones Silver Moon usually wore.
 It was a Martial master's attire, but it gave off a more luxurious feel. The material was obviously more luxurious than Silver Moon 's. Those with good eyesight could even see the gold lining.
 The few of them were fearless.
 Three young people!
 In fact, Li Hao's group had already vaguely guessed the identity of the other party, because these three people each carried a long staff.
 Qi Mei staff King!
 Of course, the three people in front of him might not be. It was more likely that they were the other party's disciples.
 Li Hao didn't wait for Yuan Shuo's reply. He dashed forward at an extremely fast speed.
 "Silver city's Li Hao! Disciples of the five beast Kings, may I ask what business senior brothers and senior sisters have here?"
  Li Hao!
 Sun moxian cupped his fists awkwardly. He didn't know if his etiquette was right, but he didn't care. It was fine as long as it was right.
 "Nandou province's sun moxian, the first disciple of the eyebrow-level staff King! I'm here to deliver a letter of challenge under the orders of my master! My master is going to challenge the five bird Kings at the heavenly bridge tomorrow!"
 As soon as he finished speaking, a letter was shot at Li Hao.
 It was mixed with inner strength!
 The inner strength was strong, but the pages were weak, yet they were not damaged.
 Li Hao reached out to grab it, and his inner strength burst out from the page. Li Hao's finger force was like a sword, instantly crushing the inner strength. He received the letter firmly in his hand."I'll accept the letter of challenge on behalf of my master. About the challenge ..."
 At the back, Yuan Shuo's expression was calm,"I'll be there on time!" Tell sun Yifei, since he's already a super, he shouldn't do this! Tomorrow, I'd like to see if I've made any progress after hanging out with Ying Hongyue in the central region for so many years!"
 At this moment, sun moxian was slightly shaken. He didn't dare to say anything more and cupped his fists."The letter has been delivered. We'll be waiting for the five bird Kings tomorrow!"
 After saying that, he quickly left.
 Behind him, his Junior Sister and Junior Brother quickly followed.
 After they had walked a distance, the junior Brother of the tenth realm said in a low voice,""Senior brother, why aren't you saying the harsh words that master told us to say?"
 “……”
 Sun moxian was silent for a moment. After walking for a while, he said,""That's Master's words, so we won't say it. It's useless to say such harsh words. That old demon Yuan is ruthless, and it's not worth it to kill us. Also ... If there's a battle tomorrow, Silver Moon martial arts has the habit of having their disciples fight a few battles first to liven things up ... I'll go up and deal with Li Hao tomorrow!"
 The two of them were stunned. Why?
 "Eldest senior brother ..."
 "When Li Hao accepted my challenge, I only wanted to give him a little pressure. I didn't expect him to crush it so easily. That Li Hao is either in the late stage of the 100-plus level or in the great circle of the 100-plus level!"
 The two of them were shocked.
 "No way? I've asked Red Moon and found out that Li Hao was only a disciple that old demon Yuan took in three years ago. He didn't inherit any martial arts at the beginning and was at most at the tenth realm. How could he have broken through a hundred?"  "Even if it breaks 100, it should be at the peak of the initial stage. How can it be the late stage or even the great circle? "Perfection requires the comprehension of force ..."
 The two of them were in disbelief.
 Was that even possible?
 Sun moxian considered for a moment, then shook his head,""It's hard to say. Anyway, we have to be careful. Master said that there are many strong cultivators in the Silver Moon martial forest, and it's true. In the central continent, we are considered geniuses in the Martial Master realm, but here, it seems that more than 100 martial masters are everywhere."
 The few of them quieted down and quickly left.
 ……
 At the same time.
 Yuan Shuo glanced at the letter and sneered,""I haven't seen you for decades, and you're still the same."
 Then, he glanced at Li Hao and asked,"why did you take it?" I thought you would choose to retreat. "
 Li Hao smiled innocently,"I can't embarrass teacher!" "We're all martial masters of the same generation. If I embarrass my teacher when his disciple sends a letter of challenge, my life is small, but my face is big! We're from the martial arts world, isn't our reputation more important than our lives?"
 “……”
 Yuan Shuo nearly burst out laughing.
 What a joke!
 He then looked at Li Hao and said after a long while,""That sun moxian isn't simple. He must have comprehended 'force'. I didn't expect sun Yifei to be able to cultivate such a young Martial Master. It's not easy."
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It was definitely harder to become a Martial Master in the great circle than in the Sunshine State.
 For the advancement of sunlit, it would be fine as long as the third shackle was broken.
 In fact, talent and mysterious energy were the two things that mattered most. However, for a Martial Master to break through the 100th level, comprehension was the key. Sometimes, comprehension was too mysterious. Even if one looked extremely smart, one might not be able to comprehend force.
 He then looked at Li Hao and said,"sun Yifei brought his apprentice here to cause trouble. I understand what he means!" You'd better think it through. If you can avoid going on stage tomorrow, then don 't. "
  He had been hiding for so long, but there might be a lot of people watching the battle tomorrow.
 It wasn't a good thing that Li Hao had been exposed.
 Li Hao usually preferred to keep a low profile, but today, he shook his head.""It's different! Master used to run amok in the Silver Moon martial forest, and now he has retired from the Silver City and accepted a closed-door disciple. If he can't even deal with sun Yifei's disciple, wouldn't he lose face?"
 This was truly an era where face was more important than the heavens, especially to these senior martial masters.
 Hiding also depended on the time.
 At this moment, if Li Hao lost without a fight, he would be embarrassed.
 Superhumans might not understand or care about these things, but martial masters would definitely care.
 On the side, Wang Ming seemed to understand and hurriedly said, "I'll go! Teacher, I'm also your in-name disciple ... And in-name disciples are still disciples. Watch how I torture that fellow to death!"
 Yuan Shuo glanced at him and said after a long while,""You? I'm not looking down on you, but if that sun moxian wasn't a newbie ... If you go up, I'll give you a seven to three score!"
 What did that mean?

 70 - 30?
 Wang Ming couldn't help but say,"seven to three ... Teacher said my chances of winning are only seventy percent?"
 It was too low!
 I'm sunlight, and the other party is obviously not a thousand-man fighting machine.
 "You'll get 30%, and he'll get 70%!"
 At these words, Wang Ming's face turned green. This was underestimating him too much.
 "I'm sunlight ..."
 "I just advanced to the glorious sun tier!"
 "Is it very powerful?" Yuan Shuo laughed. If Liu Long didn't enter the warrior dimension, he might not be able to match you. Liu Long's power had reached the perfect level, but he didn't have any comprehension of Shi. His pseudo-perfect level is definitely not a match for the sun glory. "
 A Martial Master who had not comprehended force was definitely not a match for sunlight.
  But once he comprehended force, it would be hard to say.
 It might be an exaggeration to say that it was a 70 - 30 chance, but it was definitely a 50 - 50 chance. It was hard to tell who would win.
 At this moment, Liu Long also nodded slightly,""Without comprehending force, you definitely can't beat the sunlight! In terms of comprehension, it depends on the strength of the force, experience, and skill ... It's indeed hard to determine the winner. "
 "Elder Yuan, is sun Yifei going to issue a challenge letter or tomorrow?" It's not the time to explore the remains tomorrow...Elder Yuan and the others hope to enter. Could it be that sun Yifei doesn't care about everyone's opinion ..."
 "Who knows," Yuan Shuo replied calmly. Either sun Yifei is so strong that even the three major organizations and the night patrolmen can't stop him, or he can test me or seriously injure me so that I can be at their mercy after entering the ruins, so that I won't cause trouble for them with my strength. "
 Liu Long frowned.
 He looked at Li Hao, then at Yuan Shuo.""If we accept the challenge, elder Yuan's strength will be revealed tomorrow ... Wouldn't that be a little inappropriate?"
 His strength was already exposed before he even entered the arena.
 If he was stronger than sun Yifei, then everyone would be on guard.
 If he was weaker than sun Yifei, he might be severely injured ... But he might not be killed, because the ruins had not been explored yet.
 No matter how he looked at it, it seemed like he had lost out.
 Yuan Shuo sneered,"so what if I'm exposed?" When you have no strength, you have to keep a low profile! Now that he had the strength, what was wrong with being a little more high-profile? Whoever dares to provoke me, I'll kill them!"
 At this moment, he had some of the old Devil's aura.
 If he was exposed, so be it!
 If he could kill sun Yifei, he would kill everyone else.
 Sun Yifei could also help him measure the strength of the spirit accumulation realm, in case he overestimated himself.
 In the past, he was low-key because he was not strong enough.
 But now ... He was not afraid!
 Then, he suddenly looked at Li Hao."You accepted the challenge so excitedly. You didn't even mind revealing your strength. Tell me. Do you have any ideas?"
 Li Hao smiled."Teacher, I have an idea. I realized that that sword move ... Needs to be courageous!" Cut me off, see blood ... I think that person's strength isn't weak, and he has power. This is my best opponent! If I can cut it, my sword might be able to take shape. "
 Yuan Shuo's eyes lit up.
 "So ... You're going to hide the earth Force?"
 "En!"  Li Hao nodded."Not many people would have thought that I could use my internal energy to form a sword. However, I can sense the earth. Therefore, I want to fight him with the strength of someone in the late stage of the 100th level!" If I win, I have a chance to comprehend sword force!"
 Once the sword momentum was formed, the two momentum were formed.
 If he could merge the two forces, Li Hao might be able to reach the Qian warrior realm.
 It was only now that Wang Ming understood something and said in surprise,"What do you mean? Li Hao, aren't you in the middle of the 100-level?"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com As he listened, he felt that something was wrong!
 Late-stage breakthrough 100? Perfection?
 What the hell!
 How could he not know what Li Hao's strength was?
 Why did it seem like she had slept for decades in the blink of an eye?
 Li Hao smiled but didn't say anything.
 Liu Long didn't pay any attention to him and directly said, "Let's go. Let's go to the night patrollers first. No matter what, it's good to discuss with department head Hao. There will be many people watching tomorrow. It's good to have someone to hold the line. "
 The few of them nodded and quickly rushed towards the crosscut Canyon.
 ……
 At the same time.
 At the bottom of the transverse Canyon.
 There were tents everywhere.
 At the foot of a cliff, someone said,""Someone from Lord sun's sect has sent a challenge to Yuan Shuo!"
 Ghostface.
 At the red moon encampment.
 From the tent, a voice with some indifference was heard."If sun Yifei wants to do this, then we'll let him!"
 He called him by his name.
 It was obvious that the person in the tent was at least a three-Sun Expert.
  It was obvious that Hong Yue wasn't satisfied with sun Yifei's direct challenge to Yuan Shuo. First, he had exposed sun Yifei's existence. This man was too arrogant and didn't even try to hide his identity. This made Hong Yue a little unhappy.
 Second, they still needed Yuan Shuo to lead the way. Moreover, Yuan Shuo was not the only target. He had killed Duan Tian and was quite powerful. If sun Yifei was injured, Red moon's strength would be reduced as well.
 Now, the others were probably happy to watch the show, but the night patrolman and red Moon were having a headache.
 There were two powerhouses, one of them had slashed three yang, and the other was at the late stage of three yang. If one of them died or both sides suffered heavy losses, the others would be happy. Even if Yuan Shuo died, they would have one less expert ... If he really died, it was still acceptable.
 "Should we stop them?" the ghastly face asked hesitantly.
 "How do we stop them?"
 "Sun Yifei has been arrogant in the red moon for a long time. Who else does he listen to except the leader?" the man inside said lightly. Even if the leader of the purple Moon Warriors were here, he might not listen to me. "
 The leader of the Silver Moon base was Zi Yue, but she had gone to white moon City and was not around.
 And he was in charge of this place.
 He was also a three yang!

 The red moon's strength was obvious. Duan Tian, who was killed, sun Yifei, who had just arrived, Zi Yue, who went to white moon City, and he, the three suns, there were four of them.
 Even without sun Yifei, there were still three three sun Masters in Silver Moon.
 As for Ying Hongyue's son, who had been killed before ... No one really cared about him. Ying Hongyue had many sons and grandsons. If he were to be placed with Silver Moon, he would either be too weak and the central region wasn't suitable for him, or he would be too talented and would be placed here to hone himself.
 It was obvious that the talent of the person who was killed wasn't very good. After all, he had a father like Ying Hongyue, but he was only at the early stage of the sunlit realm ... He was obviously just so-so.
 ……
 At the night patrolman's encampment.
 Hao lianchuan had also received the news.
 At this moment, he was pacing back and forth in his tent, feeling a headache.
 How unlucky!
 He had encountered such a thing the moment he arrived.
  "Damn that sun Yifei!"
 Hao lianchuan cursed,"we haven't even started exploring the ruins and this guy is already looking for trouble!" He, a late three yang realm master, challenged a Martial Master who had just advanced to the Qian warrior realm. I'll go and meet him tomorrow!"
 He was also very angry!
 He originally thought that even if sun Yifei came and wanted to fight, he would probably wait until after the ruins exploration.
 He had to consider the big picture!
 Good Lord, in the end, he didn't care about these things at all and directly arranged to meet tomorrow.
 Was Hao Kong a good-for-nothing on Red moon's side?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Can't even control this?
 He was talking about the three-sun powerhouse, who was also the leader of the red moon's exploration of the ruins. He was also a three-sun powerhouse. Originally, Hao lianchuan had thought that this guy would be able to restrain him.
 However, he realized that it was useless. Sun Yifei didn't even care about him.
 Huang Yun and the others were also in the tent.
 At this moment, they were all solemn.
 The late stage of three yang!
 To be honest, everyone was still afraid of sun Yifei. In the entire Silver Moon, apart from Minister hou, who could guarantee that they could defeat him?
 However, someone whispered,"Hao bu, although it's not good news, it's not bad news either!" Sun Yifei was definitely going to enter the ruins, and it was a good time to check it out. Otherwise, if they really went in, they wouldn't be able to figure out his strength. Although he was said to be at the late stage of three yang, how strong was that? Now, we'll let Yuan Shuo test his strength ... At the crucial moment, we'll just have to think of a way to interrupt the battle. "
 Otherwise, it would be difficult to deal with them if they didn't know their background.
 Hao lianchuan frowned,'I don't know how many people are waiting to see a joke tomorrow! I can't wait for them to fight to the death ... The style of these older generation martial masters hasn't changed!"
 This was the atmosphere of the Silver Moon martial forest.  It had always been like this!
 Even if they knew that there might be powerful enemies outside, these guys would still fight to the death if they didn't agree with each other. In the end, they were all taken advantage of. This kind of situation had happened many times in the Silver Moon martial arts world, and it wasn't unique to sun Yifei and Yuan Shuo.
 Most importantly, these martial masters didn't learn from their mistakes.
 Or rather, they knew that this might be the result, but they still had to do it!
 Hao lianchuan's head hurt. After a while, he said in a deep voice,""When Yuan Shuo arrives, I'll persuade him to give up on this battle. If sun Yifei dares to come, I'll let him know that this is Silver Moon, not the central continent. His words don't count here!"
 He was prepared to kill sun Yifei if he dared to come.
 Although exposing the fire Phoenix spear so early was not the result he wanted, wasn't he forced to?
 The crowd looked at each other, not knowing how to persuade him.
 Sun Yifei's appearance did mess up everyone's plan.
 ……
 At the same time.
 There were people in the various encampments discussing.
 Sun Yifei challenged Yuan Shuo!
 The two martial masters of Silver Moon martial arts world from decades ago were enemies. Now that they had met here, the battle was about to start. Some people were looking forward to it, while others were nervous.
 ? ……
 In another encampment, this was the swords gate's encampment.
 At this moment, in the tent, a middle-aged man with cold eyes heard the news and suddenly laughed,""Just as I expected, when Qi Mei staff King and old demon five birds meet, they will definitely fight! Back then, sun Yifei was defeated by demon Yuan on the Hengduan heavenly bridge. Sun Yifei couldn't bear the humiliation and jumped off the cliff to commit suicide ... Everyone thought he was dead, but who knew he would come back alive and become a late-stage three yang superhuman?"
  Then, he said with some anticipation,"I'm really looking forward to another battle between them ... Unfortunately, one has become a super, and the other has just entered the thousand warrior realm, so their strength is not on par. However, old demon Yuan has fused his five bird force. Even if he has just entered the thousand warrior realm, he won't be too weak. Duan Tian deserved to be killed by him. Even if old demon Yuan is defeated tomorrow, there will be a good show to watch!"
 It was obvious that he was confident in Yuan Shuo.
 It wasn't that they believed Yuan Shuo would win, but that even if he lost, he would show everyone a battle of the best.
 This was Yuan Shuo!
 A young woman beside him said,""Father, was Yuan Shuo really that powerful back then? If that was the case, why did it seem like he was the worst? Ying Hongyue, sun Yifei, and my father all became supers a long time ago. Why did he stay in the 100th level for 20 years?"
 If he was so powerful, why didn't he become a super earlier?
 They might be on the same level as Ying Hongyue now.
 The man in front of him was one of the Seven Swords of the Silvermoon, earth overturning sword Hong Yitang.
 After hearing his daughter's words, he thought for a while and shook his head.""It's hard to say, but it might be related to his deep accumulation."
 Too robust?

 His daughter somewhat understood, but que still didn't quite understand.
 "He's reached the completion of the 100-fold threshold or has fused all Five Forces," Hong Yitang continued."For others who have reached the completion of the 100-fold threshold, if 1000 cubic meters of mysterious energy is needed to break the superpower lock to advance, Yuan Shuo might need 5000 cubic meters!"
 "Tell me, during that period, how could there be so many mysteries for him to advance?"
 "Later on, Ying Hongyue became stronger and came to take revenge on him. He was forced to hide in the Silver Moon province and even in the Silver City, so he naturally missed the opportunity."
 "He's that strong?"
 "Five times the normal consumption?" his daughter exclaimed.
 She had heard of her father's past. In order to advance, he had used up a large amount of mysterious energy, and with the support of others, he barely managed to advance. Now, he had also entered the three suns, become a powerful expert, and founded the swords gate.
 On the other hand, Yuan Shuo actually required five times the consumption of his father's energy. It was no wonder he had been unable to advance all this while.
 "Do you think he's known as demon Yuan for nothing?" Hong Yitang laughed. He called himself the five bird King, and the others also called him that on the surface, but in reality, they all called him the beast King! The king of beasts! If he didn't have any real strength, he would have been killed long ago. Of the other six swords that were as famous as your father, three of them were killed on the spot!"
 "Could it be that father wasn't as good as him back then?"
  This was a daughter's admiration for her father.
 Under normal circumstances, he could just brag and let it pass.
 However, Hong Yitang thought for a while and shook his head.""I'm not as good as him!"
 His daughter's face was full of surprise. When her father talked about the martial arts world back then, he had always been full of confidence, pride, and arrogance.
 Even when some of the martial masters in the central region were mentioned, his father would not even spare them a glance.
 But today, he actually admitted that he was inferior to Yuan Shuo in front of his daughter. This ... Was that person really that terrifying?
 Hong Yitang didn't care about his daughter's surprise. He smiled and said,""Inferior means inferior! If they were evenly matched or just slightly better, it wouldn't matter. But that guy is far better than me! I'm not afraid of you laughing at me, but when I knew where he was, I never went there to avoid trouble. He likes to spar with strong people, but the point is that all the sparring ... Makes it easy for him to kill people!"
 "That's why he challenged me twice back then, but I didn't accept either of them. If I had accepted them, you wouldn't be here today."
 "Oh?" Hong Qing's interest was piqued."Father, can we ... Go and watch the battle tomorrow?"
 Such a strong man, who even his father admitted that he was not as good as him, had only just entered the thousand warrior class, but he had also killed three suns.
 The other one was also the famous Qi Mei staff King. He had now entered the late stage of the three suns realm and was famous in the central region. The battle between these two would definitely be explosive.
 Hong Yitang thought for a while and nodded,""That's good, I'll see the world! Now that you've broken through a hundred ... If you still can't enter the warrior dimension, then you should prepare to enter the Super realm and enter the sunlight. These people have all mastered force, especially Yuan Shuo! It might be of help to you. "
 The martial masters of the older generation, even if they had become supers, were still disdainful of superpowers, even if they were supers.
 After giving birth to children, he would definitely train them to practice martial arts first, and he would think about it when they broke through a hundred.
 If they were unable to comprehend force, they would then consider letting their children absorb the mysterious energy and step into the supernatural realm. This way, their progress would not be delayed. They would break through a hundred martial masters and have a high chance of directly entering the solar flare.
 If he could enter the warrior dimension, he would first enter the warrior dimension, comprehend force, and then advance to a super.
 Such a situation was not only common in Silver Moon, but also in the central region.  Nowadays, many of the overlords in the central continent were in this situation. They were either martial masters or divine Masters. These two types of people were the most difficult to deal with in the central continent.
 ……
 Yuan Shuo had not arrived yet, but the news had already spread throughout the entire Hengduan Canyon.
 Countless powerhouses wanted to see the battle between the two old martial masters tomorrow.
 When the sky turned dark, Li Hao's group arrived.
 In front, there was a row of tents.
 The others weren't familiar, but Wang Ming was very familiar with it. He said excitedly from a distance, "We're here, I can see familiar faces!"
 In the distance, someone was also shouting in a low voice,""Professor Yuan, you're here!"
 "The people from the silver Blizzard city have arrived!"
 A moment later, before Li Hao and the others entered the tent area, Hao lianchuan strode over without caring about his reputation. From a distance, he said in dissatisfaction,""It's fine if you're so late, but I heard you accepted the challenge?"
 What the hell!
 In the Silver Moon martial forest, accepting the challenge meant that he had agreed.
 If he didn't accept it, there was still some room for negotiation.
 Yuan Shuo glanced at him and ignored him.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, was looking at him in a daze.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Yes, it was a very dull look.
  He looked at Hao lianchuan in a completely different light. It was as if there was a fire Phoenix moving inside his body!
 What was going on?
 The fire Phoenix seemed to be alive. It was in Hao lianchuan's body and the aura it gave off was extremely powerful. However ... It was not the aura of a superpower but an indescribable powerful aura!
 Hao lianchuan was talking to Yuan Shuo when he felt Li Hao's gaze. He looked at Li Hao in a daze.
 Why are you looking at me like that?
 This brat was evil!
 In the past, he would have thought that he had scared him, but now, he suspected that this kid was plotting something.
 Seeing him look at him, Li Hao instantly lowered his head, as if he was afraid.
 He was shocked. What was this?
 Could it be ... An origin god weapon?

 At this moment, he could only think this way.
 More importantly, could origin God weapons be hidden in the body?
 Why can't my sword do it?
 If it was possible, it would be so convenient. He could take it out whenever he wanted and was not afraid of losing it.
 "That feeling...It feels so powerful!"
 Even though it was hidden in Hao lianchuan's body, Li Hao still felt that it was extremely powerful.
 It was as if he was really a Phoenix that was about to burst out of his body.
 Li Hao stopped looking at Hao lianchuan and looked around.
 There were many small moons, and they were all experts at the Dark Moon realm.
 There were also quite a few small Suns, all of which were at the radiant sun realm.
  There were even a few of them who were almost at Qiao Feilong's level. They were clearly at the peak of the sun glory stage. The night patrollers had indeed gone all out this time.
 The next moment, Li Hao looked at a low-key woman in the crowd.
 It was a plain-looking woman in her thirties who was standing on Yue Ming's side. Like the others, she was also looking at them curiously, and her eyes met Li Hao 's.
 Li Hao also looked in that direction, but he immediately shifted his gaze away. He seemed a little shy and timid, sneakily looking around while cursing in his heart.
 Who said that there were only two three suns on night patrol?
 Who said that only Hao lianchuan would come this time!
 Then what was this woman's situation?
 These were the three suns, and they were very powerful three suns. They were stronger than Qiao Feilong and even a little stronger than Hao lianchuan. They might be in the middle stage of the three suns.
 Liar!
 They're all liars!
 Li Hao cursed in his heart. The information was not accurate at all.
 This woman might have a treasure similar to Li Hao's mirror on her. She had concealed her aura, and no one seemed to have noticed it, not even the teacher.
 He really hid it well!
 And ... Could it be an enemy?
 Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. It was hard to say.
 Perhaps the three major organizations had sent someone to hide in here?
 'Should I tell Hao lianchuan?'
 However, if it was someone from the night watchman's side, Hao lianchuan might not even know about it. It was hou Xiaochen who had arranged it. If she revealed it to Hao lianchuan, would it cause trouble?
 "Also, other people can't see through it, so how would I know? this is also a problem.
 At this moment, Li Hao had a headache.
 I've just arrived, and I seem to be in trouble!
 ……
 At this moment, the woman who Li Hao had glanced at looked at Li Hao. Seeing nothing out of the ordinary, she continued to look at Yuan Shuo and the others curiously.
  When he saw Wang Ming, he was slightly taken aback.  Sunlight!
 She knew who Wang Ming was.
 Before he left, he seemed to have only been at the level of a full moon. After walking for a few days, he had crossed the full moon and directly entered the glorious sun. This speed was too fast.
 Thinking of this, the woman took a few more glances and quickly stopped. She was more concerned about the state of Yuan Shuo and Liu Long.
 It was hard to judge Liu Long's strength, but he felt like he had entered the warrior thousand level.
 As for Yuan Shuo ... He really couldn't see anything.
 However, he had a vague feeling that Yuan Shuo seemed to be very angry!
 It was a restrained anger!
 That kind of feeling was like a volcano about to erupt, which made the woman slightly surprised. Indeed, his reputation was well-deserved!
 Yuan Shuo was very powerful.
 While she was observing, Yuan Shuo suddenly glanced at her and frowned. His eyes were cold and sharp like swords. He frowned at the woman and then looked at Hao lianchuan."Tell your people not to use any spying techniques on me. Otherwise, you won't be able to handle my anger!"
 Hao lianchuan was stunned. Really?
 He looked back and didn't find anything. He frowned and said,""Don't just observe! This is very impolite, be more proper!"
 ? He had greeted them before he came.
 Did anyone check on Yuan Shuo?
 I didn't sense any energy fluctuations, is old man Yuan looking for trouble?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It was very possible!
 He was a little annoyed. I just said a few words to you and you're already impatient.
 He relied on his old age, stepped into the Qian warrior realm, and killed three suns. Now, he really doesn't take me seriously.
 "You're not allowed to fight tomorrow!"
 After saying this, he left unhappily.
 No way!
  Yuan Shuo glanced at him and laughed. He whispered to Liu Long,""Did Hao lianchuan remember wrongly? I'm not actually a Night Watcher."
 “……”
 Liu Long was speechless.
 When the others heard this, their faces tensed up. Some wanted to laugh, while some were a little annoyed.
 As for Hao lianchuan, he was also speechless when he heard this.
 He was too lazy to say anything. He had remembered wrongly. Only now did he remember that this old thing was actually not the night patrolman.
 That's right, that student of his was!
 Hao lianchuan cursed again in his heart. I'll talk to your student tonight.
 If you don't listen to me, I'll send your student back home!
 Also, he had to ask Li Hao to persuade him not to be so proactive in seeking death.

 There was a limited number of tents, so the people from the silver Blizzard city were given a large tent. The treatment was not bad.
 As for Liu Yan, it was only normal for him to get one.
 As an extraordinary, these were all normal.
 Of course, some people were surprised that Li Hao's group had brought a dog, while others were indifferent. Supernatural beings had different personalities, and as long as the dog didn't interfere with their business, no one would care.
 ……
 He simply put his luggage aside.
 Yuan Shuo wanted to rest, while Liu Long wanted to find Hao lianchuan to discuss their next mission and work.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, dragged Wang Ming to meet new friends.
 ……
 "Li Hao, this is elder Huang. You know him!"
  Wang Ming was sometimes very magnanimous. Under normal circumstances, even if he brought someone to visit, it would be someone of the same level. In many people's eyes, he was still a moon underworld.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, the first person that this guy brought Li Hao to visit was Huang Yun, who was at the radiant sun rank.
 After all, the two of them had met before and were quite familiar with each other.
 The visit was also meant to get to know each other and take care of each other.
 As a sun glory expert, although Huang Yun was not given a tent, there were only two people in the tent. Besides Huang Yun, there was also a strong man who looked like a black egg.
 He was very dark and looked simple and honest.
 A dense earth energy wrapped around his body. One look and one could tell that he was an earth elemental Expert.
 Huang Yun also smiled when he saw Wang Ming and Li Hao come to visit. He was quite familiar with Wang Ming, and Li Hao was no stranger to him.
 "Good day, old Huang!"
 Li Hao's face was green and a little shy. It was obvious that he was a young man who wasn't sociable enough.
 After greeting Huang Yun, he looked at the earth elemental Expert and said hurriedly,""Hello, big brother!"
 Inside the tent, the earth traveler laughed,"Big brother? I'm already old enough to be your father! I'm Zhao Huan, the city Patrol envoy of white moon City!"
 Huang Yun smiled and introduced,"Zhao Huan is an earth elemental Expert. His earth escape technique is very powerful. It's difficult to fly up to the sky, but it's even more difficult to enter the ground!"
 As he spoke, he called the two of them into the tent.
  This time, the tents were not small and had a lot of space inside.  Moreover, because there was an earth element expert here, there were some simple structures in the tent, such as a table and a bed. It was much more comfortable and comprehensive than other people's tents.
 Wang Ming and Li Hao walked in together.
 Seeing the tea bowls on the table, Wang Ming said enviously,"Uncle Zhao's treatment is really good. Even if the earth element doesn't fight in the future, he'll still be top-tier in city building!"
 Zhao Huan laughed heartily."Xiao Wang, your metal element is not bad either. I really won't fight in the future. I will build a city, and you can help me strengthen it with metal and build a giant city!"
 The two of them joked around and seemed to be quite familiar with each other.
 Of course, Zhao Huan and the others didn't ignore Li Hao. Huang Yun invited the two of them to sit down and looked at Li Hao with a smile.""Li Hao, your teacher accepted sun Yifei's challenge. You have to persuade him. Your teacher doesn't have any friends or relatives, so he has been in contact with you the most in the past few years. You're also the last disciple he accepted, and he has an unyielding personality. Sun Yifei is powerful, and he's at the late three yang realm. Duan Tian can't compare to him ..."
 He also wanted to influence Yuan Shuo through Li Hao.
 It was not the best choice to fight now.
 It would only benefit the other parties, and the ones who would suffer losses would be the night patrollers and the Crimson Moon. The Crimson Moon's influence was not that great, but the night patrollers would suffer the most losses.
 Li Hao nodded, his face solemn. It's just that my teacher's personality is very stubborn, so even if I say it, it won't have much effect. "
 With that, he shook his head regretfully and said in a low voice,""Elder Huang, I asked brother Wang to bring me here because I want to know more about the situation ... I'm too embarrassed to ask others, so I've only met you a few times. I can sort of know you ..."
 "What do you want to know?" Huang Yun laughed.
 "Um ... Um ... I want to know, other than department head Hao, is there anyone else who can deal with sun Yifei?"
  Li Hao was a little worried."Elder Huang, I heard that many of the three suns might have come this time, and they are all dissatisfied with us. We are very powerful, and elder Huang, you are all top experts in the sunlight ... But can we ... Deal with so many three suns?"
 He actually wanted to know if these people knew about that woman's existence.
 Sunshine was considered the backbone of Silver moon's forces.
 If they didn't know, he would have to test Hao lianchuan.
 With the sudden appearance of a mid-stage three yang cultivator, Li Hao definitely had to figure out who was friend or foe.
 Huang Yun considered for a moment before saying,"there's no need to worry too much. The various large organizations aren't all United." Even when it came to the night patrollers, not all of them had the same thought. There were still differences. Furthermore, the two mid-sized organizations, because they're local organizations, they usually cooperate more with us. After all, the three great organizations only have a stronghold here, and their main energy is in the central region. "
 "So you're saying that on our side, Hao bu is the only one with three suns?"
 Li Hao didn't want to hear this, so he asked directly.
 Huang Yun nodded, there was nothing to hide,""There's no other way. Among us silver Moon Nightwalker, only hou bu and Hao bu are three suns. Hou bu can't leave, so Hao bu has to come alone."
 "But don't think that we're weak," he continued."This time, there are seven sunlit experts. Besides old Zhao and me, there are two at the peak of the sunlit realm among the rest!"

 He was in the early stages of the sunlit realm, while Zhao Huan was in the middle. Li Hao saw the size of the sun and did not ask for details.
 There were also two at the peak of the radiant sun realm ... Li Hao compared the size of the sun to the one he had seen earlier. They were probably a man and a woman, both middle-aged.
 "The water element division and the metal element division,"
 Li Hao looked puzzled, and Wang Ming immediately interjected,"We, the night patrollers, have one chief, five deputy ministers, and six other ministers! Other than hou bu, Hao bu was the first Deputy Minister of the other five. "The remaining four are from the he Department, the Water-type at the peak of the sunlit realm. It's that fierce-looking Auntie ..."
 Huang Yun and Zhao Huan both looked at him. This kid was quite bold.
 Although she was indeed at the level of an aunt, you kept calling her an aunt. Be careful not to catch you and be rude to you.
 "I'm more familiar with the surrounding areas!"
 Wang Ming chuckled."Because I'm also a metal element user, I often go to the Zhou Department to ask for advice. Zhou Department is that handsome uncle who stood next to Hao Department before. He has a sword on his back and is at the peak of the sun glory sect. I think the third Sun among our night watchers is very likely Zhou Department."
 The metal element was good at attacking, and since he was of the same element as Wang Ming, Wang Ming was familiar with that person and highly respected him.
 Huang Yun and Zhao Huan did not deny this.
  The attack power of the surrounding area was very strong, and he was also a veteran of the brilliant sun, so it was not impossible for him to step into the three suns.
 Li Hao smiled. Of the seven dazzling Suns, he had figured out four of them.
 Next, Li Hao chatted with the two sunlit guests for a while. It was just a visit, so he wouldn't stay for long. Besides, it was still dark outside, so it wasn't convenient for them to continue chatting.
 ……
 A moment later, Wang Ming left with Li Hao.
 Since he had already paid a visit, he would visit them one by one.
 Next, Wang Ming took him to visit several other sunshine powerhouses.
 Since he was Yuan Shuo's student, the other members of the sunlight Academy were also very polite.
 Gu Mei, who was at the mid-stage of the wood-type sunlit realm, was the healer of the entire team.
 Liu Ping, who was at the early stage of the lightning element's solar flare, had powerful attack power. He wasn't tall and was a head shorter than Li Hao, but his voice was very loud.
 Li Xiangdong, who had the special element and was in the middle stage of the sun glory realm, was from the same family as Li Hao. His ability was very special. He was the eyes of the entire team and was good at scouting. According to Wang Ming, he could clearly sense everything within a radius of several miles. He could even hear the sound of an ant crawling.
 The night watchmen's deployment was quite reasonable. They were equipped with attack, Scout, healer, and defense. In addition, Huang Yun, who had the wind element, was good at escaping. They were not weak.

 Finally, Li Hao walked out of the tent of the metal-elemental Zhou huaimin. His smile was a little stiff.
 He had been laughing for a long time!
 As juniors, it was their first time seeing so many important figures, so they naturally had to smile.
 Of course, on the surface, everyone was polite to him. Even the two deputy ministers encouraged him. Of course, he also tried to persuade Yuan Shuo not to challenge sun Yifei.
 After visiting these people, Li Hao said,""Old Wang, why don't we also pay a visit to those at the Dark Moon realm?"
 Wang Ming was speechless!
 He was a little tired. It was mainly because he had to introduce them to each other one by one until his mouth was dry. Now, he even wanted to visit Yue Ming ... What was there to visit Yue Ming for?  It would be better to meet tomorrow and have a chat when they met.
 "Li Hao, that's enough!"
 Wang Ming was a little reluctant.
 Li Hao smiled and looked at him in silence.
 Wang Ming felt a little uncomfortable under his gaze and cursed inwardly. Why are you looking at me?
 This guy didn't respect the strong at all.
 I'm riyao!
 After a long while, he said helplessly,"alright!" However, I'm actually not too familiar with some of the dark moons. This time, not all of them came from Whitemoon city, there are also people transferred from other cities, including sunlit city and yaoguang city's branch. "
 Li Hao nodded.
 He cast his gaze in the direction of a tent where a huge sun was. The woman was there.
 When Wang Ming saw him look in that direction, he thought for a moment and said,"That seems to be ... Let me think ... Oh, that's the gathering place for female superpowers ..."
 He looked at Li Hao."You! Are you here to pay a visit? or to pick up girls?"
 He immediately spotted the female superpower's tent.
 There were more than 50 people on the night patrol. Of course, not all of them would enter the ruins. A portion of them would stay outside. There were about 30 people who entered the ruins. There were not many female superhumans, only about ten of them.
 Yue Ming usually had four to five people in a tent, and the one Li Hao was looking at was one of them.
 "Let's go and take a look!"
 Li Hao smiled and walked toward them. As he walked, he said in a low voice,""Female superpowers ... It's rare to see so many of them at once. Old Wang, do you think that if I marry a female super, I can give birth to a god tier master?"
 Wang Ming was speechless!
 Where did you get this idea from?
  I've never heard you mention it before, and I've never seen you say that you've let yourself go the moment you go out?
 Li Hao chuckled but didn't explain.
 He was wondering if that person was listening.
 It's good to listen!
 ……
 In the tent.
 The few female superhumans were not asleep either. Some were cultivating while others were chatting. They were all at the Dark Moon realm. Now that they were about to enter the ruins, they were a little nervous and could not sleep.
 "Someone's coming!"Someone said as they were chatting.
 "Who's here?"
 Just as she said this, Wang Ming's voice rang out from outside."Hello, I'm Wang Ming. I'm here to visit everyone with professor Yuan's students. Is it convenient to go in?"

 "Wang Ming?"
 "It's big mouth Wang ..."Someone recognized him and quickly whispered.
 "Don't shout like that. Wang Ming's pretty good and talented. I heard he discovered five super locks, and he's also very strong. He's even of the gold element ..."
 "And professor Yuan's student? that shy little boy?"
 "It should be,"
 “……”
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com p A woman's chirping could be heard from the tent.  Li Hao's expression didn't change, but Wang Ming's face changed. As a member of riyao, his hearing was much better than before.
 Big mouth Wang?
 Who gave him this nickname?
  You're the big mouth!
 Do I have a big mouth? It wasn't good at all!
 Wang Ming was speechless. If Li Hao hadn't insisted on coming, he wouldn't have bothered.
 Soon, the tent was opened, and the person who walked out was the woman that Li Hao had been paying attention to. She looked to be in her thirties or forties and was rather thin.
 Wang Ming seemed to know her. When he saw her, he immediately smiled."So it's sister Zhang who lives here."
 "Brother Wang, please introduce me," Li Hao said in a low voice.
 He was like a shy little boy, not even daring to speak too loudly.
 Wang Ming laughed heartily, but in his heart, he cursed, this guy ... Really can act!
 Having dealt with Li Hao for so long, how could he not know Li Hao?
 When Liu Yan teased him earlier, he didn't even bat an eyelid. Where did he get the shyness from?
 "Hello, I'm Zhang Ting. I'm Yue Ming Yue Yue Yue, a Water-type super!"
 Hearing Li Hao's words, the woman smiled and reached out her hand, as if she wanted to shake Li Hao's hand.
 When supers introduced themselves to each other, it was rare for them to shake hands.
 Not just superpowers, martial masters would not shake hands unless they were testing each other.
 Shaking hands could easily expose a lot of things.
 This was especially true for martial masters. The inner strength of a Martial Master was hard to tell from the outside.
 And at this moment, this woman actually wanted to shake his hand ...
 Of course, Li Hao was a newcomer and a weakling in the eyes of others, so there was nothing to hide. Shaking hands was also a form of equal friendship and respect.
 Wang Ming didn't think much of it.
 Li Hao smiled shyly, but he still extended his hand and lightly shook it. Then, he hurriedly retracted his hand and said in a low voice,""I'm Li Hao, from the silver Blizzard city,"
 At this moment, the other women in the tent also came out.
 One by one, they looked at Li Hao curiously, and soon, others greeted Wang Ming.
 Seeing that the others didn't pay much attention to Li Hao, Zhang Ting took the initiative to chat with Li Hao like an understanding elder sister. With a smile, she said softly,""Li Hao, is this the first time you've traveled far?"  "En!"
 Li Hao nodded."I've always been in the Silver City."
 "Then why did you come this time when it was so dangerous? You're a Martial Master of the tenth realm, right? You're not a superpower yet, right?"
 Li Hao shook his head and said,"I'm not at the tenth realm ..."
 Then, she whispered,"my teacher won't let me say it. Sister Zhang, I'm very talented in martial arts ... Don't tell anyone else. I ... I actually broke a hundred. I told brother Wang and the others, but they didn't believe me."
 Zhang Ting suddenly laughed.
 She was really a newbie!
 It broke a hundred!
 In fact, she had a feeling that Li Hao might not be at the tenth realm. Although their handshake had only lasted for a moment, she felt that Li Hao might have broken through 100. As expected, this newbie didn't know anything and blurted out the secret as soon as he opened his mouth, somewhat similar to Wang Ming's big mouth.
 "I believe you!"
 Zhang Ting laughed."When we enter the remains, if you need any help, you can look for me. You're still young, and if there are things you don't understand, you can also come and ask me."
 "Thank you, sister Zhang!"
 Li Hao hurriedly nodded, full of joy.
 In his heart, he calculated that this woman should indeed be in the middle stage of the three yang realm. As for her ability, it was indeed water.
 Not only that ...
 Li Hao suspected that the other party also had an origin divine weapon.
 It was different from Hao lianchuan's Fire Phoenix. The fire Phoenix seemed to be alive. It was extremely obvious and could be seen clearly at a glance. It kept moving and seemed very powerful.
 Li Hao didn't notice this woman at first.
 At this moment, the two of them were facing each other and very close to each other. Li Hao almost saw through her.
 The reason why Li Hao thought that this woman might have an origin divine weapon was that he seemed to have seen a small, transparent snake slithering in the three suns 'big ball of light.
 If one didn't look carefully, one might not notice it, especially when the light of the three suns was so bright.
 Moreover, Li Hao seemed to have a better understanding of superpowers.
  He could even see some special places, such as the light ball that the other party appeared in. His four limbs were very bright, but his left hand was obviously not as bright and dim.
 This meant that the man had unlocked the superpower lock on his right hand and legs. The water element was connected to his kidney, so he must have unlocked the superpower lock on his kidney.
 After opening four super locks, he would have three suns.
 The woman in front of him might have a weakness in her left hand, as the strength of her four limbs was not balanced.
 "An existence at the middle stage of the three yang realm actually has an origin god weapon ..."
 Li Hao didn't know if that was the case, but he knew that anything that could be stored in one's body was not simple.
 If it was really an origin divine weapon, then this woman was very terrifying. Hao lianchuan's weapon seemed to be more powerful, but if they were to fight face to face, he might not lose. However, this woman was very good at hiding her strength.
 If it was a sneak attack ... Hao lianchuan might be in trouble.
 "Who arranged this?"
 Li Hao thought for a while. Wang Ming had already finished the chat and looked at Li Hao, chuckling. "Let's go to the next location. Sister Zhang, we'll be leaving first. "

 Zhang Ting nodded and watched the two of them leave.
 As for Wang Ming, after walking for a while, he said in a low voice,"Do you have a special fetish? Why didn't you chat with those young girls over there instead of talking to sister Zhang? she's already thirty or forty years old, and her looks ... You really have a problem!"
 Li Hao chuckled."She's gentle and nice to hear. Those young ones only care about talking to you. What can I do?"
 "Tsk, I don't even like it!"
 "I'm different now,"Wang Ming said smugly," I have to look a little further. Maybe I can marry a three yang or higher ..."
 "They're all very old!"
 Li Hao reminded him, but Wang Ming said disdainfully,"What do you know? that's the Silver Moon! In the central continent, some god tier Masters who are blessed by the heavens may awaken their innate talent to the radiant sun and become Third Sun in two or three years ... I heard that the youngest Third Sun is not even 20 years old. "
 "It's that powerful?"
 "Of course, that's why I'm going to set my sights on that side!"
 The two of them chatted for a while before walking towards the other tents.
  After that, Li Hao became a bystander, mainly watching Wang Ming chat. If someone asked, he would take the initiative to say a few words, as if he was a terrorist.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com ……
 After nearly two hours, when the sky was completely dark, Li Hao finally returned to his tent.
 At this moment, Liu Yan was no longer around.
 Li Hao looked suspicious. Yuan Shuo, who was resting, said without raising his head,""Liu Long has just returned and brought her to the Yama's side. They might be near the Yama's camp."
 "Teacher, there won't be a conflict, right?" Li Hao frowned.
 "Liu Long is here, so he probably won 't."
 Then, he glanced at Li Hao."You've been acting strange since we arrived here. Why are you running around with little Wang? tell me, what did you find?"
 Li Hao looked around.
 "You can directly spy on my conversation," Yuan Shuo said lazily."It doesn't matter whether I guard against it or not."
 If there really was such an expert, it didn't matter if they heard it or not.
 Li Hao turned to look at Wang Ming. Wang Ming had just entered the tent, but before he could react, Yuan Shuo said,"Go find the person in charge here and bring me some food. There's nothing left!"
 “……”
 Wang Ming was speechless. Why didn't he let Li Hao go?
 Alright, I'm more familiar with this place.
 He didn't say anything and turned to leave.
 After he left, Li Hao said,"Zhang Ting, water super, mid-stage three yang. She might have an origin divine weapon. She was in the seventh position on our left. She's a thin woman in her thirties."
 Yuan Shuo nodded."I know. That woman glanced at me before. I felt like I was being spied on." I thought it was a special ability. I didn't expect it!"
 He was not surprised, nor was he angry or shocked.
 It seemed very calm.
 "There's a high chance that Hao lianchuan doesn't know of this person's existence. He's either a spy for hou Xiaochen, a spy from the higher-ups of the night patrolmen, or a spy from the three major organizations. "
 There were only three possibilities.
 "He's been with the night patrollers for a long time, and he's probably been able to hide from hou Xiaochen ..."  With that thought in mind, Yuan Shuo smiled,"don't worry about it. I'll go see Hao lianchuan later. There's no need to talk to him, just find him directly and use a special method to contact hou Xiaochen. I've been wanting to talk to him for a long time. You can come with me later. You can also observe hou Xiaochen and get to know that guy."
 Hou Xiaochen!
 Li Hao was also very curious about this person, so he nodded.
 Li Hao was still considering whether he should tell Hao lianchuan that his teacher was about to contact hou Xiaochen.
 Yuan Shuo stood up.
 As they walked out, Wang Ming happened to come back with something. When he saw the two of them go out, he immediately said in surprise, "You're not eating?"
 "I'm not eating, you eat first!"
 Alright!
 Wang Ming was a little dejected. His own disciple was still the best; his in-name disciple was really pitiful.
 ……
 At the center of the camp.
 Hao lianchuan had a big tent for himself.
 At this moment, he was still considering whether he should call Li Hao over for a chat. Suddenly, his eyes flickered, and he opened the tent. Yuan Shuo had come by himself!
 He thought that Yuan Shuo had thought things through ...
 But before he could say anything, Yuan Shuo chuckled and said,""Contact hou Xiaochen, I want to talk to him!"
 “……”
 Hao lianchuan's expression turned ugly and he was a little annoyed.""If there's anything, just tell me directly!"
 "The Minister might not be here," he added."I heard that Red Moon and Yama's men have gone to the vicinity of Whitemoon city. The Minister might have left the headquarters."
 If he left, it would be difficult to contact him.
 "Let's try. Even if we go, we should meet on the 28th. If we meet earlier, are we just having fun?"
 Yuan Shuo's words made Hao lianchuan feel helpless.
 He could not help but ask,"Yuan Shuo, is this really necessary?" When did I offend you?"
  "No, I didn 't!"
 "Then, you ..."
 "You want to hear it?" Yuan Shuo asked helplessly. Do I have to listen? It might not be a good thing for you to listen to it. Of course, if you insist on listening, I won't stop you. You can just stand aside. What do you think?"
 Hao lianchuan wanted to say something but stopped himself. After a while, he said,""Forget it. I'm warning you, don't always think about giving me trouble! If I had known you were like this, I wouldn't have called you to come to explore the remains. "
 "I know!"
 Yuan Shuo waved his hand, not bothering to listen to what he had to say.
 Hao lianchuan felt that he was being ignored again and felt even more depressed.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, was trying to hold back his laughter.
 She didn't have any bad feelings towards Hao lianchuan, but she found it quite fun to see him suffer a few times.
 They entered the tent. Unlike the others 'primitive tents, Hao lianchuan's tent felt more like a base. There was a large display screen in the middle of the tent.

 Yuan Shuo took a look at it and nodded."I didn't expect you to really come up with it. This thing has a good communication effect, right?"
 "It's okay. As long as it's within three thousand miles, we can usually contact it ... But once there's super interference, we might lose contact. Once we enter the ruins, there's a high probability that we won't be able to contact the outside world."
 As he spoke, he fiddled with it and inserted some mysterious energy into a small hole.
 Then, he pressed a few more buttons.
 It was already late.
 However, in less than ten seconds, the screen lit up, revealing a young and lazy-looking face. Just as he was about to speak, he saw that it was Yuan Shuo opposite him, and his lazy attitude disappeared. He leaned back in his chair and laughed."Professor Yuan, long time no see!"
 "Minister hou!"
 "It's been a long time indeed,"Yuan Shuo's eyes flickered.
 "Minister, he insisted on contacting you ..."
 "Yes, I know."
  "Go do your thing, I'll talk to professor Yuan," hou Xiaochen nodded.
 "Alright then!"
 Hao lianchuan had no choice but to leave. Before he left, he glanced at Li Hao, but Li Hao acted as if he hadn't seen him. He lowered his head and didn't leave. He stayed beside Yuan Shuo.
 “……”
 Hao lianchuan was completely speechless and left immediately. He really didn't want to stay with this master and disciple duo. Every time, he would feel suffocated.
 ……
 In the tent.
 Li Hao brought a chair for Yuan Shuo, who sat down with a smile.
 Hou Xiaochen glanced at Li Hao and said with a smile, "He's Li Hao, right?"
 "Yes,"
 "That's not bad,"
 Hou Xiaochen nodded his head,"it's a blessing to be able to endure. Your friend died a horrible death, but you're able to endure it for a year without revealing anything. Your temper is much better than yours."
 Hou Xiaochen commented before turning to Yuan Shuo, "You're looking for me in the middle of the night, you must have something to say, right?"
 "Zhang Ting!"
 Yuan Shuo only said two words.
 Hou Xiaochen fell into deep thought. After a while, he slowly said,"Zhang Ting ... Came from Nanyue province. She joined the Silver Moon night patroller three years ago. She was originally under the Nanyue Inspection Division, but because she offended her colleagues, she was sent to Silver Moon. She started off as a member of the inspection Division. Three years ago, she performed a Meritorious Service and absorbed energy into her body, becoming a night patroller. Now, her strength is registered as a full moon ..."
 "Do you know her current strength?" Yuan Shuo asked directly.
 Hou Xiaochen was silent for a moment before asking,"did you get an origin god weapon or something?" The eight great families "weapons, you have one, right?"
 "Why do you say that?"
 "Without the origin god weapon, how can you see through Zhang Ting?"
 Hou Xiaochen asked.
 After he finished speaking, he said with a faint smile,"or is it that your student has seen through it?" Is the bloodline of the eight great families really that magical?"
 "Friend or Foe?" Yuan Shuo was too lazy to reply.
 "It's hard to say,"
 "Hard to say?"
 Yuan Shuo frowned.
 "It's highly likely that they're not from the three major organizations,"hou Xiaochen laughed."It's possible that some people are preventing me from becoming independent, so they've sent people to watch me."
 "You're going to be independent?"
 "You still have such ambitions?" Yuan Shuo was a little surprised.
 "I don't have that kind of ambition," hou Xiaochen chuckled,"but there's no need to be too surprised. The central region, keep on sending the border officials to the central region to weaken the border's strength and send these people into the central battlefield, causing countless deaths and injuries ... Taking in geniuses into the central region and sending the strong into the battlefield, to those guys who want to become independent, this is to restrain and suppress their ambitions, I agree. "
 "To us, the Silver Moon, there are only so many experts. We can't even defeat the three great organizations 'branches, so it's not right to mobilize our forces and recruit geniuses as reserves! I dragged them away a few times, and they might not be satisfied, so they arranged for Zhang Ting to monitor me. "  "If you force me again, I'll be independent!"
 “……”
 Yuan Shuo was a little shocked.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, was even more shocked.
 He had been talking to Wang Ming and the others about this in the car earlier, but he had felt that Silver moon's side didn't have such intentions. But now ... The boss of Silver moon's Nightwalker was directly and unscrupulously saying that he was going to stand on his own!
 "Don't stare at me like that. You're not a good person, Yuan Shuo. Do you really care about that?"
 Yuan Shuo suddenly laughed."I don't care. It's just that ... It's just that I didn't expect you to have such thoughts. In my opinion, you should go to the central region and beg for forgiveness."
 "Why?"
 "If they send people to wipe out the three great organizations," hou Xiaochen laughed,"it wouldn't be impossible for me to fight in the central region if silver Moon is safe. However, Silver Moon isn't a peaceful place in the current situation. If I leave, Silver Moon will be abandoned. If that's the case ... Why are you leaving?"
 "The night patrollers, the inspection Division, and the garrison have reached an agreement. It's just that the administration Bureau hasn't reached an agreement yet. Professor Yuan, are you interested in joining us?"
 “……”
 Yuan Shuo was also a little troubled. He was only asking about the situation, but the other party had directly invited him to rebel!
 After a long while, Yuan Shuo said dejectedly,"if you don't have enough strength, the gun will shoot the bird that takes the lead!"
 "Yes, that's for sure,"
 "That's why I'm not in a hurry,"hou Xiaochen laughed. This time, he had seized the defensive origin god weapon in preparation for this. If you're willing to join us, you might still be a little lacking now, but when you're able to go a step further and display your old devil style of killing people until they're terrified, wouldn't that be great?"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Yuan Shuo had a headache, and after a while, he said,""What about Zhang Ting?"
 "It's up to you. She won't attack the night patrolmen, and she won't attack you either ... But don't expect her to attack when you're in danger. Of course, if he's really dead ... Then he's dead!"
 "It's fine if she dies, but Hao lianchuan can't die!"Hou Xiaochen said. If you have the spare energy, help Hao lianchuan solve some problems. "
 "I'm douqian, and he's three suns,"Yuan Shuo said with a headache.
 "Oh!"
 Hou Xiaochen nodded and chuckled,"it's fine. Do as you see fit." By the way, do you want the method of extracting the blood God's spawn from the red shadow?"
 “……”
 Yuan Shuo was silent.
 "Then I'll tell you. It's very simple. If you have an origin divine weapon, use the soul of the origin divine weapon and directly absorb it. But the weapons of the eight great families might not be the same ... It's fine, Hao lianchuan took the fiery phoenix spear with him. You can borrow it."
 He then added,"if you have the ability, then kill everyone from the three major organizations!" If you can't kill them all, then after this exploration ends, you can escape!"
 "Where to?"
 Yuan Shuo looked at him and frowned slightly.
 "You can go wherever you want. Just have Li Hao come to white moon City."
 Yuan Shuo pondered for a moment and nodded,"alright!" So, this time, I'll be the one to snatch the defensive origin god weapon? Am I right?"
 "If you think it's possible, then it's possible."
  Yuan Shuo was silent for a moment before he replied,"alright, I'll think about it!" After this, I don't owe you any more favors. "
 "I don't owe you anything, up to you!"
 Yuan Shuo immediately turned around and left. On the screen, hou Xiaochen was silent for a moment before suddenly speaking,"I can promise you that the remains of the silver Blizzard city will be Li Hao 'S. I won't interfere!"
 Yuan Shuo's body trembled slightly. He didn't say anything and left with Li Hao.
 On the screen, hou Xiaochen had also quieted down. After a while, when Hao lianchuan entered the room, he said softly,"I can lend the fire Phoenix spear to Yuan Shuo at the crucial moment!"
 "Ah?"
 "Just like this!"
 As soon as he finished speaking, the screen turned dark.
 Hao lianchuan cursed in his heart. This again!
 These guys are really annoying!
