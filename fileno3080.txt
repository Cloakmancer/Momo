However, this was not Li Hao's only goal. He hesitated for a moment, thought for a while, and finally said,""Also ... If ... During this process, the tianfang universe shows signs of recovery ... If some great Dao stars show signs of recovery ... Dao Masters, move the stars directly into the Silvermoon universe!"“……”The two of them looked at him in surprise.Was this ... Going to tear down the house?You also want to tear down the Dao universe?And it was Tian Fang 's!As for Li Hao, he exhaled and said,"don't worry. Tianfang's Dao universe is probably arranged according to the rules of Dao chess. I know how to dismantle it. Although I haven't finished it all, I know the first few thousand Dao!"That's right, he had thought it through. If there were any signs of recovery, he would tear it down and not let the tianfang universe recover now.It was recovering at this stage, but once it was discovered, it would be a huge problem.No one was interested in finding trouble with the silent tianfang great Dao universe at the moment, but once it was revived ... The others who had left before would all appear. As for whether they knew or not, how could they not know that the revived great Dao universe still had the accumulation of great Dao?Outside of tianfang, if they said that there were no spies from the major worlds, they would be underestimating the experts of the major worlds. There might even be seventh or eighth level venerable sovereigns keeping an eye on this place.After warning the Silver Moon Warriors, Li Hao turned to look at Kong Ji, who had been preparing.""Nirvana, I don't think it'll be difficult ... Resurrect, can you resurrect Tian Fang?"Even if it was destroyed, it still had to be revived.Otherwise, the entire world would be ruined.After destroying a large world ... Not only would the wandering cultivators have no place to stay, but if they really met the experts of tianfang world in the future, they would be killed!"Let's try!"Kong Ji shook his head,"I can't say for now!" "In addition, with Nirvana and revival erupting at the same time, my two DAOs can reach their current limits. As for light and darkness, the dark Demon Ridge is here, and the place of the light envoy's Dao accumulation may appear ... It's not a big problem, after all, he's still a level eight venerable sovereign! But I still want to walk the path of life and death ... The fusion of the three extremes of six paths ...""This ..." He frowned slightly, not willing to just walk the path of four paths merging."Life and death Emperor, there doesn't seem to be any overly famous characters in the records of Tian Fang."This way, even if Nirvana was successful, it would not be impossible for him to reach tier 7. However, he would not be able to meet his expectations!Life and death ...Hearing this, Li Hao also hesitated. He looked at Kong Ji and said after a long time,""You can't be thinking of directly pulling Tian Fang to his death, right? If you do that, you'll be in big trouble!"Some venerable sovereigns of Tian Fang were still alive.For example, Daoist Coiling Dragon, Daoist Firerain, the secret emissary...It was difficult to borrow the power of those who were alive and dead.It's fine if Nirvana is resurrected, but you want to destroy the world directly ... Moreover, you might not be able to destroy it.In any case, it would definitely cause big trouble. "That's not what I meant, I mean ..."Kong Ji shook his head."I mean, I might want to walk the path of life and death once ..." He paused and exhaled.Li Hao instantly frowned!Kong Ji said seriously,"I've learned about life and death, but I haven't gone through the life and death reincarnation cycle. I don't have a deep understanding of it!" To die in the extreme, to be reborn in death ... To walk the true cycle of life and death!""According to what you said, you might lose your memory. This is the first reason! Second, the limit of one's lifespan was reduced! "Third, there might be other drawbacks ..."Kong Ji hesitated."What I'm thinking about now is that if I go through the Samsara, my Nirvana world is still incomplete. If I can't rely on it ... Your River is much more perfect than mine. If I can't rely on it, my great Dao will scatter, and I might die completely!"He needed something to carry it. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  Li Hao had used the river of Dao. The first time, he had relied on the two-Dao universe. Kong Ji was at the peak of level six, and the two-Dao universe could not withstand his reincarnation.If his Nirvana world wasn't perfect enough, he wouldn't be able to form a complete cycle and might fail.Then he would really be dead!Li Hao smiled."I'll use my River as a support ... It's fine if it carries one side, but it's best if another one comes ... I'll call venerable the sword. Venerable the sword's Dao domain is still considered perfect!"However, Li Hao added,"you're extremely young and have an infinite lifespan. It's hard for you to naturally age ... I used the power of time too much. You can't decline naturally. If you want to walk the path of life and death, you'll have to do it on purpose ... And it's a bit of a waste!"Kong Ji looked at him and felt his head hurt.It was indeed a waste!Dying once would not only affect one's lifespan, but also waste a large amount of resources.Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"how about this? if you really want to go on a life-and-death journey, I won't try to stop you. It's not a big problem to go once!" However, don't waste your energy too much. How about this ... I have life and death, Nirvana, recovery, light and darkness, and other small realms. You can fill them up for me!"The energy of a sixth stage venerable sovereign was not weak.Help me perfect my little realm!Kong Ji was speechless. This fellow, you're really ... Plucking the feathers from the goose that passed by."In addition," Li Hao said,"you'll need a lot of pure power of great DAOs to resurrect. Are you ready?"Kong Ji was a little embarrassed and shook his head.Not yet!He had spent all the money he had before.When his father left, he insisted on taking him with him. He said that he wouldn't leave and insisted on making a name for himself. In the end ... He was too embarrassed to ask for money.

Chapter 3081 Quiet (3)_5
He had absorbed the world Energy of the entire Crimson Moon world, pushing himself to the peak of the sixth step.This time, the life and death reincarnation cycle would retain a part of the power essence, but a large amount of power would still overflow. It would not require the level 8 world power, but it would definitely consume a lot of resources.I forgot about this!As a rich second-generation heir, I've never been short of money. I was a little short of money before, but I absorbed the power of an eighth-rank major world. Now that I think about it ... I don't seem to have any other sources.He had spent all his money!What should he do now?Li Hao was also speechless.'I thought a rich kid like you would have some background, but you're empty-handed and told me you're going through the cycle of life and death. You're even more unreliable than me, but I'm prepared every time!'Previously, he did not lack resources, but he had given them all to Silver Moon. Now, he did not have any, and the remaining resources were used up for his own recovery."How about ... I ask my father for some?""It's impossible." Kong Ji was conflicted."I should be able to keep a part of it. However, it's almost impossible to recover to my peak without one billion or eight billion Dao crystals."It was easy and simple to say.One billion or eight hundred million would do.Previously, Li Hao had burned even more money than this.However, 10 million great Dao crystals could buy a small world. 100 million could buy a slightly weaker medium-level world.But Li Hao didn't have any!Should he ask for it from the light Emperor?Kong Ji felt a little embarrassed. As for Li Hao, he didn't want to get the light Thearch involved either. It would be very troublesome. Perhaps the other party would enter Tian Fang, which would be even more troublesome.Ordinary rank six venerable sovereigns did not need this much, but Kong Ji really did.At this thought, Li Hao said,"why don't we ... Ask a few Level Seven venerable sovereigns? maybe we can find one?" Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  “……”He was speechless. Those paupers had spent everything in order to advance. Are you sure you really have it?He suddenly realized that he was really poor!He couldn't even take out 1.8 billion great Dao crystals!We're the Masters of the four major worlds, but we're still so poor. I don't know where we've spent our money.Only now did he realize how much money Li Hao had spent on Silver Moon. At this moment, the two of them were in a dilemma because of the money.How troublesome!He was short of money again! Kong Ji sighed."If it doesn't work, I won't walk the path of life and death. It's actually pretty good. Four bipolar is not bad!"It was truly difficult to completely comprehend the Dao of life and death if one didn't walk it once.Cultivators who cultivated the life and death Dao were all rich. He thought to himself,"I, a rank eight, can't even afford to cultivate it. It's difficult for me to even walk once, but Li Hao walked four times ... The previous time, he absorbed the remains of two rank seven venerable sovereigns."This satisfied his needs.Kong Ji hadn't paid much attention to it before. Thinking back, when they killed the awakening gods, each of them had received more than 100 million great Dao crystals. The awakening God Thearch alone had received 500 million. In fact, Li Hao had spent one billion great Dao crystals to revive to level five!He didn't even notice this before!But now ... Without money, he couldn't even revive himself.He had a headache. Li Hao was also thinking about something.An ordinary great cosmos absolute being could still afford one billion. Previously, sector Lord Senlan had only been a Tier 6 world absolute being. If it wasn't for the fact that he had consumed a lot of energy to advance, he could easily take out a few hundred million great Dao crystals.Was he going to Rob a Lord of the seventh step?The solitary void had helped him a lot. This time, he had taken the heaven's path for Silver Moon and also for the solitary void.Four dual-pole Lords were not bad!However, it would be a pity if he chose to give up just because he was short of a little energy.At this thought, Li Hao quickly sent a message.A moment later, four shadows appeared. Li Hao still wanted to try, so he asked,""Seniors, sorry to disturb you again. We're short of some energy ... About one billion great Dao crystals are enough for great Dao energy. Seniors ... Can you gather that amount? Lend me some ..."The venerable sovereigns looked at each other.Venerable the sword was a little embarrassed. After a while, he coughed and said,""I still have some savings here ... About 30 million Dao crystals. The ones I saved before ..."Sector Lord Sen LAN waved his hands,"I've spent all my flowers for advancement!."Li Zhu didn't say a word and pretended not to hear it. He didn't have any, and he was even poorer than venerable the sword.Wu Shan laughed bitterly."I actually have one more thing. When I killed Hong Yu, I left behind a lot of power of the great Dao, but I didn't give it to Yunxiao. However ... Hong Yu left very little power of the great Dao. Even if we compare it, it's not bad if it can be compared to 100 million great Dao crystals."Four level 7s could only gather 130 million great Dao crystals.There was also the son of a rank eight venerable sovereign and the rank five silver Moon King ...This group of people had spent money so generously and like water before, but now that it had come to this, they couldn't even gather 200 million.Li Hao was also helpless!After some thought, he said,"if we destroy the Outlander domain, the Outlander domain's world power can also condense into a great Dao crystal, right? however ... It needs to be used to revive the Outlander domain. Unless the Outlander domain isn't revived, it can be gathered."This was also not feasible!It was impossible for the light to not awaken.Seeing that everyone was having a headache over his matter, Kong Ji still said,""Forget it, I'll go find my father directly. One billion might be a little difficult ... But my father has accumulated for many years, even a million years. He can still take it out!"

Chapter 3082 Quiet (6)
Just as everyone was at their wits 'end, a shadow suddenly appeared.The shadow of the chess piece!"You want a great Dao crystal?"Kong Ji looked at the chess figure and was a little surprised that this person had appeared.He nodded."Yes, do you have it, senior? If you do, you can lend me some. I'll pay you back when I have money ..."The Dao chess virtual shadow shook his head."I don't have it. If I did, I wouldn't be so weak!"Then what the hell are you saying!"I don't have it, but there's a place that definitely has it!" The Dao chess Phantom said.Everyone was moved.The mysterious man didn't beat around the bush and directly said,""Tianfang world has been recovering for many years. It's not like the great Dao universe, which has been in constant destruction! "A level nine world origin absorbing the power of Chaos ... Over the past million years, even if I accumulate 1000 great Dao crystals a year, that would be one billion!"1000 a year, could a level 9 world accumulate that much?Not ten million, just a thousand!Everyone's hearts moved. This was true.It had been too many years!Kong Ji was overjoyed, but Li Hao frowned."Senior, do you mean that there are many great Dao crystals at the source of the world?""Yes,""Will it be very troublesome?""You guys even destroyed a Nirvana world, so why are you afraid of trouble?"The mysterious man was speechless. Are you guys afraid?If he was afraid, the world would not be destroyed!"Then, for senior to remind us now ... Does senior also need our help in any way?""Right!"The Dao chess virtual shadow did not hold back,"my main body is a Dao chess piece, you know that!" You all know that the essence of Dao chess is an eighth-tier great cosmos!"Everyone nodded. Everyone was clear about this."However, I've been refined into a sovereign weapon, so I've lost the chance to grow on my own," the shadow continued."In addition, I've been placed in the dark Demon Ridge for too long, causing the internal energy of the Dao chess to be almost depleted. My strength has also declined greatly!""I can't leave tianfang so easily. Once I leave, I'll become a universe of the great Dao without anyone restricting me ... At that time, I'll be in trouble.""Senior, do you want to replenish your energy?" Li Hao nodded."It can be considered so.""I've told you before," the shadow said."When you lent me some power that day, you might have to pay the price of an eighth-tier great cosmos! It means that I'm almost completely empty ... Otherwise, why would I need so much energy?"Everyone was short of money, and so was the game of chess."I'm the sovereign weapon of the master of tianfang," the shadow continued."From the day I was created, I was given something ... Or rather, rules. I can't harm tianfang world! So, this time, since you want to do it, I won't stop you. There will definitely be some danger, but ... If the source of the world really appears, besides satisfying the needs of the void ... Can you give me all the remaining energy gathered by the source of the world?"“……”"Senior ..." Kong Ji frowned."The Dao Qi Phantom said,"you can count it as a favor you owe fellow Daoist Li Hao ... Just deduct it!" However, the world origin is the source of a level 9 world. Once it retaliates, it'll be very terrifying ... I can't do anything, but I can do you all a small favor ... If there's really a projection or Dao accumulation of an expert from the tianfang era, I can help to deter them! Using the aura of the master of Tian Fang to intimidate them ... This would weaken their will to resist! It's good for you to unite the entire world ..."Li Hao thought for a moment, but he didn't feel that it was inappropriate. He was just a little confused."Senior, at your current stage, what do you need to do with a large amount of energy?"The shadow wanted to roll his eyes!"Why? Because ... Everyone knows of my existence and wants to take me away! I'm very weak now, and many venerable sovereigns know of my existence. I can't leave Tian Fang, but you can leave at any time. Once you leave, do you think I'll just be slaughtered by them?"This question!Wasn't it because of you?Otherwise, after all these years, it doesn't matter if I don't have the power. No one knows of my existence anyway.But now? Now, you've exposed me.And you're asking me why I need energy?Li Hao was a little embarrassed. He had forgotten about this.Li Hao coughed lightly."That's true ... By the way, senior, if you can accommodate senior Wushan's great Dao, perhaps we'll be satisfied. Senior Wushan might be able to take the opportunity to reach level 8, and you won't need to recover on your own.""No!"Before Wushan could say anything, the chess figure shook his head."He can 't!"Wu Shan's face darkened!I haven't even said that I don't want you!You're despising me?You're just an empty shell from an eighth-tier universe. What is there to be proud of?Dao Qi didn't care what he thought and explained,""His Dao is not compatible with the core of my universe!""Senior's core is space?""No."Dao Qi shook his head,"space, that's Tian Fang, I'm not Tian Fang!" I'm just a weapon refined by the master of Tian Fang, and I still retain the core Dao origin of the previous level-eight universe. Strictly speaking, my core Dao can be considered ... A shadow!"Shadow!Li Hao was slightly surprised. Dao Qi said,""This is also the reason why I was left with the dark Envoy. The dark Envoy cultivates the way of darkness, and my core is the shadow, so I can be considered a part of the darkness!""Therefore, Wu Shan's Dao is not compatible with mine. If we merge, it may not be beneficial. It may even cause both sides to suffer!"He glanced at Li Hao and then at the empty silence. Both of them were fine.He didn't mind cultivating both light and darkness at the same time and accommodating time Dao. Of course, the Dao of time was the best, but ... Time cultivator Li Hao seemed to be bent on developing his own universe. This made him feel helpless.Even an eighth-tier universe would be looked down upon one day."I don't need it either," Wu Shan said."An empty eighth-rank shell can't give me any help. Other than an extra shell, there's no other benefit. It's very difficult for me to take the opportunity to reach the eighth-rank! Forget it. Otherwise, I'll have to feed the chess game, which is too troublesome!"You despise me, but I despise you too!The chess figure was also speechless. 'Forget it, there's nothing to say between us. I'm not interested in you.'At this moment, Li Hao didn't say anything more. He nodded.""Alright, then we agree! Other than the portion that can satisfy the void, if I can really get it, I'll give the rest to senior! Senior, you need to help us deter all existences like the tianfang Taoist connotation, projections, and avatars. "A clone? Dao Qi was speechless and shook his head."I don't think so. Don't worry too much. Avatars aren't popular in tianfang world!" Even if there are, with four rank 7s here, it shouldn't be a big problem. Don't worry!"Li Hao nodded. That was true.At this moment, he did not waste any more time and quickly sent a message to heaven and earth. His voice was like thunder."Seven days later, the world will be destroyed! The cultivators of Silvermoon could find a place with Dao accumulation that was compatible with them to cultivate and comprehend! Venerable sovereigns will split up and stay in various places in case of any changes!"At that moment, the Silver Moon cultivators all began to move.Li Hao and Kong Ji were also ready.Start the preparations!The huge tianfang world was no longer guarded against them.……At the same time.Outside of Tian Fang, in the depths of the chaos, there were indeed many venerable sovereigns lurking and spying on Tian Fang. It was unknown what these people would do after taking over the empty shell of Tian Fang.Now, all the families were having an emergency meeting.Tianfang and neo martial were the targets of each family. Whether to join forces to destroy the scourge of neo martial first or to gather strength first to capture all the powerhouses in tianfang, this fixed place, was also a problem that each family was discussing.The hidden venerable sovereigns only had one mission. Once the Dao accumulations of the great Dao appeared in tianfang, they were to immediately inform all parties. They were not allowed to let the revived tianfang universe be seized by this group of people.Everyone was waiting in silence.In the tianfang region, the rare silence was somewhat suffocating.

Chapter 3083 Desire (Taking Leave Tomorrow)_1
Seven days passed in the blink of an eye.Tianfang world.Li Hao and Kong Ji, one in the South and the other in the North, stood at the peak of the world. They were both a little excited. Although the experts of the Nirvana world had disappeared ... It was still a rather exciting feeling.Four Grade 7 experts were in charge of the four directions.At the same time, the four of them were also paying close attention to the inside and outside. They had to be careful of other venerable sovereigns coming in, and they had to be careful of some unknown dangerous places in tianfang world.At this moment, Kong Ji took a deep breath."It's so big!"He suddenly laughed."The world is so big. It's as if ... The light has been destroyed. In the past, I didn't dare to have such thoughts. If I dare to think about it, my father will beat me to death."But today, being with these people, he suddenly felt that the Nirvana sky square was nothing.There's nothing we don't dare to do!Right now, he was a little weak, but ... He wouldn't continue to be weak.Not to mention the four level Seven venerable sovereigns, it was hard to say who was stronger between him and Li Hao. This was not his original intention. He admired Li Hao, but he did not want to be surpassed by someone younger than him."This time, I'm going to enter the seventh rank!He thought to himself.Even if his strength did not reach the seventh level, his realm had to reach the seventh level. As long as he had enough resources, he would instantly reach the seventh level and become the six paths Supreme Emperor!"Let's start!""Nirvana world!" He murmured. In the next moment, the Nirvana world emerged from his body and began to expand.This time, it was no longer a simple enchantment. It spread from underground to the depths of the magma until it penetrated the entire boundary.The dark Nirvana world began to expand slowly.It was far inferior to the large world that he could casually display on normal days!Not only that, at this moment, in the center of the Nirvana world, there seemed to be a small flower that gradually began to grow. It absorbed the power of the entire world and destroyed the entire world to give birth to a Flower of Life!Li Hao said that he would return it and revive the world!But what if ... He didn't return it?Kong Ji thought silently.If I don't return it, will this flower be able to absorb the power of a rank nine world to reach rank seven?At that time, I will be able to step into the sixth level of the third level venerable Emperor's domain and step into the seventh rank.They would become the peak existences among the grade 7 ones.Even if it wasn't grade 8, it wouldn't be much worse.Perhaps ... I will be the next neo martial artist King. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  The flower grew up bit by bit.Darkness began to envelop the surroundings. The earth and sky turned dark, and the entire region became chaotic.……In the North.A small world appeared and like the void, it went deep into the ground. The small world rumbled and the four directions started to be destroyed. However, little flower was born in the realm of desolation.As for Li Hao ... He was only a small blade of grass that had not yet emerged.This also represented their comprehension of Dao. Grass had a strong life force, so it took root and struggled to survive. Flowers, on the other hand, had a higher demand for Dao, so it was more troublesome to raise them.After all, Nirvana and revival were the main DAOs of the void.Li Hao could only be considered a minor.The grass began to grow, and the sharp tips of the grass began to emerge.The power of Nirvana started to spread in all directions.At this moment, Li Hao sensed that all living things and all matter were dying. He fell into an absolute silence.The mountains, the water, the rocks, the earth, and even the wind were all dying.All living things were dying!This was the great Dao of Nirvana, and it was not weak.Although the ten thousand DAOs didn't have any differences in size, strength, or weakness ... There were some DAOs that were more suitable for fighting, more suitable for killing. In the eyes of cultivators, those DAOs were the DAOs of the strong!The Dao of Nirvana was obviously the Dao of the strong.In two directions, the two Nirvana zones started to expand. Compared to tianfang world, they seemed extremely small. It was just that they seemed to have an additional ringworm, making them look a little ugly.The four seventh rank venerable sovereigns looked down at the sky and saw the two ugly black dots.Within the area covered by the fog, there was complete silence.In the air.The little bird instantly froze in the air, as if time had stopped.Li Hao observed and observed. He had used the power of Nirvana several times before, but he didn't have a clear perception. Now, he was deep in thought.That day, when Time and Stars appeared, everything froze.It was as if time had stopped!The Nirvana realm was actually similar. All living things were stagnant. The difference was that the Nirvana realm would absorb energy. The energy of all living things had fallen into silence and was being extracted.Didn't that mean that the Nirvana world was even stronger than the time freezing power? Other than the ability to go back to the past, it seemed that time was not much stronger than Nirvana."Something's wrong ..."As he continued to annihilate everything, Li Hao wondered what the difference was between time and destruction, which both had the function of freezing everything.What were Shi Guang's strengths?"Nirvana ... Time is still flowing!"Li Hao thought of something. Yes, in the realm of Nirvana, time and space were not destroyed. Time and space actually existed, which meant that the birds in the realm of Nirvana ... Were alive, but dead.However, as time passed, they would die of old age!However, time would not stop!Time froze, and time no longer flowed. After 10000 years, 100000 years, 100000 years ... Everything was still the same. If the chaos entered Nirvana, all cultivators would die in 1000000 years!However, if time was frozen, after a million years, time would dissipate and everything would return to normal. Perhaps the cultivators would not be able to realize that time had just frozen.

Chapter 3084 Desire (Taking Leave Tomorrow)_2
"Is this the difference?""Spacetime is unaffected!""No... Life and death will not be affected!"Since time could pass, death would appear. Since death had appeared ... It meant that the Dao of life and death was actually not affected by Nirvana. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  "Nirvana can only destroy the form, not the spirit!""Time, however, can even stagnate the spirit."Li Hao sensed all the changes as he walked on the ground. He not only sensed Nirvana, but also the solidification of all things, including mountains and rivers, during the process of Nirvana. Their vitality was instantly drawn away, and they fell into dead silence ...Li Hao was deeply moved by this change.Time and space did not change.The space was still the same space, and time was still flowing ..."Time doesn't have to flow backward, backtrack, or speed up ... It can be frozen!"When he first saw Time and Stars, everything seemed to have frozen, and even space seemed to have stopped flowing.Li Hao, on the other hand, used to use the acceleration and reversal of time.Borrowing force was actually a way to backtrack.As for the simple solidification ... He rarely used it.Due to his limited strength, he was unable to freeze his opponent if he was strong. He could only make his opponent temporarily stay in place. Therefore, he felt that it was not very practical and had not used this ability much.However, Li Hao had some new ideas."Nirvana is also solidification! It's actually easier to not freeze spacetime. Can you split up time a bit and reduce some of its overall functions, pushing out the freezing of space? would it be easier to use it?""The Dao of time can freeze tens of thousands of DAOs ... Does that mean that time is indeed the combination of tens of thousands of DAOs?"Li Hao kept thinking.In the past, he had thought of forming time with thousands of DAOs. But now, he suddenly realized something. What if he deduced in reverse?Time tears apart!For example, if the opponent was a fire-type, could my Dao of time only target the fire-type and freeze the Dao of fire? I wouldn't need to freeze all the DAOs at once, but only the Dao of fire?Would this work?"Time ... Is a combination! That can also be opened!"Li Hao was a little vexed. Since I know how to tear down the net of Dao, tear down the world, and tear down the great Dao universe, why have I never thought about tearing down time?Shi Guang, can I really not tear her apart?Of course, it was very difficult at the moment.Was he going to use the Dao of time to trace back the structure of the Dao of time?This might be a fallacy!If he didn't go back in time, how would he be able to present the structure of time Dao?How did they succeed?It was really a headache! "Time and Stars ..."Li Hao suddenly thought of something. The time star, when he first saw it, actually had some consciousness. Later, Li Hao didn't pay attention to it and often met up with it.But can I directly comprehend time and star?What if he could find a unique method to counter one Dao?Wouldn't it be easier to freeze an expert's strongest orthodoxy?Could the power of time only be of such little value?Whether it was backtrack or downstream, they both consumed lifespan.What kind of time was this?Why would a true Dao of time cultivator be limited by lifespan?Thus, perhaps there was a problem with his usage of time. The Dao of time might not be limited to this. Backtrack and downstream were both special methods of usage. Otherwise, why would a Dao of time cultivator not dare to use time normally?What kind of Supreme great Dao would that be?"Backtrack and downstream will both trigger the chaos lightning tribulation. That's just simply gathering, freezing, and freezing time ... Will that trigger the descent of the chaos lightning tribulation?"The emptiness on the other side was painstakingly destroying the world.On the other hand, Li Hao's mind was elsewhere.Li Hao didn't care too much about the strength of a Dao. Time was still his core essence. Therefore, he would deduce time more based on his understanding of other DAOs.This time, he seemed to have comprehended many things.At this moment, Li Hao was thinking of reversing time.Suddenly, a star began to spin and appeared in front of them. The four seventh rank venerable sovereigns who were observing frowned. If it was just Nirvana, then it was Nirvana. Why did it condense a time star for no reason? At this moment, Li Hao was still destroying the world, but his mind had already drifted away.The star in front of him was shining.It was just the appearance of a star. There was no major movement, so it did not attract the attention of the chaos lightning tribulation. They just had to be careful. Now that Li Hao could conceal his aura, the chaos lightning tribulation would not be able to find him as long as he did not go overboard.Suddenly, Li Hao took the star in his hand and pointed it forward. The world froze.It formed a sharp contrast with the Nirvana world.Within the Nirvana world, it was dark.On the other hand, the small area where time had frozen was still the same as before. Other than the creatures no longer moving, everything was still alive, and there were not many changes."Does Quietus ... Exist in time?"At this moment, Li Hao's consciousness suddenly sank into the time star. He had actually tried it once a long time ago, but he stopped later, because he was almost frozen in time during that attempt.This time, Li Hao tried again. His eyes glowed with a golden light.In an instant ... He seemed to see a dense net of Dao!A lot, a lot!Li Hao was shocked. Dao net ... As expected, time wasn't just a single Dao net. Although he had guessed it long ago, at this moment, he seemed to really see the existence of the Dao net. However, the Dao formed by this Dao net seemed very weak.

Chapter 3085 Desire (Taking Leave Tomorrow)_3
"The prototype ..."Li Hao had some ideas. This time star was actually just an embryonic form, an extremely young time star.Someone had built such a star.And so, the stars of time appeared on the Silver Moon.Battling the heaven Thearch!It was definitely him!At this moment, Li Hao was certain and a little shocked. Zhan Tiandi had actually constructed a time star and woven 10000 DAOs. It was a true gathering of 10000 DAOs, but the DAOs he had woven were very weak.There wasn't enough energy!The fact that the other party had comprehended ten thousand DAOs and weaved ten thousand DAOs meant that his comprehension of the realm was unimaginably high. Perhaps ... Grade-9?However, the energy of the new martial arts was not enough for him to construct a truly powerful ten thousand Dao.Thus, this was the only thing that was formed."Terrifying!"Li Hao mumbled. It was too terrifying. As far as he knew, the strongest person was the master of the sky. However, he had constructed 9999 great DAOs, forming the space Dao. As for Zhan Tiandi, he might have constructed 10000 great DAOs, forming time!What was the missing Dao?Or could it be that there were more than 10000 DAOs in chaos? it was just that the different construction methods caused the final core DAOs to be different?Then ... Can I destroy this star?Li Hao looked at the star of time in front of him ... At this moment, he was suddenly tempted. If I tear down this star and construct a new time in my own way, is it possible?BOOM!A loud noise interrupted Li Hao's thoughts. A powerful Taoist connotation suddenly burst out, and a vague shadow appeared.It seemed to be from ancient times! Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  p With the power of a great Dao that Li Hao was familiar with, this was a place left behind by a middle-stage venerable sovereign. At this moment, as Li Hao died, the power of the hidden Dao suddenly erupted!There were also a few Silvermoon cultivators on this mountain.At this moment, they were all very nervous.A powerful pressure swept across the heavens and earth, resisting the destructive power. However, it was quickly suppressed by the destructive power. Vaguely, someone seemed to be roaring, but it was not clear.It was far less vivid than the sound of the great Dao that came from the seventh-grade Taoist connotation when he went back to the past!At this moment, a long river of Dao appeared and suppressed the riot. The Silver Moon cultivators around looked up as if they had seen something. Some of them were dazed as if they had seen a Soaring Eagle!This place should have been the place where a Giant Eagle Imperial venerable used to be. The Taoist connotation emerged, and some people saw it spreading its wings and flying, while others saw an Eagle soaring in the sky!As the destructive power went deeper, the power of the Taoist connotation instantly spread in all directions.In the next moment, Hong Yitang controlled the bed-calling River and covered it. The river swept over and absorbed the Dao accumulation. In the river, a branch called bed was vaguely stronger.Hong Yitang appeared next to Li Hao. He was a little confused as to why Li Hao had used time star, but he didn't say anything.Seeing that this place of Taoist connotation was suppressed, the Taoist connotation overflowed, and was completely destroyed ... Hong Yitang absorbed the power of the Taoist connotation and left some residual waves for the people at the foot of the mountain to comprehend. Then, he disappeared. At this moment, Taoist connotation also exploded in the South.BOOM!It was as if a giant beast had soared into the sky. The heavens and the earth shook, and the great path universe appeared at this moment. Vaguely, some stars were flashing with extremely weak light. These Taoist connotation seemed to affect the great path universe.The remnants of the great Dao's power had stimulated some stars. This was also a sign of recovery.……While Li Hao and Kong Ji were destroying Tian Fang ...Chaos.In a place so far away that he didn't know the way.There was also a world standing there, similar to Tian Fang.However, what was more shocking was that the entire world was filled with great Dao laws. They were connected to each other and densely covered the void. The world seemed to be made up of them.Moreover, it was directly displayed!Every great path nomological law seemed to stand straight and visible to the naked eye. There was no need to look back, as it directly presented an incomparably huge great path net that surrounded the entire world!The materialization of the great Dao!This level was beyond Li Hao's imagination.Tens of thousands of DAOs filled the air. Some of the great Dao laws were so powerful that it was shocking. The power of the great Dao was so dense that it seemed to have given birth to life. The great Dao seemed to have given birth to life!A terrifying existence!At the center of the gathering of the DAOs, there were many statue-like existences. They stood there for an unknown amount of time, as if they had existed for eternity.Suddenly!Among them, an extremely huge statue opened its eyes slightly. The moment it opened its eyes, the world changed and a world was born. With a thought, a world and a universe seemed to appear in front of it!His eyes were as bright as the starry sky. At this moment, tens of thousands of DAOs appeared in his eyes. Space was reversed, and the world was in chaos.A universe of the great path seemed to appear above his head, but it was only partially visible.Some of the stars were shining with a faint light.The infinitely distant space seemed to shrink in an instant. It was so close yet so far away. In that moment, the statue seemed to be able to see a distant corner of the chaos. There, life existed, there was a world, and there was also ... The heavens!As if he had seen something, his eyes locked onto a certain area.In his eyes, the scenery of the sky gradually began to appear.……At the same time.Chiyang region.The neo martial world was roaming, or rather, Emperor Cang was roaming.

Chapter 3086 Desire (Taking Leave Tomorrow)_4
At this moment, the human King, who had just arrived and met up with the new martial artist, had just laid down and wanted to rest for a while. Suddenly, he looked up at the world above. In his eyes, yin and yang appeared, and the world seemed to have been cut into two spaces.One Yin and one yang!His eyes had also changed. One of them was like the sun, while the other was like the moon.Yin and yang!Beside him, the Supreme martial artist raised his brows slightly. Instantly, the book of great Dao appeared, as if there were tens of thousands of DAOs emerging. The pages of the book flipped, and the sky and earth spun. Time and space seemed to reverse. The power of a Supreme martial artist was instantly added!Emperor Cang, who was still teasing Xiao Yu, yawned. In an instant, his eyes burst out with a brilliant radiance that shot into the chaos!It was as if he was trying to see through the entire chaosverse!At this moment, it seemed to have seen something. In the cat's eye, a huge pillar appeared. One by one, it stood in the distance. The square domain was included in it, and some other domains were also included.At this moment, the powerhouses seemed to be looking at something.The arrogant and Savage human King was no longer arrogant and Savage at this moment.He just looked at the sky in silence.After a long time, he suddenly sneered,"how annoying!"The Grandmaster also laughed like a spring breeze. "You're strong, but you can also be annoying!"The human King chuckled,"that's true ...... I'm not as strong as you, so there's nothing I can do!" Old man chiyang was really arrogant! I told you, I will only absorb the Yang energy from other worlds, leaving him an empty shell, but he is not happy. Hateful, hateful, damn!"“……”The Grandmaster looked at him for a long time before sighing. "It's not easy for a villain to be like you. Don't you think you're too much?""Who's the villain?"the human King sneered. Who was the righteous one? In the chaotic world, you kill me, I kill you, you eat me, I eat you ... Who said who was a good person? Who dared to say that they were good people? Old Zhang, don't throw dirty water on me!""You want the power of other people's great DAOs, and you're still so arrogant ... You're not a villain?""Tsk, how did the chiyang region reach the eighth step? Wasn't it also formed by invading the surrounding small and medium-sized worlds and accumulating them ... The White bones in my hands are white, I'm getting rid of evil for the people!""You ... You're right!"The Grandmaster laughed and then sighed,"Where do you think Tian Fang's people went?""I don't know, but he's still alive!"Ren Wang looked in one direction. At this moment, it was as if he had determined his direction. He said softly,""Back then, when I stepped into the chaos, I was instantly lost. I had no front, back, left, right, Supreme, and bottom, no light, only a dark Dao. I want to know more ... Why is that Dao near my neo martial world?"It was hard to tell the direction of the chaos.However, for venerable sovereigns, it was not that mysterious. They could still see their surroundings clearly.But in the past, after killing the heavenly Emperor, the human King was already at the peak of the sixth rank. The moment he walked out of the neo martial art, he was lost, and decades passed in an instant. Time seemed to have frozen in the realm, and when he returned, time had already passed.Outside of neo martial, it didn't seem to be chaos ... It also seemed to be chaos! Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  However, this chaos did not seem to be the chaos that everyone saw. It seemed to be a dark passage with no direction.It was outside of neo martial!It was the passage that appeared at the moment when the new martial art broke through the boundary.Until one day, this path disappeared.Neo martial had truly walked out of chaos.When did it disappear?After the Silver Moon was born!It was as if the birth of the Silver Moon had also taken away the path of darkness that pervaded the vicinity of neo martial."Zhan Tiandi, what did you do in the past?"At this moment, the Grandmaster also said in a soft voice,""What is he trying to tell us? Guide us to what? His ranking method can be used from battle techniques to ten thousand DAOs. Weaving qi and blood, weaving ten thousand DAOs, qi and blood is Dao, ten thousand DAOs are Dao, one art can be used to connect ten thousand Arts ... He's really an unfathomable character. ""That's right." The human King nodded slightly."He's limited by this world. Otherwise, he should be able to easily reach Level Seven!""That's right!" He raised his eyebrows."That Silver Moon King Li Hao inherited some ... I wonder if he's the second king or ... The second king!" "You've seen him before. What do you think?"The Grandmaster asked."What do you think?"The human King glanced at him and smiled,"open your eyes and look!" Should I close my eyes and look at him?""Why didn't you ... Stay back then?" the Grandmaster laughed."Those of different paths can not conspire together!"The human King laughed sinisterly."All living beings have the right to live. All living beings have freedom. All living beings have the right to live. All living beings should cultivate without competition ... That's just a fantasy! When there's someone, there's competition, and when there's someone, there's ideas. He's an idealist, but I'm not. I'm a realist!"Those who walk different paths can not make plans together.The Grandmaster laughed."But from what I know, the current Silvermoon King is very strong. He has the power of a fifth-rank beast, and he might not be any weaker than you were back when you were still in the world. And he's only in his twenties ... Of course, you were the same age back then."However, the human King shook his head."Don't mind this. I'm more concerned about ... Whether he will become the second old Wang, the second fighter, or ... The first Li Hao!"The Grandmaster seemed to be deep in thought."You've seen him before. What's your judgment?""For now ... I still haven't broken the time limit!"When the human King said this, he was silent for a moment,"it's too difficult!" "I saw it once back then. I thought ... If it were me, I might not be willing to break it. What kind of path of desire is the Crimson Moon? Flowing time was the one! Old Zhang, did you see that? If you saw it ... Would you ... Be willing to?"The Grandmaster was silent for a while. After a long time, he said with difficulty,"I didn't see it, so I didn't know what to do. Maybe ... It'll be the second Battle, an even more powerful one. There's nothing wrong with that."

Chapter 3087 Desire (Taking Leave Tomorrow)_5
"Hehe!"The human King sneered,"let me tell you. If you dare to take it, I dare to kill you! I'll just kill you!"“……”The Grandmaster rolled his eyes. Only in front of this person did he seem to be unrestrained and free. He was a little speechless."Kill me? I can't take it?""No... I'm just afraid that you'll fall into time! The desire in your heart is too strong ... If I give it to you, the neo martial artists will live forever, and you may be willing to get lost in it ... Becoming the second Battle, this is not what I want!"He patted Zhi Zun's shoulder and sighed,""Old Zhang, this path is not suitable for neo martial artists! Neo martial, must fight! However, the Dao of war is too uncontested, and it's very difficult for me to break free from it ..."The Grandmaster lightly shook his shoulder, shaking off the other party's large hand. This brat didn't have any manners.He didn't respect the old at all!"You mean that even the Silver Moon King Li Hao can't leave the battlefield?""Difficult!"The human King sighed."It's really too difficult. It's not that I look down on him, but it's really as difficult as ascending to the heavens. If you want to break this and break the influence of battle, the first step is to give up!""Give up?""Right!""Yes!" The human King nodded and said with great difficulty,"give up ... The embryonic form left behind by the battle!"The Grandmaster's heart trembled!Looking at the human King, the human King shrugged and nodded,""That's it. Time is strong, too strong. So strong that you're willing to give it up after you've gotten it? If you give up, will you be able to gather time again? Back then, I ... Felt that it was very difficult for me to resist this temptation. I simply didn't look at it, ignored it, and let it pass in neo martial ... Let it be!"When the Grandmaster heard this, he also sighed softly.""That's true ... But it's not a pity. Actually, what's wrong with living to be the second Battle? He was truly unparalleled! A gentleman is unparalleled in his world. Perhaps, Li Hao is willing to do it, and his future prospects may even be wider than yours!""This is true!"The human King didn't deny it and nodded."I've absorbed extreme yang. It shouldn't be difficult for me to reach the eighth step. However, I'm still exploring the path to the ninth step. Time is rushing towards the ninth step! If Li Hao didn't mind, he would have a place at the ninth level of the Supreme Emperor realm, but I, Fang ping, might not be at the ninth level!"After saying that, he suddenly laughed wildly,""But if I make it to rank-9, I'll still be Fang ping! The one and only Fang ping! I'll still be able to dominate the primordial chaos!"The Grandmaster didn't say anything else.The two of them didn't mention what they had seen before. The fact that neo martial arts could see all of this might have something to do with the battle. It didn't matter. If they saw it, then so be it. What did it matter?Tianfang was an interesting place.……Tian Fang. Heaven and earth shook, and the Taoist connotation fluctuated constantly.The entire world seemed to be resisting.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly raised his head. Nothing happened, nothing appeared. But he suddenly raised his head and looked at the tianfang great Dao universe. Some stars were flickering weakly.The countless stars ... Seemed to have ... Turned into an eye.He raised his head and looked at the faintly shining stars, as if ... Someone was looking at him.Li Hao raised his head and looked at the sky.Is it my illusion?The four seventh level venerable sovereigns didn't notice anything, but Li Hao vaguely felt that someone was spying on him.He stopped in his tracks. "Senior daoqi!" He suddenly spoke after a long time.Between heaven and earth, a breeze blew and an illusionary figure appeared. The illusionary figure of the Dao chess piece appeared."What's the matter?""I'm fine,"The virtual chess figure was speechless.艹!I'm fine. Why did you call me?Li Hao suddenly held the stars in his hand and called out to Dao Qi, who was about to leave,""This astral aura, is it familiar?"Dao Qi was stunned. He looked at the stars for a long time before shaking his head. "I'm not familiar. Why?""Of course, I'm familiar with it too. You've been using it all this time. Is there a problem?""Zhan Tiandi, have you ever come to tianfang and met the master of tianfang?""What?"The Dao chess virtual shadow knew this person and was stunned for a moment."His era is not in the same era as the master of tianfang!""So what?"Li Hao chuckled and said, is time and space the only thing? If he ... Intercepted the past and brought it to reality, how did he do it? Even though I've traveled back in time for millions of years, why can't I face the master of Tian Fang?""This ... Descending into the past, descending into a rank nine world ... This ... You can't do it, right?""I can 't.""At least not now!" Li Hao shook his head. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  He had gone back to the past and investigated some of Tian Fang's people, but he only watched from a distance and didn't come in person. If he were to substitute himself in and wander around neo martial like neo martial ... Li Hao couldn't have done it.It was too long ago!This was the first reason. The second reason was that the experts in the spacetime they were in were too powerful. It was difficult for them to descend. Even if they did, they could be easily killed.At this moment, Li Hao stopped thinking about it.There were some things that he had some vague guesses about.Looking at the time star in his hand, he suddenly laughed,"The Crimson Moon's desire is too obvious and too shallow. The star's desire is an unstoppable existence!"The mysterious man looked at him, feeling somewhat baffled.What was going on?Time was not the Dao of desire.Li Hao smiled. A brilliant smile, right?Perhaps, that was what the others thought.But ... This was desire!The desire was so strong that it was impossible to extricate oneself. Everything one did was for it, and from the beginning to the end, they were under its control.But ... Was it going to shatter?Don't joke around. It's impossible now.

Chapter 3088 Desire (Taking Leave Tomorrow)_6
This was what it meant to be deeply trapped in desire and unable to extricate himself!"One day ... I'll abandon you!"Li Hao murmured in his heart.You've already affected me. I'm deeply in it and I can't extricate myself.Perhaps, I should build my own.'I'll place you in the infinite worlds and let you go with the wind. You can pursue your Dao, and I'll ... Rebuild my Dao!'Shi Guang, I'm peeking at you!At this moment, Li Hao seemed to have realized something. He smiled. It's not that I despise you. I like you very much, but ... You can't let me sink into my desires. If you do that, I won't be me.Today, he seemed to have finally understood all of this."Human King ..."At this moment, Li Hao suddenly said a name.Could it be that the human King ... Had given up on purpose, and not that he was unable to control it?If that was the case, the neo martial King was well-deserved!Of course, he couldn't be sure at the moment.After all, such great perseverance appeared on a human King. It was so out of place. He was extremely greedy.The next moment, Li Hao stopped thinking about this.The Nirvana world was expanding crazily!Everything began to rapidly die out!The Taoist connotation appeared one by one, and countless Taoist connotations impacted the heaven and earth.At the same time, two Dao rivers appeared and suppressed the world. The Dao chess emitted a pressure that suppressed the surroundings. The four seventh rank venerable sovereigns were also extremely serious. If they found an extremely powerful place of Dao accumulation erupting, they would quickly suppress it!The cultivators of the Silver Moon clan, including some venerable sovereigns, were all immersed in the scene.The explosion of countless Taoist connotation made it difficult for people to extricate themselves.The Dao of Tian Fang!Each of the shadows represented the peak of Tian Fang. There were many, many venerable sovereigns in Tian Fang. The number of venerable sovereigns in Tian Fang was unimaginable.The Taoist connotation was now erupting in some places that used to be uninhabited. Some new Taoist connotation places also began to emerge in this quietness.……Further away.Kong Ji was also in the process of comprehending. His aura fluctuated as his destructive power rose. Within the destructive domain, a small flower started to grow rapidly. It seemed to contain the power of ten thousand DAOs, and it swayed gently, causing one to be unable to extricate themselves from it.Once this flower was nurtured and devoured, it would definitely be earth-shattering!"Perhaps ... I can take this opportunity to control the tianfang great Dao universe and become the master of a level nine great Dao universe. Even if I don't enter level nine, I can still become an extremely powerful Level Seven!"At that moment, his Nirvana world expanded at an even faster rate. The flower was also growing continuously. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  He quickly expanded in Li Hao's direction.The Nirvana worlds of both sides even began to overlap!The empty voice resounded,"Haoyue, I want to try to use the complete side of Nirvana!" Merge your Nirvana world into my domain. That grass of yours ... Is too weak, so let me merge it completely with my domain!"Li Hao didn't say anything. He directly merged the Nirvana world into it. The two worlds merged, and in an instant, the air was turbulent. A small flower grew wildly, devouring the grass. It swayed and seemed to be emitting an extremely sweet smell. Li Hao glanced at Kong Ji and frowned. As for Kong Ji, he was also looking at Li Hao from a distance, as if he was thinking about something. Haoyue ... How should I choose?The aura of desire was spreading.Both Li Hao and Kong Ji seemed to have suffered a blow.The Crimson Moon!Yes, the Crimson Moon universe, the Crimson Moon world. One person absorbed the power of the Crimson Moon, and the other absorbed the power of the Crimson Moon world. He did not feel anything before, but at this moment, he seemed to be disturbed.Kong Ji was thinking, what's the point of reviving?It was not resuscitating!'If I swallow this flower of destruction and Flower of Life, I'll be able to control the Tian Fang great Dao and become the master of the Tian Fang great Dao universe. I'll become a level Seven venerable sovereign and become unparalleled in power. Perhaps I'll even be able to compete with my father!As for Li Hao, he had also been deeply affected by his desires.The two of them didn't know.However, at this moment, Li Hao seemed to have vaguely sensed something. He felt as if he was being spied on. He felt a bone-piercing chill and came to a realization.He looked at Kong Ji.The emptiness ... Seemed ... Not quite right.He just looked at her and didn't say anything.It was difficult for outsiders to wake up a person who had fallen into desire. Even red Moon master, the master of the great Dao, was deeply affected and suffered some backlash.Kong Ji, can you walk out of it?I don't know.……BOOM!Heaven and earth shook. At this moment, it seemed that something was about to appear and explode. The next moment, a force of light overflowed, and the Taoist connotation appeared. It seemed that the place where the radiant envoy's Taoist connotation was found.At this moment, light and darkness appeared on Kong Ji's body. The dark Demon Ridge was also exploding. The great DAOs from both sides were like a net that enveloped Kong Ji.On Kong Ji's body, light and darkness continuously appeared.The powerful power of a great Dao even gave people the illusion that he could step into Level Seven in the next moment.The flowers in front of him were even more fragrant and sweet.After eating it ... I'll be able to reach the seventh step!Kong Ji closed his eyes.I want to reach Level 7? I'm dreaming too much. Li Hao has already reached Level 5. There's not much difference between Level 5 and Level 6 for Li Hao. The two of them have reached a starting point.However, I'm the Son of God of light. When I met Li Hao, he was Level 1, I was Level 4, and I was Level 5 ...But in just a few years, Li Hao had caught up with him.Was he jealous?A little.If he wasn't jealous, then he would be a Saint. He wasn 'T. He was a cultivator, and there were no saints.No matter how good a friend or fellow Daoist was, they would still be a little envious.

Chapter 3089 Desire (Taking Leave Tomorrow)_7
"If I don't eat it, I'll need countless amounts of energy, the power of great DAOs, and even a seventh-tier universe wouldn't be enough for me to advance to the seventh-tier ... Am I supposed to eat the divine light plane?"Kong Ji kept thinking as he looked at Li Hao in the distance, his eyes even gloomier.Perhaps ... I shouldn't have listened to Li Hao!Why did it need to be resurrected?What an unnecessary move, this was a world without an owner!At this moment, Sword Saint and the others seemed to have sensed something. They looked at Kong Ji with a serious expression. Kong Ji ... Had he fallen into lust?How could this be good!In fact, they all liked this noble Son of God of light. He was an interesting person, but ... What should they do now?Everyone had the heart to become stronger. If they stopped him, they might become enemies.At this moment, Li Hao made his move. He didn't go to Kong Ji's side. At this moment, a star appeared in Li Hao's hand. It was the time star!The time stars suddenly fluctuated.At this moment, Li Hao reached out and touched the stars. The stars twitched. The next moment, Li Hao touched them again, and the stars twitched again. He continued ...The star continued to jump, and gradually, a path seemed to have appeared on the star.The next moment, Li Hao smiled and flicked his fingers.That path was instantly broken!The entire star showed signs of collapse. The emptiness that was still there before suddenly turned pale with fright!"F * ck!"Shocked, Kong Ji instantly disappeared and reappeared before Li Hao in the blink of an eye. He extended his hand, and the power of Quietus appeared. The great Dao that had just collapsed on the stars and time instantly froze!Kong Ji was shocked. He reached out and grabbed the broken Dao. The Flower of Life released some energy and healed the great Dao.At this moment, he was covered in cold sweat.Looking at Li Hao, he swallowed his saliva.Li Hao shook his head and smiled."I'm not crazy. I just want to see if people can really restrain their desires." Desires can make people slaves, but ... If you are a little more ruthless, you will find that you can control yourself!"è‰¹!Kong Ji woke up and was covered in sweat."You don't have to do this. If I don't do anything, won't it collapse?" "I ... Am not just reminding you. I am also testing myself!"Li Hao sighed. He looked at the stars and said softly,""I actually can't bear to."There was complete silence.At this moment, he woke up from his greed. After a long time, he swallowed his saliva."I really want to eat it!"Li Hao nodded."Actually, if you really want to eat it, I won't stop you. It's just that ..."He looked up at the sky and frowned."This Dao universe has a master!" He said.If he really wanted to advance to the seventh step, why did he stop him?There was no need!However, if the Dao universe had an owner, would you be a little brother if you went in?"What?"​ Kong Ji was stunned."I know, but he left ...""He's not dead, he's alive!"Kong Ji was bewildered. He nodded, his eyes changing. He looked at the sky and snorted."So annoying!"At this moment, these words were exactly the same as the human King 's.How annoying!In an instant, all his desires disappeared. He muttered,""My father can't even lead me! You still want to lead me? Pfft ..."The refined Crown Prince actually spat at him, which made Li Hao laugh.As for Kong Ji, he was a little scared. After a long time, he laughed again. "That's good. This can be considered enlightenment of the Dao heart. That's good ... However, if you do this again, I really won't care anymore!"Li Hao smiled and nodded. So what if they didn't care?You're restraining your desires, and I'm also restraining myself. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  Cultivation was really interesting![PS: take a day off tomorrow. I've been stuck writing recently. Take a day off and think about it. I probably can't write the Stargate for too long. Try to write it as easily as possible. Don't send a single chapter to take a day off.]
