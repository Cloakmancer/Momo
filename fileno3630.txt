At this time, long Zhan could not quite hold back anymore."Tian Fang, you're delusional!" He shouted.Suddenly, the chaos great Dao trembled. Not only Tian Fang, but Li Hao also trembled and couldn't help but curse.Long Zhan this fellow indeed still had means!"However, I seem to have been forced to use it now. Tian Fang might not be in trouble, so don't torture me to death first.He was still fine ... In the distance, the Queen, who had been gathering people from the world ... Suddenly screamed at this moment. The power of the great Dao surged all over her body, and she looked like she was about to explode.The master of tianfang also sighed,""As expected, you were born from chaos. Perhaps ... This is the last counterattack of the spirit of chaos?"It's just a pity that ... When you shook the chaos great Dao, I wasn't the only one affected. You didn't target me. Perhaps when your spirituality is exhausted, you'll kill Li Hao first, not me!Interesting!Long Zhan could not care about that at this moment. He was a little angry. He had been unable to lock onto the other party. At this moment, he could only attack indiscriminately.As for Li Hao ... Who asked him to merge with the chaos?He had no choice!They could only try to reduce the impact on Li Hao, but this way, the impact on Tian Fang would be even smaller.There was no way to seriously injure the other party!Long Zhan was incomparably furious!Li Hao was also met with an unexpected calamity ... The chaos great Dao was shaking violently at this moment. He had merged with the chaos great Dao, and only now did he feel some trouble. Long Zhan, this fellow, indeed has a trump card ... Unfortunately, I'm suffering even more now!He had just tried to enter with a harmonious spirit, but now he was affected even more.The human King gritted his teeth and bellowed,"I don't care. Li Hao, you hold on for now. Let's join forces and kill that guy!" Long Zhan, you shake the great Dao. As long as traces are revealed, let's see where he can escape to!"The master of Tian Fang disappeared instantly, but at this time, there were also some great Dao fluctuations!Seeing this, huntian and renwang's eyes lit up. This was good.It was indeed useful!As such, it was difficult for the other party to hide.The two of them instantly attacked. At this moment, they no longer looked or looked. Instead, they followed the fluctuation and attacked quickly!BOOM! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The sound reverberated.Tian Fang was stopped for the first time, and his expression was a little ugly. However, he quickly returned to normal."Long Zhan can't last long, and Li Hao is also trapped. Just like me, he's even more uncomfortable ... If you two want to kill me ... Perhaps, you're still a little lacking."That's good!Letting long Zhan consume it, that bit of spirituality of his would be exhausted out sooner or later!The human King was furious. This guy was clearly looking down on him.He was already furious enough today. Now, this guy was still teasing him.Li Hao had killed the clone of calamity. That future fellow had blocked the extremely powerful lightning calamity. Long Zhan had now left Tian Fang with nowhere to hide. As huntian was not the home ground, it was not good to use the path of order here ...As for himself, other than killing the light and dark emissaries, he had almost no achievements!The human King's eyes suddenly turned blood red!Huntian was following the fluctuations to interfere with Tian Fang, suppress him, and block him.However, the next moment, everyone suddenly felt a little frightened.At this moment, the entire chaos great Dao was shaking violently. The fear did not come from long Zhan, but from ... The human King! The human King seemed to have been completely enraged!"Old Zhang!"He looked at the people behind him, at the neo martial artists, gritted his teeth, and was unable to restrain his anger!The Grandmaster's head was splitting!"Self-destruct?"Tian Fang seemed to be very clear about this. However, at this moment, he just laughed. You must be joking.These people can't even lock onto my whereabouts. Self-destructing ... What can they do?"F * ck, everyone's showing off, and I'm embarrassing myself!""Divine Creator, project to the heavens!"The human King was completely furious and roared,"big guy, if we don't show off our might today, our neo martial will be too ashamed to face anyone!"At first, everyone thought that the human King wanted them to self-destruct, and they were helpless ...However, in the next moment, they seemed to have understood something. It wasn't just them. The Grandmaster was already having a terrible headache, and he couldn't hold it in any longer."This is long Zhan's trouble ..."Don't be like this!No one could stop this guy when he went crazy, but the price was too great, really too great."I don't care!""At most, we'll start all over again. I'm going to kill him!" The human King roared.“……”Tian Fang's heart slightly palpitated. 'Kill me? this guy has such big words!'"Are you guys coming?"The Grandmaster sighed helplessly. The next moment, he nodded."Come!"He turned around and looked at the crowd. He smiled bitterly."He's mad. Come on!"The neo martial cultivators looked at each other and understood something.He understood!At this moment, she felt a little helpless, but also a little ... Excited.At this moment, an inner world appeared on the human King's body.In an instant, the Supreme martial artist began to burn ... Suddenly, the book of Dao turned into an extremely thick great Dao, exuding an Emperor's aura!The great Dao instantly stood between heaven and earth.It was like a giant pillar!It was a natural and perfect fusion. Suddenly, tens of thousands of people were worshiping it. Among the neo martial Supreme emperors, some were helpless, some were cursing, and some were smiling bitterly ...What was he doing?Sacrifice!Yes, the neo martial sacrifice method.The human King and martial King, in fact ... Cultivated the same Dao. The Supreme martial King's Dao was the Dao of the people. It originated from and connected to neo martial.In the past, the human King had relied on this method to kill the new martial arts 'great enemy, the heavenly Emperor.It was just that ... He needed to sacrifice the entire neo martial.Unless neo martial arts was destroyed, such a technique could not be used easily. Once it was used, everyone else in neo martial arts would be destroyed. And neo martial arts had spent many years to resurrect people and replenish their Yang Qi ... Today, they might be defeated in one move.

3631 Chapter 587
At this moment, the human King seemed to be crazy, but in fact, he was not crazy to the point of being demonized.Tian Fang must die!He had to die. The others might still have other means, such as huntian, but they were not willing to use them ... After all, the East was not his territory, and long Zhan was also helpless at this moment.As for Li Hao ... He might still have other tricks up his sleeve, but the price he would have to pay would probably not be small.Since that's the case ... Let me do it!There were many neo martial experts and resurrection was very difficult. The price was huge ... But if he killed Tian Fang, the power contained in Tian Fang might be able to be replenished. However, the lack of Yang Qi ... It didn't matter!Tianfang world!That's right, at this moment, the human King's gaze had already turned towards tianfang world. Insufficient Yang Qi?Would that level nine world be enough?"Long Zhan, huntian, kill him and everything will be mine!" He shouted.BOOM!The Paragon then exploded, completely merging into his inner world ....When long Zhan saw this scene, even his heart trembled.艹!In the next moment, the powerful sun god was also helpless. Last time, he had not participated, but this time ... It was clear that the human King wanted to recover everyone's energy, including his own!It was really ... F * cked up.The sun god was second only to the Supremes. Soon, it entered the inner world and exploded. With a bit of helplessness and speechlessness, it said,""Next time ... Don't come ..."Who could withstand it?One or two times, one or two times, self-destructing every day. If this continued ... When would it end?One by one, the grade 8 experts walked in, including Emperor Cang, who had an innocent look on his face. His fat body fell into the inner world and exploded with a loud bang ...Emperor Cang's voice resounded!"Huntian!" The human King shouted,"hold him back! I'll kill him with one strike!"At this moment, the master of tianfang's face also changed!Crazy!Was it worth it to kill one of my clones?What's wrong with this hun Dun!Were the cultivators of this era crazy?At the level of level eight, you exploded just like that ... This matter actually had little to do with neo martial, but in the end, neo martial's human King, this madman, actually ... Actually killed almost everyone in neo martial in an instant!Yes, he had killed himself.Bastard!At this moment, everyone's heart was actually palpitating. It was nothing to be ruthless to the enemy, but to be so ruthless to his own people ... This human King was not just bluffing. He was truly crazy.Long Zhan couldn't help but look at him. At this moment, long Zhan's entire body was trembling as he shook the chaos great Dao. The consumption was huge, but at this moment ... He suddenly felt that maybe, from the very start, he wasn't as crazy as this group of people.Li Hao was like this, the human King was like this ... And the future being he had summoned was also like this.Were these people from the same bloodline?At this moment, the aura of a human king rose crazily.Supreme Rong, Emperor Rong Cang, God Rong Yang, Sword Saint Rong ...The new martial arts powerhouses exploded one after another, turning into energy and the power of ten thousand DAOs. In an instant, his inner world seemed to be raised to the extreme, and the power of the great Dao shook wildly!……Li Hao, who was watching this scene, resisted the discomfort of the great Dao shaking and looked at the human King and neo martial ...There were people in Silver Moon who had gone crazy, but not to this extent.New martial!Li Hao believed that he was decisive and ruthless enough ...Compared to the human King ... At this moment, he sighed in his heart. 'I will never become the human King. That kind of unparalleled dominance, that crazy desire to win, he ... Doesn't understand.'Maybe he knew, but he didn't learn.To make him pay such a big price for the four-sided domain and long Zhan ... He might not do it, and he would not do it. If he could not be resurrected ... The entire neo martial would be gone!In fact, this was not all that Li Hao could do. He still had other means, including the explosion of the time star and his attempt to merge with the chaos great Dao and become a spirit ...He didn't even have time to try before the human King went crazy.Merging neo martial arts into one!He actually knew about this move, and had even seen it in his past memories ...However ... When he saw it with his own eyes, he still felt that the cultivators of the neo martial world might be addicted to self-destruction. He had thought that the Supreme martial artist was still rational, but now it seemed ... He might not be.At this moment, the master of tianfang's expression also changed slightly!This lunatic!It's been two million years. I've seen all kinds of people. This time ... I've seen all kinds of demons and ghosts. If I destroy new martial, I'll admit it. I've tried to persuade you, but it seems that you didn't listen to a word!This was ... An enemy who killed his father even more than the enemy who killed his father! The master of tianfang was speechless.What did I do to you?As for huntian Supreme Emperor, he didn't say a word. Instead, he exploded with power, suppressing and entangling his opponent with the fluctuations of his great Dao. At this moment, he was even a little fearful!"I'm a little ... Afraid of the madman of neo martial arts.The human King didn't seem to be strong, but he also seemed to be so strong that no one could defeat him. In the eyes of some people, he was just a hooligan who didn't need to worry too much. But today ... He personally destroyed new martial arts with a single word ...Such a lunatic was not seen by the future Su Yu. Otherwise, he would also call him an old bastard!In an instant, the aura of a human King surged!He laughed heartily!"Tian Fang, you old fart, take this!"The saber was drawn!Tens of thousands of DAOs appeared and bowed in all directions, like the Emperor among men!An Emperor!It wasn't like Hong Yitang's teaching, but ... Overbearing, boundless overbearing, overbearing!I'm the only one who rules over all things in the world!I'm invincible!I am a king among men, an unparalleled King!As the blade struck out, the void seemed to shatter. The master of tianfang felt helpless. 'I've calculated everything. I know that Li Hao and long Zhan are both threats to me. I know that huntian might not pay a huge price to deal with my clone ...'The only thing I didn't expect was to ignore this hooligan!He also did not expect that this hooligan, in order to kill him ... Would actually ... Do this!He laughed bitterly.There was nothing to be unwilling about. After all, it was only a clone. If it died, then so be it. It was just a part of the plan that was ruined. In fact, the losses were not too heavy.But ... Was it worth it?He didn't even try to Dodge. Instead, he attacked, and the power of his great Dao exploded. He was a little confused."Fang ping ... I ... Is this really the first time we've met?"It was inappropriate for him to be so confused, but he was really suspicious now.Have we met before?The kind that I killed your entire family?The human King's Blade descended, capable of cutting through the heavens and earth, destroying everything. Hearing this, he snorted coldly,""In this life, I hate it the most when someone can run better than me!"“……”I'm the best at running.You dare to run away in front of me again?You dare to threaten me and destroy my neo martial?Alright, I'll destroy it myself!Come and destroy it!The blade fell!In the entire chaos, there was only this blade. Heaven and earth were colorless, only the blade fell!The master of tianfang let out a soft sigh as a bloody gash appeared on his forehead and started to spread. His entire body split open and he said helplessly,""We ... Will meet again!"BOOM!His body exploded into pieces.As for the human King, he panted and laughed. He looked at the mirror in the distance and bared his teeth."Tian Fang is just so-so!"Chaos, endless silence.At this moment, huntian's heart began to race, and he wanted to escape!This lunatic ... Was he just pretending?I was wrong. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  He was really doing this for his face!……Deep in the chaos.All the grade-9 cultivators were extremely quiet. It was only when Tian Fang opened his eyes and spat out a mouthful of blood that the others slowly spoke,""This ... Another one has gone crazy?"He was completely speechless!Tian Fang sighed."This world is so evil ... War ... What kind of people have they cultivated?"A bitter smile spread from his face.Zhan, you're a refined man, but ... Why are all your descendants ... So ... So crazy?

3632 Chapter 588
Tianfang world.With Tian Fang's clone killed, the human King's vitality was unparalleled. At this moment, it could be said that the human King's strength had been raised to an extreme.He would merge all the strong people of neo martial arts!It should be known that the experts of neo martial were not just the experts in the great path universe. Supremes, sun god, and sword venerable had all jumped out of neo martial, but now, they had all been forcibly absorbed and integrated by him.He was a little weak after killing his opponent with a single saber move, but he was still extremely powerful.At this moment, long Zhan was also on the verge of collapse!It was clear that shaking the chaos great Dao was quite taxing on him.Huntian was still fine ...But in the next moment, huntian felt danger and couldn't help but curse. He was actually quite refined and didn't like to curse. At this moment, he couldn't help but curse,"“艹!”BOOM!The saber was drawn!The human King's eyes were cold!He made his move.Everyone thought he was crazy, but he knew it clearly in his heart. He was more clear-headed than anyone else.I'm the only sober one!He killed Tian Fang and merged with neo martial because the threat of Tian Fang's avatar was too great. This was only an avatar. If it was the original, it would be unimaginable. Huntian was not willing to use his full strength, and long Zhan was powerless, so he would do it himself.But now, Tian Fang was dead.If he killed huntian and long Zhan ...Why not kill if he could?Ally?Bullshit!What ally? there might only be one ally for new martial, Silver Moon.Even if it was Silver Moon ... If it involved neo martial's interests, he, Fang ping, would kill him without hesitation!No one could lead the fate of neo martial, no one could. He would never place his hopes on anyone, anyone ... Not even a Supreme martial artist. In the end, neo martial was still his neo martial, their group's neo martial, but in the end, it was still the neo martial under his leadership.He unsheathed his saber!Huntian retreated.Long Zhan roared and turned into a Golden Dragon. His huge body swept across the void. His eyes were cold and he was not surprised.The human King ... Was he a good person?At this moment, the human King had reached a peak, but it would fade away. After all, the merged power was not his own. Therefore, he would not give up if he could still kill some people while he still had the chance.Long Zhan had long expected it. The instant Tian Fang died, he already had some expectations.Huntian returned and attacked with his fists, suppressing the heavens and earth!Why did he return instead of fleeing?Because ... The East needed to be controlled. He couldn't let neo martial and silver Moon monopolize it. These two people were too difficult to deal with and needed long Zhan to contain them. He couldn't let long Zhan be killed. Otherwise, if neo martial completely took over the East, they would inevitably March into the other three sides. The human King was a crazy guy, so Li Hao wasn't any better.  Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  They were all jackals of the same lair!Therefore, he didn't retreat. Instead, he attacked. He punched out in an orderly manner. It was as if the rules of heaven and earth had become much more orderly. The human King sneered. When he was dealing with Tian Fang previously, he didn't seem to be so concerned.Huntian wasn't a good thing either.One against two!The saber Qi pierced through the heavens and earth. At this moment, it was as if all Buddhas were paying homage to him. The surrounding chaotic energy gathered and exploded!At this moment, Li Hao, with a bright smile on his face, didn't interfere. Instead, he instantly disappeared.He drew his sword!Red Moon sovereign's face turned pale and he retreated instantly. Seeing this, Feng Yan shouted and attacked!"Attack!" Li Hao said in a faint voice.Thunderlord, light, myriad transformations, chess ...The experts who hadn't fused yet rushed over from the distance. They crossed the void and attacked without saying anything!Long Zhan retreated and shouted,"must it be like this?."He had just resolved the tier 9 crisis, and it was just an avatar, but these two actually wanted to hunt down his Primal Chaos race. Damn it!Although he had expected it, he didn't expect that the current human King would be so powerful after devouring the new martial. He and huntian had joined forces, but they were only on par at this moment.Of course, huntian did not go all out.He ... Might also want to weaken him a little.This was because his Dao and his Dao were in conflict. Although he hoped that he would stay behind to restrain new martial, he did not want to grow stronger. It would be best if the chaos race was exterminated, and he, new martial, and silver Moon would fight to the death. He would then hide in the dark ...This was probably the result that huntian wanted to see the most.A powerhouse who no longer had any influence and was alone, hiding in the dark, was the existence that neo martial and silver Moon feared the most. It was only in huntian's interest that all of their own people had to die.In that instant, long Zhan understood everything.The human King and Li Hao naturally understood this, so Li Hao did not surround and kill long Zhan. The probability was very low, and huntian would try his best to stop him ... Li Hao even discovered that there might be some powerhouses in the dark, who might be from huntian.……"Suppress!"The power of time once more exploded out, suppressing heaven and earth!The red moon Thearch and the others all looked uncomfortable. The Nirvana realm emerged beside them. It was the first time that the radiance Thearch had joined hands with his son. They threw a punch, the divine fist of light!In an instant, six divine fists erupted.At the same time, long Zhan shouted,"help me! Otherwise, new martial and Silvermoon will destroy my chaos race. They must devour tianfang world!"It was only at this moment that someone seemed to remember that tianfang ... Actually still had experts.The five elements emissaries, the Coiling Dragon sovereign, and the living emissary.A total of 7 rank 8s!Before, Tian Fang had fought alone. At that level, these people couldn't help him much. But now, with Guangming and the others joining the battle, these people had the strength to turn the situation around.However ...The rank eight venerable sovereigns in the tianfang realm were guarding the realm gate with their lives, not daring to go out.

3633 Chapter 588
Even the Dao master's clone had been killed!Long Zhan roared again,"if they don't dare to kill you, then they will kill you again. If they kill you again, the Tian Fang clone can still descend once more ... If they don't dare to kill you, then I don't dare to either. As long as you don't separate, no one will kill you ... But the moment they kill me, kill the chaos race cultivators, then all of you will die without a doubt. No one cares more about the four regions than I do!"Did his words make sense?There was!Long Zhan didn't want anything to happen to the four-sided zone, and he didn't want the master of Tian Fang to come again. However, neo martial and Li Hao might not be ... Afraid!At worst, they could just change locations. This place wasn't considered their old nest."Coiling Dragon!"He roared again.At this moment, the arrangements made earlier were all up to Coiling Dragon.In the tianfang region, the Coiling Dragon Imperial Emperor's expression changed. The five elements emissaries also looked at the Coiling Dragon with mixed feelings.What to do?Long Zhan ... Was an enemy!New martial and silver Moon were even more so.They had killed a large number of Tian Fang cultivators, long Zhan ... In fact, the group had killed a few tier 7 cultivators, and almost all the tier 8 cultivators had died at the hands of neo martial artists and silver Moon.Make a move?Or should they continue to defend?At that moment, the Coiling Dragon Imperial Emperor had a complicated expression on his face.""If the neo martial experts want to resurrect, the human King will probably hunt us down and seize tianfang world. Even if he's afraid of the Dao master's return, he will still seize tianfang world even if he doesn't kill us ..."You want to help long Zhan?"The life Messenger snorted coldly."I knew you weren't a good person."Helping long Zhan ... Because, they were all from the dragon clan. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Then ... Should we just sit back and do nothing?" Coiling Dragon asked in a deep voice."If you're not willing, you can think of a way to contact the path master and ask him ..." He said in a deep voice."Is long Zhan the bigger threat, or is it neo martial or Silver Moon?"He firmly believed that even if they could contact the path master, the path master would also let them help long Zhan and not neo martial and silver Moon, because these two were too big of a threat.Anyone with eyes could tell!Long Zhan was strong and had something to do with the chaos great Dao. However, long Zhan had paid a huge price previously to only shake the chaos great Dao. He was not like the human King and the others, who shook the foundation of his rank nine avatar.In terms of strength, perhaps long Zhan was stronger than a human King without rage. But in terms of the future, long Zhan might not be so.The life emissary sneered and looked at Wu Xing."The five of you are the strongest if you join forces. What do you think? do you want to defend and wait for the Dao master to descend again, or do you want to do something?"The five of them joined hands and had been able to tangle with long Zhan the entire time previously. Their individual strength was not strong, but when they joined hands, they were extremely overbearing.At this moment, life and death had been broken, and only the life Messenger was here. Naturally, she was inferior to them.Since they couldn't come to an agreement ... The five rank eights would have more say."We and Li Hao ... Actually, we have some history ..." Huo Yan said in a deep voice as they were walking in the middle of the five elements.The life Messenger frowned. He disliked Li Hao even more.Because he had killed Deathbringer. But ...While he was still thinking, the gold spirit emissary snorted coldly,""Be it Li Hao or Fang ping, they're both cruel and merciless. Huo Yan, the origin you're talking about is nothing but a fart to them!"The few emissaries seemed to have different opinions. Right at this moment, long Zhan roared out once more,""If you help my chaos race, the square domain can at least remain intact. If Tian Fang descends again, there will still be an intact territory ... If neo martial and silver Moon succeed, perhaps ... There will be no more chances! Tianfang and the world will disappear ..."At this moment, the gold spirit emissary suddenly said,""Long Zhan ... You swore a great Dao oath to the chaos great Dao to not go against us ..."Long Zhan's eyes flickered and was just about to open his mouth.The human King laughed."Come, help me. How about I make an oath?"“……”No one spoke.Wu Xing also didn't say anything.There was no other reason ... That he didn't believe.The human King ... Although everyone was not familiar with him, the human King was still a human, and long Zhan was only a member of the chaos race. But at this moment, naturally, without any reason, everyone trusted long Zhan more.Because ... Was there any use in swearing an oath to a madman?When he became ruthless, he would kill even his own people, so why would he care about a great Dao oath?Moreover, long Zhan and the chaos great Dao were deeply involved, so they dared to make long Zhan make an oath. Human King ... What was the chaos great Dao?Did he really care?He didn't care!So ... Who would believe that!At the thought of this, the people from tianfang world, who were still hesitating, suddenly made up their minds. They didn't want to work with the human King. It was too dangerous. At this moment, they wanted to protect tianfang world.He was waiting for the day the true body of the path master would arrive.Before that ... If he could live in peace with long Zhan, that would be for the best.Moreover, long Zhan might also need peace more because he had two ruthless people outside.BOOM!When the human King saw that they were not answering, he suddenly became furious.""Who are you looking down on? I'll tell you all honestly, if you dare to come out, I'll slaughter you all. Long Zhan and I have an agreement, to use your lives to exchange for the lives of the chaos race!"“……”This ...Would he?At this moment, saber marks appeared on long Zhan's body. He retreated and coughed up blood. Without saying anything, his great Dao trembled, and chaos shook."I, long Zhan, the clan leader of the chaos clan, swear an oath of chaos! "Tian Fang's experts, help me defeat new martial, Silver Moon, and the chaos race today. All cultivators will never invade Tian Fang before the master of Tian Fang returns ... If I break this oath, chaos will kill me!"The great path shook, and heaven and earth resonated.It was as if the great Dao of chaos had come alive, as if even rank nine venerable sovereigns were witnessing it ...At this moment, it was as if the source of chaos was recovering.Heaven and earth shook!

Chapter 3634 Harvest (3)
At that moment, it was as if a spirit was transmitting some sort of message. It was as if the master of Tian Fang was transmitting a message ...The seven eighth level venerable sovereigns seemed to have received some kind of message.In the next moment, Supreme Emperor Coiling Dragon was the first to step out. He transformed into a huge Dragon and charged toward Li Hao.Li Hao smiled faintly."My fellow Daoists, you helped me in the past. Today, I saved you ... But if you attack me, we'll forget about our past relationship!"The Coiling Dragon Emperor remained silent.Friendship?Did I?Perhaps ... A little.However, Li Hao had killed Deathbringer and damaged their past, causing the deaths of light and dark, yin and yang. In fact, there was no friendship left.The so-called 'saving his life'... Just thinking about it made him feel hateful.If he doesn't kill us, is he saving his life?Back then, the reason they hadn't killed them was perhaps ... To weaken the Dao Lord, to prevent him from acquiring more spirit power. It was something they had never thought of before, but now that they thought about it, it wasn't entirely impossible.The 'friendship' Li Hao spoke of was just like the 'oath' the human King made ... They were actually worthless!It was not worth it at all!At this moment, Li Hao sighed. Originally, when he suppressed Red Moon Lord alone, he didn't seem to have that much of an advantage. It seemed that he only had a slight advantage.It was as if the red moon Lord was very powerful.It seemed that his injuries had not yet recovered. The great Dao's tremor just now seemed to have seriously injured him. It was not at all as powerful as killing the Lord of disaster's avatar.However, the experts of the heaven realm all appeared.Li Hao sighed."I value relationships. Although I've returned the favor after you helped me in the past, I still pity the old feelings and don't want to fall out with you ... The human Emperor wants to punish you, so I wanted to be thick-skinned and plead for you one more time ... Unfortunately, the falling flowers have intentions, but the flowing water is heartless ..."At this moment, the human King sneered."Little Li Hao, you're the most heartless one. Why are you pretending in front of me?" he said. It's better to be a real villain than a hypocrite. I'm not happy to hear you say that!"This guy was the most heartless person.At this moment, he was an extremely hypocritical person who had to pretend to be in love. Really ... If they were not on the same side, he would have killed him with a knife!Li Hao laughed."You misunderstand, human King. You don't know my past, but I don't blame you for misunderstanding me. In the past, everyone called me fair and just, and I enforced the law impartially. I even won the title of best patrol inspector ... Someone even gave me a banner and said that I was willing to help others and was very loving ..."The corners of the human king's mouth curled up as he unsheathed his blade!The blade light covered the sky and the earth. He sneered,""Oh, really? That's good! "But ... He's not as good as me. My enemies used to praise me every day, to the point that I was embarrassed. They even begged me to kill them and free them ... I'm a person who likes to help others, and I've helped many people ... You know, Li Zhu used to be my biggest enemy, but he insisted on being my little brother. He knelt and begged me, and I took him in ..."“……”Li Hao felt that the human king's mouth was quite sharp.Forget it.It's meaningless not to argue with him about this. You're bragging, but I'm serious. I really did have someone who gave me a silk banner. Unfortunately, no one believed me.Of course, all the Silvermoon people knew about this.The pennant was still there.Their conversation stunned the five elements messengers. What did they mean?Self-boasting?The next moment, their expressions changed. Li Hao had disappeared!"Human King ... For fun?" he laughed."Alright!"The human King also disappeared in an instant!Huntian and long Zhan were both stunned.The next moment, their expressions changed slightly. At this moment, some holes seemed to have appeared in the chaos. Long Zhan's expression changed drastically."Damn ..."When did these two leave behind a pile of caves near Tian Fang?Yes, a cave!It was as if the world had been Reborn!The hiding place was even ... Pierced through.They didn't care at all, nor did they feel it.Why were there caves everywhere near Tian Fang? Where did it come from? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Where did it come from? Li Hao and the human King did not bother to answer. They had to ask venerable the sword. Of course, the origin of this was the human King. Li Hao had left some behind, but it was not for this moment. They had only built many such caves in the square region because they wanted to be cunning.It merged and instantly disappeared!When master Tian Fang had appeared, they had been useless because he was a space venerable sovereign. If they had used him, the other party would have easily discovered them.Therefore, it didn't have much effect.However, there was no space venerable sovereign now.In an instant, Li Hao appeared in front of the life Messenger, and the human King appeared in front of the Coiling Dragon Imperial Emperor, brandishing his saber and sword!Long Zhan gave a roar and instantly charged over!Huntian Supreme Emperor frowned slightly and cursed inwardly. What was going on with these two?Also, long Zhan ... He made so many holes in the four-sided region. Don't you know?'Damn it!'It was gone in an instant!Li Hao drew his sword, and the sword aura soared into the sky. Countless worlds emerged, and countless spiritual bodies were excited. He could kill again?He suddenly felt ... Honored.BOOM!The life Messenger was instantly sent flying backward, spitting out blood with a look of disbelief on his face."He ... How did he suddenly appear under my feet?"It was really too sudden!It was completely unprepared, and there were no fluctuations at all. It was as if it was the same as the Dao master's spatial transmission ...In an instant, the sword light floated in the air!Crack!As the sword struck, the void was torn apart, and the stars of the great path suddenly went berserk. Li Hao reached out and grabbed, as if he had grabbed into the great path universe. In an instant, the wall of the great path was broken apart, and a star was grabbed out!

In an instant, the rank 8 star was attacked by him. In the blink of an eye, the entire star suddenly collapsed and shattered!A faint spirituality appeared, but Li Hao just laughed. He opened his mouth, and devouring power burst out. In an instant, the spirituality completely disappeared. Li Hao said with a relaxed expression,"Spirituality? I can eat, I can't eat, but so can second cat ... Do you really think you can't do anything to the spirit?"Spirit?The others might not be familiar with Tian Fang's Dao and might not be able to take it away, but I ... Am very familiar with it!"The Dao of Dao chess might not be everything Tian Fang has. It might be difficult to deal with the master of Tian Fang, but if I were to deal with the others in Tian Fang, would I not be able to do anything if they died and their spirituality scattered?"Life ..."The five elements envoy was shocked! As soon as the seven level eight venerable sovereigns appeared, Li Hao killed one of them in an instant.The human King let out a shrill cry as he slashed his long saber across the sky. With a loud crack, the mighty Coiling Dragon sovereign was instantly sliced into two. Long Zhan was completely flustered.He had spent a lot of effort to rope in the Dragon race.It would be fine if the others died, but the Coiling Dragon could not die."Human King, please show mercy!"He roared, but the human King completely ignored him. He slashed the Coiling Dragon Imperial Emperor's corporeal body in half, and the powerful saber Qi was about to rush into the great Dao universe and destroy the great Dao stars.At this moment, long Zhan was somewhat anxious.Coiling Dragon was from the Dragon race and had the strength of a type 8 powerhouse. He was also nurtured by Tian Fang. If he could rope him in, he would definitely be of great help and would not be any weaker than Peng Cheng.Now that he was about to fall at the hands of the human King, he shouted out in a panic,""Hold back! I'll use five seventh-tier universes to exchange for it!"“……”The human King's long saber retracted a little. Turning back to look, long Zhan's expression was ugly as he nodded.The human King laughed.A five-sided seventh-order world?Not bad!More importantly ... Do you still have more?"Are you sure?""I'm sure!"The human King laughed as he swung his blade. With a loud bang, the dragon's head fell to the ground. The rest of the Coiling Dragon Imperial Emperor's body was collected by the human King. The dragon's head flew away and was caught by long Zhan. At this moment, the Coiling Dragon Imperial Emperor was still a little lost.I ... Almost died?Long Zhan frowned slightly and did not say anything. At least he managed to keep his life. He quickly transmitted,""Senior Coiling Dragon, quickly leave the great Dao universe ... The human King and Li Hao are bound to break the tianfang universe ... These two ... Have ambitions in tianfang!"The Coiling Dragon Emperor remained silent.At this moment, he was a little dazed.We ... Were tricked? Did these two people deliberately lure them out?Then ... Was long Zhan also one of them?He suddenly felt a chill in his heart ... Was long Zhan intentionally cooperating with them?There was still hope for the seven rank-8s and some rank-7s to defend Tian Fang, but now ... Two rank-8s had been killed in an instant. They had left Tian Fang and lost the deterrent force of a rank-9 world ... p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  All of a sudden, he suffered a big loss!At this moment, the human King chuckled."Long Zhan, your cooperation is not bad. Next time ... Let's trick a few more ..."Long Zhan frowned and did not speak.At this moment, he was a little annoyed.These two had the same thought. It was true that they wanted to kill him, and it was true that they wanted to take this opportunity to completely get rid of Tian Fang. In fact, they were both true. They would act according to the situation.He didn't even have a clear target!He would take advantage of the situation!At this moment, Li Hao and the human King appeared around the five elements emissaries at the same time. The five elements emissaries surrounded Li Hao as if they were facing a great enemy, their eyes full of fear and anger!I've been tricked again!Li Hao chuckled."I've already said that there are some things that you don't need to get involved in. Why?" We and long Zhan were just playing around. Senior long Zhan was incomparably powerful and even had a killing move. How could he be easily killed by us? Killing senior long Zhan, we also have to pay a huge price. Senior huntian is still watching the show, we ... Are not sick, do you all think we are sick too?"Why kill long Zhan?Huntian was obviously watching the show. He was a top-tier powerhouse, a ninth-rank existence. Even if he wasn't a true ninth-rank, he wasn't far off. He had been acting like he could fight anyone, but he couldn't win!Wasn't this the tactic of neo martial Heavenly King suppression?He was all too familiar with the human King!It was a 50 - 50 chance no matter who he hit!This guy had a bit of the Heavenly King's habits. Li Hao and the human King would not really pay a huge price to kill long Zhan and let this person take advantage of it.The key was to kill Tian Fang and take Tian Fang!One of the seven rank-8s was killed instantly, and venerable Emperor Coiling Dragon was severely injured.The five-element emissaries were simply no match for them.At this moment, huntian Supreme Emperor finally spoke."You two, please forgive and forget ... The master of Tian Fang is still alive. It's not appropriate to completely destroy his inheritance ..."He didn't seem to be prepared to completely annihilate Tian Fang.The boss is still alive, and only his clone died. If you kill all of his men, the next time Tian Fang descends ... It will be even more troublesome!Li Hao chuckled."Sure. I'm not the kind of person who wants to kill. Seniors, you can just leave the tianfang Dao universe!" Tian Fang is no longer suitable for you, but ... I know a place that is very suitable for you, the world of five elements in the North! It's the most suitable for you. If you go, you might be able to go one step further and become the Overlord of the North! This way, senior Tian Fang will have a place to stay the next time he comes back. There's no need to be trapped in the small four-sided domain ...""Just kill him, why let him return to the mountain?" the human King was displeased.

3636 Chapter 588
Li Hao laughed."Senior human King, I'm related to Huo Yan and Shui Linglong after all. I even wanted to stop you when you killed senior Coiling Dragon ... Forget it. Just let them go!" The power of the five elements could be found everywhere, so why keep staring at it? Leave the Tian Fang great Dao universe ... I don't want Tian Fang, and I'll give you the life Messenger's energy to help you resurrect the others ..."The human King raised his brows slightly and didn't say anything else.While long Zhan and huntian both frowned.To the North?The five elements emissaries were all at the eighth rank. At that moment, there was a group of five elements at the eighth rank in the North ... It was hard to say whether the two sides were cooperating or ... Hostile.But no matter what ... Li Hao ... Had the intention of strengthening the North.Huntian's eyes narrowed.The North was strong while the South wasn't weak. Was he ... Stopping huntian domain from advancing?Long Zhan also thought quickly. If these few people went to the North, could they stop huntian from continuing to expand?Perhaps ... He could!He also spoke quickly,"you guys.....I'm sorry. I didn't know that the two of them.....Would be like this ..... They've implicated the life emissary. Why don't the five of you ..... Go to the North!"At this moment, the five elements messengers "faces were all very ugly.However, if they stayed any longer, perhaps ... They would all be annihilated!At this moment, Li Hao had given them a choice. They could leave Tian Fang, preserve their level 8 strength, and establish themselves in the North ...In the North, the five elements Supreme Emperor's territory.It was the same attribute as them!The few of them knew the situation. At that moment, many thoughts ran through their minds. Venerable fire Yan sighed and took the initiative to speak."Thank you ... Silver Moon King, for saving me. From now on, all grudges between you and the Tian Fang monarchs ... Are written off."He was extremely bitter!From the beginning to the end, they were just small characters, at the mercy of others 'arrangements, at the mercy of others.So what if it was a level 9 world?With the death of the Dao master's clone, they were nothing. These people were arranging their fates. At least they could still keep their lives!Out of the 12 eighth level venerable sovereigns, six had died!As for the Coiling Dragon sovereign ... Looking at long Zhan's appearance, it was obvious that he wanted to protect him and would not let him leave.Five more ... That's pretty good.At this moment, he had no choice but to go against his heart and thank Li Hao. He was afraid ... Afraid that Li Hao would turn hostile again and kill them. They were grateful to the enemy who had killed many of their powerhouses ...The five of them were extremely indignant, but they were helpless. Li Hao, on the other hand, was smiling brightly. "You're welcome, it's good to end the grudges! There's actually no human emotion in this Hundun. There's still some affection between you and me ... I wish you all the best!" At this moment, the human King's aura was also declining. When he sensed this, he laughed,""I didn't want to kill you. It's mainly long Zhan who insisted on letting you out. I'm worried that you'll interfere with me ... You guys, don't hold grudges. I'm actually still very friendly ..."Long Zhan was silent!These two beasts were not good people.However, it was inevitable that Wu Xing would feel resentful.However, at this point ... He had nothing to say.At this moment, he quickly summoned all the experts of the chaos race to gather. Huntian had not left all this while. He was only waiting, waiting for the human King to weaken, waiting for the human King to no longer have the ability to kill long Zhan. Only then could he leave.Otherwise ... The moment long Zhan died, there would be no one in the East to control these two people!The five-element emissaries said nothing more. They were a little indignant and helpless as they took away their own origin source. The power of their great DAOs leaked out a little, and their strength weakened a little. They barely maintained their eighth-grade power.The five of them did not even look at the Coiling Dragon Imperial Emperor. They quickly fled with the remaining rank-7s!At this point, they had completely given up on tianfang world.They no longer had the strength to defend!Li Hao chuckled."While they're gone, senior human King, you can go in and devour Tian Fang. See if you can restore everyone, including the power of Supreme Emperor Tian Fang's clone and the life emissary ... If it's still not enough ..."He looked at long Zhan."Senior long Zhan's five-sided seventh-order world, it's time to take it out. The human King resurrected everyone and weakened himself. It's good for everyone, right?"The human king who had resurrected everyone would lose his combat power again without the fusion of new martial arts. He would not have the ability to kill long Zhan.The human King at this moment was actually the most brutal!Long Zhan sighed and didn't say anything. This time, he didn't get anything at all. Furthermore ... He had to pay for the five seventh tier worlds. Previously, the worlds of the chaos race were almost all devoured.In fact, he had only kept a few, which were his savings from the past few days.This time, not only did he not gain anything, but he had also lost a lot. Furthermore, he had even used the spirit of chaos. He had exhausted a lot of his energy and gained nothing. Of course, he had gained an eighth-rank Supreme Emperor, Coiling Dragon!Besides, it was also a good thing that Tian Fang had been driven away. At least, the next time he descended would not be in the four-sided domain.All in all, it was worth it.Otherwise, he would have to be careful of tianfang's descent ...Unfortunately, this time, he was actually thinking more ... Now, there was nothing.The spoils of war were almost all from Silver Moon and neo martial.In reality, new martial did not earn much. The recovery this time had almost used up everything, but Silver Moon had earned a huge sum.Long Zhan didn't say anything. He reached out and grabbed. Around him, some worlds appeared. If it wasn't enough, he spat out a world from his stomach. It was the dragon world from before. A lot of great Dao power had been extracted. At this moment, it was barely at the scale of a grade seven.At this moment, he also took out this world.

Chapter 3637 Harvest (6)
His expression didn't look too good, but he didn't say anything, nor did he say that he would continue fighting.Maintaining the current situation might be the best.He had to get the human King out of his current state!The human King chuckled. It was not bad. Although he might not earn much, as long as everyone was resurrected, with tianfang world, the level 9 world, and those corpses ... At least he would not lose anything!As for himself, even if he removed the fusion state, he still had some improvements.Even if he was not as good as long Zhan, the difference was not big.The human King was satisfied that he had reached this level from the 5000 great Dao. He managed to put some distance between him and Li Hao. Otherwise, it would be terrible if Li Hao caught up to him!Li Hao didn't have those fused spiritual bodies, nor did he have his current strength.With those worlds, the corpse of the life emissary in Li Hao's hands, and the body of the Coiling Dragon Imperial Lord, the human King quickly entered tianfang world.This time, no one stopped him!Even huntian Supreme Emperor didn't say anything. If he didn't allow the human King to revive the new martial artists, he would have to face a lone wolf-like human King. Such a person was too difficult to deal with. Moreover, he was too strong after the fusion!It would be better to let him resurrect!Today, he had at least investigated the Trump cards of these people.The human King had integrated the new martial arts and was infinitely close to the 9000 great Dao.Li Hao had fused with ten thousand spirits and was infinitely close to the eight thousand great Dao.On long Zhan's side, using the spirit of chaos, he also surpassed the 8000 great Dao, but it was less than 9000.The three from the East were all very strong, but they all had some external help.Without these ... The three from the East would not pose a threat to him for the time being.This time, Li Hao's subordinates had gained a lot. A large number of worlds, a large number of corpses, and the clone of the venerable sovereign of calamity ... This time, they were bound to be improved.He thought to himself but didn't say anything.This was also good!As for the North, he didn't stop the five elements from leaving for a reason ... To stop the spring and autumn from devouring the North!Spring and autumn was dealing with the five elements Supreme Emperor in the North. Now that the five elements emissaries had gone over, no matter if they had surrendered or not, they could only join forces with the five elements Supreme Emperor to resist the enemy for the time being!This way, the four sides could maintain a temporary balance.At this moment, he was just silently waiting for the human King to get out of this state. As for the other people in new martial arts, although the Supreme martial artist and sun god were not weak, he did not care too much.The power of four to five thousand great DAOs was still acceptable.BOOM!Tianfang world seemed to be exploding!On the human King's side, yin and yang reversed, heaven and earth changed colors, and tribulation lightning vaguely appeared!However, this time ... The lightning tribulation was only loud. There was almost no lightning tribulation. It was extremely weak, and there was no more power of the world-destroying lightning tribulation around.The chaos great Dao shook for a while, but then it gradually calmed down.Everyone's gaze turned towards the human King in the tianfang world."Daoist Hao Yue ... Tian Fang is a rank nine world. If the human King doesn't devour it and you devour it, perhaps ... You can quickly complete your 4000 or even 5000 worlds, and your power will instantly reach the peak of Primal Chaos!"If it was 5000 Dao laws, Li Hao's true strength would be at least close to 8000 Dao laws, or even stronger.Tian Fang had enough energy!At this moment, it would be a waste to revive the new martial cultivators for the human King.Li Hao laughed."How can I do that? Tian Fang's clone was killed by senior human King ... If it were me who killed him, of course, I would take the responsibility. But ... It was naturally from neo martial arts! Could it be that senior huntian wanted a share? I don't mind ..."Huntian chuckled and didn't say anything.Li Hao seemed to be curious.""I haven't been to Qian bei's chaos heaven domain, but from what Qian bei said, order has been established? It looks like the huntian domain is going to expand ..."Huntian smiled."No, I just wanted to scare Tian Fang.""Oh!"Li Hao nodded slightly and sighed with emotion.""This is just a clone, and a ninth-rank one is already so powerful. If my true body were to descend, how powerful would I be? I feel that when Tian Fang's main body descends, we'll all be killed one by one!"Huntian remained silent.This was the truth. When Tian Fang's true body descends, everyone will die one by one!But now, wasn't it impossible?"That's right." Huntian laughed."But ... Chaos only has so much intelligence at the moment. The stronger we are, the less hope he has for descending!" As long as the primordial chaos doesn't have enough sentience, it'll be very difficult for their true bodies to continue descending into it!""But if ... Too many people die," Li Hao said with a smile."The spiritual energy will be sufficient, and it will descend sooner or later."It was only a matter of time!Huntian nodded and chuckled."Therefore, I hope that the two of you will stop killing. It's not a good thing to kill too much. Everyone has spirituality. If you kill too many, your spirituality will spread and the Dao laws in the chaos will become active. At that time, everyone will be the ones suffering.""Don't say this to me. I never kill people randomly. Tell this to the human King and senior long Zhan."“……”Long Zhan was speechless!Who had killed more people?He had killed many human Kings, but if he did not count, Li Hao might have killed more people than all of them combined!Huntian was also speechless and changed the topic,""The one on the river ...""Oh, a person from the future. Do you want to get to know him?"“……”Huntian smiled and didn't say anything. He was just thinking about something.He came from the long river.Flowing time!From the looks of it, Li Hao had succeeded in splitting open the sky in the future?Or was it just one of the thousands of possibilities?He didn't know, but he knew that Li Hao had to open the chaos!At that moment, a loud boom reverberated through the heavens and earth. Figures began to appear in tianfang world once more, and powerful auras filled the entire area!The human King's laughter continued, but his aura began to decline!The shadows of the Supreme martial artists also began to gradually appear. Long Zhan glanced at huntian ...At this moment, the human King was starting to decline. Perhaps ... This was an opportunity.Huntian also narrowed his eyes. Now, the other party had just recovered. Even if the human King merged again, it would still take some time. Perhaps, this was an opportunity to launch a surprise attack on neo martial!Otherwise, neo martial would always be a hidden danger!At this moment, Li Hao said loudly,""Senior human King, do you need time acceleration? It'll only take a moment ..."The human King's voice rang out, filled with arrogance,""No need! What are you worried about? Are you worried that those two guys would dare to touch me? Not to mention not being afraid of them, even if they were no match for them, they would not have an easy time! No need to worry!"Li Hao shrugged his shoulders, smiled, and said no more.Huntian, on the other hand, dispelled the thought and smiled.""Then, congratulations to the human King for advancing further, and congratulations to the revival of neo martial ... I still have something to do, so I'll take my leave first!"At this moment, the aura of the human King had declined a lot. Long Zhan's side was not in great danger.He didn't say much and immediately escaped!This would also prevent him from continuing to wrangle with the human King. That fellow's mouth was too smelly! Huntian instantly disappeared.Long Zhan's eyes flickered. He glanced at Li Hao, then at the recovering neo martial artists in tianfang world, as well as the dimming tianfang world. He sighed in his heart and quickly escaped with his people.This time ... He still suffered some losses.At that moment, a thought rose in his mind ... He had to think of a way to separate neo martial and silver Moon, or even drive a wedge between them. Otherwise, it would be too difficult to deal with them if they joined forces.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Were new martial and silver Moon really inseparable?Not necessarily!For example, this time, the human King must have wanted to kill Wuxing, but Li Hao had let him go several times.Li Hao, on the other hand, must have wanted to take Tian Fang, but in order to revive neo martial arts, he gave up on Tian Fang.On Li Hao's side, Dao Qi, Thunderlord, and a few others were a little unhappy, but they didn't say anything. These people had little to do with new martial, and there was also the light Thearch and the Son of Light ...Countless thoughts emerged in his mind. Perhaps ... He could think of a way to completely separate them. Otherwise, he would already be at a disadvantage in the East.

Chapter 3638 Interesting Soul (1)
Huntian left, long Zhan left.Tianfang world was rapidly weakening.One by one, the neo martial Supreme emperors were resurrected. The current human King regarded self-destruction as his ultimate killing technique and the act of resurrection as nothing.The neo martial experts had all self-destructed many times.At the edge.Li Hao just watched in silence. Was this really okay?Yes, the price of resurrecting once was very high.But ... How could there be a new martial artist like this, constantly and crazily self-detonating to resurrect, again and again, without any aftereffects?His lifespan wasn't consumed?He had to consume about 100000 years of his lifespan every time he walked the Dao of life and death. Even someone as heaven-defying as Li Hao did not dare to keep on reviving from life and death. Why did the people of new martial arts dare to do so?Neo martial was more special?  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ The Dao of Yin Yang was more suitable for resurrection than the Dao of life and death?Absolutely not!At this moment, Li Hao was lost in thought. Was there ... A drawback?There must be!There would definitely be problems if he self-destructed repeatedly.……He pondered in his heart.A moment later, the weak tribulation lightning dissipated.The human King appeared in front of Li Hao. His aura was much weaker, but he was still high-spirited and full of smiles."Little Li Hao, what do you think? was your senior powerful today?"Li Hao recovered his smile and nodded slightly.It was considered a reply.However, he also voiced his doubts. There was no need to hide too much about neo martial."The human King is naturally unparalleled in power. However, there's one thing that Li Hao doesn't understand. Why ... Did the neo martial artists self-destruct so many times ... Without any losses?"If everyone could self-destruct and revive at will, everyone would have done so long ago.On Silver moon's side, if a person died and was resurrected, the resurrected person's lifespan would be affected, and their memories would also be affected.It didn't mean that he was unscathed!The reincarnation realm's venerable sovereigns would lose more than half of their lifespans if they were resurrected. One could imagine how difficult it was to resurrect them. It was a heaven-defying move!"Hehe ..."The human King laughed."This is my new martial arts 'trump card!" "Then forget it!" Li Hao laughed.Since it was a killer move, it might be a little special, but there was no need to get to the bottom of it.However, even though he stopped asking, the human King laughed. He turned around and looked at the resurrected experts. He suddenly said,""Of course, there's definitely a drawback. No matter how heaven-defying a technique is, it's impossible to ignore the laws of great DAOs and revive infinitely!"The human King was silent for a moment before he smiled and said,"it's not that bad. One self-explosion has damaged one's spirituality a little. Actually, it's not a big deal. There's too much Yin Qi and too little Yang Qi. There's a limit to the reversal of yin and yang. After too many times ... I've just become a little stupid."Li Hao frowned.From the looks of it, it's not much different from Silver moon's resurrection. It doesn't seem like he lost much of his lifespan, but the so-called reduction of spirituality ... The reason why humans are humans and living beings are living beings is because of their spirituality!If it didn't have any spirituality, it would be a stone or a vegetable.The human King's side actually came with a price. Even so, you still dare to have people self-destruct?Are you crazy?Yes, at this moment, Li Hao felt that the human King was crazy. He said that he was heartless?You're the heartless one!At the very least, I won't do that and repeatedly ask cultivator Silvermoon to self-destruct!Li Hao frowned, but the human King regained his calm.""It's not a big deal. The rise of neo martial is in ruthlessness! One can't gain a foothold if they're not ruthless! In fact, everyone already knows, so why are you willing to listen to me?" The human King laughed."I, Fang ping, don't have unparalleled talent or ability. I'm based on neo martial and chaos because I'm ruthless! No, I, neo martial, am ruthless! I'll tell you the truth, my talent isn't as good as yours. This is a fact! But even if you're at the same level as me, I'll Still Kill you! You're cruel and heartless enough, but compared to me...I have faith, I have faith! I have ... An obsession!"The human King revealed a proud expression,"you and I are of the same cultivation level, I can still defeat you!" Even if you cultivate time and I cultivate my Dao, no matter how strong your Dao is, my Dao is invincible! If you don't believe me, you can try!"Li Hao was silent.Invincible in the same realm?What kind of confidence was that!I cultivate time and have all DAOs. I can reverse time and reverse heaven and earth ... Yet, the human King said that his other DAOs are invincible!Was he invincible?He did not know.But up until now, in the same level, in the same law, the human King ... Was indeed invincible. Whether it was the ninth-rank clone, huntian, or long Zhan, once the human King caught up to the barrier of the realm, he would be invincible!No matter if you hid it or not, he was invincible!"Ruthless ... That's right. It's just that human King has been like this again and again. If neo martial continues like this ...""I'm not afraid!"The human King smiled.Why?The human King sneered."Wait until I kill enough ninth-grade beings. I'll take their spirituality and replenish my new martial arts spirit. That will make up for it!" What was there to be afraid of? How could one stand on the world if they cowered? "No matter how much neo martial arts pays today, the next day, those who force neo martial arts to pay will pay a hundred times or a thousand times the price!""Li Hao, I'm arrogant because I'm not afraid, I'm fearless! I'm not afraid of death. I'll kill the person I want to kill sooner or later. Even if I can't kill him, I'll bite you! "We're different. You're used to strategizing before taking action, but I don't like that. I, Fang ping, am not without a plan. Don't doubt me. If I'm interested, I can plot you to death at any time. What's the point?"At this moment, the human King was extremely domineering,'in one's life, one should be arrogant and invincible! "The schemer has to put in so much effort, his mind, and his spirit, living an uncomfortable life. After I killed the celestial Thearch, I tasted all the joys and sorrows, all the partings of life and death. That day, I told myself that in the future ... I, Fang ping, must live happily! Today's life is good, and a day spent in dissatisfaction is a day wasted!"

Chapter 3639 An Interesting Soul (2)
"I, the new martial arts crowd, also understand this meaning. Everyone knows the same principle ... One day of life is one day of profit. A thousand years have passed, and we are all mortals! We've all profited, profited 900 years, lived an extra day, profited an extra day!"He looked at Li Hao and said, one word at a time,"neo martial artists are humans, mortals!" There were no gods, Immortals, Devils, ghosts, or monsters! Anyone who has lived for more than a hundred years can die!"Li Hao was extremely shocked!Mortals had no gods, no devils, and no Immortals.The time limit was 100 years. After 100 years, even if they had earned it, they could die!This was the world of cultivation, and it could easily take ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years, a million years ...As for neo martial, who was based in chaos and dominated the East, tell him that he, neo martial, was a mortal!For mortals, a hundred years was the boundary. They lived today and earned today.So it was like this.With such an attitude, they didn't care about anything at all. Self-destruction to reduce their lifespan?What did it matter?Reducing my spirituality? I'll just treat it as if I'm old or have dementia. At worst, I'll just blow up a few bastards one last time. That way, I'll earn even more.Was there a way?There was!Killing a few grade-9 experts would naturally solve the problem.What to do if he couldn't kill them?If I can't kill the other party, I'll die. Why would I care about this?This ... Seemed to be the real Jianghu!Li Hao was a little absent-minded. The human King smiled and patted his shoulder."Little brother ... You're still too young! When you're a hundred years old, you'll understand what you can't let go of. ""When I was in my 20s, I was invincible and suppressed the chaos of new martial arts! At that time, I was already unrivaled in the world. In the past one thousand years, I've been stagnant because ... I'm unrivaled!"The human King seemed to have recalled something and smiled.""When a person is invincible for a period of time, it's very lonely. Without enemies, without opponents, without everything ... At that time, I was actually very dispirited. What's the point of life? From 20 years old to 100 years old, I could still endure it. After 100 years old, I even hated living!"Today, the human King actually spoke of his own mental journey.He looked at Li Hao."You're the same as me, but you're better than me. You're invincible in Silver Moon, and you soon entered the chaos. There are many experts in the chaos, so it's very interesting. But if you pacify the chaos in a few years ... And become invincible in the chaos, you'll find that ... You're very lonely."  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ "Young man ... Find a wife and have a child. You should live happily every day, or else ... You'll regret it. I'll give you some advice from my experience. Don't talk about marriage after you've calmed the world down. By then ... You'll be old!"For a person in his twenties, the human King said,"you will be old by then."This was chaos!Clearly, the human King might have experienced such a period.Li Hao suddenly thought of something and said,""That's right, I've always had some doubts. As far as I know, why ... Have I never seen the princess Consort before?"That's right!Where is the princess Consort?He had never seen it before.Although he seemed to be in new martial arts ... He had only heard of it. Li Hao didn't seem to have seen it in the few Wars. Also, the human King said that he wanted to have a child ... Did he not have one?It had been a thousand years!With the human King's personality, he didn't have any children after a thousand years?Strange!"Yunxi?"The human King laughed, and his laughter was filled with hidden meaning."Little brother, don't ask around. You're still young and don't understand. You'll understand when you're older!"“……”艹!Li Hao was speechless. I'm just asking. What's with that meaningful expression?What do you mean I'm still young ... Where are you talking about? Also, you're the one who's childish, I'm serious.Even if the human King was a thousand years old, he was still living like a child. Of course, this might have made him happy. Perhaps, after he became invincible and lonely, he adjusted himself and became the ever-changing human King he was today.But ... Your personality is really ... Depressing.After chatting with the human King for a while, Li Hao had some thoughts. At this moment, the human King said,""In one's life, one should set a goal that is almost impossible to achieve ... Before you complete it, you still have motivation, but after you complete it, you're useless ... In the past, my goal was to suppress the disaster of the new martial arts. I completed it, and I'm also dispirited ...""You should have a goal now!"Li Hao smiled and said,"I have ...""Revive your parents and friends?""Yes,""Is it very difficult? If you can kill the rank 9 clone today, you'll be able to kill Tian Fang tomorrow. Therefore, you're not enough for your goal!"Li Hao was startled. Are you crazy or am I crazy?"I ... Want to kill all those at the ninth step. You don't think such a goal is enough, but what about you?"The human King's target is ..."Li Hao's interest was piqued."Since the human King thinks that the ultimate goal is not to defeat all the level 9s, then what is the ultimate goal?"The human King laughed."I only have one dream ... To write an IOU to all the people in the entire chaos ... I've done the math. There are countless Chaos Worlds. Even if everyone is beaten by me now, what about their descendants? What about the New World? "If my children and grandchildren, for generations to come, have to do this, then I can keep waiting, keep enduring, keep collecting IOUs ... This way, the world will not be destroyed, and the living will not be destroyed. I will have a goal!"艹!Li Hao was convinced.What a great wish.This goal was impossible to achieve. Just as the human King had said, unless chaos was exterminated, there would be living beings where chaos existed, and with living beings, there would be inheritances, generation after generation ... For all eternity!I'm convinced!No wonder he was so confident. He would not lose his goal. This goal ... He would just wait!
