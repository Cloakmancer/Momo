It was simply unbelievable!……As for Li Hao, he also appeared instantly with a smile on his face, looking very gentle.The water Empress, who was originally sitting cross-legged, quickly stood up and bowed slightly. She was shocked, but she maintained a respectful expression."Junior Wanqiu greets the Silver Moon King!"Seeing this, Li Hao smiled."You're welcome. I'm sorry for disturbing you. I hope fellow Daoist Wanqiu doesn't mind."I mind!But I didn't dare to say it.Venerable Emperor Wanqiu was speechless. She did not dare to show it. They rarely got involved in the battles of high-level worlds and disputes between high-level venerable sovereigns. It did not matter to them who was the Overlord.As long as this group of people did not randomly kill people or destroy the world, it would be the greatest blessing.At this moment, Li Hao could also see the other party's fear. Without saying anything more, he sat down and asked curiously,""You didn't build this myriad Dao Pavilion, did you?"Venerable Emperor Wanqiu didn't take a seat. She said respectfully,""No, I don't have the ability to allow a high-level venerable sovereign to enter. It was built by a high-level venerable sovereign."He continued,"although the middle world Alliance is only an Alliance of middle-level worlds, the high-level worlds were also promoted from middle-level worlds. The middle world Alliance has existed for a long time. Therefore, in fact, there are some high-level worlds among the members of the Alliance. There are even ... Rank eight worlds!"Then, he glanced at Li Hao. It was to protect himself and also to deter others, although it might not be of much use.Would these people really care about a level 8 world?Li Hao nodded slightly."The expert who set up the illusory realm was an itinerant venerable sovereign, the myriad transformations venerable sovereign!" He's a peak Type 7 expert and likes to travel around. He's also an extremely important member of the middle world Alliance, and one of the elders!""The main members of the Alliance are some medium cosmos absolute beings, but there are also some itinerant cultivators and some major cosmos absolute beings ..."Li Hao didn't need to ask. The other party took the initiative to tell him some information that everyone already knew."Silver Moon King, what kind of cooperation would you like to discuss?"She added,"as a peak level six cultivator, I gave birth to a world of the great path universe. Therefore, I'm lucky to be one of the elders of the Alliance. If it's something that you want to discuss, I can agree to it. I can solve it."At this moment, she couldn't wait for this person to leave immediately.Even if there was massive bleeding once, it would be fine.As long as he didn't want his own Dao universe, he could give him any treasure.Send away this group of gods of plague!One silver Moon King was already too much for her to handle, and this group of people had already arrived. That was terrifying!Li Hao was not in a hurry to talk about business. Instead, he asked in confusion,""From what you're saying, there are many Alliance cities in the middle world? This time, it's only city No. 9 ...""A lot of them!"Wanqiu answered immediately,"the Alliance City of the middle world is mainly built in the lower six heavens. It's located in each of the six heavens to facilitate the trade and communication between venerable sovereigns. It's even located in the South, the West, and the North. However, the other regions do things their own way and don't have much contact with us. However, if there's a chance to meet, we'll still exchange a few things ...""So far, a total of 189 Alliance cities have been built in the Eastern Region of the middle world ...""There are currently 47 cloud six cities, and this place is Alliance City No. 9."Li Hao nodded. There were quite a lot of them.Of course, it wasn't too much.The 189th was located at the strongholds of the various heavens. In fact, the East was very large, and one might not even come across one even after traveling for a long time."Every place is guarded by a level six venerable sovereign, and they are all Masters of the great path of the universe, fellow Daoist?""That's not the case. "Although Li Hao had the intention to probe their strength, Wanqiu was helpless. To such an expert, it did not make much of a difference whether she probed or not. She explained,""Only some important Alliance cities, or the Alliance cities located in the critical areas of the sixth heaven, are places where we are stationed. The main reason is that we may encounter seventh heaven advanced venerable sovereigns ... Relatively speaking, we still have some opportunities to communicate with seventh heaven venerable sovereigns on equal footing."  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ "Then, the myriad Dao Pavilion ... Is there one everywhere?""Not really. Currently, only a few Alliance cities have it. The myriad transformations Emperor has a lazy personality. Sometimes, he will build a myriad Dao Pavilion on a whim. The Alliance has no choice but to do so. They won't force the myriad transformations Emperor to build a myriad Dao Pavilion. This place is only for the use of some venerable sovereigns to communicate. It's not a place for profit ..."She vaguely guessed that Li Hao might have come for this.But ... She was a little confused.The myriad Dao Pavilion was somewhat useful to low-to mid-stage venerable sovereigns, but it should be useless to someone like Li Hao, right?Furthermore, there were many limitations.It could only provide a small place for everyone to exchange their knowledge. Strictly speaking, in the eyes of some people, it was not even as important as a small world.If they wanted to have an exchange, couldn't they go to the small world?He could find any place in the chaos. However, there was a benefit to an illusion. It allowed one's mind to enter and would not expose one's identity. This way, it was relatively safer. In addition, with the endorsement of the middle world Alliance, many people felt that it was more reliable.This was the key.However, Supreme Emperor Wanqiu couldn't understand why Li Hao was so concerned about this.As an expert who could break through a great world, this illusory realm was not even a great path universe. How could he be interested in it?"Myriad transformations Emperor ..."

Li Hao mumbled,"the other party has constructed some illusions in various places to provide everyone with an opportunity to exchange ideas ..."He thought for a moment."The Dao of myriad transformations ... Itinerant cultivators should have Dao domains after advancing. They might also be constructing Dao law domains and setting up these illusions to absorb some great Dao inspirations, right?"Celestial Emperor Wanqiu's expression changed slightly when she heard that."As for you rulers," Li Hao continued,"you can also listen to some people's Dao discussions. It can be said that you've all gained something ..."Emperor Wanqiu fell silent.Yes, it was.How could there be so many good people in this world? there were no benefits to speak of at all. Who would spend the price and effort to construct such a place?It was beneficial for the rulers and the builders to discuss the Dao in it. Listening to others 'Dao and learning from others' strong points was also a key to their progress.Li Hao's sudden mention of this made Imperial Emperor Wanqiu think more about it. Could it be that ... Li Hao was upset because she had heard his preaching?Looking for trouble?​ Li Hao said,"however, there are disadvantages to this. For example, the area is too small. There are only 189 cities in total, and only a small half of them have such places. Also, if there are too few people, they might not be willing to communicate with each other. It's also very troublesome to gather together ... The chaos is too big. They can't come to the Alliance City all the time.""Moreover, middle and low venerable sovereigns don't travel a large area. In fact, everyone comes and goes, and in the end, it's actually the same group of people, right?"Emperor Wanqiu was slightly taken aback, but she nodded."Yes, as you said, senior, as time goes on ... There will be many restrictions. In fact, most of the people who have come today are venerable sovereigns nearby. In fact, even if their identities are not exposed, once someone is preaching, many people will be able to guess the other party's identity. The chaos is vast, but to us, it's dangerous to leave the world, so ..."Those who came were actually the nearby venerable sovereigns. One or two years were fine, but hundreds of years, thousands of years, ten thousand years, and a hundred thousand years ... They were all a group of old acquaintances.Even if there were new venerable sovereigns, they were all from nearby areas.The scope of their exchange was not that big."Then," Li Hao said,"have you ever considered connecting all the illusions?"Supreme Emperor Wanqiu opened her mouth and only felt a little awkward after a while."This ... Myriad transformations Emperor has thought about it before. However, senior, you should know that the chaos is too big. To connect the illusionary realm, you will need countless sleeping universes. How many illusionary realms will you need to cover all the sleeping universes?" Unless all the high-level worlds joined forces, they would not be able to cover the entire East! To us, it's just a fantasy. It's impossible to realize. "He was speechless.What are you thinking?You're an advanced venerable sovereign, don't you know this?If he wanted to connect them, sure, he would have to find countless high-level worlds and use the universe to spread and cover them, penetrating them into one.Was that even possible?It was impossible!"So, myriad transformations Emperor and the Alliance of the middle world actually have this idea?" Li Hao laughed. Thearch Wanqiu was helpless.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Of course!Who didn't know that expanding the range of the illusion could increase communication and attract more venerable sovereigns to join?Most importantly, he could only think about it.Seeing that Li Hao kept asking these useless questions, she felt a little helpless, but she didn't dare to refute him. She could only force a smile and say,""Of course I have such an idea, but it's very difficult to achieve. Furthermore, even if it's possible, it's very difficult for the spiritual body in the illusion to move ..." Zhang xuan replied.Li Hao nodded. The range was too far. He said,""That's true. However, it's not difficult to set up a teleportation formation in an illusion. It's difficult to teleport in reality as you need to break through the suppression of chaos. However, it's not difficult to teleport spiritual bodies."Was it not difficult?Wanqiu didn't mind. What was the point of saying all this?Li Hao continued."It seems that some of the top experts in the middle world Alliance also understand that to construct a Dao universe and a domain, you need to understand and comprehend more DAOs. Myriad transformations Emperor also knows that to reach level eight or nine, you need to combine all DAOs ..."Wanqiu's heart skipped a beat!Myriad DAOs as one?Li Hao didn't care. He continued."In the chaos, there are very few people who seek enlightenment and Exchange knowledge. But in fact, cultivators cultivate to become stronger. No one would do something useless.""This time, I would like to make a small deal with you, or rather, with the middle world Alliance ...""What?"Supreme Emperor Wanqiu was confused and shocked. Li Hao had been talking about illusions ...The next moment, Li Hao said,""I want to construct an illusionary realm that can cover the entire lower six heavens in the East. I want to construct an illusionary realm teleportation system that can allow all venerable sovereigns in the lower six heavens to enter the illusionary realm without leaving their homes and communicate with each other about cultivation techniques!""It's very troublesome to construct such a system, and it requires countless resources ... It also requires powerful abilities, powerful concealment abilities, and powerful defensive abilities ..."Supreme Emperor Wanqiu thought he had gone crazy.How could that be possible?Even if it was a ninth-tier universe, it would still be difficult to cover the entire lower six heavens!You must be joking!Is this guy crazy?Li Hao calculated for a while and said,""Of course, I'll also need your help. For example, if that myriad transformations Emperor doesn't find it troublesome, he'll need to construct 1000 illusory spaces, and I'll be responsible for connecting them!"

Chapter 3422 Negotiation (Part 5)
"As for the Alliance City, it's best to build more cities on deserted islands and let some venerable sovereigns take charge. This way, not only can the system be stabilized, but it can also allow the venerable sovereigns to obtain benefits. Just like fellow Daoist, they can control an illusory space ... This will also be beneficial for Dao Comprehension."Cooperation was a win-win situation.As long as he paid and didn't ask for anything in return ... That was a Saint.Even Li Hao didn't dare to say that he would be beaten to death if he made people work for free.He just needed to comprehend some DAOs so that it would be convenient for him to do so. Similarly, he didn't mind if other people comprehended and contributed."Also, every venerable sovereign who enters has to pay some great Dao crystals. Little by little, they make a big deal. Now, we can barely make ends meet, but once more venerable sovereigns enter, if a hundred isn't enough, then a thousand, ten thousand ... How many small and medium-sized worlds are there in the entire Eastern Region? It's more than 3000, right? It might even be more than 30000!"A small square region, the Dragon region of the square region, and the fire Phoenix World region of the Dragon region each had hundreds to thousands of worlds.In the entire Dragon field, there must be thousands of them. In the square field, there must be tens of thousands of worlds.What about the entire East?Tens of thousands of worlds should be at least a few, right?How many venerable sovereigns were there?There should be at least one venerable sovereign in a world. There were dozens of them in medium-scale worlds. How many venerable sovereigns were there in the entire East? it was a huge number.A hundred thousand?Or more?If one person entered and paid 100000 great Dao crystals, they would easily get 10 billion great Dao crystals!At this moment, Li Hao smiled."Fellow Daoist Wanqiu, can you discuss with the members of the Alliance? you'll build the illusion and the city of the Alliance. In addition, you'll be in charge of publicity and promotion. You'll issue tokens, and those with the tokens can enter! "In addition, you have more people, more knowledge, and more understanding. You can also improve the trading system, exchange, sparring, and reward system. As for me, I'm responsible for one thing-to help these illusions connect as one! "In addition, I'm also responsible for constructing a teleportation system between each illusion. It can allow a person's spiritual body to instantly teleport to another illusion. This way, we can go deeper and increase the degree of communication between us!"Supreme Emperor Wanqiu looked at Li Hao in disbelief. After a long while, she said,""This is impossible!"Do you take me for an idiot?I'm at least a sixth-rank bed master. Even if you're a ninth-rank bed master, you can't cover the entire East.Li Hao smiled."Whether it's possible or not, that's my business. Since I suggested it, I must be confident. In this case, if we work together, both sides will benefit. As for me ... My main purpose is to comprehend 10000 DAOs and form a 10000-Dao law domain. You may not understand, but some Level 7 and level 8 people may. To reach level 9, comprehending 10000 DAOs is the best and most direct way."He didn't mention the construction of the pseudo-chaos, as that was a matter for the future.For a level 8, constructing a domain of 10000 threads was the path to level 9. Although Li Hao was only at Level 7, he was not aiming too high by making preparations in advance to reach level 9. At that moment, Supreme Emperor Wanqiu of the middle world Alliance did not know what to say.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Was it a good thing?Although Li Hao and his group were wanted criminals, they were powerful.On the eastern side, Samsara had suffered heavy losses. There might not be anyone who could deal with them. Besides, this had nothing to do with the middle world Alliance. This was a battle between the overlords. To them, cooperation or not didn't have much of an impact.But ...Could Li Hao really do it?How did he do it?This was impossible. Previously, a portion of the sixth-tier great Dao universes had tried to connect to the myriad Dao Pavilion in the nearby area. However, not only did they pay a huge price, but the actual results were also very poor.It was better to exist alone.Venerable Emperor Wanqiu had countless thoughts running through her mind, and she couldn't help but ask,""Then ... Even if you can do it, but now, Silver Moon ... Silver Moon is not popular in the East. Even if it has been successfully established, it can be easily destroyed by others. It can be directly destroyed by the strong and even killed by the venerable sovereigns who enter ..."Li Hao laughed,"why would I?" As long as those experts couldn't discover it or sense it, how could they destroy it? As for killing ... Not all advanced venerable sovereigns are lunatics. They would dare to kill one or two venerable sovereigns, and when thousands of venerable sovereigns enter, they would not suffer much loss even if they killed their spiritual bodies. However, the Samsara monarch would not dare to offend thousands of venerable sovereigns at the same time!""Can't be discovered or sensed?"Wanqiu could not believe it. This was impossible!Even if it was an eighth-tier universe, if it really wanted to cover the entire area, experts would actually be able to sense it. If not for this, the Dragon Lord wouldn't have been able to break the teleportation of the universe called bed and force the two eighth-tier beings from the world of reincarnation out!"This ..." She could no longer judge whether it was true or not. If it was true, she could not decide because she was only a member of the middle world Alliance, not everyone.If it was fake and they reported it to the higher-ups, it would be a joke if the results were fake.Moreover, if they were to rashly cooperate with Li Hao's group and fail, the news would leak and they would offend the realm of Samsara. At least for now, Silver moon's group was not welcomed by the major worlds.Venerable Emperor Wanqiu was conflicted."Fellow cultivator, if I may ask, is there a true master who can make decisions in the central World Alliance?" Li Hao asked with a smile.Wanqiu was silent for a while, then shook her head."No, but we have the elders 'Council. Sixth-level universe Masters, seventh-level venerable sovereigns, and a small number of sixth-level pinnacle great beings can join the Elders' Council. Under normal circumstances, we will discuss important matters together, but ... There are very few such important matters that require us to discuss."

Chapter 3423 Negotiation (1)_6
"Is there no one who has the right to speak?"Li Hao was having a headache too. This kind of Alliance seemed messy and fair, but it was very troublesome. The more it was like this, the more difficult it was to control. He didn't want to control it, but it might take a long time to complete one thing, which was very unfavorable for Li Hao.It might take a long time, decades, or even centuries ...Anyway, to them, this short period of time was not long.However, Emperor Wanqiu quickly said,"of course, if it's really a big matter, the rank seven elders have a certain amount of authority. Among them, the myriad transformations Emperor relied on himself. He didn't rely on the great Dao universe to be born. Instead, he built a Dao domain and reached rank seven on his own. He has a certain amount of prestige in the Alliance. Now that this matter involves the myriad Dao Pavilion, if the myriad transformations Emperor were to step in, it might be approved quickly ..."Although she didn't really believe it, what if ... It was true?These people from the four regions were all very powerful and somewhat inconceivable. It was said that the Silver Moon King had instantly arrived in the Twin universes, which seemed ... To be quite different.Therefore, not all of his words were just bragging.If it really succeeded ... It would be a great opportunity for the entire middle world Alliance to grow stronger.Li Hao nodded. Myriad transformations Emperor.His own Dao domain!This was the same as venerable sword and the others. Such venerable sovereigns were not simple.Their strength would also be quite powerful!"Then, can fellow Daoist contact the other party? Of course, you'll still be in control of the illusory realm if we work together, but my people will also need to grasp a part of it and comprehend the Dao laws. This is a great Dao exchange between the venerable sovereigns of the entire Eastern chaosverse, and we can completely simplify it so that we won't have to keep the techniques to ourselves ..."Wanqiu was silent for a moment before she nodded."I can try to contact him. However, I might not be able to do so. This is the first reason. The second reason is ... If ..."She paused, still feeling a little conflicted."If the large realms like the reincarnation realm appear ... Interfere or even destroy you, we ... We are only a medium-level realm. We will not participate in your disputes! If such a situation really happens, we ... We won't send anyone out, and we won't help you deal with anyone. We can only protect ourselves, and it's very difficult to even protect ourselves ..."She was worried that this would drag some of the mid-tier worlds into it and turn them into cannon fodder.Li Hao nodded."Of course. This matter involves my path to level nine. Cutting off someone's path is like killing one's parents. If anyone dares to interfere with me, I'll kill them with my sword, even if I don't want to make them my enemies!"This matter was very important. If the other party agreed, they would cooperate. If they didn 't, Li Hao would have to deal with it himself. He would kill anyone who interfered!Li Hao said it casually, but he had already made up his mind. It was fine if he hadn't thought of it before, but now that he had a path, he would take it. Whoever interfered with his exploration of the myriad DAOs path would be his mortal enemy!It just so happened that constructing a system like this or a false chaosuniverse required a large amount of energy. Whoever dared to interfere would be killed!Li Hao wasn't afraid even if the Samsara Emperor interfered.They were no match for him now, but Li Hao was ready to construct more realms and raise himself to the level of 2000 Worlds as soon as possible. During this period, he had to build this thing successfully, even if he had to sustain himself through battles.However, without the cooperation of the middle world Alliance, the source of tourists would be a big problem because most of the venerable sovereigns would not trust them and lacked enough trust.As for Emperor Wanqiu, she was shocked.Although this man spoke of killing in a relaxed manner, his eyes were flashing with a fierce light. He had always been gentle and polite, and it was impossible to associate him with the Silver Moon King who had killed the earth Sun.However, at this moment, they could make the connection.Venerable Emperor Wanqiu hesitated for a moment before she said,""I'll try to contact him. If myriad transformations Emperor is interested ..."He said.Even if they were interested, they might not dare to come.Seventh rank venerable sovereigns were very strong, and they could even construct their own Dao domains. However ... This was a group of Yama-Kings!She did not know if the myriad transformations Emperor would be willing to come.In any case, she felt that what Li Hao said was somewhat unbelievable, but also ... Somewhat possible. If the myriad transformations Emperor was really interested, he might take the risk to come here.As for herself ... She couldn't run away. If she could, she would have run away long ago.As she spoke, she suddenly had an idea. Li Hao also felt some fluctuations from the outside world. Soon, Emperor Wanqiu's expression changed slightly. There were many medium-sized worlds, and the Alliance of the medium-sized worlds had built Alliance cities in various places. These medium-sized worlds were not far from each other, so they often received news faster. In fact, they might be able to transmit information faster than some major worlds. After a moment of silence, venerable Emperor Wanqiu said in fear,""Some of the Alliance's venerable sovereigns nearby have found something ... Something unusual ... There seems to be a battle between advanced venerable sovereigns hundreds of thousands of Primal Chaos rulers from here. One of them seems to be ... Seems to be a new martial human King being chased by several advanced venerable sovereigns ...""Human King?" Li Hao frowned.Several venerable sovereigns?  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ The human King had the power of at least 5000 Dao laws and an inner world. It was equivalent to having a great Dao universe with him at all times. Such an expert always fought on his home ground. Even two or three level-eight experts would find it difficult to deal with the human King.It would be even more difficult to escape.Unless there was another top-notch expert who could pester him.However, in the East, only a few venerable sovereigns from Samsara and Extreme Ice were stronger than human Kings."Hmm ... Both sides didn't cause much commotion. There's always a Dao domain enveloping them. Our people can only observe them from afar and don't dare to get close ... We don't know if it's true or not."Supreme Emperor Wanqiu was a little cautious. It was said that Silver Moon and new martial seemed to come from the same source.She didn't know the details, and it was hard to imagine how a world born from the same source could produce high-level venerable sovereigns and become a high-level world with different kings. In fact, such a situation had almost never happened before.Li Hao touched his chin and said,""Is the reincarnation Emperor taking revenge? However, the enemy ... Only has one rank eight venerable sovereign ..."Where did these people come from?Did the venerable sovereigns from the other level eight worlds also make a move?He wasn't sure of the exact situation, but if the human ruler was really in danger, he had to go and take a look no matter what."Then, fellow Daoist, please help me contact them. I'll go and take a look ..."Of course, this could also be a trap. Who knew?This was the first time they had met venerable Emperor Wanqiu. Perhaps ... She was trying to kill him?That would be too troublesome. The other party did not have the time and ability to gather a large number of level eight venerable sovereigns to kill him.Many thoughts appeared in his mind. Let's wait and see. Leaving an ethereal extent here and being able to teleport back through the river of time at any time, Li Hao wasn't that afraid.When it came to escape methods ... He felt that he might be able to escape better than the human King.The existence of the river of time was difficult for ordinary venerable sovereigns to detect, except for top-notch venerable sovereigns. Even rank eight venerable sovereigns could only sense it.Also, how could an overbearing fellow like the human King be ganged up on?He didn't kill the other party?Many doubts appeared in his mind.Li Hao quickly sent a message to the others, telling them to take a look first.Perhaps, he could even see the human King in a sorry state ... Thinking about it, he didn't feel much danger. Instead, he found it interesting.Soon, the group of people disappeared into thin air with Li Hao.Supreme Emperor Wanqiu was also shocked. It seemed like these people had really been teleported away ... Could they be teleported away in the chaos?Also, was Li Hao's so-called constructing an illusion cover real or fake?She didn't dare to believe it, but she didn't dare to deny it either. Very quickly, she used the Alliance's communication system to send a message to each world. She sent a message to the myriad transformations Emperor's region.She couldn't make a decision on this matter. Perhaps, she could only wait for the myriad transformations Emperor's reaction.As for the human King being hunted down ... She didn't care if Li Hao and his group went to rescue him. If he really died, she would just pretend that she didn't meet them.As for not dying, the group of people who were chasing after her would be in a miserable state. Of course, this was not something that she, a sixth rank venerable sovereign, could participate in.

3424 Chapter 555
The human King was actually being hunted down?Who would dare to chase after the killer king at this moment?Li Hao was a little puzzled. So far, the probability of all the advanced venerable sovereigns in the Eastern Region joining forces was low, and the probability of taking the risk to surround the killer king was also low.Even though he was puzzled, he still led his men in that direction.But at this moment ... Thunderlord suddenly frowned and looked to the East. With a slightly sullen face, he said in a deep voice,""The Thunder World seems to have been broken by someone!"Although the realm was only an empty shell.However, this was still the Thunder World, and he was the realm Lord.At this moment, the boundary had been broken. However, he could still sense that someone had broken through the Thunder World. Li Hao frowned slightly.No one knew that they had left. This also meant that there were many experts who had broken through the Thunder World. Only those who had absolute confidence in capturing them would dare to attack the Thunder World.However ... On one hand, they had to besiege the human King. On the other hand, they had to besiege the Thunder World. At the same time, they had to guard against the Dragon Lord and new martial.What was going on?The powerhouses of the East had joined forces?If that was the case, then he had really underestimated them. The speed of their cooperation was too fast. Back in the square region, Hong Yue had joined forces with several rank Seven Worlds, but it had taken a long time.  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  How could he be so fast?This time, it was beyond Li Hao's expectations.He frowned.It was not a good thing for him that the eastern powerhouses had joined forces."Let's not care about that for now, let's go find the human King first!"Li Hao didn't say anything else. His face was a little gloomy. He was just about to build the myriad Dao Pavilion, but if all the eastern powerhouses joined forces ... It wouldn't be a good thing for him. It would interfere with his entire plan.……Thunder World.The five level eight venerable sovereigns looked gloomy.There was no one.The Thunder World had been broken, but ... There was no sign of it."He's gone. ""Where did he go?""You're asking me?"The eighth level venerable sovereigns frowned.He actually ran away!The key was that they had even given up on an eighth step world. In their opinion, the Thunder World was very important. They had the advantage of being in their own territory, which was the key to an eighth step expert's rampage. Now, the other party had even lost their lair.This ... Such courage!"It's good that he's gone ...""Maybe he went to another area?""Or is he hiding in the dark?" “……”The eighth level venerable sovereigns looked at each other. They didn't feel relaxed at all. Instead, they felt a little pressured. It wasn't necessarily a good thing that this group of people had disappeared.Originally, this group of people had already been exposed.However, who would have thought that in the blink of an eye, he would run away and not even want the world anymore. Although he had drained all the energy, no matter how much energy he had extracted, it would not be as strong as guarding the local world."What do we do now?"Everyone looked at each other. They had finally decided to attack together, but now they were gone. Were they going to go back just like that?If that was the case, the long discussion they had before would have become a joke.The eighth level venerable sovereign from the extreme Ice world suddenly said,""Why don't we ... Go to the four-sided domain and take a look?"Everyone's hearts stirred when they heard this.Four-sided domain?Long Zhan's territory.The chaos race was not weak. It was said that Black Tiger had also stepped into the eighth stage, while long Zhan and red Moon were both at the eighth stage. There were three great experts at the eighth stage, and there were quite a number of experts at the seventh stage. Moreover, long Zhan's combat strength was formidable ...Although they had gathered five level 8s and more than ten Level 7s, with such strength, if they really went to the four-square region, the other party would still have the advantage of being native ... This ... Might not be useful, right?On the contrary, it was dangerous!"The square region is dominated by humans after all. Now that the chaos beasts have ruled the square region, there are still a large number of human powerhouses ... There are at least dozens of seventh level venerable sovereigns ... If we really encounter a battle and these human powerhouses are willing to help, there's nothing to be afraid of, even if long Zhan is strong!""In addition, the four-sided domain has tianfang world! "Now that new martial, Silver Moon, and light worlds have all left, the square region is very empty ..."Someone suggested, while someone else said in a low voice,"I might as well go all out ... I'll call a few more tier 8 experts and go to the square region to take a look. It'll be best if we can finish long Zhan! This guy controls the four-sided domain, and he's a big threat!""The four-sided domain is in the East. After conquering the four-sided domain, we can still defend tianfang world. We can attack or retreat at will ..."It was rare for the eastern powerhouses to join forces. They might not be able to find Li Hao's group now.In that case ... It would be better to attack the four-sided domain.They had the advantage of numbers!If there were fewer people, they would not dare. Long Zhan was too strong, but if there were more people ..."The extreme frost monarch is not weaker than the Samsara monarch. It's a waste for him to stay here ..." Someone suggested.12 type 8 worlds working together!There were a total of 16 level eight venerable sovereigns and a large number of Level Seven venerable sovereigns. In addition, there were many Level Seven Worlds participating. If they were really willing to take action and go all out, they would definitely be able to destroy the four-square region.However, there were still some experts left behind.They couldn't all leave. It would be troublesome if someone stole their house.There were 16 level 8s and 12 worlds. By right, 12 of them had to be left behind, but there were a few level 8s that were very close to each other. At this stage, as long as one was trustworthy, one person could take care of a few great worlds."You really want to go?""Why not?"“……”The level eight venerable sovereigns discussed with each other. They were all ambitious. Since they had all come out, they came to an agreement ... They would cooperate. They were too unwilling to return now."Then ... If we call a few more fellow Daoists, long Zhan would not have thought that we would reach an agreement so quickly and even put aside neo martial and silver Moon to enter the four-sided domain ... Since that's the case, then let's go! We'll catch him off guard!"

Chapter 3425 Chaotic Battle (2)
The group of venerable sovereigns was excited.What else could he say at this point?Attack!The East had never had an Overlord. This time, perhaps with an Alliance, an Overlord would finally emerge and officially compete with the other three for the world."Then I'll ... Inform the sector Lord!" Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  At this moment, the other venerable sovereign of the extreme Ice field was also tempted.If they could take down the four-sided region, it might be an opportunity for the extreme Ice world, an opportunity to truly become the Overlord of the East. After taking down long Zhan, they could borrow the power of the other worlds to kill long Zhan. There would definitely be great gains!A powerhouse like long Zhan, even if he did not come out, he was a threat too."They're out. They've been a huge threat in the battle with the reincarnation Emperor. It's rare that everyone's here. Let's take this opportunity to annihilate them!"……At this moment, Li Hao had yet to arrive at the human King battlefield.On the other side, in the extreme Ice world, the extreme Ice Emperor suddenly disappeared from the world. At the same time, two more rank eight venerable sovereigns from the surrounding rank eight worlds moved out. At this moment, a total of eight rank eight venerable sovereigns moved out and headed straight for the four-sided domain.If he couldn't find Li Hao's group, then ... He would go to the square domain!As for the new martial artists, they still had to be on guard. However, there were still eight level eight venerable sovereigns guarding the place, in addition to many Level Seven venerable sovereigns. They had reached an agreement so it was not that dangerous.……As for the neo martial world, which had been staying on the periphery of the extreme Ice world.At this moment, the Grandmaster's eyes suddenly flickered. Beside him, a cat was a little impatient."Still not leaving? "Don't worry about this. Fang ping seems to be under siege ..."Although the human King had left neo martial, it did not mean that they had completely lost contact. In fact, after the human King was besieged, the gray cat had sensed it and had wanted to rescue him, but the Supreme had not moved.The blue cat was anxious!If it didn't need this fellow to go with it, it would have left by itself.Zhi Zun glanced at the extreme Ice world. Two eighth rank venerable sovereigns had left, so there was only one left. Currently, this world was the one with the greatest threat in the East.On Fang Ping's side, he did not know why he was being attacked and who he was being attacked by, but it was definitely related to Samsara.This also meant that Samsara didn't have the strength to participate in this battle.Or reincarnation?As this thought emerged in his mind, the Grandmaster looked at the world of Extreme Ice and pondered for a moment. He didn't seem to be in a hurry for the human King. After a moment, he slowly said,"Forcefully attacking the extreme Ice world ..."On the side, the light Thearch frowned slightly."The other party doesn't seem to be going to deal with the human Kings. As for the Silver Moon King and the others, they seem to have left as well. They have now dispatched a total of eight level eight venerable sovereigns ... I think they might go to the four regions to deal with long Zhan!" Since he was dealing with long Zhan, why should he deal with the extreme Ice world now? it would be troublesome if the extreme Ice Thearch and the others returned.It was better to kill with a borrowed knife. Long Zhan was always a threat.Why did he help long Zhan out of the situation?The Grandmaster looked back at the direction of the four-sided domain. After a moment, he said in a deep voice, "It's to stop them from dealing with long Zhan. I'm worried that if these guys go to the four-sided region, it'll be like throwing meat buns at a dog. There's no return, and it'll help long Zhan's strength instead! Eight grade eights and more than ten grade Sevens. If they were all killed there, there would be at least a few more grade eights under long Zhan's command ..."Light Thearch was stunned."There are eight level 8 experts!"Are you serious?Do you really think that if these people go, they will be killed by long Zhan?What a joke!On long Zhan's side, there were only three tier 8. Even if long Zhan could really fight one against three, that was not enough either.This Supreme neo martial artist was actually ... Actually worried that these people were going to die and give them benefits. Was it possible?What a joke.Of course, if these people went, because they were not on their own land, their combat strength would decline a little. As for the chaos beasts, it did not matter whether they were on their own land or not, their strength would not be weakened. However, no matter what, with eight level eight venerable sovereigns moving out, long Zhan and the others would definitely suffer.The light Thearch was a little unhappy that this Supreme had overestimated long Zhan.Moreover, ever since he had left the four-sided domain, he had followed this person and had not participated in any battles. He had not gained any benefits and had even been dragged into the world of light. In fact, he was somewhat dissatisfied.At this moment, ambushing Extreme Ice and helping long Zhan out of the situation, he was even more unhappy. It was just as the blood Emperor had said.In neo martial arts, regardless of whether you were a leader or a level eight venerable sovereign, the neo martial artists would not give you too much face here. You could only listen to the arrangements of the neo martial arts.It was even more so with an Autarch present.He had almost no power to decide.This made the light Supreme Emperor a little unhappy, but at this moment, he was under the roof and felt helpless. He thought of his son, who seemed to have gained a lot of benefits from the operation with Li Hao and the others. He had even reached Level Seven.Just thinking about it made him feel very depressed.The Grandmaster also felt the other party's dissatisfaction. After thinking for a moment, he explained,"First, long Zhan is very strong. Second, the dragon world itself is very strong. Then, long Zhan opened his own Dao domain, so who inherited the dragon world? The inheritor might have also stepped into level eight! If that's the case, the dragon clan will have four stage eight cultivators ... And these people will have to go through the Thunder region to consume some of their energy. Their strength will not be as strong as it was at its peak. Long Zhan alone can deal with several of them ...""Then let them fight each other, and perhaps both sides will suffer!"As he spoke, he gritted his teeth and said gloomily,"If we really can't do it, we'll go too and outflank them. If both sides are injured, we'll attack! The human King is in danger, why don't we go and save him first?"

Chapter 3426 Chaotic Battle (3)
In any case, he did not want to attack the extreme Ice world at this moment. This would make long Zhan very comfortable, but he was not happy.The human King is being surrounded, and you don't care?At this moment, the light Thearch was a little suspicious of this new martial Supreme. 'Do you want to kill the human King and make yourself the king of new martial?'At this moment, the Supreme martial artist's mind was spinning.He really felt that if these people went over, they might be killed by long Zhan. This way, it would strengthen long Zhan's strength instead.However, the radiance Thearch felt that it was impossible.But he believed it.Since that was the case, it was better to let these people stay here. It would limit the pace of long Zhan's expansion. He was considering from the overall situation and did not consider whether it would be helpful to long Zhan at present.However, the radiance Supreme Emperor was also one of the targets to be roped in. Moreover, there was a natural advantage in roping in the other party.At this moment, the other party clearly felt that such a long-term plan might not be useful.He was also unwilling to besiege Extreme Ice and help long Zhan out of the situation.Zhi Zun's mind moved. Although he knew that letting Extreme Ice and the others go over might give long Zhan an advantage, at this moment, he still made a decision and quickly said,""Then let's go to the World of reincarnation!"He laughed."Fang ping won't be killed so easily. He's been through hundreds of battles. How can he be killed so easily? he's being hunted down, and it must have something to do with Samsara. Since brother Guangming is not willing to help long Zhan out, then why don't you ... Go to Samsara!" This time, the light Thearch felt much more comfortable and he felt that he was valued.Who said that a Supreme neo martial artist was domineering?It was still alright!See, when I said I wasn't willing, they also gave in.Now, he was satisfied and immediately said,""Saving the human King is more important than dealing with Extreme Ice. Let's besiege the Samsara and let the Samsara Emperor return. Even if we can't take down the Samsara, we can still let the human King escape!"It was a good thing!He had no objections to this.As for the Supreme martial artist, he didn't say anything more. He looked at the extreme Ice world and felt a little emotional ... He thought that if long Zhan really killed those people, perhaps ... He would be able to take over these level eight worlds in time!He thought about it and felt that it was acceptable.He didn't say anything more and quickly looked at big cat. Big cat couldn't wait any longer. Soon, he drove the neo martial world and headed straight for Samsara.……At the same time.In the void.Saber Light flashed, chaos trembled, and the void rumbled! The human King coughed out blood and cursed under his breath.Bastard.These guys were quite difficult to deal with. Apart from the extremely powerful reincarnation Emperor, the other unfamiliar rank eight was also very powerful. This was the key. The other three rank eights had been killed once before, and they were all weak chickens.He had no fear at all!But now, with the obstruction of the reincarnation sovereign and the powerful body of that powerful sovereign, his retreat was cut off several times. This made the human King a little uncomfortable. This time, he was in trouble.Even escaping would be a little difficult.At this moment, he could only hope that big cat and the others wouldn't come to help, or ... Attack Samsara's home ground. If that didn't work, a battle elsewhere would be fine. In short, if he didn't create some chaos, he might really fall today.Although he was cursing in his heart, he was not willing to admit defeat. Even if he was in danger, he continued to provoke,""Samsara, who did you sell your ass to? You resurrected three level 8s, and now you've given me a level 8s to monitor you. Who did you sell it to?""Huntian? Spring and autumn? Or the five elements?""It's definitely not the five elements. There are only five tier 8 beasts in the five elements, and this fellow is clearly not one of them ... This fellow seems to be a beast of primordial chaos as well. Could it be that he has sold his ass to that Chunqiu of the monster race?"Human King laughed out loud,"or did you sell it to huntian?"Behind him, the reincarnation Emperor was calm. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  He had only been setting up his Dao domain to trap the human King, not giving him a chance to escape.As for scolding him a little ... So what if he killed the other party?Moreover, although the words of the human King were unpleasant to hear, it was the truth. Although it was not as disgusting as he said, but to submit to huntian was to bow down and submit. He had already lost face, so why should he care about face?On the other side, venerable monarch fleeting life's face turned ashen. He gritted his teeth and said,""Fang ping, you're on the verge of death, yet you still dare to be so arrogant!"Last time, he was killed by the human King and Samsara joined huntian because of that. He was filled with hatred and anger.Today, this arrogant fellow was finally surrounded. He felt that he could finally take revenge today!The power of life and death emerged. Countless vengeful souls had been consumed last time. Moreover, it was not very useful against a powerhouse like the human King. Therefore, he did not use this move again. Instead, he combined life and death with the other two eighth level venerable sovereigns to extract vitality and dissipate the aura of death.The entire area was turned into a purgatory!The human King's face was slightly pale, but he still had a bright smile on his face. Even if he really died in battle, he wouldn't reveal any pessimistic emotions. Why should he let the enemy feel good?He laughed,"grandson, you want to kill your grandfather? you're still too young!" Did it feel good when I cut you into pieces the last time? Do you want another round?""You're about to die, you can only be stubborn!"Fu Sheng was furious. Behind him, the Samsara Emperor was extremely quiet. He kept laying down his Dao domain to trap the human King. The other rank eight venerable sovereign from the chaos heaven world also remained silent.This brawny man was actually a Beast of Chaos and was extremely powerful. His physical body was also terrifyingly powerful. He was also the biggest obstacle that the human King needed to break through at this moment.If this person had not stopped him, he might have been able to kill a grade 8 expert and escape.

3427 Chapter 555
However, with this person here, even though he could injure the other party with a single slash, it would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens to kill him."Damn it!" The human King cursed. Old Zhang and the others might have thought that he could hold his own. After all, they did not expect the other party to have so many eighth level venerable sovereigns, a total of five of them. Furthermore, they were able to restrain him.His explosive power was very strong now, but with the addition of a rank eight with a strong physical body ... This kind of explosive power was a bit off-balance.The difficulty of recovering from the explosion of the blade was greatly increased.On the contrary, it would continuously weaken him.BOOM!The Beast of Chaos punched out with a loud bang. This punch actually cracked the blade of the human King. The blade of the human King had been forged for many years and was extremely powerful. It had never broken even when it killed a level eight.p But today, a crack had appeared.The human King's face flushed red as he snorted coldly. At this moment, he no longer had the mood to curse.However, his eyes kept changing. He wanted to find an opening to break through but couldn 't. The Samsara Emperor was much calmer than the last time. This time, he had been setting up Dao domains at the periphery to suppress the human Kings.With such a top-notch expert setting up a formation outside, the human King's escape route was completely blocked.……The battle between the two sides was very loud. However, with the arrangement of the reincarnation Emperor, the movement was not big. Unless it was nearby, it was difficult to detect.This was also something that Li Hao and the others did not realize and only knew through the intermediate World Alliance.Originally, Li Hao had come with the intention of watching a show.However, when he sensed something in the distance ... He stopped in his tracks and his expression changed."Why would I?"Li Hao frowned. The three tier 8 powerhouses had actually been resurrected!That's right. When he got closer to the battlefield, he discovered that the three rank eight venerable sovereigns of the world of reincarnation had been revived. Not only that, it seemed that there was another one besides the four rank eight venerable sovereigns of the reincarnation realm!It seemed to be ... A Chaos Beast!Li Hao immediately frowned.At this moment, the reincarnation Emperor who was besieging the human King in the distance suddenly looked out and frowned. What was going on?What was the extreme Ice realm doing?This time, the venerable sovereigns of the extreme Ice world had joined forces with the other venerable sovereigns to besiege and kill the experts of the Thunder World. Why did he seem to sense the aura of the Silver Moon King? was he nearby?The thoughts of the reincarnation Emperor flickered, but he didn't say anything. He was still in an orderly manner.He came!Originally, he had been prepared. However, he had been waiting for neo martial, not this group of people. Now, before neo martial appeared, this group of people had appeared first.……"Absorb!" n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  Even Thearch Wushan couldn't help but take a deep breath. He could see the besieged human King off in the distance, covered in blood. From a distance ... He looked extremely miserable!The human King was such a domineering expert. He had provoked many powerful enemies in the four-square region, but he had never shown such an attitude. Today ... They actually saw the scene of the human King bathing in blood. "Five rank eights ... How did they resurrect ..."Monarch Wushan was also shocked. Li Hao glanced at him and said in a deep voice,""Life and death Dao!"As long as the price was high enough, a Dao of life and death expert like the reincarnation Emperor could still revive these rank eights. Moreover, they were from the native world. If he could do it back then, this person could naturally do it too.However, Li Hao didn't expect that the other party would have enough resources to revive three level 8s ... How great of a price would they have to pay?No wonder even the human King fell for it."Should we make a move?""There are five rank eights. Dao Qi, Thunderlord, and I will each deal with one ... The others will attack one of them. We should be able to ..."Even if he couldn't kill the other party, he could at least save the human King.Li Hao thought so too. Five rank eights were very strong. Even an expert like the Samsara Emperor was here. Without long Zhan, they might not be able to kill the other party, but they could still get out of trouble.Li Hao's group quickly approached the battlefield.It was too difficult to ambush five rank eights.Li Hao wasn't prepared for a surprise attack, either!However, just as he was about to approach, Dao Qi's expression suddenly changed, and second cat's hair stood on end. Seeing this, Li Hao quickly crossed the void and left with everyone!In an instant, a loud boom rang out where they had been, and the heavens and earth shattered!Without a sound, a few powerhouses appeared between heaven and earth.And the other party ... Had actually been hiding nearby all this time.The reincarnation Emperor looked at the scene and frowned slightly. He suddenly laughed and said,""The Silver Moon King truly lives up to his name. He actually managed to escape the ambush so easily ... It was originally prepared for the new martial Supreme and Emperor Cang. It's a pity that they didn't come!"Li Hao, who had escaped into the river of time, instantly reappeared not far away, his expression changing slightly.Three level 8 experts!Another three level 8 existences!There were a total of eight rank eight venerable sovereigns. Where did three rank eight venerable sovereigns come from?Five of them were already beyond his imagination. Where did the other three come from?As if he had thought of something, Li Hao's expression changed and he said in a low voice,""You ... You've joined a force?"It was obvious that these three rank eights might have come from some force or from the other party's spies in the East.Eight level eight venerable sovereigns!It was simply unbelievable!In order to kill the human King, the reincarnation Emperor had made full preparations. Such strength was enough to surround and kill any party.They were only here to watch the show and save the human King, but in the end ... It seemed like they were in trouble."You're all smart, but unfortunately, smart people die faster!"Venerable reincarnation laughed. Do you need me to introduce you to the three venerable sovereigns? In this world, it's not only the people from the four-sided domain who know how to join forces!"

His expression turned cold."When you kill Fu Sheng and the others, it means that you've become enemies with my reincarnation. If that's the case, I won't be able to sleep and eat in peace if I don't kill you!" Of the 16 rank 8 worlds in the eastern world, 12 of them joined forces to besiege the Thunder World. Unfortunately, you weren't among them ... The twins were destroyed, and these three were the sector Lords and Dao Lords of the other two rank 8 worlds!"This was the foundation of huntian!That's right, the chaos heaven realm had quietly roped in two rank eight worlds in the East. If the twins weren't destroyed, there would be three. With Samsara, there would be four!Other than Extreme Ice and his gang, the rest of the clans had all joined huntian.This time, he was so certain and confident that he would be able to kill the king of men. This was the reason.If five rank eights weren't enough, then what about eight? Originally, they were prepared to deal with neo martial in secret. Unfortunately, neo martial didn't appear. Instead, it was Li Hao and the others who appeared. However, it didn't make a difference. It was the same.Although the appearance of the three level 8s might not be enough to kill Li Hao's group ... It would not be easy for them to escape.He laughed, and the next moment, the world changed.The originally empty chaos around them suddenly began to shake. In the blink of an eye, Dao laws appeared in all directions, forming a Dao domain. They chased after the human King for a long time but were unable to kill him, mainly because he did not participate in the battle.Instead, he had been building the life and death Dao domain and the reincarnation Dao domain. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  Suddenly, a cold wind began to blow, and in the blink of an eye, countless vengeful souls appeared, all of them exuding the aura of venerable sovereigns. There were even some who emanated the aura of rank seven!It was much stronger than the vengeful spirit that Fu Sheng had displayed that day.In the blink of an eye, Li Hao's group was surrounded. The Samsara Emperor laughed, but the human King's expression really changed this time. He couldn't help but curse,"Oh, is this necessary?"Eight grade 8 experts!Forget it, there was still a large number of vengeful souls. The last time this guy fought with long Zhan, he did not show it.This time it's terrible!He couldn't help but shout at Li Hao,""Hurry up and get out of here ... Go find someone to save me ..."Who?He was looking for old Zhang and the others.If he didn't leave now before he was surrounded, he might not have a chance. He was unlucky this time. He didn't expect the other party to have a hidden eighth-rank!When he saw Li Hao's group arrive, he had thought that he would win this time.In the end ... Human King reflected on himself. He was too careless this time and underestimated Samsara. It was mainly because this fellow was too useless last time. Long Zhan had killed an eighth level venerable sovereign in front of him. He felt that he was too useless.However, it turned out that the reincarnation Emperor, who had almost become the Overlord of the East, was not so useless.Last time, he was caught off guard, but very quickly, he retaliated.Three level eight venerable sovereigns surrounded Li Hao and the others. They looked at them coldly as if they were already dead. Even though they could sense that there were three level eight venerable sovereigns on their side, they still had to face them.But ... Three of them had just advanced to level eight. They were the masters of the world, the Masters of the great Dao, and all of them were old venerable sovereigns! He could easily suppress them even in a three-on-three battle!As for Li Hao's group of rank seven specters, there were countless specters on the side of the reincarnation Emperor. Some of them were rank seven specters who had been killed by the reincarnation Emperor for many years!And now, they had all turned into ghosts.The venerable sovereigns were even more boundless.For the world of reincarnation to be able to reach its current state, it had killed many venerable sovereigns and devoured many other realms over the years. It was just that it did not cause much of a stir.Now, these dead venerable sovereigns had all become dead souls.Li Hao didn't say anything.He frowned slightly.Can you walk?With the river of time around, they had yet to engage in an official battle. They still had a chance to escape the encirclement.However, with the appearance of eight rank eights, the moment he left ... The human King would die without a doubt.The human King had miscalculated!It wasn't just the human King. The new martial artists didn't come either. They probably didn't expect this result. In fact, Li Hao didn't expect this before he came. They all underestimated the Samsara Emperor.Everything had been going smoothly, and they had gotten what they wanted. This made them feel that Samsara was nothing special. They had killed three rank eights at once, so why would they need to worry about the Samsara Emperor?Even if they besieged the human King ... It would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens to kill the human King!As it turned out, they had overestimated themselves.A level eight Supreme Emperor, and a top level eight at that. He was the Overlord who was ready to dominate the East. He had suffered a loss at long Zhan's place, causing Li Hao and the others to underestimate his opponent. The price was that ... If he left now, the human King would die without a doubt!Beside him, Wu Shan, the Thunder Emperor, and Dao Qi, the three rank eights, also had a change in expression.Solitary, second cat, and Sen LAN all looked serious.Everything had been going smoothly ... Everyone had come with the mentality of watching a show. How did they suddenly get surrounded?Li Hao didn't say anything. After a glance, he suddenly looked at the human King and said in a deep voice,""Will the Autarch and the others still be able to come?"The human King gasped for breath and dodged the Beast of Chaos 'overbearing punch. This was also the first time that he chose to avoid a direct confrontation with his opponent. This also meant that the human King was not able to hold on much longer.At this moment, he found time to laugh,""I don't know ... These guys ... Probably think like me ... That ... I'm not afraid of any level 8 ... I won't die Here. They might not ... Come ..."He might have gone to ambush Samsara?They might have gone to other eighth-rank worlds, but old Zhang probably didn't expect eight eighth-rank venerable sovereigns to come, right?

3429 Chapter 555
In other words, the reinforcements might not come.If it was a third party, he would have been able to fool them and tell them that they would be here soon. This would have been a good deterrent for Samsara, but ... Silver Moon was his junior.This time, it was one thing to lose face in front of the Silvermoon King, but if these fellows were truly confident that old Zhang and the others would be able to arrive quickly and were instead unwilling to escape ... If they misjudged the situation, it was very likely that they would all be wiped out!Therefore, the human King was not lying.He was also a little self-deprecating.The storm had already passed, but he actually fell on the head of this unremarkable fellow, Samsara. Yes, unremarkable. In any case, this fellow was defeated by long Zhan the last time, so he didn't take a fancy to the reincarnation sovereign.In the end ... He was defeated.At this moment, the reincarnation Emperor did not say anything and remained calm.However, the power of life and death continued to appear and strengthen the surrounding Dao domain. It wanted to trap both sides and kill them here!Only then could he wash away the shame of reincarnation!"Kill them! If you kill them, all the power of the great DAOs, the crystals of the great DAOs, everything ... Will belong to you. The world of reincarnation will not take a single cent!"The voice of the reincarnation Emperor was low and cold.Countless vengeful souls quickly swarmed toward Li Hao and the others.The people of Wushan all looked at Li Hao anxiously. Should they fight or leave?Once they engaged in battle and were entangled, even with the river of time ... It would be difficult to escape.As for the human Kings, they were clearly unable to hold on. Once the human Kings fell first ... The five tier 8 experts would quickly join forces, and they would all be finished.Countless thoughts appeared in Li Hao's mind.It flickered crazily."Senior human King ... You owe me this time!" He laughed."Battle!" He shouted.At this moment, what could they do if they didn't fight?He quickly sent a message to the two cats,"release Emperor Silvermoon and deal with the vengeful spirits!" When necessary, unseal Dali, and all venerable sovereigns must participate in the war!"The debt between him and the human King had already been paid off last time.However, new martial and silver Moon were considered one.Furthermore, when Silver Moon left the Stargate, the human King took the risk to kill the Master of Darkness, creating an opportunity for Silver Moon ... Sometimes, it was hard to say whether a debt of gratitude could be repaid or not.At this moment, he couldn't just watch the human King get killed.If they fought hard, they might still have a chance!However, under such circumstances, even if they were to engage in a fierce battle, once the human King fell, they would probably collapse completely. Everyone could be killed. Eight level eights ... Were already far beyond their capacity. They were not something they could deal with.Countless thoughts ran through Li Hao's mind. Beside him, the three level eight venerable sovereigns looked at each other. Although they felt that it was better not to save the human King, neither of them fled nor left the battle.The three of them didn't say anything.They all owed Li Hao a lot of favors, and it was difficult to repay them. Wu Shan had advanced to level eight with his neo martial arts, while Thunderlord and Dao Qi had advanced to level eight with Li Hao's help.He had his merits since he was recognized by Li Hao and the others and treated as a friend.At this moment, the three grade 8 super cultivators didn't think about anything else and attacked!Lightning struck the heavens and the earth. Clouds and mist filled the void. Thousands of great Dao grid lines turned into a cage and teleported in an instant, heading straight for the three rank eight venerable sovereigns. The six rank eight venerable sovereigns collided with each other in the blink of an eye.The human King laughed heartily."Thank you, everyone ... If I don't die this time, I'll make a few friends ... I'll definitely repay you in the future!"The few of them did not speak.They weren't as free as the human King. At this time, they still had the mood to talk. When experts fought, the three of them realized that they were slightly weaker and were not as good as the three veteran tier 8 experts.Upon contact, the sea of clouds and mist collapsed, the Thunder was suppressed, and the Dao chess body was shaken by the attack.The Samsara Emperor sat in the middle and smiled. At this moment, the purgatory appeared between the heavens and the earth. Two passages appeared. One was dark with a large number of vengeful souls coming out, while the other was bright. At this moment, it was crazily extracting everyone's life force and draining it away. "I only wanted to capture neo martial ... But now, I've captured Silver Moon as well."The reincarnation sovereign thought to himself as a smile appeared on his face. He looked at Li Hao.It would be best if this fellow could be captured alive!He needed to observe for a while, and huntian probably also wanted to observe this Dao of time cultivator.He turned his head and looked into the distance. He looked at the end of the East, where the four-sided domain was.Long Zhan, the humiliation you gave me last time, I will wash it away too!……At this moment, Li Hao had already made his move. He killed countless vengeful souls with one strike. Ermao and Kong Ji also made their moves. A large number of Silver Moon Emperor appeared.When they saw the countless vengeful souls in front of them, all of which were venerable sovereigns, the Silver Moon martial masters 'expressions changed. They didn't say anything and quickly attacked!However, the situation was worse than he had imagined.On the other side, the human King was suddenly sent flying by the eighth-order Chaos beast's punch. His body cracked and his long blade was shattered. He coughed out blood non-stop. Venerable sovereign Fu Sheng's eyes were gloomy as he struck out with his palm, leaving a deep wound on the human King's back.The human King, who had been fighting for so long, was also exhausted.It was already unbelievable that he could last until now under the siege of five rank eight venerable sovereigns. Moreover, there was an existence like Samsara among them. He was already unimaginably strong. After all, he was only a rank eight venerable sovereign who had just advanced.However, no matter how strong he was, facing five rank eights, at this point ... He had reached his limit.The human King chuckled, as if he didn't care. He glanced at Li Hao and the others. At this moment, the inner world in his body was in chaos. His eyes were filled with killing intent. If you want to kill me, at least a few of you should die with me!How many of them could a top-tier level eight self-destruct?As for Li Hao's group, he wasn't too worried. Once he exploded, these guys would suffer heavy losses. How could they surround Li Hao's group?It had been many years since he had encountered such a crisis.Walking out of neo martial arts ... It seemed that he had lost this sense of crisis.,m The human King thought. At that moment, some thoughts appeared in his mind. It was a pity ... He had not found out the truth behind Tian Fang and the others 'disappearance.Other than that, he didn't have too many regrets.'And old Zhang, big cat, these guys trust me too much. They trust me so much that they think I'm immortal. I'm going to go big this time!'"Retreat!" The human King suddenly roared."All of you, retreat!"The power of the great Dao surged wildly, and countless chaotic forces swept over from all directions. The world inside shook violently, and even the Samsara Emperor's expression changed slightly. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  Self-destruction?At the level of level eight, as long as there was a little bit of vitality, almost no one would do this. However, this neo martial human King was not completely dead yet, and he was going to self-destruct?Damn it!Was he that crazy?His expression changed slightly, and he quickly made a move. The power of countless great DAOs surged. He could not care less about Li Hao and the others. He had to completely suppress the human King first. Otherwise, once the human king self-destructed, the expert from the chaos race might not be in any danger, but the other three were rather weak.If he was killed again ... It would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens to resurrect him. Moreover, he might die of old age quickly after resurrecting.As soon as he attacked, the sky changed color, and reincarnation emerged. The countless power of the great Dao on the human King's body instantly turned into death Qi, and some of it seeped out.The reincarnation Emperor had shown his strong side.The human King laughed heartily as yin and yang reversed. The deathly aura instantly turned into vitality once again, transforming into the violent power of great DAOs. In the blink of an eye, it was on the verge of exploding!On the other side, Li Hao, who was killing the vengeful souls, turned his head and looked over. His expression changed slightly.The human King was too decisive!He was going to self-destruct even before he completely collapsed. This guy was so brutal. This ... Wasn't he still thinking of a way?Li Hao's head instantly started to ache. He was in big trouble.
