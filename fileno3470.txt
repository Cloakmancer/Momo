"And all of this will require the help of the middle world Alliance!""Each base point needs at least one venerable sovereign to form a small regional illusory realm, which is then connected to the entire great illusory realm. This will completely cover the entire area ... This will require a large number of venerable sovereigns and a large number of people to maintain it!"Thousands of venerable sovereigns!Was it a lot?There were so many of them that it was terrifying.However, in a great world, there were actually not many venerable sovereigns.How many worlds were there in the middle world Alliance?He didn't know, but there were probably tens of thousands of worlds in the four-sided region. The Eastern Region would only have more worlds and even more venerable sovereigns. It was a terrifying number.It wasn't a big problem to construct thousands of Foundation points.As long as there were benefits, the venerable sovereigns would be more than willing to be the Guardians."Of course," Li Hao added."If you're not worried that I'll plot against you, you can use the world as a base. It'll be safer and more convenient ... But if you're worried, you can build it in chaos according to the specifications of a deserted island."It was actually safer and more appropriate to use the world as a base, but he was afraid that people would worry.Thus, Li Hao gave them another option."Then, how do we attract everyone to enter and discuss the Dao?" And what kind of benefits could The Guardian obtain? To maintain such a large illusion, it would consume a lot of energy. How could he solve this problem? Also, once an expert enters ... Will they be able to hold on? Which rank of venerable sovereigns can IT support? or is it that only low-to mid-grade venerable sovereigns can enter?""The last point is, if a powerful enemy attacks and destroys the illusion, who will fight against it ... Or do we need the middle world Alliance to be responsible for safety?"The questions he asked were all necessary.Otherwise, it would be very troublesome.Li Hao explained,"the myriad Dao Pavilion has a reputation for attracting people. It has a Foundation in the chaos. I don't have the time or energy to do that. The only way is to promote it in the middle world Alliance. We have to be quick!""What benefits can The Guardian get? Every protector is in charge of an illusory space. All who enter will have to pay a portion of the great Dao crystals. Half of these great Dao crystals will go to the protector. Next, if any venerable sovereigns who enter from this place are willing to exchange pointers and comprehend the great Dao, the protector will be allowed to listen and comprehend for free!""It's inevitable that illusions consume energy. Half of the great Dao crystals paid by the entrants will be used for energy circulation. If there's not enough, I'll pay for the remaining to maintain it!" Yes, Li Hao paid for it himself.After fusing with the primal Chaos energy, he was still able to maintain the illusion. "As for whether it can support strong people ... It's not a big problem for middle and low-level ones, and it's not impossible for high-level venerable sovereigns. However, the Guardians need to be strong enough and the base points are strong enough. Only a portion of them can be set up to enter. For example, three or five base points can be chosen as the place for high-level venerable sovereigns to enter ... Even a great world can participate in it. In this way, it can support high-level venerable sovereigns to enter!""As for the attack of the strong ... You can rest assured. I'm afraid I don't have enough energy to care about the safety of those below the high level. Ordinary people can't find out about the high level venerable sovereigns. Those who can find them are at the peak of the eighth level. Whether they attack or destroy, it's not something you can participate in. I'll take care of it!"Myriad transformations Emperor felt a little strange.In that case, other than recruiting people and being responsible for promoting, they didn't have to pay much?Li Hao continued,"in addition, I'll need you to construct the illusory areas. I'm not very good at this. I'll be responsible for the foundation. You need to construct the illusory areas on this Foundation and separate the spiritual bodies of experts to enter. Otherwise ... No matter how strong the illusory areas are, they can't accommodate countless venerable sovereigns!"It was necessary for the spirit to enter the communication. This was also for everyone's safety and to avoid the destruction of their physical bodies.However, Li Hao wasn't very familiar with the structure of this thing, so it might be a little troublesome. Even if he managed to make it, the effect would probably be very poor, and problems could easily arise. This person was an expert in this area!"Of course!"Myriad transformations Emperor nodded. This was something he should do.But ... He was still a little uneasy.""Fellow Daoist Hao Yue, according to what you've said, we don't seem to need to pay too much. Then ... Will fellow Daoist ... Set up ... Some ... Obstacles in this illusory realm?"In fact, it was to ask if there was any hidden hand that could destroy all the spiritual bodies of venerable sovereigns that entered at once. Although they would not die, it would still be a kind of harm to venerable sovereigns.He was even more worried that this person might have some means to control the venerable sovereigns that entered. He had to be careful!Li Hao smiled."Fellow Daoist myriad transformations, you're also an existence who constructed a Dao domain. Let me get straight to the point. It's to comprehend great DAOs, step into level nine, and become one with all DAOs!" I have no other intentions. Dao friend, you also know that a person's energy is limited. How can one quickly comprehend 10000 DAOs? now, I have a strong enemy. Long Zhan of the square region and reincarnation of the huntian region can't wait to kill and eat me ... So, I need to quickly comprehend the great Dao and step into level eight or even level nine!"Ninth-rank? Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ If he said level eight, Wan huazhen would believe it, but level nine ... Was that possible?He thought to himself, but he didn't say it out loud. At this moment, he was also thinking that Li Hao's conditions were really loose.However, he was still not at ease.

Chapter 3471 Heavenly Daoist Sect (1)
"Fellow Daoist Hao Yue ... I wonder if it's convenient for you to show me. You said that cultivators can't see me ..."I don't believe it!Li Hao smiled."Sure. There are myriad Dao pavilions nearby, and they were all constructed by you. You can choose a few, and I'll connect them. Then, you can see if they can be easily discovered. How about it?""Alright!"Myriad transformations Emperor didn't stand on ceremony. No matter how nice his words were, he might as well see it for himself and try it out!He wanted to see how this young man was going to connect with all the illusions.……Soon, the two of them floated out.Venerable Emperor Wanqiu quickly followed behind him. She was also curious.The nearest Alliance City was also very far away, far beyond the range of a major world. She wanted to see what method the Silver Moon King was using to connect with the Silver Moon King!And the method was unexpectedly simple.Li Hao floated in the air. In the river of the great Dao, an ethereal extent had yet to be completed. It was just a newly constructed ethereal extent that had been directly integrated into the previous myriad Dao Pavilion.A moment later, Li Hao led the two of them to the next myriad Dao Pavilion.He did not walk through the river of time.Instead, he flew into the air.Their speed was also very fast, but the distance was indeed very far. Even though they were seventh level venerable sovereigns, the three of them still walked for nearly a day before they arrived at the next Alliance City. Then, they used the same trick again, and another Ethereal Plane merged into the myriad Dao Pavilion. The myriad transformations Emperor could understand it and was slightly shocked. This person had fused the laws of the great Dao into a realm.However, he was also a little confused.And then?If the two were separated, could they really still be connected?Then ... Something shocking happened. Li Hao smiled and said,""Let's enter the myriad Dao Pavilion now. Our spiritual bodies will enter ... And try to teleport to the myriad Dao Pavilion in City 9 ... We only need an instant to arrive!"Myriad transformations Emperor did not believe him.However, he didn't mind giving it a try.Soon, the three of them merged with it in their spiritual bodies. Of course, they didn't completely merge with it. Once their spiritual bodies were destroyed, they would become vegetative people. Only a part of them had merged with it.The three of them soon appeared in an illusionary space. This was the myriad Dao Pavilion. It was constructed by the myriad transformations Emperor himself, so he was naturally familiar with it.At this moment, there were some changes in the myriad Dao Pavilion's illusory realm. A door appeared in the sky, and the door was somewhat illusionary. One could vaguely hear the sound of running water. "We can be teleported back through this door!"Li Hao's voice rang out as he laughed."It's too difficult if it's a physical body. The energy consumed for each teleportation is unbelievable!" However, it's only a spiritual body now, so the teleportation is much easier. Do you two want to try it together?""Alright!"Myriad transformations Emperor agreed readily, but he was also extremely curious.Soon, the three of them entered the door. In front of them was what seemed to be a large river, but upon closer inspection, it disappeared. After entering the door, it seemed to be dark. Li Hao's voice sounded again."Currently, there is only one myriad Dao Pavilion that is connected to it. That is the only place we can go to. When there are more in the future, we will have to construct different choices here ... For everyone to choose where to go! It's best to build a central place to gather people, and even more venerable sovereigns than you can imagine ... Of course, such a place needs a strong base, a strong base, and a strong illusionary realm of ten thousand DAOs. "As soon as he finished speaking, a light flashed.In reality, they were three spiritual bodies. As they flowed through the river of time, they borrowed the power of the chess game. In the blink of an eye, the three Shadows appeared in another place. It was the illusory realm of the myriad Dao Pavilion.Myriad transformations Emperor was the creator and naturally knew the difference between different myriad Dao pavilions.In an instant, he arrived at this place. He was stunned for a moment and felt somewhat incredulous.How was that possible?It was true! Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ Li Hao's voice rose again,'I borrowed some of the way of space and it's related to Dao chess! "Of course, for now, the spiritual body is still fine, but I'm afraid it won't work if it's a physical body. Or, each teleportation will consume tens of millions of great Dao crystals, which is not something ordinary venerable sovereigns can bear. Even high-level venerable sovereigns can't bear the repeated teleportation ...""However, the teleportation also consumes some energy. So, I think that the teleportation may require some fees to maintain the illusionary teleportation.""In addition, I still hope that when fellow Daoist constructs the myriad DAOs illusory realm, it's best to construct something more realistic. It's best if you can choose some worlds with iconic characteristics as templates to construct. This way, you can travel through the myriad worlds while at home!""Of course, you might have to pay a greater price, but it's much more comfortable than this monotonous illusory space ..."Li Hao began to make a suggestion. Myriad transformations Emperor's expression changed and he quickly said,""Let's go back first. I'll return to my physical body. Fellow Daoist Hao Yue, we can discuss this matter in detail!“At this moment, he no longer had any suspicions. When he was teleported back, he carefully observed and sensed.He knew that the teleportation must be a special technique, not just a spatial technique.However, he really didn't sense it.It was unbelievable!He even wondered if ... Li Hao's real body could be teleported. Did that mean that Li Hao could appear anywhere in the chaos at any time? that would be too terrifying!Of course, he suppressed this thought.It had nothing to do with him!Even if she had to worry, she shouldn't be the one worrying.

Chapter 3472 The Heavenly Daoist Sect (1)
What was the connection between all these?It was said that Li Hao was good at ... Time?Was time the key to this?He didn't know, but he knew that Li Hao wouldn't tell him about the core. Even if he did, he wouldn't dare to listen.……Not long after.The three of them returned to City 9 from another place.The myriad transformations Emperor's attitude was different from before. The three of them returned to the mansion and he quickly said,""Fellow Daoist, it's not a big problem for you to maintain the connection between the two locations ... But if there are more than a thousand locations, can you still do it? Also, fellow Daoist isn't inside ... Does it need to wait for fellow Daoist to appear, or is it free to activate?""I don't need to be in it!"Li Hao said. He had some thoughts, but he didn't say them.This matter might require the cooperation of Dao chess. Dao chess might need to be integrated into the river of Dao for a period of time to help maintain its operation. Otherwise, Li Hao wouldn't be able to afford the consumption without Dao chess.The river of time could flow, but the target was not clear and it was not easy to locate."So, fellow Daoist means ... Those who don't have money and are unwilling to teleport can stay in the small area of the myriad Dao Pavilion to exchange DAOs. Those who are willing to spend money can go to a core place and have a Dao discussion with a group of people?""Right!"Li Hao nodded."It's very inconvenient to travel in the chaos. Venerable sovereigns aren't strong, so they might not be able to arrive in decades or even centuries ... But in the illusion, it can happen in an instant!""This illusionary realm can even be used as an intelligence system!" Myriad transformations Emperor's expression changed.Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. He nodded."That's true ... But it's just a side effect. Whether you exchange information or not has nothing to do with me." p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Myriad transformations Emperor had a myriad of thoughts in his mind.It was very difficult to transmit information in the current chaos. Apart from top-notch experts, it was too difficult and troublesome for weaklings to find out about something.According to Li Hao, a spiritual body could be transported at will. Although a spiritual body was not a physical body, apart from having no combat power, what was the difference between a spiritual body and a physical body?If they stationed some venerable sovereigns long-term as the messengers of intelligence, the countless venerable sovereigns might not even leave their homes, but they could quickly know what was happening in countless distant places ...This would play a huge role in the exchange and development of the great Dao in the entire chaos.At this moment, he thought about many things. He even felt that this was not just a problem of an illusion. It was even related to the unification of the entire chaos! "I'll ask again ... Can spiritual bodies walk out of the illusion?" Zhao Feng asked.He asked,"what I mean is, for example, if I'm teleported to another place, can I walk out?" If the distance was too far, the spiritual body would actually collapse. Could it be maintained? It seems to be able to sustain itself in the illusion, but can it still be maintained when it comes out?"Li Hao shook his head."That won't do. I can't interfere with the outside world yet. I can only say that if we link the illusions, everyone will still be in my territory, and I can still cover them with my radiation. Once you go out, you'll only be defeated no matter how far you are unless you're strong enough."Myriad transformations Emperor heaved a sigh of relief.That's good!Otherwise, it would be a little scary.Of course, he couldn't say exactly how scary it was. It was good that there were restrictions now."It's not a big problem to construct 10000 illusions. I need some time and resources ... Of course, the middle world Alliance will provide them, and we'll solve them ourselves!""There's still one more question,"myriad transformations Emperor thought for a while and said," which base is the core?" There are too many illusions, and if everyone runs around, it won't be very effective. It's best if all of the other bases act as an entrance and gather everyone in the core area. Where do you think is the most suitable?"Which part was suitable?Li Hao pondered for a moment. The central area was the place where most people went and had the most roads of communication. It was actually a very good place.Li Hao didn't care. They were all in his River.The key was that whoever was in charge of this place might obtain the greatest benefits.He thought for a while and looked at myriad transformations Emperor. This person ... Seemed to be looking forward to it.Li Hao laughed!He understood what he meant."This, leave it to the middle world Alliance! The middle world Alliance doesn't seem to have a headquarters ... Of course, I don't have any objections. You can discuss among yourselves if you want to gather some of the Tier 6 worlds together and build a base in the central region! This way, the powerhouses in the nearby area can enter at any time, and it's right at the entrance of the house ... It might be more convenient. "The myriad transformations Emperor was delighted. He was worried that Li Hao would need to take charge, which would be inconvenient for them. At this moment, Li Hao actually took the initiative to give it up."Are there any specific restrictions on the cultivators who can enter?" venerable sovereign myriad transformations continued. Or is it that it must be a venerable sovereign ... In fact, non-venerable sovereigns with strong enough spiritual power can also enter ... And some strong people ... Even enemies ..."Li Hao said,"all of them can enter!" Not only that, I'll also set up some bases that are unguarded so that anyone can enter! It also gives the venerable sovereigns who don't want to show their faces a chance to enter. As for the enemies ..."Li Hao laughed,"then let's enter!" In a place where the great Dao was exchanged, whether it was an enemy or a friend, who didn't have any thoughts about the great Dao? This place is for exchanging DAOs, not for fighting. So what if we can destroy this illusion?"

Chapter 3473 The Heavenly Daoist Sect (1)
"Fellow Daoist, you're bold!"Myriad transformations Emperor sighed with emotion. Could anyone enter?It was really ... Extraordinary.There was no such place in the chaos. The current myriad Dao Pavilion had too many restrictions. In fact, it was just a pitifully small local area network. But now, Li Hao's greatest use was to expand these local area networks and connect them together to form a huge network that covered the East!This was a huge contribution and effect to the exchange of great DAOs in the entire chaos.In the future, if he could make it big ... It could be said that Li Hao could even leave a deep mark in the chaos.Just as the two sides were discussing, myriad transformations Emperor was in a difficult position ..."Fellow Daoist, do you have anything else to say?" Li Hao was puzzled.Myriad transformations Emperor remained silent for a while. Although he found it difficult to speak, he still said,""Then ... I'll be presumptuous and say something again. If fellow Daoist Hao Yue ...""Fallen ..."He was a little nervous. Li Hao laughed when he heard that."If I die, this illusion will naturally collapse ... Of course, it might not. If the great Dao exists, it will still exist. But if the great Dao is completely destroyed, there's nothing we can do about it! In a normal battle, there's no need to destroy this illusion. My River of great DAOs isn't the core of a battle. I'll just keep a part of the world formed by the laws of great DAOs and fuse the rest into the foundation point. It won't cause any disturbance. "Myriad transformations Emperor wanted to ask this too, but he was too embarrassed to do so. Now that he heard Li Hao's words, he immediately felt at ease.That's good!Of course, if Li Hao died, it would be gone. There was no other way."Then, fellow Daoist, do you have any requirements for this illusory realm? or should I say, give it a bright name? The myriad Dao Pavilion was just a name I casually came up with in the past ..."Li Hao smiled. After some thought, he said,"the myriad Dao Pavilion isn't bad. It's just that it's not just one place, but the entire chaos. Why don't we make it bigger and call it the heavenly Daoist field?"The heavenly Daoist sect?Did it sound good?Who cares!Myriad transformations Emperor didn't really care. He was just being polite. Since the other party wanted to name him that, he didn't care. Names were small matters."Then, how long do you need ..." He continued. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "It's not how long I need, but how long does fellow Daoist myriad transformations need to construct thousands of myriad DAOs illusionary realms? in addition, there's the problem of location selection ... As long as you solve these problems, I'll be able to do it anytime!"The myriad transformations Emperor calculated for a moment and quickly said,"" 30 years will do!"“……”Li Hao was stunned for a moment. He had never thought too much about it and thought that it would be over soon. But now, the other party had asked for 30 years. It seemed very, very fast. He was acting as if he could settle it in 30 years. Wasn't that fast?Li Hao was stunned by her attitude.30 years!You must be joking!Was it that slow?"It will take ... 30 years?" he asked.p Myriad transformations Emperor was stunned for a moment before nodding."That's right. If I were to construct 1000 myriad DAOs illusionary realm, it's already very fast to construct more than 30 in a year. On average, it would take me more than ten days to construct one. To me, it's like I don't sleep or rest ..."Was it very slow?There's something wrong with your attitude.Li Hao took a deep breath."I ... I don't think I'm 30 years old yet. Besides, will my enemies give me 30 years?"“……”At this moment, myriad transformations Emperor was stunned. He knew that Li Hao was young, but ... He was not even 30 years old yet?On the side, venerable Emperor Wanqiu was also shocked.All of a sudden, the myriad transformations Emperor was a little stumped. After a long while, he said,""But this is already the fastest speed! 10 days to construct an illusion might be the fastest I can do so far ..." We powerhouses of the seventh step, when did we count time by days?We've been doing it according to the hundred-year or thousand-year rule!I know you're young, so I signed up for 30 years. In fact, I just wanted to say that I'm so fast that I don't seem human!Good Lord, does this mean that ... It's too slow?Li Hao frowned."That's too long. 30 years. Even three years is too long. Three months is more like it ..."Myriad transformations Emperor was completely speechless.1000,100 days, 10 a day, do you think I'm a ninth-rank?Without this illusionary realm, it was impossible to rely on the ethereal extent. The ethereal extent could not separate the physical body and spiritual body of a venerable sovereign, nor could it completely hide his identity. This could only be achieved with the help of this illusionary realm.At this moment, Li Hao was also lost in thought.What to do?Myriad transformations Emperor's efficiency was frighteningly slow. He had not considered this before.He had always thought that it would be very soon ...Time acceleration?But ...Li Hao frowned slightly. It wasn't that it was impossible, but time acceleration was very taxing on him, even for someone at the peak of the seventh step.Just as he was thinking about this, myriad transformations Emperor gritted his teeth.""How about this, I'll be in charge of constructing the core of the illusory realm, but I can ask for help with the specific construction! The weaving of the illusion, the solidification of the illusion, the internal modification of the illusion ... All of these could be handed over to others! This way, the construction can be completed at the fastest speed, but there will be some trouble. The cultivators participating in the construction will be able to easily break the illusion ..."Hearing this, Li Hao's heart moved. He suddenly laughed and said,""How about this, whoever needs an entrance to the illusionary realm ... Will be in charge of building it! There are many worlds in the middle world Alliance and many venerable sovereigns. Whoever is willing to participate can do so. I don't care about this, what I want is to quickly build the entire platform. All of you can decide on this, how about it?"Myriad transformations Emperor pondered for a moment and nodded,""Yes! In this case, the speed will be faster. However, it will be difficult to complete it in three months ..."What was three months to chaos?It was about hurrying on the road!He had a headache. Li Hao thought for a moment and said,""I can ask Daoist Qi to cooperate with you. If the distance is too far, you can teleport ... But it will consume a lot of energy. I'm currently ... Short of money, so you may need to pay for it yourself ..."Myriad transformations Supreme Emperor was overjoyed. He wanted to say it too, but he was sorry, he was a rank eight Supreme Emperor!He was overjoyed when he heard that."With the cooperation of chess master Dao, we'll be much faster. It'll be easier for us to contact all parties!" If that's the case, we can send more people over. Three months ... There's still hope!"Li Hao also smiled. Three months? he wished he could have three days!Unfortunately, he also knew that this was impossible.Three months was the limit. If he shortened the time, myriad transformations would probably cry. Even the entire middle world Alliance might not be able to do it.At this moment, Li Hao's smile was brilliant,"then I hope we can cooperate happily!" "It's not just me. Fellow Daoists, you'll also have some gains, especially fellow Daoist. From what I see, if we succeed this time, perhaps we'll be able to reach rank 8 soon! I don't know exactly how to exchange DAOs, what benefits there are, or what price you have to pay. I'll have to trouble you with these things!""It's what I should do!"Myriad transformations Emperor was in a good mood and he had thrown all the threats to the back of his mind!Who cares!What reincarnation? he had really entered rank eight, so why would he care about this?For those venerable sovereigns, they didn't care who was in charge if they could make progress.What did it have to do with them?No matter who was the Overlord, it would not affect the fact that they were the weak.The two sides quickly reached an agreement. Myriad transformations Emperor did not stay for long, as there were still many things to be done. Li Hao also asked Dao Qi to accompany him. As for whether it was dangerous, Li Hao asked the venerable emperors who went out to carry an Ethereal Plane with them. It was a way to contact them and also to locate them at any time. They could arrive directly through the river of time!At this moment, Li Hao began to plan his own heavenly Daoist Rite. He was too lazy to care about everything in the chaos.Since there's no place to exchange great DAOs in the chaos, I'll build it myself.

Chapter 3474 Daoist Master (1)
Chaotic Eastern Region.Countless worlds were scattered across the primordial chaos.The Eastern Region, which had been quiet for many years, was in constant turmoil these days. Rank eight worlds disappeared one after another, the Samsara Overlord fled in defeat, and the experts from the square region came out, displaying the aura of an Overlord. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  In recent days, neo martial artists had begun to show up and wander around the eighth heaven, making the extreme Ice realm tremble with fear.Now, there were 11 level 8 great worlds left and 15 level 8 venerable sovereigns, which was terrifying. There were only four level 8 Supreme sovereigns in neo martial, but it made the 11 major world alliances tremble in fear.On the Alliance's side, the Alliance's time was too short and everyone had their own ideas. Moreover, the world was fixed and it was difficult to move.Instead, he was extremely afraid of the wandering power of neo martial.In addition, the three overlords had their own plans and some of the rank eight worlds had mysterious visitors, making this Alliance even more fragile.At this moment, no one seemed to care about the lower six heavens.As for the lower six heavens, there had been some fluctuations recently.……Far away in the East.It was a small world, a place that had almost been forgotten.,m There was only one venerable sovereign in the entire world, and he was only a first-level low-level venerable sovereign. He did not dare to leave the world at all, and his understanding of the chaos was extremely limited, just like Silvermoon in the past.But today, it was chaos.The master of the small world sensed the fluctuations outside the chaos and quickly emerged with a solemn expression.There were also many Heavenly Kings around, and all of them were extremely solemn.It was not easy for small worlds to survive in the chaos. They were most afraid of experts passing by. It would be fine if they were just passing by, but what they feared was ... They were here to devour the world. To these small worlds, this was too terrifying!Soon, chaos rippled.A fourth stage venerable sovereign appeared.Looking into the distance and comparing it to the map, he also let out a breath. They had finally arrived. This was the eastern border. If they continued forward, they would have to cross the East and enter the no man's land.The fourth level venerable sovereign saw the fear in the other party's eyes and his voice reverberated in the chaos.""I Am the Messenger of the heavenly Daoist sect, rain demon! Was it xihuan realm in front? Are you the XI Huan Thearch?"In the small realm, the xihuan Thearch's face was grave as he felt the other party's terrifying aura.As for the so-called heavenly Daoist Rite, he knew nothing about it and was slightly confused.He knew about the middle world Alliance, some of the top upper three heavens worlds, and the names of some overlords. However, he really didn't know what this so-called heavenly Daoist Rite was.Of course, he knew that he could not afford to offend them."This junior is xihuan ..."The XI Huan Thearch hurriedly replied.The rank four sovereign rain demon heaved a sigh of relief, his voice reverberating,""I've received orders from the Daoist Masters of the middle world Alliance to come to xihuan and present the secret realm of the heavens!" The Thearch of Xi Huan was puzzled. What?It was fine as long as it was not an invasion.Aware of the other party's fear, the rain demon Thearch continued,""In recent days, the East has been in turmoil. Xihuan is at the edge of the East and may not know. The middle world Alliance, the 987 families, and other worlds have joined forces with the Dao Lords of the heavens to create the heavenly Daoist Rite. They spread throughout the eastern chaos and built the heavenly Dao domain with their monstrous power ..."At this point, the fourth stage venerable sovereign was filled with pride, envy, and admiration ...The heavenly Daoist sect had officially spread in the middle world Alliance three months ago.And now, he had already started to set up many bases.He was also a member of the middle world Alliance, but now, he preferred to say that he was the emissary of the heavenly Daoist sect to the outside world, as he felt more respected!Who was the Dao Lord of the heavens?He actually didn't know!Yes, he did not know.He only knew that the myriad transformations Emperor and the others in the Alliance were only assistants. One could imagine how terrifying this Dao Lord of the heavens was.Moreover, it was spread all over the East. One could imagine how terrifying it was.In fact, he had some guesses.That was because it was said that a top-notch existence would be teleported over at any time after the positioning was done ... It might be the legendary eighth-grade existence, the Dao chess!Of course, he had never seen it before. Perhaps he would be able to see it this time.The Thearch of Xi Huan listened carefully and didn't dare to miss a single word. After a long time, his face was filled with shock and disbelief. He felt that this person was joking.He entered the secret realm of the heavens with his spiritual body.Through the East, they could teleport at any time and enter the core of the heavenly Daoist sects, where tens of millions of venerable sovereigns would discuss the Dao!No matter how strong or weak the great Dao was, it had its own unique points and insights. If the Dao discussion was good, there would be a lot of benefits. If the Dao discussion was bad, one could listen to others 'discussions. There might even be high-level venerable sovereigns who could teach and dispel doubts!Was that even possible?I'm just a first level venerable sovereign ... Why would a high level venerable sovereign care about a low level venerable sovereign's Dao discussion?Would he dispel the doubts of a low level venerable sovereign?No one who had ever lived in the primordial chaos believed in anyone. Were there any good people in the primordial chaos?He didn't dare to believe it!Yu mo obviously knew what he was thinking.""Fellow Daoist, there's no need to worry! To put it bluntly ... You're only a first level venerable sovereign. If you really want to scheme, do you think you can stop me?"He smiled and said,'this is a great achievement for all the realms in the chaos! We can contact all the worlds and hold discussions hand in hand. We can hide our identities and communicate with our spiritual bodies. The safety and range are beyond imagination!""I'm here to ask for your opinion on a matter. This place is at the eastern border. Is fellow Daoist willing to set up an entrance to a secret realm here? In fact, fellow Daoist can even personally oversee it! If you're willing, I can invite a level eight venerable sovereign to set up the formation ..."

Chapter 3475 Daoist Master (2)
The Thearch of Xi Huan was extremely shocked. What?Level eight venerable sovereign?I can arrange an entrance to a secret realm here?This ... Was this true?According to the rain demon, with the entrance to the secret realm, there was no need to go to other places. They could enter at any time on their own.Level eight ... An unbelievable powerhouse!Was there really a level 8 coming?He was only a rank One World. Just as the rain demon had said, even the middle-stage venerable sovereign in front of him was an existence that he could not contend with, let alone a rank eight world. It was far from enough even if he had a small world!The Heavenly King powerhouses beside him were also thirsty.In the secret realm of the heavenly Daoist sect.Countless venerable sovereigns were discussing Dao!Teleporting to various places in the primordial chaos, arriving with his spirit, and listening to the Dao discussions of the celestial emperors ...Could he really do that?According to the other party, it was only open to venerable sovereigns. However, if the spirit of those below venerable sovereigns was strong enough, or if there was an entrance to the secret realm in the local area, if there were venerable sovereigns coming from the nearby area, those below venerable sovereigns could enter the secret realm to listen without being teleported. Was this ... Possible?The xihuan Thearch's mouth was also dry."Senior rain demon, why ... Why did you choose our xihuan realm as one of the entrances to the secret realm? According to what senior said, there are only 1000 entrances this time ... This ..."Didn't everyone know how to snatch it?There were nearly a thousand medium worlds in the middle world Alliance!Would it be his turn?The rain demon was a little helpless and envious.""First of all, xihuan is located at the borders of the world, and there are very few worlds here! "Second, the Daoist Masters of the heavens have said that each level of heaven has its own quota and can not be concentrated in one place. The medium worlds are all above the fourth heaven, and very few people are willing to move to another world ... Third, this is an order from above, and we can only follow it! I would like to have one ... But unfortunately, I don't have the right. I'm a venerable sovereign of the rain World, and there's an entrance to the rain World. Unfortunately, I'm not the master of the world ... I don't have the right to distribute it. "The xihuan Supreme Emperor was both surprised and happy. He was surprised that he was not qualified to be a rank four Supreme Emperor, but happy that he was.However, he was also extremely nervous.I'm only a rank one!He was too weak.As for the rain demon sovereign, he was slightly impatient."Fellow Daoist, to be honest, even if you don't agree, there are plenty of people who will agree. I'm just too lazy to go to other worlds!" The chaos was too far away! "If fellow Daoist agrees, I'll immediately locate it and make arrangements for a rank eight venerable sovereign to come and personally deliver the secret realm ... I'm not carrying this with me! A rank eight venerable sovereign has arrived. Without a rank eight venerable sovereign, we will waste our time for a rank One World!"In other words, what are you afraid of?If a rank eight venerable sovereign really doesn't care about your rank One World, I don't care either!I gave you a chance, but you still hesitated.He didn't know what was good for him!There were thousands of such worlds, and he was not even qualified to be schemed against.If he wanted to scheme, he would scheme against the great worlds. Even the medium worlds were not worthy. The Thearch of xihuan also thought quickly and soon agreed with this point. I'm too weak, so weak that I can't do anything to this man who attacked the xihuan realm.He nodded immediately."Thank you for your advice, senior. I'm not hesitating. I just can't believe that such a good thing would happen in our xihuan realm ...""So you agree?""Of course!"The Thearch of Xi Huan nodded hurriedly. What was the use of not agreeing?If he were to really reject and offend this person, the danger would be right in front of him. On the other hand, if he were to agree, even if there was trouble, the danger would be in the future. He really had no choice!This was not a multiple choice question, but a question with only one answer.The rain demon also laughed. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Alright, I'll set the location now and invite the powerful seniors to descend ... Daoist xihuan, don't be rude later!"The Thearch of Xi Huan was extremely nervous. He didn't say anything and quickly left the realm and entered the chaos. He didn't dare to stay in the realm any longer. Even though it was dangerous to enter the chaos, there was nothing he could do.Was there really an eighth level venerable sovereign?Who knows?As for the rain demon sovereign, he didn't say much. In truth, this was his first time trying to do something like this. Previously, it had always been the other sovereigns who had summoned him, and it was said that they would arrive very quickly ... And thus, he was very curious.Soon, a chessboard-like object appeared in his hand.It was quickly ignited!A weak flame spread out, and a fluctuation began to spread.He waited uneasily.As for the xihuan Thearch, he lowered his head nervously.Chaos fell silent for a moment.Gradually, all of a sudden, the two venerable sovereigns were startled and hurriedly looked into the distance. From a distant place, there seemed to be a fluctuation spreading over. In just an instant, the fluctuation approached them.The next moment, a young man appeared. His eyes were deep and his aura was powerful ... So powerful that they couldn't feel anything at all. They only felt that it was as vast as the chaos!As soon as that person appeared, they seemed to suffocate, as if they had fallen into another space."Is this the location of secret realm No. 687?" the voice sounded in their ears.The rain demon suddenly realized something and was extremely nervous. He hurriedly raised his head and said,"replying to senior ... Yes ... This place is where the xihuan realm is located. It is at the eastern edge and close to the southern region ..."After saying that, he looked at the other party carefully.When he saw it, he was shocked.Although the other party did not have an overbearing aura, he felt that the other party's eyes were like stars, vast and boundless, just like the brilliance of ten thousand stars. Just one look ... And he seemed to have lost himself.Was this the power of a top-tier venerable sovereign?Advanced venerable sovereigns were not rare for Li Hao and his group, but when they thought back to the time when Silver Moon had walked out, an advanced venerable sovereign had been so terrifying and mysterious.

Chapter 3476 Daoist Master (3)
He couldn't look at it directly!The current Dao chess had even entered the eighth rank.Yes, it was a chess piece.These days, he had been constantly on the move and was extremely tired. Of course, the results were good.Today, he had built close to 700 base points.As venerable sovereign myriad transformations and the others were busy, so was the entire middle world Alliance. A large number of venerable sovereigns were creating the myriad DAOs illusory realm, while the Dao chess pieces were responsible for transporting in all directions."You are xihuan?"Dao Qi said.The xihuan Thearch didn't dare to raise his head. He didn't see the other party's face, and he didn't dare to look. To a first level venerable sovereign, an eighth level venerable sovereign was a rare sight to see in ten thousand years!,m The difference was unbelievable!"Senior, junior is xihuan ...""You're willing to open the entrance to the secret realm in the Xian world?"Dao Qi asked,'if a venerable sovereign wants to enter the nearby area, you must allow him to enter! Of course, if the secret realm merged with your realm, and a venerable sovereign attacked, the heavenly Daoist temple would come to help instantly ... If it was destroyed instantly, there would be no way out. There were advantages and disadvantages! If it's hard for you to guard and control it with your Grade 1 power ... Do you know about this?""Junior understands!""Senior rain demon," xihuan quickly replied,"I've been informed of everything. ""That's good. The heavenly Daoist sects are both willing parties! I won't force you!"Dao Qi nodded slightly."There will be 1000 entrances to the training hall. The number will not increase for the time being. This place is number 687. You will be the guard of the secret realm entrance of training hall 687!"After saying that, he looked into the distance and frowned slightly,""This place is very close to the South, which is the territory of the spring and autumn Emperor. If any Southern venerable Emperor comes and wants to enter the secret realm, they can enter without any obstruction! The chaos is vast and there are countless venerable sovereigns. The Daoist sects of the heavens aim to communicate. Even if they are enemies, they can communicate. Besides ... The spring and autumn venerable Emperor may not be an enemy ..." please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  He said a few more words, which was also Li Hao's intention.He would inform every single Guardian."In addition, you are not allowed to stop those who are interested in the Dao discussion. If you discover that a guard is using his identity as a guard to stop a cultivator from discussing the Dao, you will be severely punished! As The Guardian, you have several conveniences. You can enter the secret realm for free. Every year, you can be teleported to the heavenly Daoist sect for free once, the true core area! The others will collect a certain amount of Dao crystals to maintain the operation of the Daoist Rite temple!""The people of your realm can enter the entrance of the secret realm for free. Of course, if there is no Dao discussion between the venerable sovereigns, it is useless to enter! If there are, you can enter for free ...""In addition, you can't move the world for no reason. It's easy to break the connection with the core Daoist Rite.""Little fellow Daoist, do you understand this?"The Thearch of Xi Huan heard every word. He said hurriedly,""Understood!""Mm, that's good! By the way ... If a venerable sovereign enters your entrance, you'll get some benefits too. You need to pay a Dao crystal to enter, and half of it will be given to The Guardian ..."The XI Huan Thearch took a deep breath. This ... They could still split the money?"Senior, I ..." "No need for words!"Dao Qi said calmly,"the location of the entrance has its advantages and disadvantages. If the enemy causes trouble, they will definitely attack the entrance of the mystic realm first. Therefore, these 1000 entrances are both opportunities and dangers!" Even though it wouldn't be a big deal if all the entrances were destroyed, it's still a threat to the world where the mystic realm is located. Therefore, you deserve to take half of the fees! "In addition, if no one enters, there will be no benefits. This is also to have all the guards go nearby to recruit people!""We are only providing a platform for communication in the heavenly Daoist sect. It would be a waste if no one is willing to enter. Therefore, the Daoist master has ordered us to give all the benefits to others ..."The XI Huan Thearch was shocked!He had thought that this person was the Dao Lord of the various heavens, but in the end ... Wasn't he?He was extremely shocked.An eighth grade venerable sovereign was not the Daoist master of the heavenly Daoist sect?It was too unbelievable!On the side, the rain demon was also envious. Of course, he was not surprised by the words of Dao chess. Who was the Daoist master of the heavenly Daoist sect?There was a slight guess about the middle world Alliance.The Silver Moon King!It was venerable Emperor Hao Yue!Of course, whether it was true or not, it was hard to confirm.If so ... There was more than one level eight venerable sovereign. Dao Qi, the Thunder Emperor, and Wu Shan were all venerable sovereigns. Now, their names had spread all over the East. In addition, they were one with neo martial, so this force was extremely terrifying.With so many eighth level venerable sovereigns, they were no weaker than the five elements Overlord, the spring and autumn Overlord, or perhaps only a little weaker than the chaos heavens Overlord in the West. After all, the Samsara realms had been destroyed, and the Samsara venerable Emperor had to run away in panic.Dao Qi said no more.At this moment, he looked at the realm not far away.A first order world was very weak.He muttered in his heart. To this first stage venerable sovereign, this was actually an opportunity.To build a secret realm, two things needed to be integrated.First, Li Hao's little realm.Second, myriad transformations Emperor's myriad DAOs illusionary realm.Li Hao's little world was not filled to the brim yet, but it was still an improvement for a rank One World. In addition, the myriad DAOs illusory realm was beneficial for the upgrade of the realm.Li Hao's little realm was still continuously absorbing chaotic force. It was constantly improving, and it could also speed up the speed at which the entire world absorbed chaotic force.For high-level worlds and medium-level worlds, the improvement was not obvious, but for small worlds, the improvement was quite obvious.Dao Qi didn't say anything more and quickly waved his hand.

Chapter 3477 Daoist Master (3)
First, Li Hao's little realm merged with the nearby Xhuan world. The entire world began to absorb the chaotic force around it at a visible speed.In the next moment, an illusionary realm appeared. It was like a star that suddenly fell into the world like the sun.Before the Thearch of Xi Huan could react, the world shook. Suddenly, the entire world seemed to be enveloped by an illusion. The world, the ethereal Plane, and the DAOs of the illusory realm merged into one in the blink of an eye.The chess piece waved its hand again. A moment later, a door near the world gate opened.On the gate, it was written to look down on the heavenly Daoist sect!There was a small number below it: mystical realm No. 687, Xuanji mystical realm!"My young friend, xihuan!"The Thearch of Xi Huan was extremely frightened at the moment. He answered subconsciously,""This junior is here!""You're the master of the secret land, and I'll connect you to the entrance. You can open the entrance at will! For the next few days, if anyone wants to enter and pays enough fees, you can take half, and the other half can be used to merge into the secret realm!""In addition, after a month, you can teleport to the core area of the heavenly Daoist sect to look down on the myriad world Daoist sect for free!""When the time comes, the Dao master will appear to preach, give advice, or something else ... He will also have some words to say to all of you. I hope that fellow Daoists can attend on time!"The Thearch of Xi Huan was shocked again. Go see the Daoist master?The Dao Lord of the heavens!This ... Was a good thing. "I will be there in time!" He promised hurriedly, not daring to say more.He didn't dare to delay meeting a high-level venerable sovereign. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  At this moment, when he looked back at the other portal near the realm gate, he was a little confused. Could this portal ... Really lead to anywhere?Was it really possible?Although it was still a little unbelievable, at this moment, there was no doubt that this was the work of a group of top venerable sovereigns.The next moment, Dao Qi raised his eyebrows slightly."The location of secret realm No. 688 has been confirmed. I'm leaving now. Rain demon, are you staying or leaving? I can take you along. We're going to the northern region ... I can drop you off halfway."The rain demon Thearch was both surprised and delighted. This ... Would this work?"Senior, I ...""Are you leaving or staying?""Let's go!" The rain demon Thearch hurriedly nodded. Teleportation! Teleportation through the primordial chaos!It was his first time trying it, so of course he had to try it. Moreover, he was doing it with a level eight venerable sovereign!He couldn't wait. Even if he didn't want to go north, he had to go!Dao Qi waved his hand. In an instant, he brought the rain demon into a passage at an extremely fast speed. He did not only rely on teleportation. Although he knew spatial teleportation, it consumed a lot of energy each time. At this moment, he was also relying on the constructed river of time and spatial teleportation to travel in the chaos.In just a moment, while the rain demon was still a little shocked and didn't know what was going on, the chess piece threw him down instantly.""This place is very close to the entrance of Mystery Land No. 312. The world you're going to is not far from here. I'll leave first!"As soon as he finished speaking, the chess piece disappeared.The next moment, the sky and earth started to spin. The rain demon landed and saw a world not far away. At that moment, his face turned pale with shock.In an instant!He was familiar with this place. If he were to fly by himself, even with the power of a fourth stage venerable sovereign, he would need to fly for at least a month. It was unbelievable and unimaginable!This ... This was an eighth level venerable sovereign?However, even a level eight venerable sovereign couldn't do this. Perhaps only this person could.It was too terrifying!At this moment, a venerable sovereign flew out from a distant world. He saw the rain demon and sensed the faint movement just now. He had sensed it before and knew what was going on. He flew over quickly and said enviously,""Fellow Daoist rain demon ... Was he teleported here by a senior?"The rain demon was still in shock. At this moment, he quickly recovered and said with a reserved face,""It's all thanks to senior's guidance. I've just gone to the xihuan realm. It's too far away, so senior teleported me here after seeing that I'm tired from the journey ... Entrance No. 687 has been set up in the heavenly Daoist Rite. Recently, senior has been working on it. Many places were too far away before, so many emissaries are on their way. A large number of people have arrived at the designated locations and will be completed soon ..."His expression was one of 'I know a lot' and 'I'm the emissary of the heavenly Daoist sect'. This made the fourth stage venerable sovereign speechless. He smiled and said,"fellow Daoist rain demon, you're lucky. I'm not as lucky as you are. I can only participate in The Guardian meeting in a month ... By the way, fellow Daoist rain demon, you're not The Guardian of the Daoist sect, right?"“……”The rain demon Thearch cursed in his heart!She was really ... Specially here to prick his heart.He forced a smile."No, but ... It's said that the Daoist master is kind. Perhaps ... Seeing my sincerity and seeing that all the envoys are working hard, he might specially invite us to attend the meeting ..."After saying that, he suddenly sighed with emotion. He didn't want to brag too much, but only a little sighed,""Daoist Liangyuan, in the countless years of chaos, when has there ever been such a Golden Age? Even a million years ago, when Grade 9 cultivators dominated the world, there had never been a gathering of ten thousand emperors to discuss the Dao in the heavens! Build the heavenly Daoist Rite, open the entrance to the thousand realms, enter and exit at will, gather spirit, no need to expose the original body, no need to rush, no need to pay too much ... It is said that this time, the Daoist master may personally preach ..."At this point, the rain demon Thearch was truly filled with admiration and envy.There were many Almighties, but no matter how strong the Almighties were, what did it have to do with them?However, this Dao Lord of the heavens had preached to the heavens, allowing the heavenly emperors to arrive at a place in an instant and discuss the Dao with each other. It could be said that he had changed the entire chaos. Although it hadn't officially started yet, rain demon seemed to have seen the prosperity of the heavens!

Chapter 3478 Daoist Master (1)
Venerable Emperor Hao Yue?If he ... It was said that he was extremely young, but he was willing to do so, no matter what his purpose was, whether it was to spy on the heavenly Dao or not, so what?Can your Dao be compared to his?As long as he did not devour the heavenly planes, so what?In fact, they were all venerable sovereigns and were not that stupid. The other party might not have come all the way here to give them benefits, but was it important?Not important!​ The important thing was that if they succeeded, the situation in the chaos would change drastically!On the side, Emperor Liangyuan nodded. Suddenly, he was a little worried. "I'm just afraid that someone will cause trouble, and I don't want to see this Golden Age come! We don't care about the fight between the strong and the Overlord. Whoever becomes the Overlord is fine ... However, perhaps only the Daoist master can set up this heavenly Daoist sect. If someone really causes trouble ...""It's a pity that I'm only a Tier 4 martial artist. Otherwise, I'll definitely tear anyone who dares to cause trouble to pieces!""Someone dares to cause trouble?" the rain demon was shocked.Was that even possible?On the side of the heavenly Dao Lords, there were quite a few grade-8 ones."It's hard to say!""Fellow Daoist," sovereign Liangyuan said in a deep voice,"you also know the benefits. You also know that this sermon to the East may be to perfect the Daoist master's great Dao. Do you think anyone would want to see this?" There are too many people who know about the Daoist sect of the heavens, and it's impossible to hide it. Even if we hide it, we can't let the ten thousand emperors gather. Even some of the secret realms are guarded by people from other overlords. When the time comes ... Some enemies or experts who don't want to see the Dao master advance will come to interfere ..."The rain demon instantly understood, and his expression became extremely grave!At this moment, he was a little worried and angry.""Although it hasn't officially started yet, you and I can imagine that if it's fair and just, and their identities can be completely hidden, everyone is actually willing to exchange Tao techniques ... And even listen to the teachings of a high-level venerable sovereign! It's normal for some people to be jealous, but it's a pity that we can't do it ...""I hope Dao master can deal with this!"He was a little worried, but then he thought of the broken reincarnation and suddenly said,""If there's someone causing trouble ... Will the original one from our East ... Come back to cause trouble? The other realms have dominated the East for many years and have many vassals in the middle world Alliance ..."Emperor Liangyuan nodded. The possibility was very high. At this moment, he could only transmit a message."Sigh, let's wait and see. We can't solve these problems. We can only look to that person and senior myriad transformations to see if they can solve it. Our middle world Alliance also has several seventh rank venerable sovereigns. This time, it's said that ... It's a good opportunity for senior myriad transformations and the others to advance!"Whoever came to cause trouble would be going against this group of people!But now, Li Hao and these people shared the same interests.As for reincarnation, it had long been forgotten.You've become the boss, but you've only increased the pressure. What have you done to the middle-level worlds?There was nothing.Only oppression!Who would be willing to let such a person rule the East?Everyone was even afraid of new martial, but they were only afraid. They did not care if new martial would be able to unify the East. They only wanted to know if new martial would come into conflict with Silver Moon if they did.It was said that the Silver Moon King came from a world affiliated with neo martial, but now, this person had built a great Dao platform all over the East. If it were him, perhaps ... He would also be afraid? It was said that the neo martial human King was extremely narrow-minded. Would he be afraid of this and scheme against the Silver Moon King?……The construction of the heavenly Daoist sect was in full swing.It was going smoothly!At present, no one had caused any trouble. Even if the news was not hidden, it was impossible to hide it. The purpose of the Daoist Rite temple was to recruit the chaos Thearch. If it was hidden ... What was the point?Therefore, those who were well-informed, even the powerhouses of the other three forces, should know.He could even guess that it was related to Li Hao. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Dao chess directly revealed itself and continuously set up secret realms. How could it be hidden from others?……Alliance City nine.The others were all busy, except for Li Hao, who didn't run around. Other than providing a part of the ethereal extent, he didn't do anything else. At this moment, he was still filling up his little world.He knew that this time, he might attract some trouble.Anyone with eyes would know what his purpose was.Ten thousand emperors gathered to discuss the Dao!Other than gathering and comprehending the Dao, what else could he do?Li Hao didn't have any enmity with the other three parties, but huntian had taken Samsara in. This was enmity.The spring Autumn Emperor and the five elements overlords might not be willing to see the rise of powerhouses in the East.In the four-sided region, long Zhan might also be eyeing covetously.Could it allow Li Hao to smoothly complete the construction of the heavenly Daoist sect?"Even if I did it for you ... Perhaps, I'm waiting for the day you officially start your business. By then, all your hard work will be wasted.There might even be a top-notch expert who could detect some fluctuations in the river of time, find Li Hao, and kill him in front of everyone. Everything was possible.To them, the existence of the heavenly Daoist sect was a threat.Not only Li Hao, but this kind of preaching was actually not friendly to some overlords. After seeing it too many times, it was easy for them to be disloyal. If the venerable sovereigns from their side also entered the heavenly Daoist sect, would they still acknowledge their rule?In the Alliance City.Waves of chaotic energy surged into the river of Dao and into the small worlds.It was actually very fast!Today, Li Hao had filled 1200 little worlds. It had only been three months since he last fused with the Dao of chaos, but Li Hao had already filled many worlds.

Chapter 3479 Daoist Master (6)
He filled one every two to three days. Previously, he had filled quite a number of Dao integration Primal Chaos runes. In total, he had filled 200 runes.It would be very, very fast!However, 1200 world power was equivalent to 2400 non-realm Dao laws. Even if it was doubled, it would only be close to 2000 Dao law power.With this kind of strength, he might be able to fight with Wu Shan and the others, but there was no hope of dealing with a powerful grade 8.At this moment, there was no one around.Suddenly, not far away, second cat, who had been staying behind, twitched his ears and said,""Someone's coming!"Li Hao opened his eyes.A moment later, a voice rang out,"senior Hao Yue ...""Come in!"A moment later, apotheosis Emperor Wanrong quickly entered the area with an uneasy look on her face. She said carefully,""Senior Hao Yue, as of now, the heavenly Daoist sect has already built 700 secret realms. Although they won't be completed in three months, they'll be completed in a month at most!""Senior myriad incarnations, he asked me ... Asked me to pass on a message to you. One month later, on the day of the gathering of the ten thousand emperors, there might be some changes. The six rank seven elders of our middle world Alliance, including me, are willing to help ..."However, she still felt uneasy.Recently, the commotion had been a Little Big, but there had been no reaction from all sides. The more this was the case, the more inappropriate it was!Although the middle world Alliance was only a middle-tier World Alliance, there were still rank seven venerable sovereigns. Including her, who had just advanced, there were a total of six of them. In fact, it was not a small number.Such strength was not much weaker than an Ordinary Level 8 world.However, it was impossible to rely on a few Grade 7 experts to settle such a huge matter!Celestial Emperor Wanrong was a little uneasy, but she still said,""Senior myriad incarnations 'meaning is ... To let me ... To ask you, on that day, can neo martial ... Can you come and hold the fort?"Today, they still hoped that neo martial would also participate.He wanted to let them see if there were any cracks between the two sides."Did you receive any news?"Li Hao asked.Thearch Wanrong hesitated for a moment before saying,""It's said that the Samsara Empyrean and the Peng Cheng Empyrean didn't return to the chaos heaven realm. They ... They went to the North and the South. They met the five elements Overlord and the spring Autumn Empyrean ... Maybe ..."Perhaps they were afraid of this side, or perhaps they hoped to suppress the threat from the East before it was united! In short, venerable Emperor Wanqiu was worried that something would go wrong during the gathering of the ten thousand emperors in a month.If there was a problem, even if Li Hao didn't die, it would be troublesome if his safety wasn't guaranteed, and some of the Masters of the arcane realm might even be killed. It would be a serious threat to everyone, and no one would dare to join!He didn't even need to deal with Li Hao, as he could kill all the Masters of the arcane realms!If you don't have an entrance, how are you going to enter?Would anyone still dare to open a Mystic realm?"You're worried that the three parties will join forces to deal with us first?" Li Hao said calmly."Are you worried?""Right!"Thearch Wanqiu nodded."I'm worried about that. The other elders ... Share the same concern. Of course, everyone knows that this is a good thing, but we're only a medium-sized World Alliance."If it was an advanced World Alliance, then he would not be afraid!She continued,"also, the other realms of Extreme Ice have been waiting. Perhaps ... They are colluding with the outside world. Perhaps ... They will attack on that day!" We can't even guarantee that some of them are guarding the secret realm. If they destroy the secret realm and cause the entrance to disappear, the spiritual bodies of countless venerable sovereigns will be severely injured. Although it's not fatal, it will have a huge impact on our credibility!"Previously, no one had thought of making it so big. Now that it had been made so big, once the credibility of this place of exchange was lost, it would be very dangerous to enter. Many venerable sovereigns would give up on this idea.If no one comes, what's the use of building it well? Li Hao was still calm."This is my land of Dao validation. It concerns my future and my path to level eight or even level nine. Although I don't want to provoke strong enemies, if anyone interferes with me at this time and destroys my future ... I will definitely fight back! Pay back a thousand times! Fellow Daoist, don't worry ... The myriad world dojo will be set up in Alliance City number nine. If fellow Daoist myriad transformations and the others are worried about danger, there's no need to come! If you're willing to help me, then come in person. If someone attacks, I'm afraid I'll need your help ..."Whether they came or not, it was their own choice.Li Hao didn't say much."Of course we hope everything goes well," Thearch Wanqiu said hurriedly."I'll definitely stay, but ... I'll consult the others.""Alright," he said.Li Hao didn't say anything more. Seeing that Li Hao knew about this, Emperor Wanqiu also didn't say anything more.
