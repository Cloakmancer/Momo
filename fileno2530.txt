If the connection was cut off, that world would not even be considered a small world.Why are you looking for that place!Neo martial wouldn't be interested in this kind of broken place, and so would Crimson Moon. A place that didn't even count as devouring a small world ... Was meaningless!In that place, even venerable sovereigns were hard to be born.It was not worth it to spend time and resources to find it. Now, they could even encounter a new martial human King at any time ...Alright, this 'anytime'... It's been so many years, but I haven't encountered it.He was also helpless!After waiting for so many years, they didn't come and didn't find them. They went to look for new martial, but now they couldn't find them. They had seen a ghost.Sometimes, others wanted to say "forget it"... There were many chaotic worlds, so they didn't have to keep an eye on neo martial. However, it wasn't like red Moon would give up just like that. Neo martial was stirring up all parties under the name of settling scores with Red Moon.Now that Red Moon had backed out ... It was confirmed that they had joined forces with neo martial to invade other worlds.Red Moon master thought for a while and said,"it's still necessary. Although the bone erosion is weak and has broken its connection with the great Dao of the red moon, it was still a venerable sovereign. However, it died in the Silver Moon world. There was a faint feeling of Thunder. It could be ... Chaotic Thunder!""As for the chaos lightning, it's not common. It's either a peerless treasure that appears or it interferes with The Order of Chaos. For example, the neo martial human King, who casually reversed life and death and resurrected those who died in battle, attracted the chaos lightning ... This Silver Moon can't be considered a world, so how did the eroding bones attract the chaos lightning?""Therefore, some unforeseen events might have occurred in the Silver Moon. Perhaps a peerless treasure, a heaven-defying person, a great Dao universe, or a world advancement ..."He made a guess and said,"Silver Moon originated from new martial arts, and they are of the same breath and branch. If you want to completely destroy new martial, even silver Moon has to be destroyed!" Besides, the death of a venerable sovereign is a provocation to me ... If the connection hasn't been completely cut off, I can reverse the world, kill my way into the yin-yang world, and force the king to return!"Everyone had thought that it was unnecessary, but when they heard about the chaos lightning tribulation, some of them began to think.Although it was not even a small world, it originated from neo martial arts.If another treasure appeared ... It would definitely not be simple.The yin-yang world was not a weak world.Reversing life and death was an ability that many great worlds did not have. The neo martial human King had brute force and did not study much about the great Dao, but he had mastered the world and thus mastered the method of reversing life and death ... It was an extremely high level.Perhaps Silver Moon had also inherited a part or two of it."My King, I'm willing to go and explore!"An expert took the initiative to accept the mission.It was not very dangerous.More importantly, it would be fine as long as he did not trigger the primal Chaos lightning tribulation.Rotten bones died because he was too weak. He died inside the Silvermoon, cutting off the connection to the Crimson Moon's great Dao. In reality, his battle prowess was greatly reduced, so his death ... Would not scare anyone."Yes!" Red Moon master nodded and looked at the person who spoke. It would not be a problem for this person to go.Although this person wasn't a peak existence, his combat strength wasn't weak either.As long as he didn't randomly provoke a Primal Chaos lightning tribulation, a mere Silvermoon was no problem. Moreover, Primal Chaos lightning tribulation was not something he could encounter as he wished.The others in the hall didn't say anything.To them, even if a Supreme treasure appeared, it would not be of much use under normal circumstances. Of course, if the Silver Moon had its own great path universe, it would be different. However, that was exclusive to great worlds. The Silver Moon could not even be considered a small world. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  "Yes!" At this moment, someone said,"the one stationed in the Silvermoon world is the yin-yang world Swordmaster. His sword is also superb. Thirty years ago, he killed a medium-level world Lord and destroyed his root! Now that the Silver Moon has reappeared, I don't know if the revered Sword Master will go. If he does, we have to be careful!"As soon as he said that, the expression of the person who had accepted the mission changed slightly.This indeed required attention!It was red Moon master who spoke,"it's fine!" As far as I know, the revered sword destroyed the world and devoured its power thirty years ago. He then went into seclusion and disappeared without a trace. Perhaps he was digesting what he had obtained and did not appear within the Silver Moon's range ..."That's good!,m The previous person was slightly relieved. Although a medium-level world Lord was not as terrifying as a major world Lord, he controlled an entire world. However, his root was still destroyed by Sword Master. He was still extremely terrifying.At the very least, he could not afford to offend them.After a brief discussion, the expert flew to the North of the Crimson Moon according to the clues.The chaotic coordinates were chaotic, and it was often difficult to locate them.However, since Red Moon master could sense it, it meant that the distance was not too far. It should be within the coverage of Red moon's bed universe. Otherwise, it would be difficult to sense all this.It's also in the North. I should be able to find it if I spend some time.……At the same time.In a remote region of the primal Chaos, a world appeared, faintly discernible.It was as if the sky was decorated with stars. A thick layer of tribulation clouds surrounded the outside. A door appeared in the outside of the world, standing in the sky and blocking the Tribulation clouds from penetrating.It was the Stargate!The world had originally been extremely dim, like dust, and extremely inconspicuous in the chaos. But now, the surrounding chaotic energy was pouring in and the Tribulation clouds covered it, making it somewhat different.The entire world was like a sword, emitting a faint Silver Radiance.The chaos did not know the date.

Chapter 2531 Chaos, The Past (3)_4
Just as the dark clouds covered the sky, a huge beast the size of a planet in the distance seemed to smell something and looked into the distance. It could vaguely see a trace of light.Primal Chaos energy surged around him, indicating that a world was in the middle of an upgrade.The giant beast was a little confused.Promotion?Breaking through in this godforsaken place?This place was within the radiation range of the Crimson Moon world. Under normal circumstances, even if one wanted to advance to a world, they would not choose this place. Furthermore, it was said that the neo martial human King had wandered around this place a few years ago. This place was extremely dangerous.Could it be an uncivilized world?If that was the case, it was excusable. One had not seen the chaos and did not know the dangers of the chaos. Advancing at will was also the way to destroy many worlds.The giant beast turned around.He was clearly moving at a frighteningly fast speed, but in the primordial chaos ... He was moving at a frighteningly slow speed. He wasn't moving very far away, but he was moving extremely far away.The beast had wanted to go to another place. It was said that some major worlds were preparing to discuss major matters and form an alliance to fight the enemy.It also wanted to join in the fun ... It did not have the intention nor the strength to support the new Martial Master and red Moon master. But no matter who it killed, a great battle between the Masters would be an opportunity for the chaos Rangers.They could take the opportunity to invade the world or devour its remains. These were all opportunities to improve.However, since there was still time, he would go and take a look first. If he encountered a world advancement, he might be able to have a good meal.If it didn't get any benefits after this, it was ready to leave.This place had not been quiet or safe for the past few years.The new martial human King often took the wrong path ... It was just a saying. Everyone thought that it was intentional to accumulate strength. Recently, many chaos beasts and chaos Rangers in this area had been killed by the human King. Someone had even seen the human King roasting a giant Chaos Beast in the chaos!The terrifying place broke the tacit understanding of the chaos and also broke the peace of the chaos.……Silvermoon.Li Hao and the others didn't know what was going on in the outside world. In the entire Silver Moon world, other than a few new martial artists, no matter how talented or powerful they were, no one had ever walked out of the Silver Moon.They did not know how big the chaos was, how many worlds there were, or how many experts there were.They did not know how many years had passed in the outside world.He only knew that the Silver Moon was peaceful and martial arts prospered, ushering in the most glorious period of a hundred thousand years.The world was in a state of advancement. Marchioness Silvermoon's sword Dao covered the heavens and earth, allowing the common people to comprehend it. There were bound to be some geniuses out of the ten billion people who seized the opportunity.Be it truth path or Phantom path, they had obtained a huge improvement.If he could not comprehend force, he would walk the solid path. There were thousands of great DAOs, but there would always be a Dao that suited him.The mountains, seas, sun, and moon were endless. Although the daomerge was rare, there were still people who had begun to do so. However, no one had yet been able to fuse reality with illusion.The experts didn't waste this rare moment of peace. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  Qian Wuliang and Hong Yitang were both very active.They preached everywhere and even started to preach Dao. In every martial arts college, there was even a debate about the two great DAOs. Which was stronger, Phantom Dao or truth Dao?Some of the academies had even started to focus on one Dao.And no one stopped him.According to Li Hao's words, each of them had to show their abilities.As long as everything was out in the open, it didn't matter if they argued, discussed the Dao, or even sparred.The strong enemies were annihilated, and the world was at peace.A group of cultivators was full of energy. If they were forbidden from sparring, they might cause even more trouble.Of course, Li Hao wasn't idle, either.At this moment, he was chatting with someone, touching the other party's book of Dao from time to time. After so many times, Zhang an could no longer bear it. ""Are you even listening to me?",m Li Hao nodded with a smile."I heard it!""Then what do you think?""If we open the Stargate now and let you go out to explore ... Wouldn't that be sending you to your death? If you die and your grandfather comes to me for revenge ... Wouldn't that hurt our own family?"Li Hao chuckled. He was much more enthusiastic and talkative than before.He then added,"you don't have to worry about me or Silver Moon. Everything will work out when it comes to it! I do have a presumptuous request ...""What?""Lend me the book of Dao ... Not just the book of Dao, but also ... Senior himself!""Me?""Right!"Li Hao smiled meaningfully."Senior, you're an old man who has existed since the early stage of neo martial. Are you interested in exploring the past with me? with your insight, let me see neo martial!"Zhang an's expression changed slightly.Li Hao said seriously,"recently, I've realized the difficulty of improving myself. The key is that I'm shortsighted and haven't seen the real experts. Even if I've seen them in some illusions, I've never really experienced them. I've never experienced such an era!""So, I want to go with you, senior ..."Li Hao looked at him."It's a good thing for director Zhang. Your Dao is too complicated. It's too messy. There are too many things." "Because you've seen too much, you've already lost your direction ... Let's look at your past together. From the perspective of an outsider, from the perspective of a third party, we'll look at you again! "In this way, I won't change the past, I won't touch the past, and you won't be ... Safe! Your identity is important, and no one would intentionally kill me ..."

Chapter 2532 Chaos, The Past (3)_5
"Kill you?"Zhang an was stunned, and Li Hao nodded."There are many strong neo martial artists. Through your history and records, at least many people can sense some changes, such as the human King in the later stage, the celestial Thearch and the celestial Thearch Zhan in the early stage, and even the consciousness of the world and the consciousness of the seed!""Even if we just go to the illusionary past, we might be dealt a fatal blow!"Li Hao said solemnly, all of this is extremely possible! These existences were too powerful! So ... Through your line of sight, I might be able to avoid many dangers! "As for me, I can also take this opportunity to look at the powerhouses" past. Silver Moon is also the world that has the deepest contact with neo martial artists. Similarly, Silver Moon now knows that the strongest era was neo martial artists ... Of course, Crimson Moon might be one of them, but Crimson Moon bone erosion has already died without an intact corpse, so it's difficult to find her. "Through himself, he could observe the past! Zhang an was shocked by Li Hao's idea. He glanced at Li Hao and fell into deep thought.Li Hao said again, don't hesitate anymore! "Senior, you're just thinking too much. I have no intention of hurting you, nor do I have any intention of doing anything to you. We're just taking what we need from each other. I've observed the experts, and senior can look back on yourself ... You've reached the Heavenly King level and are cultivating both the new Dao and the essence Dao, but this isn't a long-term thing!"In fact, Zhang an's talent was not bad, and he was also knowledgeable. There were not many neo martial artists who were more knowledgeable than him.However, because of this ... He had learned too many things!The book of great Dao contained the Dao of human King, his grandfather's Dao, and the Dao of various great sovereigns. It was a mess and couldn't be completely integrated. As a result, in his era, his peers either became Heavenly Kings early or venerable sovereigns directly ...However, Zhang an had only been at the peak of the Saint realm before this.In terms of status, his grandfather could even be ranked in the top five or top three in the entire neo martial arts.The human King's sister had become a venerable sovereign, while he ... Was still a Saint.Now, even though he had advanced to the Heavenly King stage, it was only because of the new Dao's blessing and not because his own origin Dao had achieved a huge breakthrough and development.Zhang an considered Li Hao's words for a while, then said solemnly,""Are you sure you want to take a look through my path? I know that you consume a lot of your lifespan every time you go there. Do you still have any lifespan left to use?"Li Hao felt that he was about to die of old age.In fact, there was a sense of decay in the aura.And now, he still wanted to walk the path of time. Wasn't he afraid that he would die on the path of time?"It's only from the perspective of a bystander, not the real past...It's just the depths of my memory. Of course, it's slightly more profound than pure memory!"Li Hao explained,"the memories of the past ... Are actually different!" "If I walk over, it means that everyone in the past will know about me, see me, and discover me ... As for the memories of the past, deep in the memories ... At most, it will attract the attention of some truly unparalleled and top-notch existences, and only then will they discover some clues! I'm only at the ninth level of the Dao integration stage, so I can't control time as I please!"Zhang an thought for a moment and nodded."That's doable ... I think those truly powerful people don't actually care about what their past has been discovered. However, I have to say this first. You can't invade my privacy!"Privacy?Li Hao glanced at him and smiled,"which one are you talking about, senior?" Seeking flowers and Willows? Or something else?"“……”Zhang an glanced at him and didn't want to say anything.This guy was really annoying at times.Seeing that Li Hao didn't seem to care about what was happening outside, he reminded him again,""The Silvermoon world is about to be promoted, and it might really attract the attention of some experts from the chaos Wanderer! To be able to roam the primordial chaos freely, and to be a loner at that ... Even the weakest of them would be a venerable Emperor, and not an ordinary one at that!"Li Hao nodded."That's why ... If I want to become stronger, I'll have to go through you. Senior, you don't think that I can become stronger just by worrying, do you?"He laughed helplessly."I know you're worried, senior. But we have to do something. It's better to do it than to say it, isn't it?" n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  Zhang an was startled and nodded.He was wrong!Li Hao also reminded him,"senior, it's best not to think too much about everything. Sometimes, you should make a decision when it's time to make a decision. I'm afraid that you've been influenced by your grandfather, the Supreme martial artist. But since you can't become someone like your grandfather, why don't you take a step back and seek the second best ... Learn from senior Empyrean pole. Being reckless or lying flat may be a way out!"Zhang an wanted to learn from his grandfather, to learn from that Supreme, to become the military counselor of neo martial arts, or even the leader of the human King, to become a multi-armed, omnipotent existence ... It was a good idea, but the truth was very cruel.There was only one new martial Supreme.Not everyone could learn it!Zhang an was silent, but he nodded. In fact, he also understood where his shortcomings were. However, li daoheng was right about one thing. Zhang an and him might look completely different, but deep down, their personalities were somewhat similar ... Because he had seen and seen too much, he felt that his talent was not bad. Even if he could not surpass Zhang an, he could not be inferior to him.He was focused on surpassing and breaking through ... Otherwise, if Zhang an simply walked a path, whether it was the path of his grandfather, the path of the human King, or the path of other venerable sovereigns, with the help of those venerable sovereigns, even if he couldn't become a venerable sovereign, he would probably be able to become a half-step sovereign.And now?Neither high nor low!Li Hao didn't say too much. Zhang an knew what he was doing. He just wanted to remind them that these people knew what was going on, but they just couldn't change the situation.Zhang an's agreement was good news for Li Hao.This was a good opportunity for him to test how his Dao of time could affect others.Peeking over!In fact, it was also prying into people's privacy ... Of course, this was from Zhang an's point of view. If he really looked at it from a top powerhouse, Li Hao might not dare to look at it, because it might be a way to court death!Go and take a look at the real neo martial, even if it was the neo martial of the past!The Zhang family educational records had allowed Li Hao to comprehend many things. If he combined it with what he had seen and heard, he might even gain some unexpected gains and perfect his own Dao system."Senior ... Shall we start then?"Zhang an glanced at him and nodded. He took a deep breath and said,""If you insist, I'll do whatever I want if you're not worried! I'll go and see if I've done anything wrong all these years ..."The most difficult thing to see through in a person was still themselves.She always felt that if you can, I can too. If you can, I can too. The facts proved that no means no.Since he was young, his targets had been the human King and the others ... He was from the same era as the human King, blood Emperor, iron Emperor, and the others. The age difference was only a few years, and his targets were these people.In the end, it made people sigh. The gap was only getting bigger and bigger, but they had never really been close."Let's go," Li Hao said with a smile."I hope that we'll be able to obtain some good gains before Silver moon's advancement ..."As soon as he finished speaking, a long river appeared.They surrounded Zhang an.Zhang an exhaled. He had come to persuade Li Hao to be careful and let him go out to find new martial arts. In the end, he didn't know why, but he had gone to see his past with Li Hao!At this moment, the long river surrounded Zhang an.A star appeared between Li Hao's eyebrows, shining brightly. The real time star had almost completely fused with Li Hao.Fusing with his body ... Was a special combination for both Li Hao and time and star.In the next moment, time was turned back.His memory seemed to have returned to the depths!At this moment, some of the past that he did not want to mention, or even could not mention, appeared in Zhang an's mind.As if they were weightless, the next moment, the two of them fell from the river at the same time.At this moment, Li Hao possessed Zhang an's body, and Zhang an had also entered his own body in his memory. However, he did not take the lead. Instead, he observed his memory from the perspective of a third party.At this moment, Li Hao's vision blurred, and a figure appeared in front of him. It was extremely tall and powerful!His aura was not too powerful, but Li Hao felt boundless pressure.That was Zhang an's ... Fear!"Grandpa!"It was the possessed Zhang an who was saying,"grandfather ..." In an instant, Li Hao understood. He was the Supreme neo martial artist!He did not expect to meet this new martial Supreme at the first moment. What a coincidence.

Chapter 2533 The Memory Of The Past (1)
Li Hao's vision blurred, and a person appeared in front of him.Since Zhang an had called him grandfather, he must be the new martial Supreme, martial King Zhang Tao.Li Hao had some understanding of this person.In the history of neo martial arts, this person left a heavy mark. He was one of the protectors and leaders of the human King. His influence was far-reaching. He was originally the pioneer of the path of the human Emperor of neo martial arts. Later, he broke the path and helped the human King.In the last battle of neo martial, he fought against the ruler of the origin era, the celestial Emperor, and finally died. Later, he was resurrected by the human King.He was also the glory of neo martial arts and the military advisor of neo martial arts. Strictly speaking, Silver moon's director Zhao, Qian Wuliang, Lin Hongyu, and Hong Yitang together might be able to match his role. This role referred to the government affairs.The other party was in charge of all the government affairs of the entire neo martial arts. Among them, education was the field that he was best at.p Thus, to meet this person right after falling into the past ... Was truly a pleasant and unexpected surprise.However, with Zhang an's identity, it was only a matter of time before they met.The word "grandfather" made Li Hao feel a little dazed. It also made Zhang an, who had possessed him, feel a little dazed. This Zhang an was the Zhang an of the future. When he saw the person in front of him, he was also in a daze.I haven't seen Grandpa in a long time!It was too long!Ever since he had come to Silver Moon, he had practically cut off all contact with his grandfather. He was running away from his grandfather, but he was also afraid of him. Even though his grandfather was someone worthy of respect, affable, and humorous in many people's eyes ...However, in his eyes, his grandfather ... Was a terrifying creature. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  His elder brother was the pillar of the family.His own sister was the youngest and also the most doted on.As for himself, he was in the middle. He was not as independent as his elder brother and not as lively as his younger sister. Since he was young, he had been afraid of his grandfather. Even now, he could not help but tremble in fear."You're back?"The old man in front of him glanced at Zhang an. Although he was an old man, he actually looked quite young. However, his eyes were slightly weathered and he looked a little tired."Yes, Grandpa!""Get ready, pack your bags, and go to mcmau to study!""Mcmau?" "Yes,"The old man smiled as if he had thought of something. He chuckled and said,""There's an interesting guy in mcmau, you should know ...""Fang ping?""Right!"BOOM!Li Hao's head was buzzing. It seemed that when Zhang an mentioned this person, even the long river of memories was affected and interfered with. It even felt like it couldn't bear it. Li Hao was immediately shocked!This was just the past!In the depths of Zhang an's memory, the mention of a person's name could actually cause the river to tremble. What ... What kind of power was this?The old man didn't seem to know anything. He laughed. "It's him! He's an interesting kid who's destined to be the pillar of humanity in the future ... I've decided to groom him into the third generation of Education Minister and take over my position!""Grandfather...He...He seems to be the biggest troublemaker. He will cause big trouble wherever he goes. Because of him, the catacombs have been in chaos many times. Countless soldiers have died in battle. Many grandmasters of the older generation have died in battle while rushing to the catacombs. You ...""Foolish! Stupid!"The old man rebuked. He was somewhat dissatisfied and disappointed."Other people can say that, but you can 't! "You're my, Zhang Tao 's, grandson. I've taught you by example and by word. Your big brother has long since left to take charge of a region and guard the catacombs. I've only given you the greatest amount of effort and effort!""Causing trouble?""Hmph!" The old man snorted coldly,"there are countless strong enemies in the catacombs. How can we break out of this? "Should we just defend to the death and wait for the catacombs to fully invade? Do you know why no one, be it me or the others, stopped him even though we knew that he would cause trouble every time he went down? because ... We need someone to break out of this situation!""Since he dares to do it, can do it, and is willing to do it ... Then let him do it! We will bear all the consequences!""He is the soul of the younger generation, your spirit ... The spirit of invincibility, the spirit of never giving up, the spirit of either success or death ... The grandmasters of the older generation are willing to die for him!""Only then can we fight for a future!"The old man frowned and was a little unhappy."Other people can say that. The grandmasters of the older generation can also joke like this ... But no one thinks that he is really wrong! Since he's willing to take the risk again and again, we have the courage to bear all the consequences!""Zhang an, you're still young. You're too inexperienced and have a weak view of the big picture. That's why I'm sending you to mcmau so you can get in touch with him. He said that he's going to take revenge on me and told me to be careful. It's best if my family doesn't go to mcmau ... I won 't!"The old man suddenly laughed. His laugh was very meaningful. "I'm going to send you and your sister over. He can beat or kill you if he wants! I also want to see if you can change your indecisiveness after getting to know him ... Zhang an, your starting point is higher than his, and you're stronger than him. You have me as your grandfather, while he doesn't ... But I hope you won't underestimate the heroes of the world because of this!""A young fellow who can stir up countless powerhouses in the catacombs, who can't wait to eat his flesh and drink his blood...To you, he is worth learning and respecting. The only thing you shouldn't look down on and hate him for is that he's not a weakling! "There's no other reason. The catacombs war will also break out, and he, the catacombs powerhouse who has been destroyed, may be difficult for you to catch up to in your life ..."

Chapter 2534 The Memories Of The Past (2)
The young Zhang an seemed to be unconvinced."Even though in the eyes of outsiders, he's a genius, a very talented person, and has a good upbringing, like a modest gentleman, he's been used to people's flattery since he was young. Suddenly, his grandfather told him that you're going to mcmau for nothing else but to learn from that person, to get in touch with that person...To get in touch with that uncultured youth!Zhang an was unhappy, but he didn't dare to say anything in front of his grandfather.Initially, he did not want to go to mcmau. He wanted to go to capital City Martial Arts university."Capital City Martial Arts university might be as famous as Magic City Martial Arts university, but capital City Martial Arts university has produced even more powerhouses ... Even though mcmau's reputation has grown in the past two years, it's only because of that Fang ping who has been studying at mcmau and stirring up a storm ... He wants to go to ccmau more. Deep down, he actually has some other thoughts. If I go to ccmau, I can stir up a storm too, and let ccmau and mcmau be equal again.It was better to send charcoal in the snow than to add flowers to brocade.In addition, the Zhang family's influence was also in capital city. Here, he could develop even better. He could even lead ccmau to participate in the next National martial arts Conference, win the championship, and break magic City Martial Arts University's two-year winning streak.……At this moment, Li Hao listened quietly. He could feel that ... This person attached great importance to his grandson, Zhang an. He didn't care about him as little as he had imagined.On the contrary, he had high hopes for Zhang an.He even hoped that Zhang an could become close comrades with the future king and become a member of this small group during the rise of the future king, just like the blood Emperor and the others.For this reason, he even took the initiative to make a joke ..."I'll send my grandson and granddaughter to be beaten by you, and you can do whatever you want with them. It's fine as long as you don't torture them to death ... Even if you torture them to death, I won't blame you!"At this moment, Zhang an, who was possessing him, was also having very complicated thoughts.This was the conversation he had with his grandfather before he went to mcmau that year. His grandfather had hoped that he would go to mcmau, but he was unwilling to accept it, but he did not dare to refute it. Moreover, he felt that his grandfather valued that person more than him, and he felt anger and unwillingness!"I'm grandpa's biological grandson. Why is Grandpa so biased toward that troublemaker who has been causing trouble for mankind all this time? many grandmasters have gone to the catacombs to fight and died in foreign lands because of his impulsiveness!Back then, he didn't understand!Looking at it now and recalling the past, at this moment, Zhang an sighed softly in his heart. He was young and frivolous. At that time, he was indeed too arrogant. The battle between neo martial arts and the catacombs had been going on all this while.However, he lacked someone to break the situation. Grandfather and the others were the stabilizing pillars and couldn't be moved easily. If they were careless, they would lose the whole game!At this moment, the young human King had been stumbling all the way into the catacombs. Although he had stirred up trouble and brought disaster upon himself, at the same time, he was constantly weakening the enemy's strength, causing the enemy to mistakenly think that it was just the young human King's accidental encounter, putting his grandfather and the others aside.And this also laid a huge Foundation for the later victory.Zhang an thought to himself and then looked at himself at the time. He seemed to be very unconvinced. Although he said yes, he lowered his head and didn't say a word. He didn't pay much attention then, but now, he was in a daze. Her grandfather was looking at her.There was a change in his expression and a sigh in his eyes, as if he was saying something. His grandfather had never shown him such an expression. He had never seen it before. n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  Today, when he went back to the past, he saw the hidden anticipation and apology in his grandfather's eyes. It was as if he was saying,"you're my real grandson and the one I love the most is you. But I also hope that you can recognize yourself and reality and make friends with like-minded people ..."That look was so complicated that even Zhang an was a little shocked.Her grandfather ... Had never shown her such an attitude.When he was young, did his grandfather have such high expectations of him?For a moment, he suddenly felt a little depressed and absent-minded. In his memory, his grandfather was only strict with him. The more strict he was, the angrier he became, and the more disappointed he became ... He never had any expectations!This was especially so when others kept advancing after neo martial while he was stuck at the sage level. His grandfather seemed to have completely given up on him!Zhang an's mind was filled with countless thoughts, but Li Hao's mind was not as complicated.He just looked at the person in front of him and felt the thoughts of the possessed Zhang an. He also felt that the other party's strength was growing all the time ... He was a little surprised, but he also understood.Interesting!The Supreme martial artist of this era had already shown signs of mastering the way of the human Sovereign. With the help of the people in his cultivation, he had actually won the trust, admiration, and even faith of the people with such strength ...Neo martial didn't talk about faith, but this person relied on his identity as a non-Supreme to obtain the recognition of thousands of people. He was really capable!The other party didn't show any martial arts, but at this moment, Li Hao was a little shocked. An interesting person, a powerful person. Even when he was weak, he felt that he had gained a lot from just one look.This time, from a first-person perspective, he saw it with his own eyes and came into contact with it personally ... He suddenly felt that this era was very interesting!He had only had one conversation with the Supreme martial artist of the Zhang clan.Time passed quickly. Li Hao, who possessed Zhang an's body, was also experiencing the same thing.Until ... He entered mcmau!The Academy that had left its name in history!After entering, he realized that it was only so big, and there were very few experts ... In Li Hao's eyes, these people were not even at the sun or moon level. The strongest among them had only just entered the sun or moon level.

Chapter 2535 The Memories Of The Past (3)
An Academy like this ... Was actually the best academy in the past!And at this moment ... Li Hao was somewhat stunned. He didn't see the human King, but he saw an unexpected figure, venerable the sword!……The sword venerable of this period seemed to have walked out of the ten-year sword-sharpening period. He was somewhat high-spirited and somewhat uncontainable.When Zhang an saw venerable the sword, he was practicing his sword in his small courtyard.It was a simple sword attack, sword retreat, sword attack, sword retreat!Zhang an had followed his grandfather's instructions and came to pay a visit to the sword venerable ... Even though the sword venerable of this era was not considered a Big Shot, in the eyes of Supreme martial artist Zhang, he was still extremely weak.However, before he came, the Supreme martial artist of the Zhang family had asked Zhang an to pay a visit to this genius who had sharpened his sword for ten years ... Yes, the sword venerable was also a junior of the Supreme martial artist, and the Supreme martial artist also regarded him highly.He felt that this person would be a great person in the future.It had to be said that the Supreme martial artist's other abilities aside, his vision was extremely sharp. At this time, he actually determined that the sword venerable, who had just risen to power not long ago, had already passed the best period for martial arts practice and would have a great future.At this moment, the sword Saint was not as imposing as he had been in Li Hao's eyes.It seemed a little ordinary.He looked like a little old man with a sword at his waist. This was the legendary longevity sword ... It wasn't the sword itself, but the sword intent.Li Hao's strength far exceeded that of the current sword venerable. With a simple look, he realized that it was far inferior to his own sword. However, the sword of the sword venerable was extremely pure!At this moment, venerable the sword had completed the feat of one bridge and three gates into my stomach as recorded in the history books! n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  In this era, strength was considered top-notch.Of course, there was still a huge gap between him and a Supreme-being.When the other party saw Zhang an, he was not too polite, as if he did not care about his grandfather's identity. When he saw Zhang an, he said,""Your mind is in a mess. You're still young, but you're pretending to be calm and steady. You've lost the spirit of a teenager. You should go to ccmau ... Ccmau is full of a bunch of antiques, old-timers who abide by the old rules ... Your grandfather, Minister Zhang, was also an abdication. However, the descendants are calmer and calmer with each generation, each worse than the last ... In this era, calmness is a sin! It's not like I'm defending the world when the world is unfair. At this moment, what's the use of being calm when I'm fighting for the world ..."The sword Saint was not polite at all!At this moment, the young man, Zhang an, was a little sullen and angry that he had been underestimated.But ... He could only continue to pretend to be calm. The revered sword artist seemed to have noticed it, but he didn't say much. Perhaps he had considered that this man's grandfather was his immediate superior after all. In the end, he shook his head and said,"Forget it. Since you're here ... Don't say anything. Take my sword. It's giving your grandfather face!"As soon as he finished speaking, he slashed out with his sword!At this moment, the young man Zhang an was extremely weak. He felt that he had suffered a huge blow and was even a little resentful ... The sword venerable was so powerful that he could not withstand a single strike from his sword!Sure enough, just the sword Qi alone was enough to force him to retreat.The real Zhang an and Li Hao, on the other hand, were slightly stunned.At this moment, the two of them felt a special will, or even momentum, a special momentum that only the Silver Moon had!The two of them had seen countless Shi, but they had some understanding of it in an instant ... Li Hao was shocked. Pure, United, and all DAOs return to one?His heart trembled!The strength of the sword Master at this stage was really ordinary ... From his point of view, it was very ordinary. However, the sword of the sword Master at this stage ... Actually had a sense of egoism!This ...The elderly Zhang an was also stunned. At this moment, his soul trembled once again. This was ... The will of the sword Dao, and also the will of imparting Dao!But at this moment, the young man was filled with anger and didn't notice it at all.As for venerable the sword, he frowned slightly and seemed a little disappointed. He quickly put away his sword and said calmly,""Your talent isn't bad, not bad for Fang ping. It's a pity ... A pity! "Go. If you have time, try to recall this sword of mine ... Also, you're too young. You're only 18 years old. Don't learn from an 81-year-old. The you now should do what you need to do. Your grandfather's achievements were not achieved by being calm. When he was young, he was no worse than Fang ping. Perhaps he was even more reckless and did all sorts of bad things ..."As soon as he finished speaking, Li Hao, Zhang an, venerable the sword, and the others heard a sneer."Li Changsheng, if it weren't for your sword, I would've slapped you to death!"Li Hao was taken aback. This Supreme martial artist of the Zhang clan ... Had actually been eavesdropping all this time, and hadn't paid much attention to it before.However, Sword Saint didn't seem surprised."Why don't you try killing me?" It's illegal for me to tell the truth? "When you were young, my teacher once said ... Of course, I won't say more about the dark side of things. But come to think of it, your grandson isn't like you ... That's right, you're too good at pretending to be a Saint, and your grandson will learn from you. If you ask me, you shouldn't be like this, but be a little pretentious in front of your grandson ... In front of us, in front of Fang ping, weren't you shameless to the extreme?"“……”The Zhang clan's Supreme martial artist seemed to be a little displeased and coldly snorted, "Don't give me that. My grandson is very talented. This sword of yours ... He will comprehend the true meaning sooner or later! But then again, you're a little out of touch with the Dao of origin source. Strange ... This little Broken Sword of yours really has a bit of its own flavor. You can even cut off my fingernails with one strike!"At this moment, Li Hao felt a little strange.Was this how the top big shots communicated?He pretended to be in a new realm!

Chapter 2536 The Memories Of The Past (3)
"Can your grandson sense it? If you can really comprehend it, I ... Forget it, you're older than me and of the same generation as my master. I'll go eat shit if I'm upside down!""Who are you looking down on?""You're looking down on your grandson!""Are you scolding me? Don't think I don't know what you're thinking. Li Changsheng, you'd better behave yourself, or I'll kill you with one slap ...""Go ahead and slap me. If you kill me, I'll let my disciple slap you to death!""Let go of your mother ... Is he your disciple? You think Lu fengrou is dead?"“……”The two big shots were secretly transmitting their voices and cursing at each other.As for the old Zhang an, he was dazed for a long, long time. He was a little depressed. I ... It seems that I have never realized the true meaning in my life. It seems that I have disappointed my grandfather.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 As for the young man, Zhang an ... He was extremely weak, and his heart was filled with anger at the moment, so he didn't care about it at all.At this moment, Li Hao also wanted to laugh.The powerhouses of the new martial era were all very interesting. Were their means of communication ... All like this?The other had been tailing them, eavesdropping and cursing shamelessly. Was this the legendary Supreme martial artist?As for this sword venerable, who he had imagined to be unparalleled in his call...He had also cursed countless times throughout the country. However, he had restrained himself slightly because the Supreme venerable's status, identity, and age were all higher. He was of the same generation as his teacher.Of course, what Li Hao was more concerned about was that venerable sword was still at the origin stage, but he had already reached the convergence path of 10000 DAOs, while Supreme had already reached the convergence path.These neo martial artists ... Each and every one of them, at such a weak time, was somewhat different, really amazing!With this brief interlude ...What Li Hao couldn't forget next was that he hadn't seen the human King for the time being ... After leaving venerable the sword's place, Zhang an and his sister were quickly sent to do manual labor.And on the way ... Li Hao became even more interested.Along the way, there were flattering words like "mighty Vice-Chancellor Fang,""great Grandmaster Fang," and "congratulations to Grandmaster Fang."Was this the legendary mcmau?And not a nest of bootlickers, not a nest of bandits on the side of the road?A group of people ... No matter how young they were, they all had the style of bandits. They acted as if they were the number one in the world except for old Fang. They even walked sideways!Each and every one of the young men was full of vigor and murderous intent!When they saw Zhang an, they looked like they had seen a child.Even though they knew that the young human King's grandfather was an important figure, many people, including some so-called teachers, looked at him as if he was going to be in trouble. It was said that the young human King had said that he wanted to take revenge on Supreme martial artist Zhang's grandson!That's right, he was so petty. Moreover, he said it in a fair and square way. It was said that it was because Supreme martial artist Zhang often extorted this young human King. At this moment, Li Hao, who didn't want to disturb the times, couldn't find anyone to chat with. He suddenly asked,""Senior Zhang, is this the most famous Academy in the new martial era?"Zhang an was stunned. Could he still make a sound?He didn't even know the situation."Yes, this is mcmau!" He tried to reply."You've just entered the school ... And you're already being watched?"Zhang an was a little bitter."Yes ... This is just the beginning. The human ruler has not returned yet. He will only return after the opening ceremony ... Anyway, I have a deep impression of this opening ceremony ..."How deep was the memory?Zhang an didn't need to say much, because the new students 'opening ceremony was about to begin.But this time, Li Hao met the human King.The young human King!"I descended onto the rostrum in an extremely flashy manner. I descended onto mcmau in a manner that I'm afraid that others don't know that I'm powerful. I'm afraid that everyone doesn't know that I'm arrogant!"That's the human King ... The one beside him ... Is ccmau's Supreme Emperor tie. He's at mcmau now, and he's forming a team with the human King ..."This time, Li Hao met many big shots in the future.Many of them were future venerable sovereigns.Iron Supreme Emperor, human King, sword Supreme.The next moment, the flashy human King suddenly said,""Teacher Qin, let's start!"Meanwhile, Li Hao and Zhang an heard the human King say something else,""Old Qin, close the door and let the dogs out. Put them near the Zhang family's kids. Old Zhang is such a shameless old man. I'll let him torture me...Torture the siblings!"The elder Zhang an was helpless and transmitted, "There's still this? I thought it was an accident!"At this time, a pretty boy-like figure appeared in the void ... He looked tough and handsome, but because of his flirtatious appearance, he looked a little like a pretty boy."This is venerable Emperor Qin!" Zhang an's voice rose again.​ "Venerable Emperor Qin?"Li Hao was a little surprised. He had never heard of it before. There were not many records of it in the history of neo martial, but ... At this moment, Li Hao was stunned. It was somewhat ... Special!It felt like heaven's will was attached to him!The Son of Heaven?"This ... Is the famous desperate man ... He claims to be the best in the world and refuses to accept anyone. The human King has beaten him again and again, but he still refuses to accept it ... Unless you give him some benefits, such as calling you father ... Otherwise, he won't accept it even if you beat him to death!"Speaking of this, Zhang an felt a little helpless.""He's very talented. He dares to fight and kill. He's not afraid of anything. He's even capable of causing trouble. He's not weaker than a King ... He's just a little shameless. Isn't it normal for him to owe money? That's right, the invincible momentum recorded in neo martial's history ... Was created by him! If I win, I'm invincible. If I lose, I'm invincible. I'm truly invincible. In the true sense, I'm unconvinced by the heavens and the earth ..."

Chapter 2537 Memories Of The Past (Part 5)
Li Hao's interest was instantly piqued. Was it that interesting?He had actually read about the invincible aura in some of the Silver Moon Martial master's Secret manuals, but he didn't really understand it. He thought that the invincible aura meant that one would be able to win every battle and attack every single time!However, from what Zhang an said ... It didn't seem to be the case."Even if he's defeated ... He can still be invincible?""Right! "Ordinary people can't do it, but he can ... Because he believes in himself from the bottom of his heart. He's truly invincible. He's not consoling himself, he's truly so confident. Even if he loses once, he'll feel that it's just a test of his life. He'll still be invincible, and then he'll fight again ... Again, again, again, again, again ... If he doesn't die after a hundred battles, then he'll truly be invincible!"Li Hao took a deep breath. This was interesting!To be honest, it was easy to comfort himself, but he had to make himself firmly believe that he was invincible. Even if he failed once, he would still be invincible because this was only a challenge. As long as he was alive, he would be able to defeat him ...This kind of mental state could be said to be extremely worth learning!As expected, anyone who could become a venerable sovereign was not simple.There weren't many records of this person in the history books, but he actually had such redeeming qualities. An invincible aura ... No wonder there were mentions of such an aura in the Silver Moon secret manual. This aura was extraordinary!Following that, it was time for the young Zhang an to be tortured. A large number of demonic beasts were thrown to his side, beating him into a sorry state. This was the human King's revenge and also a test!As for the Qin Emperor, he was also throwing demonic beasts to his side. Someone couldn't help but remind him,""Fengqing, that's enough. Aren't you afraid that department head Zhang will settle the score with you?""Tsk, do you think I'm afraid of him? "At worst, he'll just beat me up. He won't kill me. As long as he doesn't kill me ... Old Fang said that he'll get enough benefits this time ... As long as he doesn't kill me, I'll take revenge on him next time!"Li Hao didn't know whether to laugh or cry, and the old Zhang an was also extremely helpless. To be honest, this was the first time he had seen the mentality of these powerhouses.This was the first time he knew how they felt ... When they faced his grandfather.I'm not afraid of you!I'm bullying you because you won't kill me. As long as you don't kill me, I'll beat your son, your grandson, and your great-grandson in the future if I can't beat you ..."To think that back then, I thought that with my grandfather's identity as a powerhouse ... In mcmau, I could enjoy special treatment even if I didn't do as I pleased ... It turns out that these seniors are all trying their best to take revenge on me ... Really ..."The old Zhang an was really helpless. I didn't know there was such a layer back then.At this moment, someone from mcmau's new students in the distance suddenly shouted,""Yuan Ping club sisters, come with me to kill the enemy!" A group of freshmen, led by a young girl, suddenly charged at the demon beast. Li Hao couldn't help but look at them and say softly,""They're all freshmen ... I didn't expect this girl to have such courage. I can see that all of you are very afraid ..." Zhang an was also a little dazed. After a long time, he said,""That's right ... Many people say that she got to where she is by luck. In fact ... Compared to us, she's really stronger, braver, and more courageous!""She was younger than all of us. She was only 16 years old ... Zhang Xue and I were already 18 years old. However, she was the first one to organize everyone to kill demonic beasts and demonic beasts. As for us ... We could only hide ..."Li Hao was stunned. This tone ... Didn't sound right.Zhang an sighed."Actually, I've always thought that it was natural for her to reach the venerable sovereign level. It's just that everyone was attracted by her brother's identity and thought that she relied on her brother ... Actually, that's not the case. In the other world, it was actually ... She who led everyone to fight in all directions and killed the world Lord. He was a little helpless and finally sent us away ...""She's ... The human King's sister?"Li Hao came back to his senses.Zhang an said,"yes ... It's her!" "You've seen it for yourself. She's 16 years old. She joined mcmau at the youngest age, but her performance was the most outstanding. She's the most outstanding student in our batch, and after the human King and the others. Do you think it's reasonable for her to not become a venerable sovereign?"Li Hao looked in that direction. That human King's sister was slim and elegant ... With a bit of baby fat, she was very cute, but she was also very decisive. When she faced those powerful demon beasts, she didn't show any mercy.He was indeed courageous and bold. Although Li Hao could see that deep in his eyes ... There was fear, he still took the lead and performed much better than Zhang an. His strength was not even as good as the young man Zhang an."As expected, venerable sovereigns all have their own special traits ..."Li Hao gave his affirmation."When I was 16, my parents had just passed away. I was very dispirited at that time, and I didn't have the ability to kill demon beasts ... Even if I did, I wouldn't have been able to gather so many people. If it were me, I would probably choose to wait for no one to notice me and secretly kill one to get some benefits ..."Zhang an was speechless!F * ck, are you complimenting little sister Wang or yourself?"At this moment, I was scared to death. I was scared silly. This is my first time experiencing this!"This is your first time fighting with someone ... Aren't you afraid?" he asked."I was afraid ... So I killed him and he even gave me a silk banner!"Zhang an was stunned, and Li Hao continued,"senior, have you seen that pennant?" I'll show you later ... It's my first time fighting and I was scared to death. Fortunately, I killed the other party. Otherwise, I'd be in big trouble!"

Chapter 2538 The Memories Of The Past (6)
“……”Was this even human?Zhang an was completely speechless!This is the first time you've fought someone and killed them, and you still say you're afraid ... What are you afraid of?!"Then you ... Then what was the first time you saw a demonic beast?""Heibao? Raise them like dogs!""Other than Heibao?""I don't remember ... I guess I killed him?"Li Hao wasn't sure. The first time he saw a demonic beast other than the Black Panther was in the Cang mountains, right?Kill him directly?Who would still remember this!"You're not afraid?" Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  "At that time, I had already killed a large number of people. Why would I be afraid of a demonic beast?"“……”Zhang an was speechless. There was no resonance between them."Senior ... You're a little too timid ... You look calm, but you're so timid at the critical moment ... You're not even as good as the sister of the king of the human family. No wonder she became a venerable sovereign and you didn 't!"艹!Zhang an cursed in his heart!What the hell is this?Having said that, it was indeed a little embarrassing. At this moment, looking back at the past, he also felt a little embarrassed!Why was he so timid at that time?Damn it!Li Hao had laughed at them!He was in a sorry state!Of course, Li Hao wasn't a gossiper, so he didn't say much. After that, Zhang an experienced all kinds of things.Li Hao followed them and experienced many things.Zhang an also entered the catacombs and began to kill his enemies. In the entire human world, the young human King's reputation grew bigger and bigger, and he became crazier and crazier. It was so crazed that even Li Hao felt that it was a little too ostentatious. It was rare for him to not die even after such a situation.Of course, for the young human King's madness, the humans had also paid a huge price.Supreme-beings began to establish the catacombs, personally participating in the battle and personally protecting the Dao. There was even a heroic feat of the young human King causing trouble, and all the powerhouses of mankind came together to deal with it!The human race in this era was simply synonymous with madness! In order to obtain some battle results, as long as the young human Kings could obtain something, be it Supreme martial artists or other top-notch experts, they would not hesitate to wage a war with the entire human race!There had never been an era where neo martial artists were crazy, hot-blooded, or even childish!In Li Hao's eyes, some things were very childish.Sometimes, for the sake of victory in a battle, the human King and the others ... Almost did not consider the consequences at all. They gambled madly, gambled, gambled that humanity would not go extinct!If it were Li Hao, he probably wouldn't have done so.Even the Supreme martial artist known as the new martial arts military counselor ... From the beginning to the end, he did not stop them in the slightest. It was not like what he had imagined. He often waved his fan and said,""My Lord, you can't do this ..."The Supreme of neo martial arts, this military counselor, always said,""Let's go and give it a try. It's fine if it doesn't work. With us around, the sky won't fall!"This was the Supreme neo martial!Li Hao was greatly shocked by such a person!Don't be afraid. Don't worry about any terrifying consequences. We'll be behind you. Even if the sky falls, we'll hold on!That ... Indescribable feeling shocked Li Hao!Although the humans in this era were weak and Li Hao felt that he could annihilate the entire human race at any time ... That kind of unity where you could do whatever you wanted and I would be your military counselor ... This military counselor was actually a military counselor who could cover everything for you. Li Hao's inherent impression of himself was completely overturned!"So ... This is the real military counselor?"After the Great War ended, Li Hao was in a trance. He even felt that he had blended into this era ... He felt that it was a pity to miss this era!Zhang an was also a little dazed,"I actually don't know my grandfather ... Because my grandfather experienced a lot of things that I was not qualified to participate in at that time!" This is also the first time I've found out ... That he was the one who instigated all the wars ..."It wasn't exactly egging him on, but there were clearly a few times when the human King was a little worried. There were some times when a child did something wrong and he was a little scared ... But the Supreme-being had helped the human King's arrogance again and again.There were a few times when Supreme martial artist even said,"what's there to be afraid of? the other side is just a bunch of small fries. If you go and fight them, we'll only have face if you win. If you lose, the other side will call for their parents, and I'll go and fight them too. If you kill the other side's parents, you can continue fighting!"​ If it wasn't for the Supreme martial artist's repeated support and encouragement ... If the human King's attitude was slightly gentler, ambiguous, or opposed at this moment, the human King's child-like attitude of doing something wrong might not be as unscrupulous as before.In the end ... He became even more unscrupulous!That was because the human King truly believed that the Supreme martial artist could cover everything up, and the Supreme martial artist also believed that the human King could do better and better each time, and do more and more fiercely each time!The feeling that he only needed to stir up trouble and didn't have to worry about the consequences ... Even Li Hao was envious of this feeling.It was so comfortable!It's over!It was precisely because of this that the human King became stronger and stronger and more and more arrogant. He was so arrogant that he felt that there was no one he couldn't kill and no battle he couldn't win. As for the Supreme martial artist, he had always accompanied him, all the way until the end ... He had always been covering for the human King!Even the battle against the celestial Thearch, which Li Hao did not witness because Zhang an had been sent away, was also known by Li Hao. It seemed that a Supreme martial artist had also helped the human Emperor at the last moment!……This time, Li Hao was immersed in the river of memories for a very long time.In the end, when Li Hao met the Supreme martial artist again, he clearly felt that the other party seemed to have noticed something unusual. He even sensed the existence of the river of time. Only then did Li Hao come to a realization.

Chapter 2539 Memories Of The Past (3)
Li Hao's guess was correct.This time, they met in the Yin Yang world of neo martial.Zhi Zun, who had just been resurrected, saw his long-lost grandson again. The first thing he said was,""It seems like you were affected by a special energy and returned from a certain time and space ..."The elderly Zhang an, who was possessing Zhang an's body, was slightly stunned.At this moment, the Supreme martial artist was extremely imposing, but his voice was extremely calm. "It's a good thing. I just don't know who came with you ... Of course, that's not important! In any case, you don't have the ability to return on your own ... It looks like you've met a strong person, or perhaps a genius!""My grandson, I had high hopes for you in the past, but I was very disappointed in the end. After that ... I'm happy as long as you're safe! "Now, no matter what, just come back and take a look. There's no need to think too much. Just remember one thing ... Don't be afraid, just go and try! With your personality, perhaps your return this time was incited by someone else ... In the future, remember one thing, you don't need to be incited by others! Do it yourself ... As long as you do it, whether you succeed or fail ... As long as your grandfather is still alive, I'll let your enemies die with you if you're killed!""If you win ... As long as you're right, even if he's the human King, as long as you dare to fight him ... I'll go all out to fight him. I can beat him in the past, and I can still beat him in the future!""There's nothing to be afraid of. I'm here for everything, so just do what you need to do! You don't need to think about the big picture ... The big picture isn't what you should think about. What you need to think about is that if you're not happy, just fight. If you win, you'll eat the meat. If you lose, Grandpa will take you to continue!"Li Hao and Zhang an were both stunned by his words.At that moment, the Supreme martial artist said,""Also ... It doesn't matter if I don't know who you are. It's not important. You're capable of tricking my grandson into doing something he doesn't dare to do! To be able to travel through time and space to come here ... That's your ability! Whether it's for observation or something else, or even to spy on the situation, whether you're prepared to kill me or the king of killers ... As long as you dare to come, we'll fight you to the end!""Of course, if they are enemies, then so be it! If they weren't enemies, what you wanted to know or comprehend would come from a distance, and your observation would be limited. No matter how much you observed, no matter how much you probed ... It would be better for you to try it out yourself! If you want to ask, it's simple. Find an expert and fight with him. If you win, you'll eat his meat. If you lose, you can forget about it. You can stay with my grandson. If my grandson loses and is killed, I'll find you and resurrect you if I have the ability!""If I lose too, then let the human King continue. If the human King loses ... Then we'll both be finished ..."The imposing figure in front of him made Li Hao feel a little dazed.This ... Didn't sound too reliable, but there was a sense of trust in Him.He suddenly felt much more at ease!You can do it, what are you afraid of? If you lose, I'll save you sooner or later for the sake of my grandson. If I can't do it, then let's do it on the human Emperor's behalf ... Everyone, let's have a feast!At this moment, Li Hao didn't know whether to laugh or cry.He could actually sense a sense of ... Trust, stability, and security from the Paragon from more than 100000 years ago.Suddenly, they were extremely envious of the human King!He wasn't envious of the human King's strength, but of the human King's backer ... Even if the other party was no longer his backer, Li Hao felt that if he also had someone like Zhi Zun behind him, he would definitely feel at ease."My teacher is actually the same ... It's just a pity that his teacher's strength didn't catch up. When his teacher's strength is stronger than his, it's actually the same.You can do it, don't be afraid, I'm here!It was just that ... That period was very short.Because he soon surpassed his teacher. At this moment, Li Hao was somewhat regretful. If he had known, he would have surpassed his teacher later.While Li Hao was in a daze, the Supreme martial artist said,""Neo martial is invincible! "You came from another space-time, so it's nothing more than a Parallel space-time, the past, and the future ... It seems that you have some tricks up your sleeve! My grandson is still alive, which means he's still in the same time and space, and the enemy is in the chaos? "At this moment, you're interfering with my past and my memories ... It looks like something is about to happen. No matter what year and month you're in, what danger you're in, or what concerns you have ... It's fine. As long as this piece of memory appears in my mind, I'll help you once. It doesn't have to be killing a strong enemy for you personally ... I'll stir the chaos and create a move that will attract worldwide attention! As for whether it's useful or not, I don't care anymore. In short ... No matter how big the things you've done, they shouldn't be bigger than mine! Therefore ... You don't need to worry. The enemies that are too strong will target you! As for the shrimp soldiers and crab generals, you can deal with them yourself!"As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his hand, and a powerful force swept over.""Go back and don't interfere with the past and the future. Zhan Tiandi is so strong, but he still suffered the wrath of heaven, not to mention you! "When I have this extra part in my memory, I will quickly make my move. As for whether there is such an opportunity, there will be one even if there is no. If there really isn 't, at most, I will rebel against neo martial arts and beat up the human King ... And put on a show of neo martial arts' internal strife with the human King for you. Don't worry!"“……” Li Hao felt as if the world had been turned upside down. He instantly withdrew from Zhang an's body, while Zhang an himself floated up with Li Hao.At this moment, Li Hao was in a trance!F * ck!What kind of person was this?This was too crazy!Through time and space, he told Li Hao,"what's there to be afraid of? if you didn't come back because you ran into trouble, or if you didn't come to spy on the Dao, it doesn't matter ... If you run into trouble, just add this part to your memory. Think about your grandson's situation. If I'm still here, I'll create an opportunity for you."It could travel through time and space to create opportunities for you.Even if there wasn 't, there would still be!"If not, I'll rebel against new martial arts and fight a fierce battle with the human King to let chaos focus on me. Anyway, the top existences will not pay attention to you.This ... Was completely beyond Li Hao's expectations.It was unbelievable!Just as Li Hao was about to leave this world and return to the future in a daze, a figure suddenly appeared, as if chasing time. It was the king of men!Li Hao was stunned!That human King was overbearing to the extreme. His unparalleled strength seemed to have seen something as he chased after it madly. He was a little puzzled. "What's this? Old Zhang didn't even care about ... His own people? Forget it, I don't care who you are, I don't care what you are ... The next time you come, you have to greet me. If you don't greet me and invade my privacy like old Zhang, I will spank your butt! Was it a woman? It's a woman, hit her chest! I'll blow up your chest with one punch ... Do you hear me?"Li Hao was in a daze. He only felt that ... He had seen a ghost!This ... What was this?"Eh ... It doesn't exist in this era ... Could it be from the future? Or a parallel universe? Forget it, I don't care. Whether it's in the future or in the next time and space, if this part of my memory appears in the future, I'll kill one of the strongest people in the world to celebrate for you. I hope it's not you ... Otherwise, you're dead!"As soon as he finished speaking, the person who was chasing after time disappeared instantly!Li Hao was stunned!At this moment, the long river above his head fluctuated. He was about to go out.At this moment, a cat's meow startled his soul.""Hey, meow, fun ... Meow ... Can it be eaten? I'll remember your smell. Next time I see you, I'll bring you food, or ... Or I'll eat you! Meowmeowmeowmeowmeow!"“……”In his daze, Li Hao instantly dove into the river. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  At this moment, they were still in a daze. Although they had gone through a lot with Zhang an, these top-notch existences were not with them in the later stages. They didn't expect that they would encounter several top-notch existences in succession when they returned.The human King, Emperor Cang, the Paragon ... All of them had actually seen through something. This was simply too terrifying!If they tried to stop him, perhaps ... He would not be able to return!At this thought, Li Hao was instantly terrified. The memories of the past ... Could really kill him!
