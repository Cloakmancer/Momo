        Chapter 156: Chapter 40 sunlight (4)
Of course, this was normal. It was precisely because it was ordinary that no one paid attention to it. Otherwise, it would have been discovered long ago.

He looked at it carefully and suddenly said,””Are you sure this is the Li family’s sword?”

“I don’t know!”

Li Hao hurriedly said,”I really don’t know. I only found out about this sentence a few days ago!” This is the only weapon in my family, and it might be related to the Li family’s sword ...”

Li Hao hurriedly said,”give me this. I’ll tell you. There’s a small word on it. I don’t know if it’s what you’re looking for ...”

Small characters?

Where was he?

The water Esper took a closer look and did not find anything. He frowned.

Or did I really not notice?

He took the knife and walked to Li Hao’s side. Li Hao still had his hands raised high. The Water-type superhuman smiled. Good boy. Unfortunately, he still had to die!

The organization doesn’t just want your sword, they also want your life!

“Point the knife at me, I’ll point it out to you ... Forget it, I won’t move, don’t misunderstand ...”

The water Esper was getting impatient. Who cares if you move?

Even if Li Hao didn’t raise his hands, he wasn’t afraid of what this guy would do.

He approached Li Hao. Li Hao hesitated for a moment, then put down his hand and pointed at the hilt of the saber. “It’s right here. Look carefully, there’s a small word here ...”

Reading on Mybo xn o vel. com ,Please!

The man subconsciously looked at the handle of the knife ...

The next moment, he felt something. He seemed to see a third hand ... Was it an illusion?

It wasn ‘t!

There was really a third hand!

Magical hands!

This was what Li Hao had done when he dealt with the one with a cultivation base above 100. This time, it was the same. The trick taught by Yuan Shuo was extremely useful.

It might be slightly weaker for women, but for men ... Be it superpowers or martial masters, that area’s defense was the weakest. The key was that it was really painful when that area was crushed!

It was extremely painful!

If you weren’t a man, you might not be able to understand. Sometimes, when you accidentally hit something, it would be so painful that you would kneel down and cry.

Within the ice crystal barrier, the other’s mysterious energy had been compressed to its weakest.

This place clearly didn’t have any mysterious protection.

“Pa!”

It was like a balloon exploding, like an egg being broken, like a fish bubble being burst ...

At that moment, a sound rang out in the cargo box.

The Water-type super lowered his head subconsciously, then, like a normal person, his tears fell uncontrollably and he knelt on the ground!

Intense pain!

The mysterious energy in his body was somewhat scattered at this moment.

Li Hao, on the other hand, was also extremely fast. At this moment, he picked up the knife that the other party had just taken and stabbed it down!

It wasn’t his throat or his head, but his shoulder!

“Ah!”

The other party screamed again. At this moment, there was only one thought in his mind-pain!

Li Hao’s saber pierced through his body without any resistance!

Because ... Li Hao could see it.

Yes, this was Li Hao’s specialty. He could see the opponent’s mysterious energy, so he could tell which mysterious energy was the weakest, least, and easiest to break through.

His heart, throat, and eyes were surrounded by a dense layer of mysterious energy, which had not dispersed even now.

If he were to stab these places now, Li Hao might be injured by the mysterious energy.

A normal person, even a Martial Master, would first think of stabbing the vital points.

But Li Hao didn ‘t!

He stabbed his saber into the other party’s shoulder, which was not protected by the mysterious energy. His eyes were filled with coldness and ruthlessness. With a slash, he directly cut off one of the other party’s arms!

In the next moment, the pain caused the other party’s mysteriousness to further collapse.

Li Hao drew his saber and stabbed again!

This time, it was the waist.

“Ah!”

The excruciating pain caused the other party to cry out in pain. The superhuman could not believe it. Li Hao’s every attack was aimed at his weakest point. He could no longer protect his crotch with his remaining hand. He barely managed to use his mysterious energy to form a water blade and slashed it at Li Hao’s head!

Even if his d * ck was crushed, his arm was chopped off, and his waist was stabbed, this guy still had combat power!

A Dark Moon realm super had a much stronger life force than a 100-plus Martial Master.

If the 100-plus Martial Master had suffered such an attack, he would have been killed by Li Hao.

However, this person could actually counterattack.

Li Hao, on the other hand, didn’t Dodge. He had his own plans. He couldn’t Dodge. Once he dodged, his opponent would break his ice crystal barrier. With his superpowers active, his opponent might not die, but if he escaped, he would be in even greater trouble.

He had the Starlight energy. As long as he did not lose an arm or a leg, he could recover even if his injuries were more serious.

Thus, he allowed the knife to Pierce into his abdomen. The intense pain made him lose his composure, but Li Hao still exerted all his strength and clasped the other’s neck with both hands. One hand went up and grabbed the other’s hair, while the other hand held a small knife and stabbed the back of the other’s neck!

Puchi!

In the next moment, the knife moved sideways, and a sharp Sound of Contact was heard. The knife had torn the back of the man’s neck open!

“Ah!”

The shrill cry was heard again.

His opponent’s mysterious energy had almost completely dissipated. Li Hao grabbed his hair tightly and tore open his wound again with the knife. He used all his strength and slashed down heavily!

Gabeng!

The knife was broken, and the man’s neck bone had almost been completely broken by Li Hao.

Blood spurted out!

His entire head drooped down in an instant and almost fell off!

This terrifying scene made Li Hao slightly uncomfortable.

However, he did not give up.

His inner strength gushed out and once again shook the small knife, stabbing it again and again!


Chapter 157: Chapter 40-sunlight (5)
After an unknown period of time, someone shouted from outside,””Li Hao?”

The killing intent in Li Hao’s eyes disappeared. He looked down at the superhuman who was already dead. Frowning slightly, he threw away the things he was carrying and wiped the blood off the superhuman’s body. Then, he walked out of the container.

……

“Dead?”

Outside the container, Liu Yan and the others were on high alert as they carefully approached.

When she saw Li Hao come out, Liu Yan heaved a sigh of relief.

The next moment, they rushed into the container, but Li Hao didn ‘t.

After a while, Liu Yan and Yun Yao walked out with pale faces.

Chen Jian also looked at Li Hao with a strange expression.

He was ... Really too ruthless!

Was this kid really a newbie?

How many stabs had he made?

Dismembered!

Not to mention Liu Yan and Yun Yao, even he felt his hair stand on end at the sight of it. He couldn’t imagine what Li Hao had done just now. He had grabbed his opponent’s head and stabbed it again and again.

How ruthless!

Reading on Mybo xn o vel. com ,Please!

This time, Liu Yan’s expression also changed, and it took a while for her to recover. She exhaled and said softly,””Are you alright?”

Yue Ming!

He was actually killed by Li Hao!

Earlier, Li Hao had also killed a cultivator in the 100th level. Tonight, this guy actually killed a cultivator in the 100th level and a Yue Ming. Was such a record really something that could be achieved by someone in the tenth realm?

Even if the two of them had underestimated him and ignored him, they would still need to be bold and meticulous, as well as have an extremely strong mental fortitude. Otherwise, lying in front of such an expert without even changing his expression and pretending to be anything ... This was really not something an ordinary person could do. Even she, Liu Yan, would probably not be able to do it.

“I’m fine!”

In fact, Li Hao’s face was also a little pale, but he quickly recovered. He grinned and said,””They’re all bad people! Evil can never defeat justice!”

“We are justice!”

Li Hao hypnotized himself. The next moment, he regained his fighting spirit and said with a smile,”Justice will prevail! Do an act of justice, exterminate the evil and protect the Dao!”

At this moment, he suddenly liked this sentence very much.

As long as I stand on the side of justice, even if I kill them, it’s only right!

Seeing that he had recovered, Liu Yan was relieved, but she was even more worried.

He was worried that this kid had really become a pervert.

You can actually recover so quickly in such a situation ... How does your heart grow?

She was an old woman who had been on the battlefield for a long time. When she saw the situation inside, she couldn’t stand it.

At this moment, yunyao, who usually looked gentle, couldn’t help but whisper,””If you can survive this time ... I’ll help you with some psychological rehabilitation.”

She felt that Liu Yan had always said that she was a pervert, but now she felt that Liu Yan was wrong. That was because she had never met someone more perverted.

Li Hao was one!

A newbie!

This guy, is he mentally okay?

“Yes, sure!” Li Hao nodded.

He didn’t mind receiving help from his teammates. So what if he recovered? in fact, Li Hao didn’t think much of it. He just felt a little uncomfortable earlier. Now that he couldn’t see it, it wasn’t a big problem.

“Li Hao, if you can survive this time ... I believe that you’ll have a place in both the superpowers and the martial masters!”

At this moment, Yun Yao added.

The way she looked at Li Hao was different from before.

If this guy didn’t die, then many people wouldn’t be able to sleep.

Li Hao seemed to be a little shy and said awkwardly,””Sister Yun, don’t say that. I’m just a mere ten decapitation realm cultivator. I’m not even a super. This is too embarrassing ...”

The few of them did not speak again.

Liu Yan took a deep breath and said in a deep voice,””Let’s not talk about this. We don’t know what’s going on with boss. Set up immediately. If boss is not dead, he will definitely come here! As long as boss can enter the cargo ... If those supers accidentally break in ... With more than 100 martial masters inside, killing Yueming will be as easy as drinking water!”

With their superpowers suppressed, it would be strange if the supers did not die when they encountered a Martial Master!

If they weren’t in the cargo, it wouldn’t have been so easy for Li Hao to kill this Water-type superhuman. The mysterious energy in his body was extremely strong, and even Liu Yan found it difficult to break through it, much less Li Hao.

At this moment, Li Hao also pulled himself together. He laughed and said,”Mm! “I realized that supers are more arrogant and gullible. They rashly obtain power and have no foundation at all. It’s very likely that these guys will chase us in!”

If it was a Martial Master, Li Hao felt that it would be very difficult for Liu Long to deceive his teacher, who was a treacherous ... Ahem, an experienced senior.

But supers?

Li Hao really felt that these guys were easier to fool. They looked down on martial masters, so it was hard not to be fooled.

At this moment, no one mentioned Li Hao’s murder.

Chen Jian, on the other hand, looked at Li Hao pitifully, then looked at Wu Chao, who was still lying on the ground not far away, with some desire.

He hoped that Li Hao wouldn’t forget about Wu Chao.

He could channel a little of that power to save the people. Otherwise, Wu Chao would be dead, and even yunyao wouldn’t be able to save him.

Li Hao didn’t say anything. He hadn’t forgotten about this.

It was just that ... He inserted a little bit into Wu Chao’s body and realized that this person’s injuries were really too severe. He probably wouldn’t be able to be saved in a short time. Thus, Li Hao didn’t input too much. He wanted to keep his life for now and take his time after this matter was over.

……

Just as they were setting up the warehouse.

Liu Long and the others were also almost at the warehouse.

Chapter 158: Chapter 40 sunlight (6)
Of the ten supers, Liu Long had killed three in his surprise attack, Yuan Shuo had killed one, the inspector had killed another in a random firing, and now Li Hao had killed another. In the blink of an eye, a large number of them were dead.

At that moment, only four supers were chasing Liu Long ... And Yuan Shuo.

Yuan Shuo had already met up with Liu Long at this time. His old face was ashen.

Liu Long dragged him along, afraid that this guy would die on the road of escape.

“Old man Yuan, hold on!”

Liu Long was somewhat anxious. He didn’t know how Li Hao and the others were doing, but old man Yuan might be the first to die tonight.

“Don’t worry ... I can still hold on for a while ...”

Yuan Shuo panted and looked behind him. There were four supers chasing after them.

Yuan Shuo glanced at the four of them, but he did not pay much attention to them. He was more focused on sensing another force, the brilliance of the sun!

“Just one sunlight?”

Yuan Shuo thought to himself,’if there’s only sunlight, then tonight’s operation is doomed to fail.’

Because as far as he knew, the night patrollers also had sunlight.

Even if he did not go all out, these guys might not succeed this time.

“One sunlit city, ten Dark Moon cities ... And many martial masters ... They really think highly of Li Hao!”

In terms of strength, such a team was enough to deal with Yuan Shuo, Liu Long, the night patrolman, and the inspector. Li Hao didn’t need to take them seriously.

Reading on Mybo xn o vel. com ,Please!

However, after so many years of planning, and knowing that their plan to kill Li Hao had been exposed, did they send a sunlight sect member to take charge?

If it was really the three major organizations, it would not be so simple!

“Why don’t we not make a move? if we do, we have to kill a powerful one and make the other party suffer heavy losses!”

The loss of high-end forces was the real reason for the other party to stop. Otherwise, with the death of one riyao, the other party might not be afraid and might even continue to attack.

Sunlight was strong, but there were dozens of them in Silver Moon province.

The three major organizations would not be afraid of losing one of their members.

Yuan Shuo chose to continue waiting!

Even if the other party had an expert, they might not appear at the first moment. When an expert appeared, they would be more cautious and would only appear after making sure that there was no ambush. Otherwise, they would have to be careful of the night patrollers ambushing them.

“The one at the back, the night patrolman will deal with him! Even the Nightwalker’s sunlight has appeared. If there are still experts, there’s a high probability that they will appear after making sure that they won’t be ambushed!”

As for Li Hao ... He wouldn’t die so quickly, and these people wouldn’t kill him so easily. They needed to wait.

This was why he wasn’t in a hurry. Li Hao wouldn’t die anyway.

As for the others, Yuan Shuo was not so soft-hearted either. If a few of them died, it would be worth it even if they could kill a top-notch existence.

……

Just as the two sides were in pursuit.

Further back.

Wang Ming was being held by an old man as he flew through the air.

“Elder Huang, aren’t you going to make a move?” Wang Ming was a little anxious.

Yuan Shuo and Liu Long seemed to be unable to hold on any longer!

The old man who was carrying him didn’t say anything. He only looked around silently. After a moment, he slowly said,””We haven’t reached the place yet!”

Not there yet?

Before Wang Ming could figure it out, he was directly thrown out in the next moment, and the old man’s voice rang in his ear.”Go find Hu Hao and Li Meng. Join forces with Liu Long and the others and kill those guys!”

Wang Ming hadn’t come back to his senses when suddenly, a thunderclap rang out in all directions!

“Huang Yun, the night patrolmen actually sent out sunlight. It seems that you’ve forgotten the pain from before!”

The sound of thunder reverberated in all directions. The next moment, a figure that looked like a Thunder God appeared in the sky.

On the night watchman’s side, the old man called Huang Yun had a grave expression.””Blizzard Silver city’s eight great families ... Looks like we still haven’t uncovered some of their secrets. You actually sent out a lightning-type sunlit expert!”

Supers who were the best at fighting!

The thunder-god-like sunshine powerhouse laughed,””Why don’t we both take a step back? we only want Li Hao. You can take the others, including Yuan Shuo and Liu Long ... Otherwise, there might be one less sunlit realm on the night patrol today!”

Huang Yun didn’t reply.

There was only silence.

This time, the night patrolmen had tried their best to get him to Silver City. He thought that a powerhouse at the sun glory realm had already exceeded his opponent’s expectations, but in the end ... He still fell into a disadvantage.

Which of the three great organizations did the other party come from?

He knew that he was probably no match for this person. Although they were both in the solar brilliance realm, his mysterious energy was not as strong as his opponent ‘s, and his opponent was also of the lightning element.

At this moment, Huang Yun felt a little weak and said in a low voice,””Why do you have to mess up the world? With the rise of superpowers, you guys have forgotten that you were once a mortal too!”

“You don’t understand!”

The Thunder God-like powerhouse didn’t care what he said. He laughed and the next moment, a bolt of lightning exploded!

The battle of sunlight broke out in the wilderness.

The collision of lightning and Hurricane!

In the small silver City, a rare battle of sunlight broke out.

Chapter 159: Master and disciple hurt, parting (1)
Translator: 549690339
Li Hao didn’t lie to the Super.

Although it was a little late, the battle of sunlight had indeed broken out.

In the rainy night, the collision between the lightning and the hurricane erupted more than ten miles away from the warehouse.

The light of the lightning illuminated the entire area.

……

Outside the warehouse.

Li Hao looked in that direction with a grave expression. Over there, two mysterious energies as dazzling as the sun erupted.

At this moment, lightning flashed, and one could even see two figures fighting in the air.

It could fly!

Their superpowers did not seem to be flying, but they were indeed flying high in the sky. One stepped on lightning while the other spun around in a storm. The storm and lightning constantly collided!

There was only the sound of battle. At this moment, the two top experts didn’t communicate.

The night patrolman made his move.

……

In the distance.

Liu Long turned around and his expression changed slightly.

Reading on Mybo xn o vel. com ,Please!

Sunlight!

The sunlit mercenary group was here, and not just a 10-man team, but also a sunlit mercenary ... If the Nightwalker did not show up, the Silver City would not have been able to stop them!

The four Dark Moon supers who were chasing after them turned around.

Looking at the two sunbeams who were mysteriously colliding with each other in the air, Ghostface revealed a look of yearning.

Sunlight!

Compared to Yue Ming, sunlight was much stronger.

If it was said that supers at the level of Dark Moon could be killed by ordinary hot weapons, but at the level of sunshine, unless a city-destroying weapon was used, the other party’s speed, defense, and perception were all powerful to a special extent.

You haven’t even locked onto your target, but they can already sense it.

For example, the moment Yuan Shuo stepped into Qian combat, he told Li Hao that Qian combat was a God!

Ordinary people couldn’t see or sense the red shadow.

However, douqian could sense it. Even if it couldn’t see anything, it could still sense where the red shadow was. As long as the red shadow moved, Yuan Shuo would be able to notice it.

These were the powerhouses at the douqian and the sunlit realm, and they were much stronger than Yue Ming.

“Huang Yun!”

Liu Long looked into the distance. He recognized the Esper and his face turned serious,””Huang Yun ... He was previously in charge of the third-ranked flowing Cloud City. I didn’t expect him to come!”

He knew that the night patrolman had come, but he did not expect it to be this person. This person was not weak among the night patrolmen. At least in the Silver Moon province, he was a top-notch existence.

However ... It was visible to the naked eye that in this rainy night, the enemy’s lightning ability was even stronger. In the air, the thunderstorm collided, and the storm was clearly suppressed. Lightning flashed, and Huang Yun’s figure was drifting in the hurricane, somewhat unstable.

He wasn’t his match!

Who was that lightning expert?

Liu Long’s expression was extremely grave.

A top existence at the sun glory realm and ten Dark Moon supers. What kind of powerful superpower organization wanted to kill Li Hao?

It was even more powerful than expected!

“Let’s go ... Who cares what he’s doing? we need to protect ourselves first!”

Yuan Shuo coughed. What were you looking at?

Although Huang Yun couldn’t defeat that person, he wouldn’t be defeated so quickly either. They were both from sunlight, so the difference wasn’t too big. He wouldn’t be defeated so quickly.

Run first!

The reason why he ran was that Yuan Shuo felt that since the sun glory had appeared, then ... Something might happen to Li Hao.

It was time!

This sunlight had been waiting until now and had not made a move. He was probably also waiting.

They were not far from the warehouse.

Liu Long gritted his teeth and held the short axe in his hand. He looked at the few people chasing behind him and said,””Fight back! There are still three dark moons on the night patrollers ‘side. Since the night patrollers have already made their move, we can join forces to kill them now!”

There were only 4 Yue Ming on the other side, while there were 3 more night patrollers on the other side. In addition to Liu Long and the heavily injured Yuan Shuo ... Their combat strength was still roughly equal.

Of course, the red shadow did not count.

That thing was too annoying.

However, no matter what, he was much stronger than before.

As for the warehouse, the ice crystal barrier was just a precaution. If he could kill the other party here, that would be even better. He might even be able to help Huang Yun.

At this moment, a thunderous voice boomed,””Night patrollers, get involved and deal with them! Let them know that today is no longer their era!”

So what if he was a night patrol?

The Silver City had mobilized one sunlit and three dark moons, which was the limit of the night patrols.

The superpower organizations were free to do whatever they wanted. However, night patrols had their own missions and a defensive area. Silver City was not within the defensive area and was not under Huang Yun’s jurisdiction. This was the limit of what Silver Moon province could do with so many night patrols.

If more people were to be transferred over, the other defense areas might have problems.

It was not like the night patrolmen had never suffered losses before. In addition to the heavy losses in the remains, many superpower organizations were eyeing them covetously and even secretly looking for an opportunity to kill the night patrolmen.

Behind Liu Long and the others, the four ghost-faced supers stopped in their tracks.

Further back, Wang Ming had just met up with Hu Hao and the others. Seeing this, Wang Ming looked a little excited. The night patrolmen were going to establish their might today! The superpower organizations will have to think twice before killing these guys!”

For the young people in the night patrollers ‘organization, there were not many things to consider!

They only knew that in recent years, the night patrolmen had been very aggrieved.

He was under control everywhere!

The higher-ups even had different opinions. Some of the higher-ups even suggested that some of the superpower organizations should join them, giving them special privileges and distributing some benefits. This caused the night watchers to become more and more unstable.

Chapter 160: Master and disciple hurt and parted (2)
Translator: 549690339
Wang Ming had even vaguely heard that at the night patrollers ‘headquarters, there was an expert who surpassed the radiant sun level who was planning something in the hope of obtaining independent law enforcement power.

When a person’s strength far exceeded that of an ordinary person, and even firearms could not hurt them, sometimes, their desires would be infinitely magnified!

And now, other than the central region, other places, such as a remote province like silver Moon province, were already covered in smoke. The turmoil had begun.

The rise of the supers in 20 years allowed the superpower organization to grow rapidly.

At Wang Ming’s words, the third eye between Li Meng’s brows opened, and he looked a little excited. “It’s Ming bro! Brother Ming is here! Hu Hao, let’s kill them together!”

Excitement!

She recognized Wang Ming, a genius of the young generation in Silver Moon province, The Night Watcher. Although he wasn’t a blessed God tier master, he had only become a super a few years ago, and was now an expert at the Dark Moon tier.

According to the detailed ranking introduced by the night watchers three years ago, Dark Moon was also divided into Half Moon, Half Moon, and full moon.

Wang Ming, who had become a super less than five years ago, was now at the peak of the half-moon level, close to the full-moon level.

As for Hu Hao and Li Meng, Li Meng was only a waning moon. Hu Hao had been here for nearly half a month, but he still hadn’t reached this half a month.

Li Meng was naturally excited to see Wang Ming at this moment.

Among the night watchers, the younger generation all hoped to make a name for themselves, but reality did not allow them to do so. Even Huang Yun had made his move today. Li Meng felt that their chance had come.

“Kill!”

Wang Ming didn’t care about this. He was also very excited, and in a flash, a Sword of Light condensed in his hand.

Hu Hao was a little serious. Those people weren’t easy to deal with!

Reading on Mybo xn o vel. com ,Please!

However, at this point, he could not say anything. He quickly flew into the sky and disappeared into the darkness.

Li Meng’s three eyes opened. At this moment, a red light shot out from his third eye and quickly shot toward the few people in the distance.

……

“You’re ... Stupid!”

At this moment, Yuan Shuo shook his head, and Liu Long sighed.

Three night watchmen with superpowers, their combat experience ... There was no way to describe it.

“Especially that Li Meng. At such a distance, your three eyed divine light’s eruption will only consume your mysterious energy. It’ll be useless.

Although the younger generation of the night patrollers were hot-blooded, their experience ... Was really too lacking.

They were unlike Huang Yun and the others, who had been superhumans for many years. Even if they did not have much combat experience before, they had accumulated a lot of combat experience over the years. This was also why superhumans were less and less concerned about martial masters.

Originally, martial masters had strong combat experience and abilities. In the first few years of the appearance of supers, even though supers of the same level were stronger than martial masters, had more life insurance, and had more means ... In a life-and-death battle, the supers were often the ones who died.

However, it had been 20 years since then, and the older generation of supers now had combat experience that was no less than that of martial masters.

Liu Long didn’t say anything as he turned around and rushed back!

If he really didn’t care, these three newbies would most likely be killed by the other party.

There was still a gap!

The remaining four guys were not weak and were at the top of the 10-man team. According to Liu Long’s judgment, there was one who was at the peak of over 100, which was the existence of the superpower realm Yueming and full moon.

The remaining three were almost all at the Half Moon level.

There was a high chance that Wang Ming and the others wouldn’t be a match for him.

“AI!”

“Zhang xuan!” Yuan Shuo shouted. Seeing zhang xuan run away, he felt a little helpless.

Don’t you feel guilty for leaving me, a half-disabled old man, here?

Also, did you forget that your mission this time is to protect Li Hao? with so many supers here, you’re not in a hurry to find Li Hao ... Maybe some other strong Esper went to find Li Hao.

Liu Long, that idiot, even at such a critical moment!

Forget it, I’ll go myself.

He dragged his half-crippled body, his face ashen as he gasped for breath and shouted,””I’m going to Li Hao’s place ... These people are not leaving, and instead want to kill the night patrolmen. I’m worried that Li Hao’s side is in danger ... Liu Long ... You guys hurry over ...”

He gasped for breath seven or eight times.

The next moment, he staggered and ran towards the warehouse.

Behind them, a battle instantly broke out.

Seven supers and a Martial Master who was over level 100-eight powerhouses exchanged blows in an instant. In the blink of an eye, Li Meng, who was still excited just a moment ago, let out a blood-curdling screech as his third eye was splattered out by the blood of one of the Thunder super engines.

He was also the superhuman who had previously threatened mu Sen. He was also the leader of this team, a full moon Thunder superhuman.

The only one who could truly deal with him was Liu Long.

Everyone, including Wang Ming, was a level lower than the other.

Liu Long wielded his axe and swung it.

In the next moment, Liu Long’s face paled before he could even touch the other party. He felt his internal organs being burned once again. That thing was back!

He was quite experienced.

Holding the lightsaber, Wang Ming was so excited that he was about to slash someone when he suddenly let out a muffled groan. The mysterious energy dissipated, and the lightsaber in his hand directly shattered unsteadily. Wang Ming spat out blood, his face blank and somewhat puzzled.

What ability?

Liu Long couldn’t help but curse,”idiot, we’ve been following you for so long, can’t you tell?” There’s a spirit-ranked invisible monster that can burn the internal organs and shake the mysterious energy. Be careful!”

He had thought that he had been boiling his blood since these guys had followed him for so long ... Any experienced Martial Master would know that he was in danger, so they would do this.

In the end ... A newbie was still a newbie!
