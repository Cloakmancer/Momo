"A warship?"The few of them were somewhat puzzled. At this moment, the battleship was actually not of much use.It would be a waste of resources.Li Hao, why did you ask the R & D department to build warships?Moreover, there were some in both boundless city and heaven battling city. Of course, there were not many. Most of them had been taken away. When the sword Master went to war, he needed a warship to cross the universe.Li Hao only said this and did not say anything else. After making some simple arrangements, he didn't say anything more."Black Panther, come with me. I'm going to take a look at the ruins of star suppression city ... Turtle Guardian and sea-overturning Guardian can come with me. The rest of you, do your own jobs!""Alright," he said.The two saints nodded. The group of four ... Actually, there was only one Saint. The other three were demons. They headed straight for the ruins of the Zhen Xing city.Li Hao didn't bring anyone with him, mainly because he was worried that something might happen.That Zheng Hongyuan had been trying to lure the eight great families "people in, hoping that something would happen to them.Of course, Li Hao also had the bloodline of the Li family. This time, he even brought the words "Zhan Tian" with him, just in case.Li Hao brought the Black Panther along purely because it had just come out of seclusion, and Li Hao was taking it around.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Planet suppression ruins.The tree that was about to turn into a spirit had already withered. Li Hao stepped into it, and the others quickly followed him into the relic.  n0vel online free at ùì∑0ùìøùìÆùìµùì´ùì≤ùì∑ As soon as he entered ... Li Fuhai exclaimed,""It's almost the same as the one in Star Town City! It seems that Zheng Hongyuan has put in a lot of effort to build this fake star suppression city!"Li Hao took a look. There was nothing worth paying attention to. It was also very ordinary, except that it had an ancient feel to it. It was slightly different from the general neo martial relic and felt more ancient.Li Hao stepped on the stone slab and looked around. It seemed that there were no other living people, only Zheng Hongyuan.The city was deathly silent.Of course, the energy in the city was sufficient.The entire ancient city was divided into 12 regions, corresponding to the 12 families of Saturn. They were spread out in a fan shape, and in the center was a Hall. According to li Fuhai, it was set up according to Saturn's meeting hall.In the past, the experts in star suppression city would make some important decisions here.At this moment, Li Hao examined it and frowned. There didn't seem to be anything special.Where was the cutting point of the blood Emperor's land?"Let's go to the meeting hall. "The most special thing about this place was the meeting hall.The group of people quickly walked over.Outside the hall, a few statues appeared."Back then, there were 13 statues outside the conference hall," li Fuhai explained."They represented the 13 families of Saturn. One family was destroyed, leaving behind 12 statues. They represented the 12 families of Saturn in controlling the city!"Li Hao counted and suddenly said,"there are only eight statues!"Li Fuhai and the old turtle hurriedly looked over. The next moment, the old turtle had an idea."This ... Could it be that they represent the Silver Moon eight great families?"Li Hao raised his eyebrows and carefully examined them again. The statues were very blurry. He didn't know whether it was because they didn't deliberately carve out their appearances or for some other reason, but there were only statues and nothing else.Li Hao examined the statue and found that it was very simple.However, one of the statues flickered with a faint light, as if it would be extinguished at any moment.Li Fuhai looked at it carefully and said,""It should represent the eight great families, but this flickering light probably represents the Zheng family! As a Heavenly King, Zheng Hongyuan didn't need to change the original appearance of star suppression city with some useless things ... So, these eight statues might be a little special. " Li Hao nodded slightly and looked at the hall surrounded by the eight statues. Perhaps ... The place he was looking for was in this Hall.Zheng Hongyuan didn't stay with his son. Instead, he came here and built a city by himself. It couldn't be because he had nothing better to do. There must have been some arrangements.After thinking for a while, Li Hao walked into the hall.The main hall was very simple. At this moment, eight Thrones and a round table surrounded the main hall.The feeling of an eight-party meeting!As for the eight Thrones, they all seemed to be extraordinary. With just one look, one could tell that these Thrones were made from divine weapons. Furthermore, their grades were not low.One of them was a little shiny, perhaps because Zheng Hongyuan often sat on it. The other seven were a little new.However, Li Hao soon frowned.Suddenly, he saw a chair beside the Zheng family. The throne was also very luxurious and new, but ... It seemed like someone had sat on it before. He wondered if it was Zheng Hongyuan who had sat on it before.The reason for this feeling was that there was a slight wear and tear on the throne.Ordinary people couldn't see it, but Li Hao's heart moved when he saw it. This kind of wear and tear felt like ... The sword intent was too strong, and some of it leaked out, causing the throne to be worn.Otherwise, the divine weapon throne would not be so easily damaged.Li Hao was slightly shocked!Suddenly, the sword essence on his body overflowed, and he shouted in a low voice,""Li daoheng! Is that you?"His sword intent spread out and shot out in all directions!Very quickly, it had almost enveloped the entire city. The two saints were also shocked and immediately became alert.Li Hao waited for a while, but he didn't detect any living beings.He frowned slightly and said after a long time,"the Li family might have been here before!."As soon as he said that, li Fuhai was shocked and said,""No way? "This place should have been built before the heavenly transformation. Zheng Hongyuan should have entered this place after the heavenly transformation and never left. When the heavenly transformation occurred, experts can't leave ... Why would the Li family come here?"Unless ... It was right after the recovery.21 years ago, their clones might have been able to walk out of it.When they thought of this, their expressions changed.What did this mean?It meant that after the recovery of the world, there were members of the Li family walking around. Li daoheng?Li Hao also frowned. The Snake King said that the person who taught it had sword intent, and the ruins of Star Town City also had some scratches left by sword intent ... In that case, there were indeed people from the Li family outside the seal.Sword intent might not have been left behind by the Li family, but ... Li Hao felt that there shouldn't be any other sword Dao experts besides the Li family.Li daoheng was the most suspicious.This person was the only one known to have betrayed the Li family. He had also roped in many people to betray him.But why was there no trace of him in the Silver Moon?There were traces of him in all the ancient cities, and even Zheng Hongyuan had appeared, but why had he not seen him before?Many thoughts appeared in his mind.Also, what was this person here for?It seemed that there were some important things left in this fake star Town City.At this moment, Li Hao looked at the throne. Perhaps he would know something if he sat on it.[PS: the voting for the Golden keyboard seems to have started again. Poor Eagle has only won it twice. It seems a little difficult to win it three times. Everyone, please vote. It's not a bad idea to get another one. Just vote for free. It seems like you'll get one vote each time. That's all.]

In the discussion hall.Li Hao fell into deep thought as he looked at the eight Thrones.Zheng Hongyuan had spent so much effort to build a big city and restore star suppression city. Perhaps he had the intention of fishing, but it was definitely not just for fishing. If that was the case ... The other party must be too idle.The dividing point...Eight parts of heaven and earth, eight Thrones, eight great families ...There must be something special about this place.  n0vel online free at ùì∑0ùìøùìÆùìµùì´ùì≤ùì∑ If Li Hao thought of this, the others naturally thought of it as well. Li Fuhai's voice was heavy. "Don't rashly sit on it, this thing might be a bit special, it might extract the bloodline of the eight great families or something ..."He could guess a thing or two.Perhaps this was the reason why Zheng Hong Yuan had invited the eight great families "powerhouses here.Perhaps that treasure land could only be opened by the joint efforts of the eight great families.What did the blood Emperor leave behind?He dared to say that he could deal with Red Moon sovereign?Li Hao was very curious. He thought for a while and said,"if it's a treasure left behind by the blood Emperor, I don't think it will kill us!" If Zheng Hongyuan had set up some traps, we would've already killed him. Why would we need to be afraid of his traps?"If the blood Emperor had left a treasure behind, it wouldn't have caused them any fatal injuries.Perhaps there was a test ... But directly killing a member of the eight great families was not in line with the character of a venerable sovereign.It made sense, but it was still very dangerous.Li Fuhai still wanted to say something, but Li Hao said,""The sea Protector said that cowardice is the reason why some people can't rise. Since we've come here, are we going to stop and give up? Because he was afraid of unknown danger, he gave up on investigating? Then, we're no different from the Zheng family. "Li Hao smiled."Besides ... I'm blessed by heaven's will. With the existence of the bright star sector, it won't be a big problem!" The two saints will protect me. If there are any problems, you can either devour my bloodline or kill me ... The two of you can directly cut off my physical body!""What?"The two of them were stunned. Kill you?"I was worried that I would fall into a trap and be unable to escape, so I cut off my physical body and left my divine text behind. The divine text can escape into the bright star realm, and it's nothing more than reconstructing my physical body!"Hearing him say this, the two powerhouses thought for a moment and didn't say anything.The old turtle thought for a moment, then said,""Then ... Lord Marquis, please take me with you. I'm only the soul of a divine weapon, so divine weapons shouldn't be considered foreign objects. Otherwise, divine weapons can't be carried around, and it'll be fine if it's just a bare land ..."As soon as he finished speaking, it turned into a suit of armor that looked like a black turtle.Li Hao didn't say anything. He picked up the tortoiseshell, which quickly covered his body as an additional layer of protection.Woof! Woof! Woof!The Black Panther cried out, a little worried."I'm fine. "Li Hao pondered for a moment. Instead of going to the other Thrones, he sat on the one that was slightly worn out by the sword intent.BOOM!The moment Li Hao sat down, a powerful sword intent seemed to burst out, preventing him from sitting down. However, it was only a remnant of the sword intent. Li Hao snorted and released his sword intent.BOOM! With a loud bang, the remaining sword intent was shattered.Li Hao directly sat down.BOOM!There was another loud noise. The moment Li Hao sat down, the throne suddenly emitted dazzling light. The sky and earth were spinning, and an illusory space and time seemed to appear in front of Li Hao.At this moment, a powerful suction force came from the chair.Just as he had guessed, this chair was not ordinary. At this moment, it seemed to be devouring the bloodline power in Li Hao's body. The old turtle's voice rang in his ears."This thing ... Is a top-grade divine weapon ... It's a Heavenly King's weapon. This Zheng Hongyuan ... He's really bold!"This chair was a Heavenly King's weapon!At this moment, a majestic restraining force was released, imprisoning Li Hao. Not only that, but an even stronger devouring force was also released, continuously absorbing Li Hao's blood.Li Hao's expression was calm.What was there to be surprised about when he could have guessed it?He was just curious, what did Zheng Hongyuan want to get by paying such a high price?Absorbing the bloodlines of the eight great families ... This was something many people were doing.Ying Hongyue was doing it, Red Moon sovereign was doing it, and the Zheng family was also doing it.The eight great families ... Were actually nothing special.The strongest one was only the sword Saint.However, the Li family actually did not have the direct bloodline of the revered Sword Master, so the bloodline of the eight great families was really just ordinary. Could it be that the eight great families still had some secrets that he did not know about?Other than revered sword, the strongest member of the eight great families was only the Heavenly King.Was the bloodline of a Heavenly King very precious?And it was a bloodline from countless generations later.Thus, Li Hao was indeed curious as to why the bloodlines of the eight great families could resist the power of the Crimson Moon of venerable sovereigns, and how the bloodlines of the eight great families could deal with venerable sovereigns."Eight great families ..."Li Hao mumbled and said softly, turtle guard, release the restrictions and let it absorb! I want to see what this thing can do by absorbing my bloodline power. ""This ..."The old turtle was stunned. He really wasn't afraid of death.Although the Heavenly King was dead, the traps left behind by the Heavenly King might really be able to kill a Saint. Was Li Hao not worried at all?It wasn't that Li Hao wasn't worried, but there were some things that had to be made clear.If he didn't get to the bottom of this, he wouldn't be at ease.The danger he saw was not danger.The unknown danger was what he was worried about.At this moment, when Li Hao released the restriction, the world seemed to be spinning. The suction force on the chair became stronger and stronger, and the power of red blood seeped out and flowed out of his body.

Li Hao's aura weakened a little.At this moment, they seemed to have traveled through the void and appeared in another place.Where was this place?Li Hao's eyes flickered. He took a look and found that this seemed to be an empty world, and the surroundings were a little foggy.At this moment, the other seven chairs seemed to have appeared as well, but there was no one sitting on them. From all directions, they formed a circle and moved closer to the center.Suddenly, a wave of pressure followed.The pressure reminded Li Hao of someone, the red moon Thearch!The last time he saw red Moon sovereign in the seal, he also felt a strong pressure from him, making him feel a little suffocated. At this moment, it was the same. It was not Red Moon sovereign, but that kind of pressure, similar to that of a venerable sovereign!A treasure left behind by the blood Emperor?The golden light in Li Hao's eyes pierced through the void and looked at the center of the world. This place seemed to be another space, another world. Where was this?The Black Panther and Li Fuhai beside him had disappeared, only the tortoiseshell was still there.The devouring force on the chairs continued to absorb Li Hao's bloodline. After absorbing the power of the blood, the chairs gradually moved closer to the center of the world. The other seven chairs seemed to have stopped moving.It was obvious that the other chairs couldn't move forward without the support of bloodline power."Interesting ..."Li Hao's aura was a little weaker, and his qi and blood were a little weak, but he still didn't stop the chair from absorbing him. He let the chair fly forward with him, as if he were traveling through space.Gradually, they were getting closer and closer to the dark area in the center!"Eh ..."Li Hao looked into the distance and let out a puzzled sound.The old turtle's shell was trembling, and a sense of fear and respect came from deep within his bones. He also extended some of his mind power to look into the distance, and a wave of venerable sovereign pressure spread from the distance.It could barely make out ... Something was floating in that place.It didn't look real, and every time it looked, it felt like its mental energy was broken.It didn't see it clearly, but Li Hao did.It was a saber, a blood-red saber. Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  This saber was somewhat special. It had an octagonal shape, and the blade seemed to be divided into eight sides, one of which was facing Li Hao.Li Hao's eyes glittered.The blood Emperor's saber?He had once seen the shadow of the other party with a long saber at his waist and a long bow on his back. The other party had used the blood-red long saber to break the heaven and earth that day, but ... Why did the other party leave his weapon behind?This Silver Moon ... What was so special about him?The human King also left behind her sword.Celestial ruler Batian Emperor ... Or rather, iron head venerable sovereign, who was embarrassed to say it, had also left his boxing gloves.Many top venerable sovereigns had left their weapons behind. In addition, the sword venerable had also left behind his sword.Why?The Silvermoon small world was not even valued. It was just a small world given to the sword Saint. Why were there so many top-tier weapons left behind?Zheng Hongyuan had been plotting to seize this blood saber?The saber of the blood Emperor could deal with a venerable sovereign?It can't be!A weapon was just a weapon. If the venerable sovereign of the red moon was not even as good as a saber of the blood Emperor, he would just kill himself.The weapons of the human King and the others seemed to be just so-so.He was indeed strong, but it would be a joke to say that he could kill a venerable sovereign with just a weapon.Li Hao was confused.At this moment, the blood-red saber seemed to be spinning. Li Hao focused his eyes on it and was suddenly stunned ... That saber seemed to be extraordinary.The blood Emperor's saber was definitely not ordinary!However, not only was the pressure on the saber extremely powerful, but he could also vaguely see something inside the saber ..."A seal?"Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. Was this saber suppressing something?What was going on in this small world?First, the red moon Emperor had been sealed, the world had been destroyed, the mineral veins had disappeared, and the origin had disappeared. Now, the blood Emperor seemed to be using his own weapon to suppress something.Silver Moon ... Was he born by accident, or was he born to seal something?Li Hao had a headache.However, the chair had absorbed a large amount of his qi and blood. At this moment, he couldn't move forward or get close to it. Li Hao felt that if the chair continued sucking, he would really die."The eight great families ... The eight experts had to work together to suppress the venerable sovereign's pressure and get close to the saber ... So Zheng Hongyuan wanted the experts from the eight great families to come together for a meeting and extract the power of the bloodline to get close to the saber ... Is that right?"There was something wrong with this saber, it was too strong!The pressure was too strong!Li Hao was a Saint, but he couldn't get close to the other party. It was unbelievable. Obviously, Zheng Hongyuan couldn't get close either. That guy was a Heavenly King!Under normal circumstances, a weapon without an owner would not be so powerful.For example, celestial ruler Batian's gloves, human Queen's sword, and starry sky sword were all venerable sovereign weapons. However, without their owners, they might be powerful enough to pose a threat to Saints when they self-destructed, but couldn't a Heavenly King easily suppress them?"Strange!"As Li Hao thought to himself, he once again released a burst of vitality and actively fused it with the throne. The throne once again advanced a little.At this moment, Li Hao could see it even more clearly!There was indeed something in that saber.

That ... Seemed like ... A sleeping cat?A cat?Li Hao was dazed.Why was there a cat?BOOM!At this moment, the saber suddenly exploded with a powerful pressure that shook the world.Bang! Bang!The throne was shattered by the impact. The turtle shell on Li Hao's body suddenly creaked, and he shuddered in pain."Great emperor ..."BOOM!The throne broke through the sky, and Li Hao disappeared from this space.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  BEst novel online free at ’ºO ã…õ ü…Æ…®’º  Boom! Boom! Boom!Loud noises were heard continuously.As the eight Thrones appeared, the Furious roars of the Black Panther and Li Fuhai's shocked voice rang out.Boom! Boom! Boom!Li Hao felt as if all his bones had been shattered. He was a little dazed, but soon, two words appeared in his mind: Zhan Tian!The moment these two words appeared, the riot was suppressed.At this moment, the chair was still absorbing Li Hao's vitality, as if it wanted to kill him."Lord Marquis!"Li Fuhai's voice could be heard,"can the Marquis escape?" If I can't ... Then I'll cut off Lord Marquis's physical body ..."This was what Li Hao said himself.Li Fuhai must have called for a while, but seeing that Li Hao didn't respond, he began to consider whether to cut off Li Hao's body.At this moment, divine runes burst out in Li Hao's mind. The power of a great Dao emerged, and a small sword appeared. With a boom, the small sword pierced through the world, cut off everything, and destroyed the devouring power.When he opened his eyes ... A hoof was aimed at his head, as if it was going to hit him."Stop!"Li Hao hurriedly shouted and stopped. Li Fuhai looked at Li Hao with worry in his eyes.""Is Lord Marquis alright?"He's escaped? Li Hao quickly got up. He was a little weak. He staggered, and the turtle shell on his body fell off. The old turtle transformed into a human, but his face was pale and filled with shock.Li Hao didn't say anything. He looked at the chair and mumbled,""I see!"The wear and tear on the chair were not deliberately left behind.Rather, in order to escape, he had used his sword intent, leaving behind a mark.Clearly, back then, someone had sat down here and witnessed the scene that he had seen. He had escaped and his powerful sword intent had destroyed everything, but it had left some scratches on the chair.Li daoheng?If that was the case ... This person should not be weak.A Saint?Heavenly King?But it couldn't be too strong either, because if it was really strong, it wouldn't have left such a mark. If the sword intent was extremely strong, it wouldn't have left such a mark.Or perhaps ... The other party had seen even more, making it difficult for him to escape? Countless thoughts appeared in his mind.Zheng Hongyuan had been planning for so many years for that knife ... Perhaps that knife wasn't the key, but the existence within the knife, the great emperor?He looked at the old turtle and heard the old turtle call him Emperor.It was said that the great emperor was Emperor Cang.Emperor Cang was a cat?A cat was branded on the armor of Yuanping martial Sciences University.The Imperial Palace guarded by the Imperial Guards also looked like a cat.The tree that fed the fruit to the Emperor Guard's father ... The fruit seemed to be a cat too.So, Emperor Cang ... Was a cat?Emperor Cang was sealed in the saber?That was impossible!Li Hao shook his head. How could that be possible?It was said that in the new martial era, the human king and emperor Cang divided the heaven and earth equally. They were both the Masters of the heaven and earth and the world, so the world was divided into two.How could Emperor Cang be sealed by the blood Emperor here?What a joke!At this moment, li Fuhai was also confused,""Just now, you disappeared for a moment. Where did you go? What was this chair? I searched for a while, but it was as if you had disappeared into thin air. I couldn't find you at all, and then you suddenly appeared again ...""Little turtle," he said, looking at the old turtle."What's wrong?"The old turtle was a little dazed, and after a long time, he said,""I ... I think ... I sensed the aura of a great emperor ..." He said."What?""The aura of a great emperor ..."Li Fuhai's body trembled as if he had heard something extremely terrifying. He wanted to run away as if he was extremely afraid of something.But the next moment, he suddenly came back to his senses and couldn't help but curse,""I've seen your ancestor! How was that possible? In the main world, the great emperor is in charge of the universe of origin and the yin-yang world. It's impossible for him to appear here ... If he really did appear here, the heavens would have been overturned!"Who are you trying to scare?The old turtle also suspected that he had sensed it wrong, and he said in horror,""Maybe ... Maybe I sensed it wrong, or ... Or maybe the great emperor left something behind?"That person was truly an unparalleled existence.In the neo martial world, in terms of invincibility, the human King was invincible, the Emperor Cang was invincible, and even the Supreme martial artist was a level lower.After all, these two were the rulers of the world.If Emperor Cang was here, would there still be the red moon Emperor?And the matter of neo martial's traitor?Thinking about it, the old turtle felt that he had seen wrong.Li Hao, on the other hand, frowned slightly. After a long time, he said,""That world is the world that the throne was teleported to. There was a saber, a blood-red saber, and ... There seemed to be ... A cat sleeping inside?""What?"Li Fuhai's face turned pale as if his head was about to explode. His four hooves trembled and he said,""Blood Emperor killed Emperor Cang?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao looked at it without saying anything.The old turtle was also speechless. Why did you think of this?It was a little puzzled,'No... How could this be ... Emperor Cang can't be here, absolutely not!' If Emperor Cang is here, this world will no longer be a small world. The new martial Lord world will lose half of its energy and the entire world will be in chaos. Emperor Cang will not be able to leave. "

2144 Chapter 361
The two of them were extremely confused.Li Hao was also confused and confused."I don't understand your situation either! Now I know why Zheng Hongyuan wanted to take the saber. It's too powerful. Just its pressure was enough to injure two saints. If he wields this saber, perhaps ... He can really pose a threat to venerable sovereigns, but he can't get close to them. "Speaking of this, he was a little puzzled,""It seems that the bloodline power of the eight great families can be used to approach them ... I'm very curious, is there anything special about the eight great families? Why do so many things require the eight great families "help?" He looked at the two neo martial artists in confusion.Other than the sword venerable, the strongest of the eight great families was only a Heavenly King, and some were even only Saints.With such a group of clansmen ... They were barely able to guard the gate.However, why were the things left behind by the blood Emperor and the sword venerable related to the eight great families?The old turtle was also confused,"the weapon left behind by the blood Emperor is also related to the eight great families?."It didn't understand this either.The Stargate left behind by the sword venerable was still fine. After all, the eight great families controlled the world. Eight keys formed a large formation. It was actually understandable that the eight great families had to step in.However, there was no reason for the blood Emperor to have anything to do with the eight great families.There was no need for that.Li Fuhai didn't think about this and was still breathing in."The blood Emperor also left behind a weapon? In the face of a great enemy, why did these experts leave their weapons behind? Even if it's not of much help to them, it's still better to give it to someone else than to stay in the small world, right?"The few of them looked at each other, their faces blank. They did not understand.And, was there really a cat in the knife?At the thought of this, li Fuhai was a little frightened. Was Emperor Cang really here?That was impossible!It knew that Emperor Cang loved to eat beef. It was too terrifying.Li Hao, on the other hand, kept frowning.He definitely hadn't dug out all the secrets of the eight great families.Unfortunately, Zheng Hongyuan was dead. This guy was the patriarch of the Zheng family of the eight great families, so he definitely knew something. As for those who remained, like director Wang, they were only descendants of the Wang family, so they definitely didn't know.  BEst novel online free at ’ºO ã…õ ü…Æ…®’º  As for the others, they were in danger as well.As for the family heads of the other families, they had all left. In that case, perhaps ... Only Zheng Yu knew the situation.Of course, if li daoheng had been here before, the Li clan might have known something."The blood Emperor's blade was left in the core area where the blood Emperor shattered the world ...""There's a cat in the knife ..."These clues couldn't give Li Hao any more answers.He felt that there was nothing to gain from it. He couldn't even get close to it, so what benefits could he gain?It was wrong!The next moment, Li Hao's heart moved.Who said there were no benefits! The pressure of a venerable sovereign!The last time he saw red Moon sovereign, he was already terrified and did not dare to continue looking, worried that Red Moon sovereign would really invade him. But what if ... He comprehended the venerable sovereign's pressure here?Once he got used to the venerable sovereign's pressure ... It was also a kind of cultivation, right?It was true that there was no way to get close, but it was still beneficial to keep feeling, comprehending, and resisting. This was a venerable sovereign!Moreover, the blood Emperor was no ordinary venerable sovereign.In the new martial era, the strongest people were indeed the human Kings. Following that, the blood Emperor and the others would be the top existences. They were much stronger than some unknown venerable sovereigns, such as the water power and Li Wuji.Between venerable sword and the blood Emperor, who was stronger? it was said that even venerable sword was not as strong as the blood Emperor!The pressure that the other party had left behind was eternal. Wasn't this the best form of training?Also, other than his vitality being absorbed, he didn't suffer any serious injuries. Thinking of the two words "Zhan Tian" in his mind, Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. He could see it clearly, but the old turtle couldn 't. Could it be related to these two words?When he felt the pressure, he only felt that it was very strong, but there were very few other thoughts of fear.He did not feel like he was going to die at any moment like when he was facing Red Moon sovereign.It wasn't that the blood Emperor's pressure wasn't strong. Perhaps the two words 'heaven battling' were also from him, so he could reduce this feeling.Many thoughts flashed through his mind.Li Hao kept thinking. How many more secrets did the Silvermoon world have?He felt that he had seen through it, but at this moment, it seemed that he had not.Also, someone from the Li family had definitely come out!Why had he not appeared?Those who were not from the Li family, even if they were sword cultivators, should not be able to have their qi and blood absorbed, so their sword will would not have erupted for no reason.Li Hao looked at the eight Thrones. Were these things left behind by Zheng Hongyuan or the blood Emperor?If it was left behind by Zheng Hongyuan, it meant that this fellow had made a great discovery and had actually created these eight King Thrones."If the eight great families all sent their people, would they be able to get close to that saber?"At this moment, Li Hao fell into deep thought as he looked at the eight Thrones.Beside him, there was still the Wang family. Director Zhao could be considered a descendant of the Zhao family. Adding on the descendants of his Li family, the other Zhou, Hong, Zheng, Liu, and Zhang families didn't seem to have any inheritances in the outside world.Of course ... Ying Hongyue had the bloodline of eight families!He thought, if he caught this guy and pushed him over, would he be able to get close to the blade?Of course, forget it.It was too dangerous!If the other party really got that saber and stabbed him, wouldn't that be giving him benefits?Li Hao was thinking, and so were the two old turtles. They were both at a loss."The blood Emperor's blade is here ... And ... Emperor Cang? It shouldn't be ... Could it be that the treasures left behind by Emperor Cang are also here? If that's the case ... This place is very important!"

2145 Chapter 361
The old turtle said solemnly,"once this place is taken away, the venerable sovereign's weapon will be taken away. Something bad might happen!" Among the many venerable sovereigns in new martial arts, the blood Emperor's combat strength was extremely strong! If it wasn't for the fact that he was unwilling to accept his predecessor, or rather, the power of his previous generation's heaven-battling Emperor, perhaps ... He might not be weaker than the human Emperor and Emperor Cang!"Li Hao was puzzled, so strong? Those two are world Lords!""He's really strong!""Zhan Tiandi!" The old turtle exclaimed,"since ancient times, the most talented person was Zhan Tiandi!""Eh? Not the human King?"Li Hao was stunned for a moment. Wasn't it said that a human King would reach the level of invincibility in a few years?"The human King's rapid progress is all because of the treasures and inheritance left behind by Zhan Tiandi, which helped the human King to the end ... Zhan Tiandi himself could actually kill the celestial Emperor, the biggest enemy of the new martial era! But ... He gave up. "Li Hao was dumbfounded.It can even be like this?The most talented person in all of history?Wasn't this a little too much?Li Fuhai interjected,"it's not that exaggerated ... The talent of a human King is also unparalleled!" It's true that Zhan Tiandi is powerful, but he's too gentle and gentle to everyone. He's a true sage and refined in his bones ... So it's hard for him to kill ..."Li Hao didn't say anything. He just fell into deep thought.In that case, this saber was really not ordinary.The starry sky sword, the human king's sword, and the celestial ruler's glove were all far inferior to this. Of course, it might also have something to do with the cat inside.This relic was indeed extremely important.Also, can I enter that place without going through the throne?If the throne was built by Zheng Hongyuan, then it should be possible. After all, when it was built, he must have been inside, otherwise he could not be connected to it.  BEst novel online free at ’ºO ã…õ ü…Æ…®’º  It didn't make sense for the blood Emperor to build the eight Thrones.Perhaps at the beginning, all the people of the eight great families could enter?Who knows!Li Hao felt the qi and blood in his body. It was still very weak. It seemed that there was a limit to each entry. If he continued, he might die from being sucked dry."Let's go back first ..."Li Hao glanced at the eight Thrones and said,"at this stage, unless the eight great families gather, it'll be very difficult to get that saber!" Right now, I want to meet Zheng Yu and Ying Hongyue. These two guys seem to know more than I do, and they seem to be gathering the bloodlines of the eight great families!""I'm very curious, what's so special about the eight great families "bloodlines ... Up until now, I haven't felt anything too special, so why can they resist the power of the Crimson Moon?" That was the power of a venerable sovereign!This was a power that even Heavenly Kings found difficult to resist. In the end, a weakling like Ying Hongyue was able to resist it with just a bit of the bloodline power of the eight great families. How strange was this?He didn't really care about this before!No matter how strong Ying Hongyue was, she couldn't be stronger than him at this stage.Where did he get the qualifications to resist?It could even be stripped away, not through the bright star sector, but through itself. Some of it was stripped away and integrated into the forbidden Sea, which was even stranger.The old turtle also shook his head. He was also confused and didn't understand the situation.On the other hand, li Fuhai thought hard,""The eight great families ... I didn't pay much attention to them before. Besides the sword venerable, there weren't any other powerhouses, so they weren't worth mentioning! But according to the Marquis, it was indeed strange! If we want to get to the bottom of this matter, perhaps only the Li family or the eight great families "patriarchs would know ... In any case, when I arrived, the eight great families had already been established!" "Why did they choose these eight schools to manage the world ... I'm not sure.""At that time, there were many stronger families in the origin world than these eight, so there were also people who were willing to come to Silver Moon."Seeing that it couldn't give an explanation, Li Hao smiled and said,""It's fine, we'll figure it out sooner or later! Even if I can't get it now, it doesn't mean that I won't be able to get it forever. If I really get it, maybe ... There's really hope to deal with the venerable sovereign!""It's a pity that it's a saber and not a sword ... But it doesn't matter. Anything can be a sword!"He seemed to be certain that the saber was his.Who asked this relic to be in his hands at this moment? Zheng Hongyuan had planned for many years, but he had not been able to get it. It seemed that he might not be able to succeed even if he relied on the power of the Heavenly King.In the end, I'm afraid that the eight great families will really have to gather together.At this moment, Li Hao recalled the words the blood Emperor had said when he divided the world into eight.He said,"in this world, you can't have any thoughts you shouldn't have. Don't try to leave the origin world in vain. Otherwise, you'd better behave yourself ..." It seemed to be a warning, but it was a warning.He also said that he had used the universe formation to suppress heaven and earth. Could this be the formation that was used before the eight major cities?The formation that sealed venerable Red Moon seemed to be the same one.Venerable the sword was not good at setting up formations, but now, he was able to stop a venerable sovereign for 100000 years with a seal ... Perhaps it was not because The Phantom of venerable the sword was too strong, but the formation left by the other party was too strong.This blood Emperor ... Was really something!The blood Emperor seemed to have done all this as a precaution to prevent the separation of this world. Or did he predict that this world would separate?Li Hao had a headache.Soon, he smiled again, like a chameleon, which confused the two saints. Li Hao smiled and said,""This place is a good place! However, Zheng Yu should know some things now. He knew that his father had stayed here for countless years. Moreover, there must be people in the Li family who knew about this place ... But they couldn't take anything away. It looks like I don't have to worry too much about the things being taken away ..."

As he said this, his eyes suddenly flickered."Ying Hongyue, do you know this place as well?"The two of you are at a loss. How would we know?What could that fellow do even if he knew?Li Hao quickly calculated for a while and said,""Ying Hongyue has been living too comfortably recently. I'm going to visit her soon ..."Comfortable?Li Fuhai wasn't too sure, but the old turtle was very clear. How was he comfortable?From the central region to the North, from the North to the Li Dynasty, from the Li Dynasty to the Western Kingdom of God, he brought the three major organizations and the clear sky divine mountain. There were more than 100000 supers, but there were only 1000 left.Did Li Hao have some misunderstanding about comfort?Li Hao, on the other hand, had all sorts of thoughts.He wanted to meet Ying Hongyue!He hadn't seen that guy for a long time.Although they might not be able to kill him ... He was sure that there was a group of people watching Ying Hongyue nearby. There were Zheng Yu's people, Hongyue's people, and even the Li family's people!With Ying Hongyue as the center, perhaps they could kill a group of experts.The moon goddess was there as well, so it was even more lively.It's so lively, and on my side, there are other people busy with things. I'll just join in the fun and refuse all the trouble!  Best novel online free at n0ŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  As for Zheng Yu's Hurricane city, it would not easily appear now.And ... The other party might have gone to the Silver City.Li Hao laughed after making this judgment.Previously, he had deliberately made such a gesture, and that fellow must have been worried about this. This was good as well. It had restricted Zheng Yu and prevented that venerable sovereign from breaking the seal again.Li Hao had no intention of breaking the seal if he could avoid it.Everything he had done was only to intimidate Zheng Yu.That fellow must have thought that he couldn't win against him, so he disregarded everything else. Right now, he probably wanted nothing more than to hide the seal.Li Hao glanced at the eight King level Masters again and said,""Although the other party might not be able to take it away, it's still a little dangerous. Guardian turtle will stay here for the time being. As for general Huai, you should return to heaven battling city. "The old turtle didn't have any objections, but he said nervously,""If ... If I accidentally enter that place ..."It was afraid.He wasn't afraid of death, but he was a little afraid of that aura, which made him feel uneasy.Li Fuhai hurriedly said,"what are you afraid of? you're a divine weapon. How can you go in without someone to lead you?" Cut the crap, you'll be done here!"Don't say it!If I'm allowed to stay here, I won't do it. That was scary!Li Hao glanced at the two experts and couldn't help but say,""That Emperor Cang...Is he that evil? Wasn't he the Lord of the World? Why do the two of you feel like you've seen a devil?"The two of them didn't say anything.Was Emperor Cang a devil?In the eyes of the human ruler and the others, Emperor Cang was adorable, fun to play with, kind, and sensible ...However, in the eyes of others, he was ... An extremely terrifying existence.In his heart, there was no good or evil, no right or wrong.Such existences were actually very terrifying. They did everything as they pleased. For example, they wanted to eat beef. Emperor Cang felt that it was normal for him to eat beef. As for who he ate ... What did it matter?In order not to be eaten, the shuigui family would do everything they could to please them. Sometimes, the two venerable sovereigns even had to cut off some of their own meat and let them eat hotpot. They were really aggrieved venerable sovereigns.Li Hao didn't know any of this. At this moment, li Fuhai was too embarrassed to say it. He laughed dryly and said,""No, no, how could that be? However, it is impossible for Emperor Cang to be here. Hence, we are worried that Emperor Cang might have left behind some divine weapons. If that is the case, it would be easy to activate them randomly ..."'I'll believe you!'Li Hao didn't say anything else. He said,""After I get some of the blood and Qi of the eight great families, I'll go in and investigate again, or I'll bring director Zhao and the others ... But they're still too weak, I'm afraid they'll be sucked dry! This place is actually not bad. If you want to deal with venerable sovereigns, you have to understand them better!"You really dare to think about it!As the two thought this, Li Hao didn't stay any longer. He left the old turtle behind and left the ruins with li Fuhai, who couldn't wait to run away.In the remains, the old turtle quickly fled the meeting hall and retreated to the entrance to practice. He was the kind of person who would try to escape by force at the slightest anomaly. He was also pitiful and hoped that Li Hao would come soon and take him away.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Meanwhile, in the West.As Li Hao had expected, it was indeed very lively.p A group of red-robed experts appeared frequently, wanting to kill yueshen, but they didn't attack Ying Hongyue.The other group of black-robed experts also kept appearing, but they were protecting the moon goddesses and dealing with the red-robed experts. They didn't attack Ying Hongyue.Ying Hongyue, on the other hand, was tracking the moon goddesses.The four parties didn't contact each other, but they seemed to know each other's identities.Their battlefield had also shifted from the stellarsky continent to this side. They had no choice. Li Hao of stellarsky continent was too difficult to deal with.The most miserable was the moon goddess's side, who were constantly being hunted down.At this moment, the Queen's face was livid. She kept looking back. The guys from the Crimson Moon world had been chasing them. If Li Hao hadn't killed those gods and even the divine path gods, these guys wouldn't have dared to chase her.The limit of a God was similar to Li Hao 's.If the heavens and earth could contain the nine levels of the sun Moon tier, then the Saints on the godly spirit side would be able to unleash the battle prowess of the nine levels of the sun Moon tier. They were also the manifestation of the great Dao of the heavens and earth.

2147 Chapter 361
Whether it was neo martial or Crimson Moon, their current limit was only at the peak of immortal, around the seventh level of Sun Moon.The Queen cursed in her heart. If the sun god and the others had not died in battle, these guys who dared to chase after her would have been killed long ago!But now, the Tiger had fallen into the sun and was being bullied by the dog!The number of deities who had escaped with her had dwindled, and some of them had died in the long pursuit. There were only five deities left, and including her, there were only six.Fortunately, Li Hao had improved the limits of the world again, and the battle strength of several deities had improved. At this stage, they were no weaker than those at the peak of immortal realm, so they were not annihilated."If this continues ... I'll be too passive. I have to find a way to resurrect the Prophet God!"The moon goddess thought that there was no hope for the sun god and the dark god to recover, but there was still hope for the Prophet God.Li Hao probably still hadn't found where his opponent's Natal star was.As for herself, she wasn't worried about this. Her Natal star was probably not in the universe of the great path, but in the seal, which was the moon of the entire Silvermoon, which was the foundation of her great path.As for the stars formed by the other Dao meridians in his body, it would not be a big deal if they were shattered.At this moment, yueshen's combat power had recovered a lot, but she did not want to reveal all her trump cards. The black robes were helping her kill her powerful enemies, and she was happy to do so. Those guys were probably from the Zheng family.Clearly, they were worried that if they were killed, Silvermoon's body would shatter and the seal would break."Why is Ying Hongyue chasing after us?"Yueshen was confused and a little angry. This detestable guy.She had met Ying Hongyue once, and the other party was very polite. However, when the moon goddess saw the other party's smile, she was very disgusted and directly attacked. In the end, they had a fight but didn't gain any advantage. She couldn't be bothered with the other party's talk of cooperation and directly ran away.She would not believe any of these guys who looked gentle.What cooperation ... She knew that he was Li Hao's enemy, but she was not willing to cooperate with this seemingly gentle bastard.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.In the rear, Ying Hongyue's expression wasn't too good. She was sincerely looking for Li Hao to cooperate with her. The enemy of both sides was Li Hao. Moreover, if she cooperated with Li Hao, the people of the Crimson Moon world wouldn't easily make a move.In the end, that stupid Moon Goddess actually ignored him.Right now, the battle between several parties was intense.Wasn't this giving Li Hao an advantage?Whether it was the Crimson Moon's side, Zheng Yu's side, himself, or the Western divine Kingdom ... The enemy should be Li Hao!He continued to chase for a while, took a deep breath, and said in a deep voice,""We must stop this internal friction and unite our forces to deal with Li Hao's group! "Not now, not here, where we're having internal strife. At this stage, neither the Crimson Moon nor the Zheng family can come out. There's no need to have internal strife now ..."These guys ... It didn't make sense.It was still the flying sword immortal. At this moment, he was a little cold as he revealed the heavenly secret with a single sentence."Everyone knows that, but everyone is afraid of him! They felt that fighting with him now was not a good thing, only death! So ... It's better to find something to do first. When the world revives, there will be strong people to deal with Li Hao, instead of weak people who keep sending themselves to death to give him benefits!"Who didn't know that Li Hao was a great enemy?They all knew!More importantly, he had suffered losses time and time again. Many saints had died, and it was said that even a Heavenly King had died. At this time, no one, be it the Zheng family or the red moon, would cause trouble for Li Hao.It would be better to do some work here and show that he didn't have anything to do.Ying Hongyue frowned. This was true.However, it would be very troublesome.The flying sword immortal was starting to get impatient. His voice was low."The Yama is dead, and we only have a thousand or so people under us. We've been running here and there, but the divine nation isn't willing to cooperate. Ying Hongyue, if this continues ... Will we still have a way out? If this continues ... With so few people left in the flying heavens ... I don't want to waste my time here!""What?"Ying Hongyue frowned slightly. The flying sword immortal calmly said,"If you continue to run away like this, I'll leave! "Ying Hongyue, you've hidden too many things and never told us everything. People are dying one after another, and we have no hope ... If we continue to run away with you, we'll die sooner or later! Even if Li Hao wants to kill us, he won't make Fei Tian his first target. There aren't many people left now. We can find a place to hide. He might not even have the time to care about us!" However, if he followed Ying Hongyue, he would definitely be an important target for Li Hao.Ying Hongyue furrowed her brows slightly. As expected ... The result that Li Hao wanted was about to come.Was he being deserted by his friends and family?A bunch of people had died, and now, the flying sword Immortals of the three great organizations wanted to retreat. Vast sky Mountain's master didn't say anything, but ... It was obvious that he had the same thought. Yama's death made them feel a huge threat.He had originally come to the West in hopes of allying with the moon gods so that he could at least protect himself. But now, the moon goddesses ignored them and fled as soon as they saw them. Instead, they started fighting each other. They were no match for Li Hao in the first place, and dozens of cultivators had died recently. The two of them could no longer hold back.Ying Hongyue was clear about this in her heart. She quickly said, "Don't worry. I'll definitely reach an agreement with the Western divine Kingdom in three days! This Moon Goddess is too impulsive and stupid ... Damn it, if the Prophet God was still alive, she would never be like this!"As he said this, he thought, as long as I help them resurrect the Prophet God, the other party is a wise man. He definitely won't be like the moon goddess and keep people at arm's length!He was helpless.If he met a smart person, it was actually easy to negotiate. If both sides had the same enemy, wouldn't that be easy to negotiate?But ... He had met an unreasonable woman!It was clearly an iron-clad cooperation, but the other party had forcibly turned it into a situation where they would fight upon meeting.If this went on, after Li Hao resolved the threat of several ancient cities and the troubles of the four countries in the central region, he might come to the West!He didn't have that much time to waste here!The flying sword immortal glanced at him and said in a deep voice,""Then the last three days! "If we still can't work together, if we can't form an alliance, and if we're like a pile of loose sand ... I'll leave! Not only me, but Haotian is also the same. We have always trusted you, but now, you know what you have brought us!"They only suffered heavy losses and fled like rats.They had had enough of such days!Ying Hongyue took a deep breath and lost some of her usual calmness. She nodded and turned her head to look into the distance, hoping that there would be no more accidents.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.A man and a dog crossed the void and headed straight to the West.  Best novel online free at n0ŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  He would let Qian Wuliang negotiate with the ancient city first.Li Hao didn't care about it for the time being. He wanted to make a trip to the West first ... To see if there was anything he could take advantage of. At the same time, he wanted to put some pressure on Ying Hongyue so that she could borrow more power from the Crimson Moon.In addition, Li Hao also had an idea. Could the Li family be in the West?To the East was the great wilderness. Desolate beasts had been roaming freely before, so the Li clan should not be hiding there.In shuiyun city in the South, there were few historical remains and the country was weak. The probability of the Li family going to the South was not high.In the Li Dynasty in the North, there was a God of beginner martial arts, so it was hard to say.On the other hand, the revival of the gods in the West, especially the moon god, had the effect of suppressing and sealing. Their revival might have been a part of the Li family's work.Moreover, the West was their enemy ... Even if they had to fight until the heavens fell and the earth cracked, they didn't need to care.It was a good thing that all the enemies were gathered here.Li Hao laughed as he dragged the Black Panther. "Let's see if your nose works. I hope you can dig out all the rats!"The Black Panther's nose twitched and it nodded.It wasn't easy for him to come out, so he naturally had to fish for some benefits.It was just like when he left Silver Moon province, one man and one dog still traveling the world.

Chapter 2148 The Silver Moon In The Sky (1)
In the Western divine Kingdom.The God nation was protected by gods, so it was considered wealthy.The weather and environment in the land of the far west were not bad. It was not extremely hot or cold. With the protection of the gods, there was no war. The buildings were tall and had a somewhat exotic atmosphere.This was Li Hao's first time in a foreign country.His clone had been to the Li Dynasty once, but he did not return.As for the other countries, they had only crossed swords with their armies at the border, but they had never stepped into the territory of other countries.The moment Li Hao stepped into the foreign divine Kingdom, he sensed the aura of some gods, which might have been overflowing in the past or caused by the recent recovery.In the dark, there was a voice that seemed to want to subjugate the mortals who entered the divine Kingdom.Ever since Li Hao had killed many gods, the divine Kingdom had been in chaos for some time. But now, the Queen was still alive, so the divine Kingdom was once again at peace.There were many temples here.Almost every city had many temples, and they believed in all kinds of gods. Perhaps the other gods were different, but every city had a moon god temple, which was the strongest God that the divine Kingdom believed in.The moon goddess represented the Silver Moon in the sky.But now, the Silver Moon had actually begun to turn red, which was caused by the invasion of the power of the red moon. However, ordinary people did not understand this, and no one cared about it.The people of the divine Kingdom were also somewhat different from those of the Central Plains.There were some with blonde hair and blue eyes, and some with black hair and black eyes.As the strongest of the four nations, there were many cultivators in the divine nation. These people had the techniques of super cultivators, which were different from the Li Dynasty's beginner martial arts techniques. They were good at borrowing the power of gods. In Li Hao's opinion, they were borrowing the power of DAOs.The cultivators of the God nation were actually accessories to the God. When they cultivated, they were actually helping the God cultivate.Once a deity fell, the Dao would be broken, and the Natal star would shatter. These cultivators who cultivated the path of deity would also lose their power. This was a complete external force, which was even more unreliable than the superpowers in the Central Plains.At this moment, Li Hao was walking on the streets and alleys with Black Panther, but no one noticed his existence.He strode forward.Li Hao stepped into a temple. In the temple, believers and priests were kowtowing, but no one could find Li Hao.Li Hao looked at the statue in the center of the temple and smiled.Stupid God!Or rather, a helpless God.Each statue was attached with the spiritual power of some gods. This way, it was easy to receive the power of faith. However, if an enemy entered this place, it would be easy to find the enemy's true body through these connections.Many Western deities had died, but there were still some who survived.Li Hao had entered the temple of the god of death. In other words, the King of Hell in the Central Plains had the same meaning.The god of death was considered a powerful existence among the gods.The moment Li Hao entered, the fiendish statue of the Grim Reaper seemed to tremble. A faint wave of mental energy swept the surroundings, as if it had sensed something, or perhaps the aura of death.However, how could a wisp of mental power detect Li Hao's existence?Beside Li Hao, the Black Panther's nose twitched. It glanced at Li Hao. It had already smelled something.Those fellows "true bodies weren't too far away from this place.Li Hao stayed where he was for a moment, then quickly brought the Black Panther to the next temple. It was the moon god temple, which was everywhere.It was a majestic, sacred, and beautiful statue that looked very much like the Queen, but not exactly the same. It might have been the first moon Goddess, but the current Queen was the second moon Goddess.There was some power of faith in the statue.Li Hao reached out and grabbed some.After carefully examining it, he raised his brows slightly. Interesting. The divine Kingdom's power of faith was actually a type of great Dao power. In that case, the divine Kingdom had actually been studying the great Dao for many years.Or rather, he had accidentally triggered a great Dao.The universe of the great path had always existed.It was just that everyone discovered it at a different time. Li Hao and Yuan Shuo, after in-depth research, discovered the existence of the Dao universe. They combined it with the Dao Meridian and stepped into the Dao universe. Best n0vel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã ùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìã‚ÑØùìÅùí∑ùíæùìÉ "Maybe ... Other than me, others can actually enter the Dao universe too. It's just that it's quite dangerous, and it's easy to get lost in the Dao universe.""The big star from last time should be ... Zhang an?"Li Hao thought that if Zhang an had condensed a new Dao, he might have entered a great Dao universe before, but he did not know about it.This meant that ... Other people actually had the opportunity to enter the great Dao universe.The great Dao universe did not reject new Dao cultivators from entering.This universe wasn't his exclusive land.However, it was easy to enter but difficult to come out.The gods should have also begun to study the great Dao universe. The power of faith in the West also had some traces of the great Dao. If li daoheng and the others were outside, they would most likely come to the divine Kingdom to study the power of faith and find the great Dao universe."But I'm sure that I was the first one to discover the connection between the Dao Meridian and the stars!"‚Äã Li Hao thought to himself,"otherwise, heaven and earth wouldn't have rewarded me with a piece of divine text, the word 'Dao'."Therefore, it must have been his first time discovering that he could contact the great Dao universe through the Dao Meridian.

Chapter 2149 The Silver Moon In The Sky_ 2
The people in the past might not have had a Dao Meridian.Even if there were, they were only some gods who had unknowingly developed Dao meridians and no one had noticed them.And through the Dao Meridian, he and his teacher would definitely be the first and second to enter the Dao universe directly.Just as he was deep in thought, the statue seemed to have sensed something, and its eyes opened. However, the believers beside it did not notice anything.These temples also served as informers.The statue of the moon goddess opened its eyes and looked around.He seemed to be a little confused.As for Li Hao, his eyes flickered and he suddenly laughed. He, who had been invisible, instantly reappeared. The statue was about to close its eyes, but when it opened them again, it saw a man and a dog.In an instant, the statue seemed to have stiffened.The look in his eyes changed from surprise to anger, and from anger to a fierce look!Li Hao!Li Hao had come to the divine Kingdom!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.The moon goddesses, who were trying to avoid being killed, suddenly looked at her. The other gods around her quickly turned to look at the moon goddesses, and the Queen's expression turned ugly. "It's not good!""Your Majesty ...""Li Hao, we're in the divine Kingdom!""What?"The few of them were shocked!Gods have always been proud. Moreover, gods are not afraid of death. Death can be resurrected, and they will return sooner or later. Even when they faced neo martial that year, they were not so afraid. Even if I die, we will return countless years later. But they were really afraid of Li Hao.After all, Li Hao had killed them. He had truly killed them, and it was impossible for them to recover. Of course, the prerequisite was that their Natal stars had been completely shattered.The others couldn't do it, but Li Hao could.Therefore, these gods were not afraid of anyone else, but Li Hao.The Queen's expression was extremely ugly."He showed up of his own accord ... Damn it!"She hadn't noticed Li Hao at first, but Li Hao had shown up of his own accord. Was this a provocation?However, she was indeed a little scared. She wasn't too afraid of herself. Even if Li Hao could kill her, he might not dare to. Besides, her Natal star was different from other gods.But if the other gods had their Natal stars found by Li Hao, they would be doomed.The Queen's expression changed. She turned around and gritted her teeth,""Go and talk to Ying Hongyue!"Damn it!She didn't want to talk to Ying Hongyue at first, but now ... Perhaps it was time to talk to him.Also, Li Hao is here, so be careful.This person might be here to kill them.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the temple.The Black Panther looked at Li Hao doubtfully. Why did he have to show himself when he could have just chased him in secret? If people knew you were here, wouldn't they run away?Li Hao chuckled and left the moon god Palace. He said softly,""If I don't let them know that I'm here, without some pressure, how can I feel despair? If I don't feel any despair, how can I fight with Ying Hongyue?"The Black Panther didn't understand, but it didn't matter. If Li Hao said so, then so be it.As for Li Hao, he looked around and didn't ask the Black Panther to chase after the gods in a hurry, giving them some time.He continued to travel around the entire Western divine Kingdom.The sword intent gradually started to dissipate a little.Gradually, it began to spread in all directions. The weak couldn't sense it, but the strong could. Li Hao was not here for these people, but for other people who might be hiding here.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.As Li Hao's sword intent began to spread in the West, someone in a temple suddenly raised his head and looked outside. After sensing it, he frowned.After a long time, he murmured,"longevity sword intent ... Li Hao?"Li Hao had come to the West.So what if he came? with such great fanfare and such arrogance, did he think that no one in the world could limit him, or did he have other reasons?Strange! Best n0vel online free at n0ŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At another place.Ying Hongyue's expression changed slightly. She looked in a direction and a faint sword intent spread out.Before Ying Hongyue could speak, the flying sword immortal's expression changed."Sword intent!"Ying Hongyue didn't say anything, but the members of the organization nearby instantly became restless. Sword intent?Where did the sword intent come from?"Li Hao!"The flying sword immortal gritted his teeth and looked at Ying Hongyue. Was it Li Hao?Ying Hongyue ignored him. She was silent for a moment before suddenly speaking,"Li Hao has come to the West. He's from the Crimson Moon universe, and he's an expert under the red dust leader. It's meaningless for us to continue fighting! Let's work together and stop the internal friction. Otherwise ... Only Li Hao will benefit from it. "Li Hao was here, and he was being so ostentatious. It was both a good and a bad thing.The good thing was that everyone knew that he was here. The originally chaotic forces should not mess around anymore.The bad thing was ... Everyone was actually so terrified.This was not a good thing!The person hadn't appeared yet, but the inexplicable pressure made many people feel like they were crushed.At this moment, in the darkness, someone's voice could be heard.""Li Hao is here ... We should leave the West ..."Obviously, someone didn't want to meet Li Hao here.However, Ying Hongyue frowned slightly and said,"that's inappropriate!" Once he comes, we'll leave. I'm afraid ... We won't be able to go back!"Can't go back?At this moment, a red-robed figure appeared in the darkness. He looked at Ying Hongyue and said softly,""What do you mean by that, leader Ying? Even if Li Hao becomes a Saint, he's only one person. If we leave now, does he have three heads and six arms that can cover the entire Silver Moon continent?"Still can't go back?How could that be possible?Ying Hongyue didn't say anything. She only quickly investigated and quickly said,"At the border of the Western divine Kingdom, the boundless city and heaven battling city might have already arrived and are waiting for him. If we leave now, we'll fall into his trap!"
