, even if they were enemies, they still had to share the risk if they went together to explore the ruins.
 Hou Xiaochen laughed,"without the three major organizations, we can't pass?" There was no hurry. The remains were there, and they couldn't run away! My idea is to fight first, until the three major organizations know whose territory this is. When they realize their mistake, we can slowly negotiate. At that time, we will be able to take the initiative. "
 "However, from what I know, Blue Moon, Banshan, and King Pingdeng are all Sunglow realm cultivators. Right now, there are a total of three Sunglow realm cultivators from the three great organizations here! Minister hou said that you're injured and unwilling to fight ... Although I'm also a rising light, I'm afraid I'm powerless ..."
 He felt that these guys were going to use him as a blade.
 However, this was definitely not the result he wanted.
 If he really did that, he would be in danger.
 There were several sunrise realm experts, Purple Moon, and the Samsara King, who were at the peak of the three suns realm. In addition, they also had origin divine weapons. Hu Qingfeng did not dare to fall out with them.
 "Cough cough ... It's fine!"
 Hou Xiaochen laughed."Minister kui, take my fiery phoenix spear with you. Although you can't defeat Xuguang, you can at least provide some support. Furthermore, it's not like silver Moon doesn't have any experts left. There are also some Qian fighters in the Wei Wu Army. Although they aren't very strong, if the Wei Wu Army forms an army formation, they will have the ability to fight ..."
 In any case, you have to make a move.
  Hu Qingfeng remained silent.
 He cursed in his heart. "What are you thinking? I will never do it. Even if you have agreed, I won't do it. At most, I'll just leave and return to the central continent!"
 If they went back, they would be punished.
 In any case, he felt that the atmosphere on Silver moon's side was strange, and it would not be easy to resolve.
 He had been too optimistic before coming here, but hou Xiaochen's spear had destroyed many of his plans. Otherwise, things wouldn't have been like this.
 ……
 They were arguing.
 As for Li Hao, he gradually came back to his senses. Ignoring what they were saying, he carefully looked around.
 He knew that Hu dingfang was in the late stage of the three yang realm among the three great commanders in the military.
 The other commander of the White Dragon Army looked to be around 50 years old, a little younger than commander Yu and a little older than Hu dingfang. He was also a super, and from the light ball, he seemed to be at the peak of the three suns.
 Therefore, Hu dingfang was actually the weakest. Of course, he was also the youngest.
 There were not many people from the inspection Office. There was a burly man, Kong Jie, who had a dazzling glow around her. Li Hao didn't pay much attention to her. Instead, he focused on the people beside her. Hao lianchuan didn't introduce them.
 This was because these few people were not very famous.
 Other than Kong Jie, there were only 3 people.
 Two men and one woman. One of the men, who was dark-skinned, seemed to sense Li Hao's gaze and smiled amicably.
 Li Hao felt strange. Who was this?
  I don't know him.  On the side, Hao lianchuan, who was cursing, saw this scene and began to introduce it to them through voice transmission,""You don't know that black egg?"
 Li Hao was speechless, but he felt that the other person probably didn't notice it, so it didn't matter.
 "You should know!"
 "The previous Chief Inspector of Silver City was transferred to Whitemoon city. He's now the chief Inspector of Whitemoon city ... But it's useless. In this place, the headquarters are the most important. Whitemoon city is the provincial capital. As a Chief Inspector, he's useless. He might as well live a carefree life in Silver City."
 Three lives of misfortune, zhixian follows Guo.
 Three lives of evil, attached to Guo provincial city.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It was a tragedy for officials in the provincial capital to be the Secretary of the Whitemoon city. Therefore, the night patrollers did not set up any branches in Whitemoon city. They only had one headquarters to avoid a lot of trouble. Of course, it also had to do with the lack of superpowers.
 Li Hao instantly knew who Hao lianchuan was.
 The previous Secretary was quite famous. Liu Long had once introduced him to Li Hao. The previous Secretary was a Martial Master who practiced the iron cloth technique and was invulnerable.
 Back then, there was also a famous cultivator in the Silver Moon martial forest who was as famous as the people with the eyebrows-abrest stick. However, Yuan Shuo had destroyed his physical body, and his iron cloth was destroyed. Naturally, he died.
 However, the secret technique of iron cloth was not unique. Many people knew it, and it was also a martial arts secret technique that was passed down in the pugilistic world.
 "Wang Henggang!"
 Li Hao remembered. He remembered this person's name. In fact, there was a portrait of this person in the blizzard Silver city's Inspection Office. It was just that he wasn't this dark in the past. Now that he was in white moon City, he was so dark.
 Previously, when someone said that he had become a super, Li Hao thought that he had joined the night patrollers. He didn't expect that he had joined the inspector Bureau.
 However, his strength ... Was not weak!
  Late three yang realm?
 Li Hao looked at it for a while and made a rough judgment. It really was at the late stage of three yang. This was not a weakling.
 When did he advance?
 Li Hao recalled that mu Sen had only joined the inspection Office for a short time, about ... Three years?
 It was almost the same!
 In other words, he had only been a super for three years.
 It had been more than three years. If he had broken through 100 years ago, he would have been at the brilliant sun realm. After more than three years, he had suddenly reached the late stage of the three suns realm. This speed was extremely amazing.
 Moreover, the other party was not eye-catching at all.
 In the White moon City, not many people knew him. The silver Blizzard city still remembered this inspector, even more so than the current mu Sen.
 Apart from Wang Henggang, the other man and woman were also at the three suns realm. Judging from their strength, they were between the late stage and peak of the three suns realm. Damn it, there were actually several three suns in the inspection Office, even more than the night patrol.

 Li Hao was speechless!
 However, when he thought of their boss, Kong Jie, he felt that there was nothing wrong with it.
 Speaking of which, the night patrolman was still a little stronger. Not to mention the three suns, at least chief Yu was Xu Guang. One was equivalent to three. Only Hao lianchuan was a little embarrassed. As the first Deputy, among those present, only director Zhou, who did not have many orbs, was a little weaker than him.
 How pitiful!
 Commander Yu, director Zhao, Kong Jie, and hou Xiaochen were all very eye-catching. There were also people in the rising light realm, chief Yu, and Hu Qingfeng.
 On Hu Qingfeng's side, there was also a peak three-yang and a late-stage three-yang.
 Other than director Zhou, the weakest were Hao lianchuan and Li Hao.
 Li Hao felt that he could still deal with Hao lianchuan, who was at the middle stage of the three yang realm, so ...
 He looked at Hao lianchuan again. Grandpa Hao was indeed the weakest.
 Fortunately, he had advanced to the middle stage. Otherwise, if he were still in the early stage, Li Hao would be too ashamed to face anyone.
  Just as she was thinking about this, she suddenly heard his name.
 Li Hao was stunned. How can they talk about me in such a big occasion?
 He instantly came back to his senses and showed a respectful expression.
 The person who spoke of him was not hou Xiaochen, but Kong Jie.
 The boss of the inspection Office said in a loud voice,"Yuan Shuo has appeared in Linjiang recently. He has probably entered the three northern provinces. With his personality, I'm afraid he will stay there for a while."
 "Yuan Shuo's spirit accumulation technique is different from some of the Martial Master strengthening plans in the central continent. It feels more like the next stage of the Martial Master realm. There are also extremely powerful martial masters in the central continent. For example, He Yong has completed three blood exchanges and is comparable to three suns!"
 "But compared to Yuan Shuo's spirit accumulation technique, I think it's still lacking ..."
 "Nowadays, many people are watching Yuan Shuo. As Yuan Shuo's last disciple, I'm thinking if I should have Li Hao go to the three northern provinces. Maybe he can meet Yuan Shuo and talk to him about the details of the method of accumulating spirit energy. Silver Moon martial forest used to dominate the world, and now, there are still some old martial masters in Silver Moon. Not only that, as far as I know, the Silver Moon guards also have some warrior puppets ... Can we completely disclose the method of accumulating spirit energy and discuss some details? To increase the combat power of a Martial Master ..."
 At this moment, Li Hao was being stared at by many people.
 His face revealed traces of nervousness, but he was a little speechless in his heart. Was there a need?
 Even if my teacher was here, he wouldn't be able to win against you!
 This group of people were really black-hearted.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Of course, Li Hao still quickly said,""Is the teacher in the three northern provinces? If there's a need, I'll follow your orders and arrangements at any time. I'm sure teacher won't hold back on the art of accumulating spirit energy!"
 It seemed like a good idea to go to the three northern provinces.
 If he really met his teacher ... Should he run away with his teacher?  The world was so big that he could still survive.
 Silver Moon, on the other hand, had previously thought that he could make a name for himself, but now he realized that he would find it very difficult to do so. These guys were each more hidden than the other, and in this situation, Li Hao would rather die than believe that they had no intention of rebelling!
 It might be a good thing to run away as soon as possible.
 Hou Xiaochen laughed, "There's no hurry. Yuan Shuo himself hasn't completely walked down this path. This is only the beginning. Besides, a person like Yuan Shuo would only be able to go further and be unscrupulous if you let go of the shackles. If we keep him trapped, he'll be restricted. "
 Kong Jie thought for a while, nodded, and didn't say anything.
 At this moment, director Zhao said,"Yuan Shuo's matter is not urgent." Department head hou, let's discuss your matter. Department head Hao couldn't say anything before you came. "
 Hao lianchuan became even more depressed after hearing this.
 This old man was so annoying!
 "Please speak, director." Hou Xiaochen smiled.
 Director Zhao said solemnly,"the central Division has tried to send you to take up a position there many times, but you've rejected them time and time again, using the excuse that you're injured to avoid taking up the position." Now, you killed red hair with one shot, which is an existence at the level of the suguang. Minister hou, you better give us an explanation and answer today. What is your purpose?"
 The atmosphere seemed to have become a little tense.
 Hu Qingfeng was also a little nervous."Why is this old man so direct?"
 Yes, this meeting is actually for this, but ... I didn't ask you to say it so directly!
 Hou Xiaochen sighed helplessly, "I'm indeed injured, it's not a lie. "Furthermore, the three major organizations of Silver Moon are powerful, and they're in constant turmoil and trouble. Other than me, no one else is able to suppress them ... Even though the central continent might send experts over, I'm worried that they don't know the situation here ..."
  "So, you can reject the transfer?" director Zhao asked calmly.
 "I don't dare!"
 "I've told you the difficulties, and some of the night watchers have agreed. Of course, if the Heavenly Star City really needs me ... Then I'll just issue another transfer order. I'm willing to go to the central region and take up the post!"
 Hu Qingfeng was dumbfounded when he heard that.
 You ... Are willing to go?
 "But before I go, I need to do something," hou Xiaochen added.
 "What is it?"
 "Take the origin god weapon in heaven battling city and add another layer of protection to white moon City."
 "The next time I enter the ruins, I'll go in myself!" Hou Xiaochen said with a serious expression. If I succeed, then after I come out, I'll head to the central continent, but if I fail and die in heaven battling city ... Then there's no need to say anything more. "
 "Minister hou, are you going into the remains?" Hu Qingfeng couldn't help but ask.

 "Why not?"
 Hou Xiaochen looked at him calmly,"White moon City is the core of Silver Moon. Once I leave, some of the evildoers might have other thoughts. I've been worried about this all these years. If I can get the origin divine weapon that protects the entire city, I'll be able to be transferred anywhere I want. I'll have no complaints. "
 Hu Qingfeng had nothing to say, but since they had already said so much, he no longer had to be polite."May I ask how far Minister hou has gone? Minister hou, please don't misunderstand. I'm just a little curious ..."
 "He barely managed to step into the rising light realm. He only killed red hair because he was caught off guard and the fire Phoenix spear was powerful. That's why he was able to kill him in one blow. It's not as exaggerated as everyone thinks!"
 Director Zhao knocked on the table and interrupted Hu Qingfeng. He said,"In other words, after you get the origin god weapon, you will obey the transfer order, right?"
 "Right!"
 "How long do you need?"
 "Let's wait and see next month. If the relic opens next month, we can enter. The trouble with the three major organizations has been resolved, then we can enter! It's only been three days. "
 In other words, if everything went smoothly, hou Xiaochen would be willing to leave in a month or so.
 Chief Zhao nodded and looked at Hu Qingfeng.""Special Agent Hu, what do you think?"
  "Why are you asking me?" Hu Qingfeng cursed.
 How would I know!
 Now that hou Xiaochen had suddenly said that he was willing to accept orders, things were getting troublesome. Since he was willing to go to the central continent, the central continent had no reason to deal with him.
 Previously, it was only because hou Xiaochen had claimed the mountain as his King that he had refused to leave.
 In the central region, even if he was a Dragon, he had to coil up!
 After thinking for a while, Hu Qingfeng felt that this might not be a bad idea. He could also be considered to have made a contribution. However, whether he could get the origin divine weapon from the ruins was a problem.
 Also, should he follow them in?
 But previously, Zhang Ting had died inside, and he was inside. If he were to be killed by this fellow, he would not know what to do.
 "I have to inform the higher-ups, unless more people come, otherwise ... I will not enter!"
 He had a plan in his heart. Seeing director Zhao look over, he nodded,""I have no objections. It's up to Minister hou. If Minister hou really goes to the central region, he might be my superior in the future. Congratulations!"
 He revealed a smile.
 Hou Xiaochen didn't even look at him. After saying this, he fell silent again.
 "Does anyone else have anything to say?"
 Director Zhao looked around and asked again.
 No one spoke again.
 As long as hou Xiaochen was obedient, nothing else would matter.
 "Then let's end the meeting!"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "We need to solve the problem with the three Darksider organizations as soon as possible," director Zhao said, a little tired."If it's not possible, then we'll wait. If necessary, we'll ask for help from the higher-ups."
 After saying this, he finally looked at Li Hao.""Li Hao, you have the bloodline of one of the eight great families of Silver City. We don't know much about the eight great families, but Red Moon is very concerned about you. We will continue to investigate this matter!"
 "However, I've read some of the records in Silvermoon's ancient books, and I've gained a few things."
 Li Hao's spirit instantly rose. At this moment, this person suddenly mentioned him. He didn't think that director Zhao would say anything unnecessary.  It must be very important!
 Of course, he didn't know why he said it when there were so many people around.
 Director Zhao saw Li Hao looking at him expectantly and smiled. He said,""There are too many things that I don't understand. I've asked old Zhou to read many ancient books, and one of them recorded a passage. When the eight guardians gather and open the dusty door, it will be the time for another expedition!"
 "These words may be related to the eight great families of Silver City. Or, they are guarding a gate that has been sealed for many years, leading to unknown place. There is no information on who they are conquering. "
 "Moreover, too much time has passed. Just treat it as a legend."
 After saying this, director Zhao panted,"Ying Hongyue might know something. Among the three great organizations, Hongyue rose the fastest. If there's a chance, I can have a talk with Ying Hongyue ..."
 These words ...
 Talk about what?
 Wouldn't they be finished if they met?
 Li Hao didn't say anything. He just took note of this.
 Eight guardians?
 The sealed gate?
 Was he talking about the stone gate?
 Or the eight trigrams?
 Li Hao fell into deep thought. For the time being, he didn't have much of a clue. As for the expedition ... He had a vague understanding. Back then, there should have been a human King commander leading many powerhouses to a certain place to fight.
 The heaven battling Army was an Army that stayed behind.
 However, after these people set off, it seemed that they never returned, and even heaven battling city had been abandoned.
 Where did they go?
 The central region?
 Or ... In the endless starry sky?
  In the past, the starry sky would not have been Li Hao's target, but now that superpowers had appeared and the strong were flying, Li Hao began to wonder if there were other creatures on the earth.
 He had seen an expert killing an enemy in the universe and killing an expert named heavenly Emperor.
 The heavenly Emperor was the enemy?
 But he was already dead!
 Therefore, the human King's expedition might be to deal with powerhouses stronger than the celestial Thearch.
 Did they all die in the end?
 Who knows?
 Li Hao didn't think about it anymore.
 "You're welcome, the meeting is over!"
 After saying that, he stood up and shakily walked towards the back. There was another passage there that he could leave through.

 Hou Xiaochen also stood up, his face calm as he turned and left.
 Li Hao and the others hurriedly followed.
 ……
 "Minister!"
 At this moment, Hao lianchuan was a little nervous.""You really want to leave?"
 "I haven't left yet," hou Xiaochen said as he walked,"and I even killed a Xuguang. If I don't leave now, the central continent will label me as a traitor." The moment I made my move, I was prepared to leave. "
 "But if you leave," Hao lianchuan said, his head aching,"what ... What are we going to do?"
 Silver Moon would be in trouble if you were to leave!
 ? If there was a new minister, there would definitely be a purge.
 "I'm not leaving immediately!"
  Hou Xiaochen laughed and quickly got into the car. This time, Li Hao had learned his lesson. He took a step ahead and instantly sat in the front passenger seat.
 Hao lianchuan rolled his eyes. This little bastard!
 It just so happened that he had something to discuss with hou Xiaochen, so he didn't say anything else. He went to the back row with hou Xiaochen and frowned,"Minister, let's use the same old excuse. Just say that my injuries are acting up and I can't travel far."
 "Rather than hoping that I'll stay, why don't you become stronger quickly?"
 Hou Xiaochen looked at him and said, "You've been in the three suns for some years. Your luck has been good recently and you've entered the middle stage of the three suns. But with your speed, when will you be able to enter the rising light Stage?"
 Hao lianchuan was helpless."I'm not talented. I've only found four superpower locks. I haven't found the fifth so far. Even if I'm at the peak of the three-yang realm, I don't have any hope of entering the rising light."
 The improvement of superpowers was fast. If one had enough mystical power, the improvement would be very fast, but the premise was that one had to discover the superpower lock.
 Even if he could not open all of them in one go, for someone like Hao lianchuan, if he found the fifth superpower lock now, he could open it bit by bit. Every time it broke a little, it would give him a large amount of mysterious energy and strengthen himself.
 It would be very fast to enter the peak of the three suns.
 Unfortunately, he didn't have the ability.
 After breaking the four superpower locks, he had stepped into the three yang realm. However, after entering the three yang realm, he had no direction. He had no choice but to absorb the mysterious energy bit by bit and strengthen it.
 This was the same as a Martial Master. He had to grind slowly, like Qian warrior. He had to grind until the fifth lock appeared.
 Hou Xiaochen furrowed his brows,"how much you can see doesn't necessarily mean you have the talent!" Besides, whether it's a Martial Master or a superpower, it doesn't mean that breaking the superpower lock is a good thing!"
 "But if I don't break it, I won't be able to advance ..."
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Hao lianchuan laughed bitterly."It's mainly because I can't find the fifth superpower lock. Otherwise, I think I can enter the rising light. Forget it for now. I'll wait until I reach the peak of the three-yang realm."
 Hou Xiaochen frowned.
 "Actually, it's not that there's no way to find the Super Lock that you can't find," he said after some thought.
 Hao lianchuan was slightly stunned. How?  Hou Xiaochen once again fell into deep thought. After a while, he said,"Ask Li Hao!"
 “……”
 In the front row, Li Hao was dumbfounded.
 You're asking me?
 How would I know!
 Was hou Xiaochen looking for trouble on purpose?
 Hao lianchuan was also shocked.""Find him? How could he know that everyone's lock is in a different position? even if it's in the same position, I can't find it and break it!"
 Even if the location of the superpower lock was the same and everyone knew that it was in all four limbs, so what?
 Can you see it?
 Do you know where it is?
 If you can't find it, how can you break it?
 "If he can store his spirit and spirit lock force, he'll naturally be able to find the lock ..." Hou Xiaochen replied.
 Li Hao's heart skipped a beat.
 This was the secret of the yunshen that he didn't tell anyone, but the Minister actually knew.
 Hou Xiaochen seemed to be very calm. He didn't care what Li Hao thought at all. He continued,"I don't know what method he used to strengthen his five internal organs. He strengthened them rapidly and even used the superpower lock to lock the ethereal Shi! However, if he can do it, so can his teacher. This means that he can rapidly strengthen a person's superpower lock to the point where it's visible. Your superpower lock might be too weak, so weak that you can't even sense it. "
 "Force is very intangible. Under normal circumstances, it can not be locked into the five internal organs. If he can lock it, it means that the application of the Super Lock has been developed and developed ... You can ask him. If he can't do it, then I can't either."
 Hao lianchuan was a little surprised and looked at Li Hao.
  Li Hao didn't even turn his head. He only thought for a while before saying,""This ... My teacher and I can indeed do this. It should be related to the fact that we're martial masters. As for the others ... I'm not sure. Department head Hao is not a Martial Master. If the superpower lock is weak, then we need to strengthen it. Maybe we can take the blood God to solve this problem. "
 "Blood God?"
 "I've tried it," Hao lianchuan hurriedly said."It's not very effective."
 "That is, the blood God is not strong enough!"
 Li Hao thought for a while."Eat Xu Guang's food. It might be useful. You can show the Minister's fifth superpower lock."
 This was actually a good idea!
 But whether it worked or not, he would only know after trying.
 He and his teacher could quickly strengthen themselves. His teacher was already very strong to begin with, while Li Hao relied on sword energy and the five elements he extracted. There was no need to reveal all these things.
 If it really didn't work, then he would consider other methods.
 At that moment, Hao lianchuan seemed to have found his way. His eyes flickered.

 Previously, he only had the thought of killing Hong Yue, but he didn't have much purpose.
 However, if it was really as Li Hao said ... He would have to pay more attention to Red Moon.
 At that moment, hou Xiaochen didn't care about this and continued,"Li Hao, you're a Martial Master, so you won't improve much with a group of supers. Tomorrow, let Xiao Yu accompany you to the Wei Wu Army. "The Wei Wu Army should also step up to the stage. In the next few days, you guys should leave the city and attack the three major organizations. Either defeat them or beat them until they gather more experts. Then, we can discuss the remains with them. Otherwise, we don't have enough people!"
 Why not?
 Li Hao understood a little. Perhaps hou Xiaochen felt that these few people weren't enough to die in the remains!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com This person didn't just want to kill the three major organizations to establish his might. It seemed like he wanted more experts from the other party to help him explore the ruins. How black-hearted!
 As for the Wei Wu Army, Li Hao wasn't very interested.
 Even if they were powerful, they couldn't be too powerful.
 Of course, Li Hao didn't dare to be too careless now that he had learned something.
  ……
 At the same time.
 Outside the White moon City.
 In a luxuriously decorated mansion, there were many villas nearby. They were all holiday resorts built by some rich people in white moon City.
 At this moment, a few experts gathered.
 LAN Yue looked unhappy."Everyone knows that it was a set-up. Even if we wanted to capture Li Hao, we wouldn't have chosen this time. We definitely wouldn't have sent the three suns to capture Li Hao. He's so close to hou Xiaochen. Is he trying to get himself killed?"
 "This is just an excuse for them to deal with us!"
 "Hou Xiaochen is clearly trying to kill us all. Since he's made the first move, don't blame us for not being polite!" LAN Yue said coldly.
 "Banshan, what do you think about Feitian's side?" he asked the cloaked man.
 Banshan, who was covered in a cloak, said in a cold voice,"as long as Crimson Moon is willing to give me a sunguang-level Blood God, I will consider it!"
 LAN Yue looked at him coldly.  Banshan was unmoved.
 "It's not impossible,"LAN Yue said after a while," but there's a condition ... That you kill hou Xiaochen. If you succeed, there'll be no problem!"
 This was also drawing a big picture.
 If he could kill hou Xiaochen, a single Blood God would be nothing, but if he couldn 't, then he naturally wouldn't have to pay.
 As for Banshan, after thinking for a while, he laughed,"Alright!"
 LAN Yue was a little surprised. He thought that this guy would not agree.
 However, he had agreed!
 This was the strange part!
 LAN Yue looked at King Pingdeng, who was not far away, and said,""Equality, what do you think?"
 The king of equality frowned."We'll see. Also, the governors of the three provinces have been killed. They're not far from Silver Moon. Will they interfere with our side?"
  As soon as these words came out, the few of them frowned.
 Who had killed that person?
 To be honest, to be able to kill that person meant that he was extremely powerful and a terrifying existence.
 Moreover, the three provinces were nearby. Although they were thousands of miles away, if they really caused a commotion, it would also involve this place.
 Blue Moon took a deep breath,'I don't know, but no matter what, let's settle Silver moon's problem first! As for the others, we can put them aside for now. "
 None of them said anything else. If they didn't get rid of hou Xiaochen, they wouldn't be able to establish themselves in Silver Moon.
 However, the Silver Moon was a place that he could not give up.
 Otherwise, after so many three suns died, they could just abandon this place. It was just a border province. 99 provinces were so big, why would they care about this place?
 [PS: the third one is a little later. You'll rest for a few hours, around 11 O' clock, just like yesterday.]

 In the Nightwalker's building.
 Li Hao's office.
 Li Hao leaned back in his chair and looked up at the sky. When Wang Ming pushed the door open and entered, Li Hao was still thinking.
 "Senior brother, congratulations!"
 Wang Ming chuckled.
 Li Hao glanced at him, and Wang Ming smiled.""I heard that you went to a meeting with hou bu and the others this morning. Only four of them went. That's amazing. Senior brother, are you going to be promoted?"
 Of the four that went, Li Hao's level was the lowest.
 Li Hao had no interest in talking about this.
 Today, he had suffered a huge blow.
 The more flamboyant he was yesterday, the more depressed he was today.
  He had originally thought that after yesterday, even if he didn't dare claim to be in the top five, he would definitely be in the top ten.
 In the end, after looking at it today ... Go to hell!
 And this was what he saw. What if he didn't see it?
 Silver Moon was definitely not simple.
 At this moment, Li Hao had a deep realization. Silver Moon was definitely not ordinary. It was impossible for so many people in a normal province to hide their strength. They were all experts, so why did they need to hide?
 And it wasn't just one or two.
 The bosses of the various large organizations had all hidden their strength.
 He couldn't see through hou Xiaochen and the others.
 Was it because he couldn't see through it, or was the other party's realm too high for him to see through?
 Had he surpassed sunguang?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com And what were they hiding for?
 If he couldn't see through them, it meant that they had surpassed the level of sunguang. There were a total of four people who had surpassed the level of sunguang. Were there any in the central region?
 I'm afraid ... There is!
 Those who said they were at the sunrise light realm, were they really sunguang?
 For example, a leader like Ying Hongyue?
 It was said that sunguang had appeared not long ago, but Li Hao felt that these B * stards might only disclose the previous level after each level.
 For example, the Sunglow level. After they entered the Sunglow level, they would reveal their existence to the public.
 There was definitely a group of people who had always been ahead of everyone.
 Superpowers had been around for 20 years, and in the past, they would update their ranks every few years. It was said that the rising light had been made public in the central continent for a few years, but Silver Moon did not even know the name of the rising light's rank.
 The delay in the news made many of Silver moon's people think that the rising light realm had only just appeared. In reality, it had already been several years.
 ……
 Thinking of this, Li Hao was slightly irritated.
 Very quickly, he relaxed again.
 He suddenly laughed.
 This way, it would be more interesting.
 "Old Wang, I'm going out for a spin and also to visit an old friend."
 "Captain Liu?"
 "No, don't see sister Liu for now. Let's go visit senior Southern Fist."  "Ah?"
 Wang Ming was stunned. Why did he want to see Nanquan?
 Li Hao, however, had his own plans.
 He Yong of the southern Fist was the strongest Martial Master he had seen so far, apart from Yuan Shuo. He was a pure Martial Master, not a Martial Master who had advanced to a super.
 The other party had exchanged blood three times and was comparable to the three suns.
 What did that mean?
 In fact, using one move to enter the warrior's Qian realm was just sunlight, but the opponent had forcibly raised it to a higher realm. Therefore, Li Hao felt that changing blood might also be a way.
 His teacher's path might not be wrong.
 However, the path of a Martial Master beyond the thousand-man Combat Master was not certain. There might be other paths, and he wanted to know more about them.
 At this moment, he still had a few forces that he could not comprehend.
 In that case, if he also changed his blood many times, could he quickly improve his combat strength?
 Shi was something that could be instantly comprehended on a whim.
 Sometimes, it was even possible to be stuck forever.
 Li Hao had already comprehended the third force with the addition of sword force. It was even more difficult to comprehend after he had reached the warrior power level. Who knew how long it would take for him to fully comprehend the rest? looking at the sea, the ninth-refined force was not of much use since it had not reached the ninth fold.
 So, he decided to visit the southern Fist.
 It was not just the southern Fist. After visiting the southern Fist, he also wanted to visit Wang Henggang, the strong man in the iron cloth suit.
 If there were other Qian fighters in the city, he would like to pay them a visit.
 If the Wei Wu Army had more battle chiliocosm and more people who comprehended force, Li Hao would be willing to exchange pointers with them.
 Li Hao had some plans in mind.
 Back when his teacher challenged Silvermoon's heroes, he had wanted to take advantage of their strengths to make up for their weaknesses. He had wanted to comprehend their Shi and thus fuse the five powers.
 The path of invincibility recorded in the ancient books also allowed one to challenge all directions and gather an invincible momentum.
 All of this showed that there was nothing bad about fighting and sparring.
 ……
 Wang Ming didn't care why Li Hao wanted to see Southern Fist.
 However, since Li Hao had said so, the night patrollers actually had nothing to do. As for encircling and annihilating the three major organizations, that was just a literal act. They had not really started their operation yet, so they were very idle.
 The sports car started moving again.
 Soon, they drove toward a wealthy area in the southern suburbs.
  He Yong was rich and didn't lack money.
 He was also a Martial Master from the royal family. After he arrived, he bought a large courtyard near the southern suburbs. It was antique and free, much better than Li Hao and the others who lived in the dormitory.
 In the villa area in the southern suburbs.
 This villa area was quite impressive. They actually arranged two ten decapitation realm cultivators and two star light cultivators as security guards. In an instant, the style was up, and the safety was guaranteed.
 At least, for many people, whether it was the ten decapitation realm or the Starlight master, they were all superhumans.
 With them patrolling the area, it was definitely safe.
 However, when Li Hao and the others showed their night patrolman tokens, the security guards quickly opened the door and let them in without asking any questions.
 Perhaps this was the only place where he could experience the might of a night watchman.
 "The environment is great!"
 Sitting in the car, Li Hao looked around the neighborhood and nodded in admiration. It was even better than his villa in the Silver City.

 The houses here were all faintly visible, hidden in some green vegetation, giving off the feeling of a hermit.
 As for the mosquitoes, there were even some special devices used to drive them away. There was a faint mysterious flow of energy, so there was no need to worry at all. It could be seen that the construction of this place was done with great care.
 Wang Ming didn't really care and said casually, "It's okay, it's not too expensive. It's only a few million Yuan per set. "
 "How much?"
 Li Hao was speechless. So expensive?
 Wang Ming, on the other hand, rolled his eyes.
 Go to hell!
 Was a few thousand a lot?
 It was a lot!
 It was impossible to rely on salary, but the night patrolmen paid mysterious energy. Mysterious energy could be sold for millions outside. Would this house still be expensive?
  As for the divine stones, they were in the hundreds of millions outside ... Of course, no one was selling them!
 In fact, after becoming a super, other than the weak, the strong would no longer use the currency of the world as a unit of transaction. What was the use of more money?
 Starlight and dark Moon still needed some money to maintain their livelihood.
 In riyao, he could just throw it anywhere and it would be too easy to earn money.
 Wang Ming couldn't be bothered to pay attention to Li Hao, and said,"If you like it, I can give you a set."
 "I don't want to."
 "Why?"
 "I don't embezzle!"
 “……”
 Wang Ming was speechless. Who said that giving it to you was corruption?
 This guy!
 As they were talking, the car stopped in front of a building.

 At the same time.
 In the courtyard.
 He Yong was talking to someone when his eyes suddenly moved. He looked out of the door and heard the sound of a car engine from the courtyard.
 The person who was talking to him had also heard the commotion.
 He Yong had an unkempt beard and looked like a warrior, but his eyes were shining.
 And sitting opposite him was a woman with exquisite looks. She looked to be about 30 years old, her long hair draped over her shoulders, and she was wearing a kind of long dress that was popular in Whitemoon city, the kind that covered even her heels.
 At that moment, the woman also heard the commotion and glanced at He Yong.
 He Yong's eyes flickered."Super ... At the level of sunlit!"
 There was a familiar feeling.
 I remember now, Wang Ming!
 Why was he here?
 There seemed to be someone else ... Li Hao!
 Yes, it was definitely Li Hao.
 He Yong was very surprised. Why did these two people come to his place?  In Silver City, they couldn't wait to get rid of her.
 Just as she was thinking this, someone knocked on the door, and Wang Ming's loud voice rang out."Senior Nan, open the door, we're here to see you!"
 The woman looked at He Yong and smiled."Your friend?"
 "Friend?"
 He Yong laughed, his mouth splitting open. He stood up and said,""You can say that. We're friends despite our age, just that our mouths are a little bigger."
 "I'll take my leave then,"the woman smiled and stood up.
 "Yes."
 He Yong didn't say anything. The two of them stood up and walked out.
 He walked a few steps out of the residence. The courtyard was rather large, and he Yong wasn't in a hurry, so he didn't move quickly. This time, Wang Ming, who was at the door, was anxious.
 "Clang clang clang!"
 "Senior Nan, are you not at home? I can hear the sound. We're not welcome here, are we?"
 "What an impatient person," the woman chuckled while covering her mouth.
 He Yong was also speechless. As he walked, he said,""He's more arrogant. He was very low-key before. He probably thought that after returning to white moon City, he would have someone to protect him, so he's not afraid anymore."
 As she said that, she laughed.
 That's right, he was a night patrol, and hou Xiaochen had killed Xuguang with a single spear strike, so why would Wang Ming be afraid of the southern Fist?
 After a few words, He Yong opened the door.
 Wang Ming laughed and was about to say something when he saw the woman and was slightly startled. He then looked at the southern style and smiled.
 He Yong didn't explain. He just smiled and nodded at Li Hao.
 The woman glanced at Wang Ming, then at the silent Li Hao, and chuckled."Big brother he, then I won't disturb you any longer. Come to my place and have a chat when you have time."
 "Definitely!"
 "Then I'll take my leave first!"
 She nodded slightly at the two of them and walked out of the courtyard. Outside the door, a car quickly drove in, and the woman got in and left elegantly, dragging her long dress.
 Wang Ming looked back and smiled.
 He Yong also laughed.
 Li Hao wasn't in the mood to laugh. He glanced at Wang Ming and frowned."Be careful. Don't show that expression to everyone. If you meet someone you can't afford to offend, you'll be in trouble."
 "What do you mean?" Wang Ming's eyes moved.
  "Martial Master douqian."
 Li Hao said calmly,"as expected, senior Southern Fist knows a lot of experts. As expected of a famous Martial Master!" Any one of you is a rare warrior master. "
 Wang Ming stared blankly for a moment in disbelief."Qian Dou? I couldn't tell!"
 Li Hao laughed,"you're just blind!" It wasn't just a warrior's Qian, it was the kind that had killed countless people. Don't think that he's that old, I think ... He's at least 50!"
 "Around 50 years old. If it was 20 years ago, he would be at least 30 years old."
 Li Hao pondered for a moment and smiled.""There weren't many famous female martial masters in the Silver Moon martial forest back then. The blue light sword and the light sword of the Seven Swords, the lancets of the swordsmen, the embroidered spring fist of the fist, the heart-crushing palm of the palm ..."
 Li Hao looked at He Yong and said with a smile,"that person just now, could it be ... The heart-jabbing tender guest who jabbed at the foot door?."
 He Yong laughed,"good eyes!" How did you know?"
 "Her long dress is dragging on the floor, covering her legs and feet."
 Li Hao smiled calmly."There's nothing special about the other parts of her body. Since her feet are covered, she's probably a heart-jabbing tsundere. My master told me several times that this woman likes to stab people with her feet, which are faster than knives. Once her feet are used, countless martial masters 'hearts will be pierced."

 "From the looks of it, he doesn't seem to have advanced to thousand warrior recently. Does that mean that he wasn't in Silver Moon previously? did he come from the royal family?"
 He Yong took a deep look at Li Hao, somewhat surprised and somewhat strange. After a long while, he said,""Kid, you seem to be more confident and calm than before. Why, are you more confident now in white moon City?"
 Li Hao shook his head and smiled."No. I've just seen through some things. Senior, please don't mind."
 "Senior, aren't you going to invite us in?" he asked with a smile.
 "Hahaha!"
 He Yong laughed,"interesting! Come in and sit! To tell the truth, I didn't even think that you were old demon Yuan's disciple when you were so cautious before, but now you do. Back then, old demon Yuan was also very arrogant at your age. "
 "Senior, have you ever seen my master at his age?"
 Li Hao also laughed."My master is over 70 years old this year. He's considered quite old. 50 years ago, he probably just broke through 100. Senior Southern Fist isn't as old as my master, right?"
 Yuan Shuo was considered an older Martial Master, and Southern Fist should be younger than him.
 He Yong smiled."I've seen him before. I'm only a few years younger than your master. When he was 20, he was already a famous Martial Master. Although he wasn't as famous as he was later on, he followed his master to travel the world ..."
  Teacher's master?
 Li Hao hadn't heard of it before, so he asked curiously,""My teacher's master ..."
 "Yes, it was quite famous in the past, but its limelight was later overshadowed by Yuan Shuo. Old demon Yuan did not cultivate the five birds technique at first, but he dug up his own grave and found the five birds technique. He improved on it and created the current five birds sect!"
 The five birds technique was created by Yuan Shuo, or rather, it was modified from ancient books.
 This meant that the five birds sect had only started to have an inheritance starting from Yuan Shuo.
 Li Hao nodded and didn't ask any further.
 He Yong led him inside and said,""The heart-jabbing beauty ... No one has called her that for many years. Now, everyone calls her Madam Bai! She's married, but she's not from the royal family, so she's not with me. It's just that her old friends are all in Silver Moon, so she's here to see me. "
 "Speaking of which, perhaps you know her husband," he added with a smile.
 "Who is it?"
 Wang Ming was a little puzzled."A douqian Martial Master? I've never heard of him before. My husband's family is surnamed Bai. It's not easy to marry a douqian Martial Master. Are there any experts surnamed Bai in white moon City?"
 "You said Whitemoon city!" He Yong laughed.
 Wang Ming was taken aback.
 "The Bai family of white moon City?" he asked in surprise after a long while.
 "Right!"
  Li Hao, however, was a little confused.  Wang Ming hurriedly said,"Whitemoon city!" Whitemoon city was not originally called Whitemoon city, but later on, people gradually called it Whitemoon city. However, everyone gradually forgot that Whitemoon city's original name was later called by the officials. "
 "'Silver Moon' is the first word of Silver City and Moon City. However, many people think that it's the second word of white moon City. In fact, it's wrong. However, it's been a long time. Those who aren't natives don't know about this."
 Wang Ming was a native of the White moon clan, so he knew very well what was going on. He quickly said,"The reason why the White moon City was given the word" white "was because 80 years ago, the Bai family was the city Lord of the White moon City for 120 years! It was only when the imperial family retreated behind the scenes, the Bai family stepped down, and the administrative Bureau was established that the Bai family was no longer there. "
 The city Lord!
 It was an ancient form of address.
 However, 80 years ago, the city Lord was the city's boss. The Bai family's inheritance was passed down, and they had always been the city Lord of white moon City, ruling the entire Silver Moon.
 80 years later, not many people still remembered the Bai family.
 Li Hao was also surprised."The Bai family ... Senior Southern Fist said that heart-stabbing beauty married into the Bai family?" he asked.
 "Yes,"
 "The Bai family is now divided into two groups," He Yong said with a smile."One is in stellarsky city, and the other is still here. You know the White Dragon Army, right?"
 Li Hao was surprised and glanced at Wang Ming.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Wang Ming said embarrassedly,"I forgot to tell you. The White Dragon Army was actually an Army established by the Bai family back then. It was only after the Bai family withdrew that the White Dragon Army became one of the three garrisoned armies. So when senior Nan mentioned it just now, I thought of the Bai family of white moon City."
 "The current commander of the White Dragon Army ..." Li Hao raised his eyebrows.
  Wang Ming shook his head."It has nothing to do with the Bai family. Otherwise, I wouldn't have said that there weren't any experts from the Bai family. The current commander of the White Dragon Army is Ren tianchuan. You might've met him this morning."
 Li Hao thought of the commander who was around 50 years old. He didn't hear him speak, but he wasn't weak. He was an expert at the peak of the three-sun realm.
 The three of them entered the house.
 He Yong smiled."It's not that the Bai family doesn't have any experts in white moon City. It's just that they're relatively low-key. I'm not talking nonsense when I said that you might know her husband. Hu dingfang knows him, right?" Have you heard of the Vice commander of the Tiger wing Army, Bai Yuanqing?"
 Wang Ming was taken aback again,"that white-faced commander?" I've almost forgotten his name. I only know that everyone calls him the white-faced general ..."
 Anyway, Li Hao was at a loss. He didn't know her.
 p How did he get involved with the Tiger wing Army?  Silver moon's situation was indeed complicated.
 He Yong continued."It's him. Madam Bai married him. The Bai family actually contributed a lot to Hu dingfang becoming the commander of the Tiger wing Army at such a young age. Silver moon's situation is rather complicated. "
 "The Bai family supports Hu dingfang, so they're like sitting Tigers. The Bai family is in stellarsky city and has some connections with the military law Department, so Hu dingfang can be considered a proper representative of the military law Department. The garrison is under the military law Department, so Hu dingfang is a proper and proper person."

 "What?" Li Hao was confused."Why doesn't the Bai family support that Bai Yuanqing as the commander?"
 "Hu dingfang is not simple either!"
 He Yong laughed."There are other people behind Hu dingfang. Hu dingfang originally had a hard time being a commander, but it's said that his wife is a capable person. His wife has contributed a lot."
 After saying that, he gave Li Hao a meaningful look.
 Li Hao said indifferently,"my Senior Sister, senior, why are you beating around the bush?" What great ability can my Senior Sister have?"
 He Yong laughed."Of course he is. Your teacher has a good relationship with Huang Yu. I don't know the details, but the two know each other and have some friendship. At that time, your Senior Sister seemed to have gone to Huang Yu, and Huang Yu later supported Hu dingfang to take over. The Bai family could only swallow their anger. After all, Hu dingfang was their support, so they couldn't fall out with him. After all, many people didn't want the Bai family to rise again, so when Hu dingfang took over, he also received a lot of support from the higher-ups."
 “……”
 Li Hao's head ached when he heard this. It was just a random woman, but he was involved.
 It was originally fine, but it involved his Senior Sister, then Yuan Shuo, and now Li Hao.
 Li Hao helplessly shook his head.
  As expected, in this world, as long as you had more than a few people, you would be able to form a relationship with anyone. With this calculation, he really did have some connection with this heart-stabbing tender guest.
 He Yong understood Silver moon's situation very well.
 Seeing that Li Hao seemed to be getting impatient, he laughed and said,""It's actually good to be clear about this. At the very least, you'll be able to connect the dots, and then you'll find that it's quite interesting. For example, hou Xiaochen and Huang Yu, the two of them that don't seem to have anything to do with each other, but 30 years ago, the two of them were eating and drinking together, and their relationship was quite good. In the end, 30 years later, the two of them seem to have become strangers. "
 Li Hao raised his eyebrows.
 "Try to guess again," He Yong continued."You'll realize that the time of appearance of your night patrolman, chief Yu, and the time of disappearance of a certain someone are extremely close to each other!"
 "Senior, please tell me about it," Li Hao said, interested.
 "Do you know the red moon?"
 “……”
 Nonsense!
 He Yong laughed,"when Red Moon was established, there was a saying that July was high in the sky!" Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple. The first generation Purple Moon was actually a female expert in Silver Moon martial forest. Purple Moon had always been in charge of Silver Moon, but in the end, the first generation Purple Moon disappeared very quickly, and not long after, there was no sign of her. It was said that she was assassinated, and then, chief Yu appeared among your night watchers. "
 "The second generation Purple Moon only inherited the identity of the first generation Purple Moon, but your Minister hou didn't seem to like the title of the purple Moon, so he killed the second generation Purple Moon with a single shot!"
 "When it comes to the third generation Purple Moon, I don't know if it's because Ying Hongyue has learned her lesson, but do you know what the third generation Purple Moon, who is the current Purple Moon, is?"
 At this moment, Li Hao was completely dumbfounded. He blankly said,""What?"
 "The current Ziyue is actually orange moon's daughter. Orange moon is a woman, a good friend of the first-generation Ziyue. The third-generation Ziyue has lived to this day without dying ..."
 Li Hao blinked.
 Wang Ming was also dumbfounded.
 He understood what she meant.
 The first generation's purple Moon was the current Chief Yu.
 Because of this title, the second generation Zi Yue was not well liked and was killed by hou Xiaochen.
  Third generation Zi Yue, Ying Hongyue has also learned her lesson and found chief Yu's best friend's daughter to be her ... Do you have the cheek to continue killing?  What the hell!
 Li Hao heaved a long sigh."Senior, don't speak nonsense. How is that possible?!"
 "You don't believe me?"
 He Yong laughed."The first Purple Moon, called the Jade Rakshasa. Hou Xiaochen was too arrogant. He didn't even bother changing his name and just called her little Yu. This isn't the Jade Rakshasa. I'm eating poop while standing upside down!"
 “……”
 Li Hao was in a daze. After a long time, he laughed."Forget it, senior. Don't talk to me about Jianghu gossip. I'm not interested. I don't care who they are. It has nothing to do with me!"
 He laughed bitterly in his heart.
 The first generation Purple Moon ... Chief Yu?
 What the hell!
 Red Moon and I have a blood feud.
 He thought for a moment and asked,""How many years has it been since chief Yu joined the night patrolman?"
 "I told you. He disappeared a long time ago, about 15 years ago."
 Li Hao calculated carefully. At that time, Red Moon should not have started the eight great families plan.
 With this thought in mind, he felt at ease for a while.
 Otherwise, Li Hao would feel very awkward about the other party's participation in the eight great families 'plan, and he wouldn't know if he should take revenge.
 This old man Nanquan is not a good person!
 This fellow had been in the royal family for many years, so he knew a lot of secrets.
 Of all people, Hu dingfang and chief Yu were involved with Li Hao and were deliberately causing trouble for Li Hao.
  Of course, it could also be a reminder.
 Li Hao felt that his mouth was too cheap. He had to expose the identity of the heart-stabbing beauty, but in the end, the old man had told him a bunch of gossip.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Senior, ignore them!"
 "I've come to visit you this time because I have a request,"Li Hao said with a smile.
 "Blood Reformation?"
 "You want to ask about the specific process, specific changes, or specific methods of blood transfusion?"
 Li Hao was stunned. So direct?
 Nan Quan laughed again."Simple. Come, hit me. Hit me until I'm on the ground and I'll tell you!" I promise I won't hide anything. "
 Li Hao raised his eyebrows.
 He Yong leaned back in his chair and said arrogantly,""What, you don't dare to? Or could he not? Was this all a swordsman could do? Yu Xiao and Huang Jie died so quickly, and Yu Xiao appeared first. Even if I say that Huang Jie was killed by Hao lianchuan, does that mean that Yu Xiao choked to death on water?"

 Li Hao frowned slightly.
 He knew that some people would make guesses, but he didn't expect that someone would expose him so quickly.
 He Yong ... Was indeed as the rumors said. The southern Fist might look rough, but it was actually bold and careful!
 He Yong chuckled and looked at Li Hao."Are you interested in a spar? To be honest, I also want to see the power of swordsman Dou Qian. I once sparred with a swordsman Dou Qian in the central region, and in the end ... I couldn't even withstand a single blow!"
 "Of course, he's not a Silver Moon swordsman. There's a top swordsman in the central continent, the sky sword of the past. However, he's now a superpower and is unbelievably powerful. He's a top existence even at the sunguang level and is considered a Big Shot!"
 He Yong laughed."The heavenly Sword is strong. The earth-overturning sword is now hiding like a mouse. I can't be bothered with him." The Jade lightsaber and your master are now killing the Crimson Moon's men, and the radiant sword has gone missing ... To be honest, it's too rare to see the Silvermoon swordsman these days. Why don't you play with me?"
 Li Hao glanced at He Yong. After a long while, he said in a deep voice,""Senior ... Do you want to spar?"
 He Yong raised his eyebrows."I kind of think so ... Of course, don't be like your master. You kill people when you're sparring!" When your master kills someone, that guy deliberately finds someone of equal strength to fight with. In that case, there's a 90% chance that someone will die. As for the two of us ... I don't know if I'm far better than you or you're far better than me, but I don't think it's necessary to fight to the death. There shouldn't be such a thing as equal strength. "
 "Although I came to Silver Moon to see how strong the spirit accumulation stage is, I can see that the person I'm looking for is your master, not you."
  "Then forget it!" Li Hao shook his head.
 "Why?"
 "Swordsmen don't spar, but they kill with their swords!"
 He Yong frowned. After a while, he sighed and said,""Forget it then. Someone has said the same thing before. Tian Jian said the same thing. He has killed countless people in the central continent. He will kill people as soon as he strikes with his sword!"
 Shaking his head, He Yong said regretfully,""It's a pity that I still have things to do and I haven't seen your master yet, so I don't want to fight you to the death now. Even if you win, you'll be ridiculed. You can't beat old demon Yuan, so you went to beat his disciple ... You'll be too ashamed to see anyone. "
 On the side, Wang Ming couldn't help but say,"senior might not be my senior brother's match ..."
 Since he had already pointed it out, he didn't mind flattering him.
 "Perhaps!" He Yong laughed.
 After saying that, he looked at Li Hao and said,"I know why you're here." Martial masters all desired to become stronger, or rather, everyone desired to become stronger. However, the blood transfusion technique doesn't really suit you. Your body isn't weak, so you might not become stronger quickly after the blood transfusion. "
 Li Hao frowned. Was she not willing to communicate?  It was normal.
 After all, this might be the path that the other party had found, and not everyone was willing to share it. Didn't he also not mention the key to accumulating spirit?
 However, he had originally thought that he would at least gain something.  "Don't think too much. "
 "It's not that I'm unwilling, but there's no need to!"He Yong laughed.
 "Of course, it's not like I don't have anything to tell you,"
 He Yong thought about it and said,"you are a swordsman. If you want to become strong again, there is a way. Let's see if you dare to do it."
 "What?"
 "Fire Phoenix spear!"
 Li Hao was stunned again. Why was the fire Phoenix spear involved?
 "Hou Xiaochen must have been a top-tier Martial Master back then, and he must have been one of the three great commanders! Back then, there was a high chance that he was a warrior. As for now, I can't tell if he's a Martial Master or a superhuman. "
 "But he killed the red-haired man with one spear strike. I saw something. His spear, spear intent, and spear force are still there!"
 "Go and borrow the fiery phoenix spear from him," He Yong said in a deep voice."There's something special about origin God weapons. If it's nurtured for many years, the soul inside will recover! Once the soul of these origin God weapons is awakened, they will inherit some things from their master, such as Shi!"
 "You were able to borrow an origin god weapon and get the fire Phoenix spear ... If you have the money, get some divine power stones and activate the fire Phoenix spear. Don't fight hou Xiaochen, it's meaningless. However, if you exchange blows with the ownerless blazing Phoenix spear, you might be able to obtain some unexpected gains. "
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Feel hou Xiaochen's force and the power of the fire Phoenix spear ... When your sword intent and spear intent clash, you'll definitely gain a lot as long as you don't get killed by the origin god weapon!"
  "In fact, I can even use this opportunity to sense hou Xiaochen's Shi. He was very powerful back then, and he's just as powerful now ..."
 "Is what senior said true?" Li Hao's eyes twinkled.
 "Nonsense!"
 "Is there a need to lie to you?" He Yong laughed. Not only hou Xiaochen, but Huang Yu as well. If you can borrow his weapon, you'll be able to benefit as well. In fact, every weapon that a Martial Master nurtures all year round will have some of his own divine intent in it. "
 "An origin god weapon is the best! It's because the origin god weapon has a soul!"
 Speaking of this, He Yong added,"there are also some origin divine weapons from the ancient civilization that have been sealed. If they had an owner back then and their divine intent has not dispersed, you can also try to unseal them. However ... It's too dangerous! If the previous master is too powerful, and the intent left behind is too powerful...Then you're finished. Once the weapon soul awakens and kills you in one move, you'll die. "
 "Therefore, it's best not to try it. An origin god weapon like the Phoenix spear that has been unsealed for many years should at least have some stability."
 He Yong really knew a lot.
 At this moment, Li Hao quickly absorbed everything.
