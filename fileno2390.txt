That was the eye of the sword! At that moment, as the power of his bloodline was stripped away, the sword eye was also dissipating.Ying Hongyue was ecstatic!He was about to succeed!Li Hao, you're too arrogant!More and more power was drawn out. Li Hao's aura seemed to be slightly weakened. The hundreds of stars in his mind and spirit sea were in turmoil!The sword intent was somewhat overflowing!Li Hao's eyes were extremely clear, and he just watched in silence.After an unknown amount of time, the eight trigrams Formation became more and more brilliant. Ying Hongyue was initially ecstatic, but at this moment, she was somewhat frightened. During this process, Li Hao ... Didn't seem to resist!This made him extremely uneasy!Why didn't he resist?The eight trigrams Formation was powerful, but Li Hao was not. Why didn't he resist?But now that things had come to this, he couldn't stop. There was only fear and uneasiness, and a little less excitement and ecstasy.When he absorbed the last bit of bloodline power, Li Hao suddenly exhaled.""Finished? He was good! To be honest, I've long wanted to strip away all of the Li family bloodline power. Li daoheng clearly still has some tricks up his sleeve, but it's hard for me to strip away all of it ... Thank you!"He revealed a slight smile, and the golden light that flickered in his eyes from before was no longer present.At this moment, Li Hao smiled as if he had returned to his original state.""The firmament sword has accompanied the Li family for many years, and the power of my bloodline has seeped deep into my bones ... Even if I changed my physical body, I still can't get rid of the influence of this power of my bloodline ... I've always wanted to strip it away and get rid of some of li daoheng's backup plans ... But I've never succeeded. I really have to thank you!"Ying Hongyue roared,"Li Hao, do you think you're at an advantage just because you took away the Li family's bloodline?" Today, I'll merge all eight meridians into one ..."In an instant, the eight trigrams Formation transformed into a human!Her eight bloodlines started to merge completely. Ying Hongyue's aura rose sharply and completely suppressed Li Hao in an instant.His expression was cold. At this moment, the two of them were almost face to face. He looked at Li Hao coldly.No!Even if you did, you would have failed!Li Hao, you're still too arrogant!At this moment, Li Hao didn't even look at him. He just looked at the sky and suddenly said,""It's almost time!"What?Just as he had such a thought, the seven big cities suddenly burst out with a bright light. The sword city also burst out with a bright light!The seal in the air began to tremble violently!Above Li Hao's head, two words suddenly appeared: "Zhan Tian"!"The eight meridians converge. Please use the saber of the venerable sovereign!"Li Hao's shout shook the world. Suddenly, a bloody saber under the city started to shake. The Li Dynasty!The God of beginner martial had just returned when his expression suddenly changed. Li Hao's voice resounded,""Senior, please use the blood saber to nourish the venerable sovereign's saber with the blood of the Crimson Moon!"The God of beginner martial's expression changed slightly. The next moment, he gritted his teeth and roared. A powerful qi and blood energy spread across the world!In the distance, the bloody blade under the city started to shake violently!In an instant, it suddenly rose from the ground!It was as if he had rushed out from another space!A powerful being flew out from the North, instantly shuttling through the void and grabbing the blood saber. His whole body trembled as he smashed through the void and arrived above the Silver City in an instant!At this moment, the God of beginner martial had a complicated expression on his face."Senior, please use your saber and cut eight meridians!" Li Hao said calmly.The God of beginner martial's expression changed, and Ying Hongyue's expression also changed drastically. She gritted her teeth and roared,""The eight lineages were arranged by venerable sword and venerable blood Emperor to guard the Silver Moon. You can't interfere if you don't care ...""Senior, use your saber and cut eight meridians!" Li Hao said calmly.The God of beginner martial didn't care about Ying Hongyue. He only looked at Li Hao deeply and said in a low voice,""You ... You've already prepared for this ... You're using me ...""Senior, attack! To complete your mission ... The fusion of the eight branches is the most nourishing!"The God of beginner's martial arts sighed.I've been tricked by this kid!Should he use a saber?  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  Of course!In an instant, a blood-red saber slashed down. Ying Hongyue, who had just combined her eight meridians, had a drastic change in expression. She reached out her hand to grab the saber. However, this was a saber of a venerable sovereign. Not only that, the person wielding the saber was a half-step sovereign!One blade!The eight-Meridian blood pillar collapsed instantly. The sleeping cat in the saber opened its mouth and swallowed all the bloodline power!The God of beginner martial slashed with his blade and instantly disappeared with it. His voice came with a bit of helplessness and a bit of hesitation. "Don't expect me to owe you a favor. I don't owe you anything. If you want to talk about favors ... You should look for the blood Emperor, not me. I'm just a handyman ... Damn it, damn it!"After fusing with the eight bloodlines, this was the greatest tonic, stronger than the faith he had gathered all these years. The cat in the knife even showed signs of opening its eyes!To the blood Emperor, to him ... It was a debt of gratitude!Motherf * cker!I'm so angry!He helped Li Hao cut the meridians of his enemy, but he still had to owe him a favor ... The God of beginner martial felt that he had suffered a loss just thinking about it, and he instantly disappeared.His eight meridians were instantly severed!Ying Hongyue, who had been at her peak just a moment ago, suddenly had her vitality and strength drop. Her face was ashen as she looked at Li Hao, who seemed to have expected everything, in a daze. She muttered,"You ... You schemed against me?"

Chapter 2391 Killing Ying Hongyue (1)_6
Li Hao looked at him in silence for a long time before he said softly,""Scheme? What kind of scheme was this? The fusion of the eight meridians is the most nourishing for that saber. You've already schemed against the heavens, yet you still don't know this? If you can't even predict this, what are you planning? Why didn't Zheng Yu try to merge the eight meridians? Why didn't li daoheng try to merge the eight meridians? You're the smartest one and you're the only one who can merge the eight meridians?"Li Hao sneered,"everyone knows that you can merge eight meridians ... Even a half-step sovereign isn't as smart as you. You're the only one who can merge eight meridians and instantly become an invincible master?" Ying Hongyue ... Why are you so smart?"Ying Hongyue's face was completely ashen as she muttered,"No, it's not like that. When the eight meridians are combined, one can control this saber ...""Do you think you can control the saber of a venerable sovereign? Its owner was not dead! When the eight meridians unite, it means that the eight great families have been devoured. To the blood Emperor, whoever dares to devour the eight great families ... Is courting death. Killing your own kind, aren't you going to die?"Li Hao continued to mock him,"so ... The moment you, or anyone else, combine their eight meridians, it's the time of death!" You ... Are you looking down on those new martial Supreme emperors?"Ying Hongyue's face was deathly pale. At this moment, her essence, energy, and spirit seemed to have completely collapsed.He had been pursuing the eight meridians as one for his entire life. It would have been fine if he had not succeeded, but the moment he succeeded, when his aura surpassed Li Hao's and he was infinitely close to a pseudo-Emperor ... With one slash, the eight meridians that he had struggled for his entire life ... Were completely gone!Such a blow could no longer be described as despair.He stared blankly in the direction that the God of beginner martial left and muttered,""Why ... If I can't combine the eight meridians, how can I get close to that blade ... That blade can only be approached by combining the eight meridians ..."Li Hao sighed."You're still as stupid as ever. Why would the blood Emperor let people get close to his blade in order to resurrect the cat he wanted to resurrect?" The knife he left behind was not for people to get close to him. Other than the person he designated, who else could get close?"That wasn't an opportunity!Li Hao shook his head."That saber isn't an opportunity for others. Stupid guy. Do you understand?"That's not an opportunity, so why did I let you get close?The purpose of its existence was to prevent others from interfering with its resurrection of the cat. The purpose of this sword from the beginning was to protect the cat. No one except the God of beginner martial could take it away!Ying Hongyue's face turned completely pale as she looked at Li Hao in a daze.It was not an opportunity!He saw the blade as his greatest opportunity. After the eight meridians merged, he would be able to take the blade. With the monarch's blade, he would be so powerful that he could even kill a half-step sovereign!But today, Li Hao said that it was not an opportunity!"Blood Emperor ... What he left behind is not an opportunity ..." He mumbled.Everyone said that the blood Emperor was kind. Why wasn't it an opportunity to leave behind a blade?Li Hao chuckled and said,'why did the blood Emperor leave behind an opportunity? Even if he stayed, he would not do it in this way. He wanted to resurrect the creature he wanted to resurrect. Even Saints had a reverse scale. Moreover, he was a venerable sovereign from Xin Wu. How dare you touch his reverse scale? You're really ... A retard!"Take me for example. If I were to resurrect my master, would I make the place where my master was resurrected into a land of opportunity? Was it to be destroyed by others and gain benefits?I'll make that place the biggest killing ground. Whoever dares to break in will die!The blood Emperor was already being merciful by not killing anyone who had barged in!Yet, this fellow in front of him treated it as an opportunity ... What an idiot!"Impossible ... Impossible ... Zheng Yu and the rest have been planning this all along ..."Ying Hongyue was still unwilling to give up. She said in despair, "It's not just me. They're also plotting for this saber, and his father even died for it ... Li Hao, according to what you're saying, isn't Zheng Yu an idiot too?"Li Hao smiled brightly."They're like me. They want to raise you. You see, you're the best tonic for blood-edge now that you've fused all eight meridians." If I feed that knife, the God of beginner martial will owe me a favor ... Do you think they're after a knife?"Wrong!They wanted the God of beginner martial!What an idiot!"Zheng Yu, I've been feeding you all this time. Can't you tell? Do you think that he fed you to snatch the saber? No, he's going to feed you to the knives to support you!"Pfft!Ying Hongyue spurted out a mouthful of blood. She seemed to have gone mad."You raised me not to snatch the saber, but to feed it!He thought of Zheng Yu, who had given him countless benefits over the past few days. He had even devoured his own clone and obtained countless inheritances after entering the stone door.He had thought that the other party was trying to deal with the red moon sovereign and use him to get the saber ...In the end, it wasn 't!Zheng Yu wanted him to become stronger and merge his eight meridians into one. Then, he would feed that blade so that the God of beginner martial stage would owe him a favor and join forces with him to kill li daoheng!,m So that was how it was!They didn't plan to use that blade. Even if they did, it wouldn't be now, but after they had proven their Dao as venerable sovereigns!  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  Li Hao gently patted his face and chuckled.""Even if I refine Silver Moon, I might still be able to encounter new martial artists ... Would they easily use that blade? You're so silly ... They were all thinking about how to help the blood Emperor resurrect the cat. Then ... Even if all the Silvermoon people were dead, as long as they gave the cat to the blood Emperor, the blood Emperor would protect them with his life! All the people here are actually not as good as a cat ... Even if the human King is angry and the blood Emperor protects them with his life, neo martial will not target them ... You still don't understand!"

Chapter 2392 Killing Ying Hongyue (3 In 1)-7
On the outside, Zhang an was stunned and his entire person was stunned.Li Hao's voice was cold,"do you think that everyone only looks at what's in front of them?" Only silver Moon? Neo martial would definitely still exist! If they were to destroy the blood Emperor's plan, they would be hunted down by an invincible venerable Emperor once they left the Silver Moon! Even the new Martial Emperor would hunt them down! Even Zhang an's status in neo martial arts is not as high as this dead cat. Do you understand?"Ying Hongyue looked at Li Hao in a daze. Li haoyou sneered and said,"So, why do you think that you can easily use this saber? Whether it's the eight main cities or Silvermoon small world, neo martial can abandon all of them ... But that cat in the knife ... Can't abandon it!""Director Zhang, do you think I'm right?" he looked at Zhang an and smiled.Zhang an was stunned. After a while, he nodded.​ 'Even if it's me ... Grandpa has more than one grandson. If he's really dead ... Then so be it.'Her grandfather could have given her up for the sake of the bigger picture.However ... The blood Emperor looked gentle, but he had to resurrect the cat. If he failed to resurrect the cat, he would lose all hope. A reincarnation of Zhan Tiandi, a master and a friend of the human King ... If he went crazy, the new martial arts team could even give up on dealing with the Crimson Moon world and focus on killing the guy who ruined the resurrection plan!Who would dare to move?No one dared to!Did the blood Emperor completely inherit the power of Zhan Tiandi?If he completely inherited it ... Even his grandfather would not be a match for him. The invincible sun god might only be on par with him.At this moment, he was a little dazed.All of this ... It seems that I have never thought about it.Ying Hongyue was in complete despair. There was only endless darkness in front of her. Li Hao reached out his hand, grabbed her head, and slapped her face."Ying Hongyue, I've said it before. Killing you is just a matter of a thought! What else do you have? I've allowed you to complete your eight meridians as one. Now ... Do you still have more?"Li Hao had pushed him to the peak of his life!He had completed the eight meridians unification that he had always been pursuing. However, it was gone in an instant!At this moment, Ying Hongyue had completely collapsed. She was filled with despair, fear, and madness."Kill me ... Li Hao ... Kill me ...""Kill me!"He had gone mad. He roared madly,"eight meridians as one, it's all a trap! It's a trap ..."The eight meridians as one that he had pursued for so many years was actually a trap!Then what was all that he had given up for?He thought back to the time when he was in Silver Moon, and the martial masters who had followed him ... But when he turned around, there was no one left!I originally thought that I could reach the peak.However, my decline from the peak only took an instant!This was even more painful than killing him!My eight meridians as one!"Kill me!"Ying Hongyue let out a mournful roar and went completely mad. She started to struggle violently, and blood started to flow out of her seven orifices.He was unwilling to accept this! He couldn't accept this!Even though he had been defeated by Li Hao, he hadn't been so desperate.Li Hao's face was cold,'a rat like you has collapsed in despair? How could that be! Do you think that I'll let you go and let you suffer ... Do you really like to read people's minds?"At this moment, Li Hao struck out with his sword. In the distance, Black Panther had brought back a group of people, but they were all killed by him in an instant!Ying Hongyue's aura continued to decline!At the same time, Li Hao tore the sky apart again, and a stream of blood flowed in. In the void, a beam of sword energy burst out, and Li Hao slashed it!"Li daoheng! Help me investigate all the void Dao meridians related to my blood!""Li Hao!"His cold voice resounded through the world. You've gone too far!Li Hao's voice was calm."Help me this time. I'll give you a copy of the bright moon sword. Other than the time sword, I'll give you the other 99 sword intents for your research!"The void instantly froze!Zheng Yu's voice was also heard, and he sounded a little surprised.""You crazy man ... Is it worth it To Kill a Clown? So what if I leave behind a few clones?"Bright moon sword Dao!They had all seen the 1000 swords before. They were very powerful. This was all Li Hao had comprehended after he mastered the great Dao and comprehended the longevity sword intent.Whether it was li daoheng or Zheng Yu, neither of them actually took Ying Hongyue seriously. Just as Li Hao had said, she was only food for that knife.In the end, in order to kill Ying Hongyue's Phantom Dao clone, Li Hao was actually willing to give away his sword Dao true Kang!Even if they were both half-step sovereigns, they wouldn't underestimate the true essence of sword intent of a half-step Master."Yes!" Li daoheng's voice came.A wisp of blood instantly fused into the void Dao universe. At the next moment, the universe trembled, and in an instant, miserable cries suddenly burst out from all over the world!Li Hao didn't say anything. The Dao integration experts around him disappeared one after another.Not long after, they brought back cultivators one by one. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  At this moment, Ying Hongyue was completely silent.He only looked at Li Hao for a long time before he laughed at himself."In order to kill me ... You're really ... Unbelievably crazy ... It seems like my death is worth it ..."Li Hao had really gone crazy in order to kill him!He had promised Red Moon sovereign to release his clone.He promised li daoheng that he would give him sword Dao true Kang.He had given up on the Li clan bloodline and given up the eight meridians as one ...It seemed that in Li Hao's eyes, killing him was better than killing all the heroes in the world. He had even exposed his time star.

Chapter 2393 Killing Ying Hongyue (3 In 1)-8
Ying Hongyue looked around at the clone that had turned into dust.At this moment, he had completely given up. He sighed,""Perhaps, my biggest mistake ... Was that I shouldn't have waited. I should have waited for you to rise ... Perhaps, from that day on, I was wrong. I should have killed you at the first moment!"Li Hao's face was calm."It's time for you to die. No matter how great the price I have to pay to kill you, I think it's worth it. Because ... I hate you!"Kachaa!His bones were broken, and blood and flesh flew everywhere!Li Hao squeezed her bit by bit, and every inch of her bones broke. Ying Hongyue groaned continuously, but she didn't shout. He gritted his teeth until his teeth were broken, and a fierce light appeared in his eyes."If you want me to be in complete despair ... I won't let you have your way! Li Hao ... Even if I die, I'll become your nightmare!" p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "I don't care about this. I only care about your complete death!"Kachaa!Ying Hongyue's tongue was crushed, and she couldn't make any more sound. Everyone around them was watching.He watched as Ying Hongyue was slowly crushed into pieces by Li Hao, but his eyes were still there, watching everything with open eyes!At this moment, Li Hao was so calm that he didn't seem to be alive.In the air, a corner of the seal began to collapse. The power of the Crimson Moon emerged, and an illusionary figure began to appear. Li Hao looked in that direction in silence.The illusory figure became stronger and stronger.He was getting stronger and stronger!After a long time, he transformed into red Moon sovereign. He looked at Li Hao as if he wanted to kill this guy, because Li Hao gave him a sense of threat.At that moment, the eight main cities were in a frenzy!In the distance, a blood saber seemed to be floating in the air. A man holding a saber seemed to be locking on to them. Red Moon sovereign sighed."If I don't kill you, I feel like ... It will be very troublesome!"Finishing his sentence, he sighed and punched through the void. At the next moment, he disappeared from his original spot and entered the void Dao universe!BOOM!The eight major cities emitted a brilliant light as the seal closed once again!Ying Hongyue's eyes dimmed completely. The venerable sovereign's clone ... Didn't choose to kill Li Hao.Li Hao sneered,"what are you expecting?" If he dares to attack me...Wouldn't the eight great bloodlines have been fed for nothing?"Ying Hongyue's eyes completely dimmed and turned into ashes in an instant!That's right!He had forgotten.If I feed my eight meridians as one to that blade, that God of beginner martial ... Will most likely attack! Could the venerable sovereign's clone match the man's blood saber?Probably ... Not!In the land of Dali.The God of beginner martial sighed and cursed.Why didn't he make a move?Do it, I'll kill that clone, and we'll end this once and for all. I don't owe you anything anymore!How annoying!He was so frustrated. I don't want to get involved, but Li Hao is feeding blood saber's eight combined meridians. The cat in the saber seems to be recovering soon. I owe him a huge favor!……Silver City.The eight cities pressed down, and the seal closed.Ying Hongyue had completely disappeared.Everyone around looked at Li Hao in silence. At this moment, Li Hao didn't say a word. He just disappeared from his original spot and landed on a mountain. Wisps of dust floated on the mountain.Li Hao silently looked at the empty graves on the mountain and said to himself, I ... Killed one of the culprits!Ying Hongyue was dead!He looked up at the sky. 'Now, I only have a few strong enemies left. These people are also the culprits. I won't let any of them go!' "Dad, mom, little Yuan ... It's not far!"Li Hao muttered.'That day won't be too far away. I'll get rid of all my enemies in the Silver Moon land!'At this moment, the great Dao was everywhere, and the giant dragon was soaring.Waves of Dao Meridian Energy spread out between heaven and earth!Li Hao's Dao Meridian was activated again.From the original 144 Dao meridians, it started to climb crazily.He revealed a smile. It was only today that I managed to kill this fellow that I had hated for a long time. I seemed to have failed.The gloominess in his heart had dissipated a lot at this moment.

Chapter 2394 After The Battle (1)
Ying Hongyue was dead!On the day he left Silver City, Li Hao had made up his mind to kill this enemy, to kill this executioner.Today, he had schemed and schemed and finally killed him!Truth Dao clone, Phantom Dao clone, main body, eight Meridian clone ...Ying Hongyue could be said to be the most difficult enemy to deal with in this era.Li Hao hadn't really come into contact with Zheng Yu and the others, and he hadn't really fought them either. In the few times he had come into contact with them, Li Hao hadn't suffered any losses either, so he didn't think much of them.Only Ying Hongyue ... He had come into contact with her a long time ago, but he couldn't kill her. He didn't dare to kill her!Killing him would be harder than killing a half-step sovereign.At this moment, Li Hao's gloominess was much less. His Dao heart was natural, and the cultivation of martial arts and heart was a characteristic of this era. If there was an obstacle in the heart, it would be difficult to advance on the great path.Today, he had cleared a huge obstacle and his great Dao was constantly rolling.Li Hao, who seemed calm, was not calm at all.Standing in front of the empty grave, he felt so complicated that no one could understand him. Who would have thought that Li Hao, who was still troubled by becoming a transcendent more than a year ago, would kill so many Heavenly Kings and his greatest enemy, Ying Hongyue, today?Li Hao smiled.Did you guys see that?Can you guys ... See it? Out of the billions of stars, is there one that belongs to you?I'm afraid not.He seemed to be crying and laughing at the same time.Even if I control the world, I probably can't resurrect you, right?Neither his parents nor Xiao Yuan were cultivators. Even if they had an innate Tao body and meridians, there was a high probability that they didn't have stars.There are countless stars in the starry sky, but is there one that belongs to you?Even if there is ... Will I be able to find it?"How many humans have been born and how many have died in the Silver Moon world over the countless years? how many stars still exist in this great path universe? they are extremely weak and are like dust. To find the one that belongs to you among these countless dust ... I might not be able to do it even if I spend my entire life.Li Hao smiled bitterly.Looking up at the starry sky and sensing some faint fluctuations, Ying Hongyue's eyes suddenly turned cold. Ying Hongyue might have been wrong about everything, but she was right about one thing: the Silver Moon world had suffered countless disasters in the past few decades. Not to mention other things, even the three bastards in the void Dao universe were unforgivable!At this moment, the great Dao fluctuated.The reality-level universe seemed to be affected. When the three Heavenly Kings self-destructed, the reality-level universe also fluctuated violently. Li Hao looked into the distance as he thought of something.On the other side of the Green Mountain, the God of beginner martial had already disappeared.Just now, Red Moon sovereign did not dare to attack him. On one hand, it was because of the fight for time and star. On the other hand, it was because he was afraid of that person and that blade. Everything that Ying Hongyue had hoped for would never happen.Moreover, at this moment, a thought suddenly appeared in Li Hao's mind ... Today, there was still one goal that he had not achieved. The will of the heavens ... Had not appeared.Even when Li Hao was besieged by the seven Heavenly Kings, the will of heaven didn't appear.Even when the time stars appeared, the Heaven's Will did not appear.Heaven's will ... Where did it go?Li Hao looked around at the experts. Was heaven's will ... Hidden among them?Do you think it's not time yet?Or did he think that he would fall into Li Hao's trap if he stepped out now?Many thoughts flashed through his mind.In the Silver Moon world, heaven's will was still extremely important. The benefits that the other party could give you might be troublesome, but the troubles that they could create might be unexpected.And this time, luring heaven's will to attack was also one of Li Hao's goals.The other party did not appear!He looked around again. At this moment, stars were shining above Li Hao's head, and his Dao meridians were constantly activated. He had absorbed the power of the past and the future, and his strength had improved a lot. Although he had not opened his meridians, he could open his Dao meridians at any time.At this moment, the number of stars rose from 144 to 100.Soon, the stars trembled.180 stars appeared!In an instant, they transformed into five circles. After killing Ying Hongyue, Li Hao had almost instantly reached the fifth level of Dao integration!Not only that, although li daoheng's sword had severely injured his spirit sea, the time and star had stayed there for a long time. Not only had it not weakened, but it had also become stronger.The core of the bright moon sword essence, the sword of time, and the star had also become more powerful than before. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Some of the sword essences that could not be contained before were also building stars.Li Hao had comprehended 188 splitting sword intents of the longevity sword intent. Before, he had only condensed 100, or 99, and the time sword intent was not one of them. At this moment, 100 swords began to form and became even more powerful.All around, everyone was feeling the fluctuations of the great Dao.Countless civilians in the entire Hao Yue continent were also waiting in confusion. They didn't know what the current situation was. Had the great Dao universe merged with the heaven and earth?He did not know.However, because Li Hao had killed many Heavenly Kings, he didn't absorb them directly. Instead, he let the energy spread between heaven and earth. The energy between heaven and earth became denser, but to say that the great Dao universe had merged with heaven and earth at this moment ... Even the civilian cultivators didn't find it shocking enough. It wasn't as powerful as they had imagined.At this moment, Li Hao's face appeared between heaven and earth, and the sky screen was opened again."The plan of the great Dao universe to belong to the Silver Moon was destroyed by the enemy ... Although seven or eight Heavenly Kings were killed, half-emperors, several half-emperors, and even venerable sovereigns appeared and stopped the great Dao universe from melting the Silver Moon!"

Chapter 2395 After The Battle (2)
"However, after this, the land of Silver Moon will threaten and kill all those below the half-step sovereign realm!" Li Hao's voice shook the world.Li Hao's voice rose."These half-emperors and venerable sovereigns ... Won't be able to do anything for a few days. We'll come again when that time comes!" The world had returned to normal. Due to the recent deaths of many Heavenly Kings, there was sufficient energy. After killing the half-step sovereign ... The world would naturally evolve! With us here, there's no need to worry about these rats!"Everyone was quiet.He wasn't really nervous, but he was a little confused. Half-step sovereigns and venerable sovereigns ... How strong were they?He didn't really understand!But it felt very powerful.As for the Heavenly Kings, they knew a little about them. It was said that they were above the fourth level of the Dao integration realm, which was very terrifying. It seemed that the Marquis had killed many of them last time, so they did not think it was inappropriate to kill another batch today.As for those who knew more, they were all extremely afraid and nervous.Half-Emperor?Venerable sovereigns?These legendary existences and legendary levels, the Silvermoon world, actually still existed?It was unbelievable!Heavenly Kings ... Even in new martial arts, they were not weak. Yet ... A group of them were killed so easily?Just how strong was Marchioness Silvermoon now?Although the plan to merge the great DAOs had failed this time, no one felt that there was anything wrong with it. The world Energy had indeed increased again, and it had increased by a lot.For everyone ... It was still enough for cultivation.It had only taken them a little time to absorb a lot of the spring of life and feel the increase in energy. To everyone, they didn't lose anything and were all in high spirits.As for the strong coming, everyone believed that with Marchioness Silvermoon there, there wouldn't be a problem. Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ Today, everyone had unconditional trust in Li Hao.This was because every time an enemy attacked, no matter how strong they were, they would be repelled or killed. Ever since Li Hao took control of the world, there had never been a great chaos on the bright star continent.……"Lord Marquis!"Lin Hongyu and the others only dared to approach Li Hao now.At this moment, Li Hao's aura was even more powerful.However, after he reached 180 Dao meridians, Li Hao stopped opening his Dao meridians. Instead, he opened his void Dao sword intent.At this moment, the number of sword intent stars in his spirit sea had reached 130.In terms of realm, Li Hao had reached the fifth level of Dao integration ... But the improvement was not as great as he had expected. He had paid a huge price this time.He had exposed his spirit Sea World and lost the chance to launch a surprise attack on the void Dao universe. He had also exposed Time and Stars, as well as all his trump cards ...In the end, he only killed Ying Hongyue and some Heavenly Kings who didn't affect the overall situation. His cultivation level had only increased by a small level.From an outsider's point of view ... If it wasn't a personal grudge, it wouldn't be worth it.A fifth-level Dao integration cultivator was only in the middle to late-stage Heavenly King realm.And this was all referring to the No origin Heavenly King.Only those at the sixth level of Dao integration or even the peak of the sixth level could be comparable to a peak Heavenly King, which was still a distance away from a half-step sovereign. One would need to be at least at the seventh level of Dao integration to be comparable to a half-step sovereign, and even the top half-step sovereigns would need to be at the eighth or ninth level.At this moment, Zhang an also landed. He looked at Li Hao with mixed feelings.At this time, she suddenly didn't know what to say and helplessly said,""I've always wanted to get rid of those traitors, but now ... Other than li daoheng and Zheng Yu, you've killed everyone else!"He had planned this for a long time.​ In the end ... He hadn't even thought of how to deal with Zheng Yu when Li Hao killed everyone except Zheng Yu and Li daoheng!Even he couldn't help but sigh. Li Hao ... Really resembled his grandfather.The Supreme martial artist that everyone in neo martial arts respected!At the very least, Li Hao's schemes and calculations were successful every time. Moreover ... They were the kind that you knew was a trap, but you had no choice but to step into it.Even if it was a scheme, it was also majestic!If the God of beginner martial arts was the celestial pole's avatar, such an existence who could survive in neo martial world until the end of time had no choice but to walk out of his place of residence this time. This was true ability!He had no choice but to step out!The convergence of the eight meridians. Li Hao had given him and that saber ... Heaven's Fate didn't care about it, but he had to consider that saber. Therefore, that person was probably extremely depressed at this moment.Zhang an was filled with countless emotions!Li Hao ... Was really capable!This time, another thought surfaced in his mind. If Li Hao could get past Silver Moon in the future ... He might even surpass his grandfather. Of course, whether he could stand shoulder to shoulder with the human Emperor was hard to say.Although the human King was not good at planning, nor did he like to plan, his overbearing and brave nature was unparalleled.At this moment, he could clearly sense that Li Hao and the human King were two completely different kinds of people.The Saints behind him were also at a loss.Now that they had killed all of them ... There were only two half-step sovereigns left. What should they, the Saints, do?Kill a pseudo-Emperor?Or what?It seemed like ... There was nothing to do.For a moment, they felt a little helpless and looked at Zhang an. Originally, they had followed Zhang an because they wanted the neo martial artists to take revenge on their own. In the end, from the beginning to the end, Zhang an's biggest contribution was actually to take down Galaxy city!At that moment, the Saint from the Zhang family's dingtian city suddenly said,""Marquis li, we're powerless against a half-step sovereign. The gap is too big! However, it was said that when neo martial cultivators transplanted their great Dao and entered the new Dao, they could stabilize the new Dao? If that was the case, could the Lord Marquis take a step further? Reaching the seventh level of the Dao integration realm and standing shoulder to shoulder with a half-step sovereign? There aren't many of us, but we're all true origin Saints!"

Chapter 2396 Post-War (3)
This person also had unparalleled saber intent, and his battle strength was quite strong.When The Guardian monster plant of dingtian city had rebelled, he had also killed it on the spot. As for the Zhang family ... It was little Yuan's ancestral family.At this moment, directly saying that he wanted to join Silver Moon would seem too snobbish!However, when the other party said that he would use the origin Dao to stabilize the new Dao and push Li Hao forward, it did not sound snobbish at all. Instead, it was for the greater good. He was using the origin Dao to stabilize the new Dao! With Li Hao's help, he could fight a pseudo-Emperor!What a great atmosphere!As expected, if the other party had directly said that he wanted to join a new Dao force, the Silver Moon Martial Master would not have been happy. He would have thought that if the other party came at this time, why had he not come before?But now ... The Silver Moon martial masters also felt that his words were very reasonable!They were all true-blue Origin Saints!These people were transplanting the great Dao, stabilizing the great Dao universe, stabilizing the great Dao River ... Although there were few of them, they were indeed of great help. For a moment, no one felt that it was bad. They all felt that they could be considered.Of course, this required Li Hao's agreement.This was the art of speaking.The Saint of the Zhang family looked honest and simple ... But Qian Wuliang and the others took a few more glances at him after hearing his words. He was a man of character. Even Zhang an didn't say anything, but he took the initiative to speak first, which immediately won many people's favor.As expected of the descendant of an official. This person's ancestor was a governor of new martial arts, a half-step Emperor. He was also the governor of the homelands of people like the human King. If Li Hao was replaced as the human King, this person's ancestor would be in the same position as Zhao Shuguang.Li Hao didn't say anything. He just glanced at the many new martial Saints.That included Hong shanmu and the others.Although it was said that they were cultivating new DAOs, in reality, they were only comprehending new DAOs and hadn't officially changed DAOs yet. They weren't considered new Dao cultivators but origin cultivators.There were many new martial Saints.If they all changed their DAOs and integrated into the new DAOs, it would be helpful in stabilizing the new DAOs, just like the Saint of the Zhang family had said.He looked at the void, then at the fluctuations of the great Dao universe, and the remnant power left behind by the Heavenly Kings after their deaths ...Li Hao suddenly laughed,"good!" Then he would take this opportunity to turn all the neo martial artists who were willing to walk the new Dao ... Into new Dao cultivators! Shanqi and the others had been waiting all this time ... This was an opportunity that could not be missed! No one will stop them, no one will stop them ... Those three fellows are fighting to the death in the void Dao universe ... They won't be able to come out in the short term!"Zhang an frowned slightly and said,"we're not going to care about them now?" If those time stars were to be captured ..."This was a huge problem!Not even thinking of a way?Li Hao shook his head."I can't handle it. They're all half-emperors, and there are three of them!" The time star isn't that easy to capture, and with three people restricting it, the triangle is the most stable. If it was only Zheng Yu alone, I'm still worried that he wouldn't be able to win against li daoheng ... But these three currently don't have the power to fight one against two!"If it was two people, then it would be troublesome. A battle of life and death might be able to decide who to belong to.However, the three of them ... This was interesting.The three monks had no water to drink!It was the most stable structure for three people to win two against one. At this moment, Li Hao was worried that something would happen if one person was missing.Zhang an nodded slightly.After some thought, he said,"I have no objections if they want to change to a new path. Since you've agreed ... That's even better!" To be honest, I didn't expect that you would be able to solve all the troubles below the half-step sovereign realm so quickly! You're much more capable than me. If everyone is willing ... We'll follow your arrangements. "He paused for a moment before continuing,""You've far exceeded my expectations to reach this stage! However, I still have a question ... And I want to ask one more thing. ""Senior, please speak!"Zhang an looked at him and said after a long time,""If ... I'm saying if, if everyone can't advance to venerable sovereign, and Li daoheng and Zheng Yu are willing to join forces with you to kill the venerable sovereign of Hong Yue ... Would you be willing to do so?"Li Hao gave him a deep look but didn't say anything.Zhang an continued,"for now, this venerable sovereign is the biggest threat. Moreover, he's from the Crimson Moon universe!" It would be very, very difficult for one side to kill him! And they're worried that the other two sides will take advantage of them ... If the three sides join forces to kill the venerable sovereigns first, eliminate the strongest one, and then decide the winner ... Perhaps they'll be willing to do it!"As soon as he said that, all the experts fell silent.Zhang an's suggestion was not bad.If there was really such an opportunity, the three parties would kill the venerable sovereigns first and then fight to the death. In this way, not only would they have a greater chance of success, but they could also eliminate a huge scourge.Venerable sovereigns were too powerful!Even li daoheng's plans had been repeatedly foiled by Li Hao. Did he still have the confidence to kill a venerable sovereign?Li Hao laughed."We'll see. I'll only have such an idea when I reach the seventh level of Dao integration ... Otherwise, any half-Emperor can kill me now. If I cooperate with them, wouldn't I be sending myself into a Tiger's Den?"Zhang an's suggestion was not wrong.But ... It was impossible now.Li Hao was the weakest now, but he had grasped the truth Dao universe, which was what Zheng Yu and Li daoheng wanted to seize.This time, if time star escaped, those two wouldn't let Li Hao go easily.Because only Li Hao had a chance of drawing out the star again.They had no idea how this star came about. Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  Moreover, each attempt was more difficult than the last. Now, even if li daoheng made a Galaxy or a sword of time ... Li Hao had played with them before. He wasn't interested in the stars of time and wouldn't appear.

The other party had even seen the body of three lifetimes, and there was nothing more novel. Once they hid and did not come out, who could catch that star?Li Hao didn't say anything else. He glanced at the sky and smiled.""All right, now is the time. If you want to change your great Dao, hurry up. If you wait any longer, these guys might find trouble with me after the battle!"The heaven and earth currently couldn't completely accommodate a half-step sovereign. Previously, it was only because the great Dao universe had too much contact with the heaven and earth. Now, as the spiritual universe was retracted, the truth Dao universe would also be sealed. Next, it would probably be very difficult for a half-step sovereign to come out.Of course, Red Moon sovereign did not care!If he wanted to come out, he might come out right away ... He might even wish that he could break the seal. However, the other two would probably not give him the chance to come out. At least, li daoheng would not.All of this had nothing to do with Li Hao.He wanted to quickly complete the transformation of these people and seal off the true path universe.It was indeed beneficial for him to have a group of Saints change paths.Li Hao didn't waste any more time. He immediately started to help everyone change their path.……In the void Dao universe.The three experts couldn't care less about Li Hao at the moment. They chased after the star, and the time star in front of them seemed to be frightened and kept fleeing. Each time it fled, it would travel an infinite distance.If the three of them weren't half-step sovereigns, it would've been difficult for them to catch up.At this moment, Zheng Yu sighed,'I knew that Li Hao did this on purpose ... But I still fell for his trick. This star is not easy to catch!' Red Moon sovereign, why didn't you eliminate Li Hao earlier to avoid a problem ... Li daoheng and I might not have been able to catch up to this star. If we lose him now, the three of us will gain nothing and we'll all be helping Li Hao!"Behind them, Red Moon sovereign's doppelganger was following the two of them with his hands behind his back. He was not in a hurry and seemed to be taking his time to look around and familiarize himself with the universe.In the sky, lightning gathered.However, the power of the Crimson Moon in his clone was not too strong. Although the lightning was strong, he could still withstand it.Upon hearing Zheng Yu's words, he replied indifferently,""I've been thinking about it, why? If Li Hao wants to kill someone, you should be the ones panicking! I can't control this great Dao universe. At least, if my true body doesn't come out now, it has nothing to do with me ... Why should I help you eliminate your opponents?""Venerable sovereign, you're afraid that you can't win against the one from the Li Dynasty, right?" Zheng Yu chuckled.They were both avatars, but one had just been formed, while the other had been formed 100000 years ago, and was even holding a Crimson saber ... There was a high probability that this avatar would not be able to defeat the other.  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ   Red Moon sovereign was not annoyed and remained calm."Zheng Yu, you're still not good enough to goad me into action! Also, li daoheng's threat is far greater than my clone's ... Right now, you and I should join hands and get rid of him. That's the right way!"This was the void Dao universe after all. Li daoheng was stronger and more familiar with this place. He was right, that person was the biggest threat here.It would be more appropriate for him and Zheng Yu to join forces to suppress li daoheng.Zheng Yu chuckled and said,'after dealing with him, the venerable sovereign should be able to break out of the seal by force! It's not like venerable sovereigns can't break it by force, they just have to pay a price ... It's just that the venerable sovereigns are still afraid now, but if li daoheng is really killed, will they still be afraid?"Red Moon Emperor also smiled and did not say anything.The three experts broke through the void continuously.The universe of the great path seemed to be boundless.There was no end to it!If they were in the Silvermoon world, the three half-emperors would have reached the world barrier by now. However, in the Dao universe, even they couldn't see the end of the world.If this continued, even a pseudo-Emperor might get lost here.In front of him, the man with the sword on his back frowned slightly.In front of him was a River of Stars. Like Li Hao, it turned into a River of Stars and chased after the star.The man with the sword turned around and looked at the two people who had been following him. He said coldly,""This star is the center of the Dao. At this moment, something is missing to attract it, so it can't stop! It's futile to continue chasing ... The key is still Li Hao. He might have a chance of luring out this star again ..."It was too difficult to chase him like this!Zheng Yu laughed and said,"brother li, do you think Li Hao will help you draw out this star again?" Maybe ... It will stop at the end of the universe. After all, the universe of the great path is just a new universe. How can it really be boundless?"The sword-bearing man turned his head to look at him and suddenly sneered,""Zheng Yu, you don't seem to be worried about Li Hao's strength. In fact, you're even calmer than Hong Yue and I! It seems like you still have some tricks up your sleeve ..."Zheng Yu shook his head."Brother Li, you worry too much. I just feel that there's nothing to worry about. If we can win, then we win. If we really lose ... We'll just treat it as the venerable sovereign's tribulation. The heavenly Tribulation is a tribulation, and the human tribulation is also a tribulation! If he can't pass the heavenly Tribulation, then he'll have to pass the mortal tribulation ... Perhaps, there's a chance to prove his Dao as a venerable sovereign!"Human tribulation!The sword-carrying man glanced at him and didn't say anything else. This was not a fallacy. The venerable sovereign's Heavenly Tribulation was also to train one's heart. The same was true for the human tribulation. If one had the ability to break the human tribulation, even if there was another Heavenly Tribulation, he would not be afraid of the heavenly Tribulation!The three of them did not seem to be enemies as they chatted with each other in the vast universe.He was too lonely!One was trapped in Hurricane city, one lived on the moon, and one was sealed in the world barrier ... For 100000 years, they were awake, but they did not communicate with each other. They just sat and watched the changes in the world.

2398 Chapter 400
Today, they finally had a rare opportunity. The three of them were in the same area. It didn't matter if they were enemies or if their grudges had yet to be settled. At this moment, the stars were not visible. They could talk and resolve the loneliness of a hundred thousand years.……The three of them chatted and chased after the stars. They were very pleased.At the same time, in the Silver Moon land.Great DAOs of origins emerged and dominated the world. At the same time, there were also great DAOs that were cut off by Li Hao!That was the Heavenly King's Dao!The Heavenly Kings were not completely dead, but Li Hao would not be polite.It was better to die completely! Some of the power of the origin leaked out and brought a lot of energy to the heaven and earth, replenishing the energy of these neo martial cultivators who had changed their paths.This time, the change of Lane was different from the previous one.In the past, he had to reforge his physical body and start all over again.This time, Li Hao didn't help them reforge their bodies. Saints were very powerful. This time, Li Hao directly penetrated their great Dao through the universe and condensed the stars they needed.There was only one!He only had one Dao Meridian!If he wanted other Dao meridians, he could get them himself. It wasn't too difficult for a Saint to form his own Dao meridians. It wasn't just to save time, but also because reforging the body consumed too much energy and time.However, these people would have some disadvantages compared to those who had Reforged their physical bodies.The great Dao had a lower compatibility with the new Dao universe. If one wanted to completely integrate, they would need time to Polish it. This was the first reason.Second, because he only had one Dao Meridian, he had to condense the other Dao meridians on his own. He couldn't be like Wang Ye and the others, who followed the prescribed order and instantly rushed to a higher level. He had to fill up all the Dao meridians before he could improve bit by bit.They had to do all of this by themselves.All Li Hao did was connect them to the new Dao universe.This time, there were many saints being converted. It was not just one or two. Li Fuhai, the ninth Division commander, general Huai, the old turtle, Diamond Wood, the Zhang clan Saint, the two Saint elders of martial Union, and Hong Mu were all being converted.The other Saint under Zhang an was still mysterious and had not been converted.Li Hao glanced at it but didn't care.What other Saint?Zhang an himself!Zhang an, who cultivated the origin Dao!Zhang an, who he saw so far, was actually cultivating a new Dao. These neo martial artists liked to make a few clones at any time, and he had long been used to it.As the Saints changed their DAOs, the undying and Paragon cultivators also began to change their DAOs. Some monster plants also joined in.The new Dao ... Was already unstoppable!Anyone with a discerning eye could see that the new Dao was far superior to the origins Dao, at least in this world. Li Hao's strength had soared, and even Zhang an felt that ... The potential of this new Dao universe might even surpass the origins great Dao!Why did time stars appear in the new Dao and why time was born in the new Dao ... Even Li Hao could not understand it, but everyone felt that the new Dao universe had great potential!This was also the reason why the neo martial artists who were not in a hurry to change lanes before were now anxious.If he didn't seize the opportunity ... Would Li Hao still agree to let a new martial artist enter the new Dao if his strength continued to increase?……Li Hao only helped them change their path and didn't care about anything else.He silently walked to the side and sat down cross-legged, silently comprehending, cultivating, and experiencing everything that had happened today. no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  In the spiritual world, the sword tree had been in a deep sleep before, but it had awakened today. It was in a bit of pain. Li daoheng's sword had cut off many of its roots, causing it some pain.Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't care about Jian Shu.However, an illusionary figure appeared and continuously reversed time. In the void, a sword intent and a whip intent were gradually condensed. These were li daoheng and Zheng Yu 's. These two had passed through the spiritual universe before!Not only that, the two of them had even fought here before.In addition, there were also the thousands of illusionary sword intents. Although they were illusionary and not very real, they could be used as a reference for Li Hao. It was equivalent to the Dao intents of three half-emperors being gathered by Li Hao!This was also a treasure they had left for Li Hao after passing through the spiritual universe!It was more than that!There was still one place Li Hao hadn't gone to. That was the saber intent of the blood Emperor, which had cut Ying Hongyue and broken eight meridians with one strike!This time, Blood Blade really attacked.These were Li Hao's greatest gains from this trip, but they were nothing in the eyes of outsiders.There was also the God of beginner martial, who had also left behind some will when he had slashed with his knife.Although it seemed to be a pure path of the physical body, it was also a kind of morality left behind by top existences. For Li Hao, they were all good things and treasures. In terms of level, he was much inferior to them.The things left behind by these people could all be used as the target of his comprehension.And such an opportunity was not something that others could enjoy.Gradually, a sword, a long whip, and an illusionary sword appeared in his spiritual universe. As the power of time continued to flow, they became clearer and clearer!Li Hao's eyes lit up!This was where he had gained the most this time. He knew himself and his enemies, and he had comprehended the Dao of these few experts. Even if he couldn't absorb anything, he could still learn some details about these people.In the void, the shadow of the sword tree appeared, but it no longer screamed. As Li Hao continued to channel the power of time, his entire spiritual universe became more stable, and the injuries of the sword tree recovered a little.

2399 Chapter 400
 At this moment, looking at the sword essences in the air, he was also a little shocked.One came from li daoheng, one came from Li Hao's future self, one came from Li Hao himself, and there was also a faint trace of longevity sword intent ...It could be said that the DAOs of the most powerful swordsmen in the world were all here!"I'm just short of human king's sword Dao ..."It mumbled, and Li Hao suddenly had an idea."Yes, the human Queen is also a swordsman!"The sword tree transformed into a human and nodded.""The human Queen's swordsmanship isn't that powerful. She became a venerable sovereign because of the human Queen ... But because of this, the human Queen has also picked up the strong points of many schools. Venerable sword has also given her many pointers ... It's easier and more direct to comprehend the human Queen's sword intent!""Will her sword intent remain in her sword?" Li Hao suddenly asked."There will be some more or less,"Li Hao nodded. He might have to borrow Empress Dowager Shui Yun's sword to take a look!He then thought of the Li Dynasty King's Overlord gauntlet and said,""That celestial ruler's glove ... Is it celestial ruler's or Supreme Emperor tie 's?""It's almost the same ..."Sword tree said,"the one left in Silver Moon is ... A replica?" It's hard to say ... Maybe it's the God of beginner level martial arts you mentioned ... If that person is really the clone of the son of the Western Emperor ... It might be his, or as you said before, the God of beginner level martial arts who was killed ..."Li Hao's heart moved again, why did he kill an early-stage martial artist?He had almost forgotten about this."I don't know." Jian Shu shook his head."If it's as you and Zhang an have guessed, this person will not interfere with anything unless he has no other choice. Unless that beginner stage martial artist wants to interfere with the resurrection of the cat!" As for the specifics, only he knows. "Li Hao nodded and didn't ask further.However, the sword tree reminded him that perhaps he should gather more of the sword intent of the renwang King. He knew what the core of the renwang king's sword intent was. It was like a murmuring water, like a stream.It was somewhat in line with the flow of the power of the long river ... If he could comprehend some of it, he might be able to comprehend some sword intent that was not contained in the longevity sword intent.Picking up the strong points of a Hundred Schools of Thought was also something that a junior Martial Master should do.He wasn't arrogant enough to think that he could be stronger than these venerable sovereigns. Their sword intents, including li daoheng 's, were of great benefit to Li Hao!"Li Hao ... My connection with the void Dao universe has been cut off ..."The sword tree spoke again,'then next, even if the spiritual universe becomes stronger, it will not be able to Enter the Void Dao universe ...'"I have already grasped the coordinates of the void Dao universe!"Li Hao wasn't in a hurry. He smiled and said, "It's good that it's disconnected. Otherwise, if li daoheng finds out now and charges into my spiritual universe, I won't be able to resist him! At least I've completed my plan and drawn both of them into the spiritual universe ..."If Zheng Yu could enter through this place, Li Hao's plan would be considered complete.It was not considered a loss!Li Hao continued,"the spiritual universe is created by copying the void Dao universe ... And the void Dao universe is controlled by that guy. I was worried that he would leave behind some flaws!" Li daoheng can't be underestimated ... I feel that even at the last moment, he should still use the spiritual universe as the main force and mainly devour the power of the void Dao universe ..."Jian Shu was a little surprised. Would this work?The universe that the three of us forged is far inferior to the true Dao universe!At this moment, Li Hao said,"let's not talk about this for now. Senior, you three should focus on cultivation. The stronger you are, the more powerful your spiritual universe will be. It will be able to accommodate more sword intents!" You were born from the sword, the stronger the sword intent, the stronger you were ... It was actually the best cooperation! This time, the sword intent is overflowing, and there are all kinds of sword intents ... This is also an opportunity for the three seniors!"The sword tree did not say anything after hearing this. It instantly disappeared from its original spot and merged into the spiritual world, beginning its own cultivation. They weren't as intelligent as Li Hao. Now that they saw Li Hao scheming against both venerable sovereigns and half-step sovereigns, they felt that Li Hao had done a good job and didn't need to worry about him at all.At this moment, the sword tree also began to lie down in peace. It felt that it was better to have a backer. Even if this backer ... Was slightly weaker than the venerable sword, this feeling of lying down was still a rare enjoyment.……At this moment, Li Hao no longer cared about others or other matters, not even the fight for the void Dao universe.He focused his mind and began to comprehend the various sword will Dao will in his spiritual universe. In the outside world, he also began to gather the will of the bloody blade, the fist will of the God of beginner martial, and the sword that he borrowed from Empress Dowager shuiyun.……Li Dynasty.The God of beginner martial was a little melancholic. At this moment, the world was quiet.He, on the other hand, was no longer quiet.He had a feeling that he had broken something this time ... He might not be able to have peace in the future!Cultivation of the Dao and the heart ... To him, it was the same. no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  It was too troublesome to owe a favor.If he really didn't care, then it wouldn't matter, but if he did care ... Then it would be troublesome!Back then, he owed the blood Emperor a favor. In the end, he had spent 100000 years guarding it. Even now, he still had not repaid the favor.And now, Li Hao was doing this again.He regretted it. Perhaps he shouldn't have used the blood saber. However, without the blood saber and the eight meridians, the World War was about to break out. This cat might really be unable to be resurrected. He wouldn't be able to return the favor to the blood Emperor!To him, this was simply a form of torture!"The human King is still the best ..."In the hall, the God of beginner martial muttered. At this moment, he missed the human King.The human King was domineering and brutal ... But he didn't like to lie. If you owed him a favor, he would ask you to return it tomorrow. You had no choice. If you owed him a favor, he would just let you fight a venerable sovereign, kill a venerable sovereign, and the matter would be over.However, people like the blood Emperor and Li Hao were not good people!He would ask you to do something that would take up a lot of time and energy, something that would cost you a lifetime!"I miss neo martial arts ..."The God of beginner martial mumbled in a complicated tone. He didn't like to be with these guys who had too many thoughts in their minds. It was so annoying!He then looked at the blood saber that he had moved over not far away. He mumbled,"when will I be resurrected?"If he didn't revive soon ... Once Li Hao reached the peak of the half-step sovereign realm, a battle between half-step sovereigns and even venerable sovereigns would definitely break out in the world!If I really break the Silver Moon, Where can I find another place for you to resurrect? even if I find it, do you think I'll have to wait another hundred thousand years?"AI!"He sighed. It was a rare moment of melancholy.
