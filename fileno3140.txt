Li Hao didn't care.With so many venerable sovereigns present, if a rank one venerable sovereign were to turn the tables ... Then these so-called venerable sovereigns could be given up and be of no use. This was no longer the Silver Moon Martial Master Li Hao knew.At this moment, he was calculating everything."But there's a problem now ... We've killed the local world Lord. It's fine if the venerable sovereigns passing by are not familiar with us, but if they are ... It'll be difficult to disguise themselves!" If one of us is exposed, it'll be easy to expose all of us ... This is a very troublesome problem. We don't have enough power to attack the dragon world directly. We can only choose to take it step by step and surround the center from the outside ..." He looked at Kong Ji. Do you have any thoughts?Kong Ji laughed,"if you want to use a realm to nurture a realm and kill these beasts of primordial chaos ... Then you must master one!.""What?""Memory!""Or rather, you have to use time reversal on every powerful person to spy on them. This way, it'll be easier to disguise!" Kong Ji continued.Li Hao shook his head."That's too troublesome. I'll be struck to death by lightning."However, he had some thoughts in his mind.Turning back time was very troublesome.He thought for a moment and suddenly said,"I have a method that can peek into the past ... It's not time reversal. It can only be used as a shadow tracking. However, the tracking is not comprehensive!""I don't have to go against the current time and time again. I just have to let those who are willing to impersonate me try ..."He presented the river of Dao and said,""The river of the great Dao has the power to reverse time. The key is not in the river, but in the fact that Time and Stars are within it ... Now, all venerable emperors have a River of the great Dao when they vindicate their Dao. Even if it's a branch, it's still a River of the great Dao!""If I were to place the time star into the Dao of reality and illusion again, into the Silver Moon world, I, the Silver Moon Emperor, could borrow the power of time to cultivate the past and future ..."He thought for a moment and shook his head."There are too many disadvantages. I don't need to cultivate the past and the future. I can open another river of time outside the river of Dao. If I can step into the river and guide the aura of the person I need to track, I can go back to my memories. Although it's not real time, I can still peek into the past!"Kong Ji understood and said slowly,""You're saying that you're going to put the time star back into the Silvermoon universe and build a river of time, or rather, a River of memories. You're going to follow this River and peek into people's past?"Li Hao nodded."Then ... If the time star is placed here, what are you going to do?"Li Hao was actually going to put the time star into the river.What about him?Li Hao laughed,"it's just temporarily placed here. There's no hurry!" "Besides, this star was here all along. Also, I have an idea ..."At this moment, Li Hao was somewhat excited, as if he had thought of something.""What do you say if I use the river of time to connect the infinite worlds?" "What?""It's to use the power of time to overcome the restrictions of bombarding. It's no longer a universe that can only cover One World. Instead, it's to connect all the worlds through the 10000 DAOs of time! In this case, there is a huge benefit ... Communication!"Li Hao was even more excited. However, if I use time as the foundation of the river and every cultivator of the Silver Moon clan is connected to the river without any restrictions on what Dao, world, or universe ... I can use time to rule over all DAOs and establish the most powerful communication system!""But now, time isn't powerful enough. It's possible that top-tier experts can still detect it ..." Li Hao frowned.The chaos was too big, making communication too difficult.It wasn't just communication. There was also transportation.If he could build a real river of time that could pass through the myriad worlds and connect the Dao of the myriad worlds to the river, not only could it be used for communication, but it could also serve as a spatial teleportation system ... Of course, the premise was that the river had to contain the Dao of space.In that case, the myriad worlds would be one.Chaos as one!At this moment, Li Hao was shocked by his own idea. Would it work?It seemed possible!This was because time was based on the myriad DAOs. Therefore, any realm could be connected.Li Hao was a little excited."Of course, I can't connect to other worlds now. It's too dangerous, but I can connect to my false world and use it as a connection point. This way, although I don't have a Dao universe, I can communicate with these scattered worlds and teleport ... Unfortunately, I don't have the space Dao!"He felt a little regretful."Daoqi is not here. If I had known earlier, I would have brought daoqi along and let daoqi take charge of this river of time. We could have completely teleported ... By then, we could teleport and communicate at the same time. This would be perfect!""You ... You mean you want to use the Time and Stars as the core of a system for teleportation, communication, and connection? then ... Then what about you?""Me?""What do you mean?" Li Hao smiled."What I mean is that you're turning Time and Stars into a weapon instead of your own Dao world. It's like you're making it public ... Do you want to make your Dao public?" Kong Ji was anxious."No!""Can't I ... Condense my own time star?"Li Hao shook his head."What?"  Best novel online free at üá≥‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüáª‚Äãüá™‚Äãüá±‚Äãüáß‚ÄãüáÆ‚Äãüá≥‚Äã Li Hao explained again,"it's just an idea. If it really works, this time star can be made public as a system. I can cultivate a time system that I've built!"

Chapter 3141 The River Of Time
"Why?" Kong Ji was confused.Why?Why did it have to be so complicated?You can totally build the time and star of today. You've already built it successfully. Why ... Are you crazy again?Li Hao continued,"don't get me wrong. I don't have any ideas. I just don't know much about the structure of Time and Stars today. I have some ideas. In the future, I might take them apart and take a look. Then, I'll build the system myself from scratch, from the foundation ...""But ..."Kong Ji was anxious,"what if you can't restore it after you open it?" What if it can't be imitated? Then what do we do?"Li Hao laughed."Then we won't travel through time. Does that mean that we can't cultivate if we don't travel through time?""I still don't understand!"Kong Ji shook his head."I'm also a cultivator. I know that building a system that completely belongs to one's own is a great success. However, you have the best foundation now. Even if this star came from someone else, according to my understanding, that person ... Is dead!"Zhan Tiandi was dead!"He's dead, and the time and STAR technique has not been completed. It's only the foundation, and you're also perfecting it. Why dismantle it?Li Hao, isn't this overcorrection?"Brother Kong Ji!" Li Hao spoke again."I'm not tearing it down for the sake of doing so," he said solemnly."It's just that ... I want to understand the real time and not the time given by others. If I don't dare to tear it down, I'll never truly understand time in this life!""Of course, not now. Also ... Why are you more anxious than me?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùKong Ji was speechless. If it was a normal Dao, of course, he wouldn't care. However, this was time.He couldn't help but say,"because this is time, the strongest Dao of the myriad worlds, the strongest Dao of all DAOs!" This is a truly heaven-defying Dao, a Dao that can allow you to easily reach the ninth rank, a Dao that can allow you to unify the primordial chaos. As long as you keep walking down this path ... There will be no obstacles. This is simply ... An incredible Dao!"If it was just an ordinary great Dao, he wouldn't even say a word."The more it is like this, the more we need to disassemble and study it!"Li Hao shook his head,'the more I can't bear to, the more I fall into desire! "This is actually the greatest desire. Even you, who are empty and can give up inheriting the rank 8 macro world, are reluctant to part with this Dao. One can imagine how great the temptation is!"At this moment, he was more and more aware of the magic power of this Dao. When Kong Ji heard this, even if it wasn't his Dao, he still found it unbelievable. He couldn't bear to part with it. It shouldn't be ... This planet had already become a sacred and inviolable existence in everyone's eyes. It was too terrifying!No matter what, it was only a Dao. A Dao was meant to be studied, so why couldn't it be torn apart?At that moment, the surrounding venerable sovereigns also heard it.They were all silent.At this moment, second cat, who was in the river, also heard it. It stuck out its huge head and looked at Li Hao without saying a word.You want to open it?Second cat was a little complicated, confused, and unable to understand.Even second cat couldn't accept it.As for second cat, he didn't care about anything.At this moment, it was somewhat unable to accept this. Because it knew the origin of this star, it did not want to ...Li Hao saw second cat stick out his head and smiled.""Senior cat two, the star is dead. It's just a combination of Dao. If it can be disassembled and restored, that would be best. If not ... Let the past be the past. Senior cat two can also walk out of it completely. What's wrong with that?"Second cat looked at him for a long time before saying,""I'm just curious, don't you ... Feel reluctant at all? What if the dismantling fails?""Then we fail! In the future, give me time and opportunity. I'll try and reassemble them one by one. If I can't do it once, I'll try ten thousand times, a hundred thousand times, a hundred million times ... Since Zhan Tiandi can succeed in reassembling them, I don't believe he can succeed in one try. Then ... Why can't I succeed in reassembling them?"Li Hao said softly,'I don't think I'm more talented than Zhan Tiandi. I'm not that arrogant! However, Zhan Tiandi gave me a Foundation, a demonstration, an answer, and a path ... In other words, the process of solving the problem, the train of thought, and even the final answer have been given to me. If I still can't solve it, then I ... Actually don't deserve to inherit this star!"This was equivalent to giving you a general idea. It was equivalent to the mathematics teacher telling you the process of solving the problem and the correct answer, but you still couldn't solve it ... What was the point of keeping such an idiot?Second cat was in a daze. After a long time, it sank to the bottom of the river. It needed to calm down.After all, Li Hao only said that. He didn't say that he was going to demolish it right now.It was because he was not prepared.Even if he wanted to tear it apart, he would have to wait until he had perfected his own orthodoxy before he could tear it apart.As for Li Hao, he looked around with mixed feelings. Shi Guang was too scary. These outsiders were all trying to persuade him, but they were all reluctant to do so. They were all in disbelief. This was a group of people who were the most confident and believed in themselves the most. Even they did not believe that he could rebuild Shi Guang!

At this moment, he suddenly wanted to meet the blood Emperor of new martial arts. This person was said to be Zhan's reincarnation. However, this person had finally lived as himself and did not seem to be the next Zhan.How did this person control himself and not be affected by the battle?

Chapter 3142 The River Of Time
In addition, the neo martial human King should have also restrained himself. It was said that when the neo martial human king rose in the early stages, all the energy was provided by Zhan. In the later stages, the human King also abandoned the influence of Zhan.He didn't say any more about this. These were all matters of the future. At this moment, he said, "Let's not talk about this. What I'm thinking now is to draw out some small realm DAOs from time stars, find the corresponding DAOs, connect the small realms, and create the embryonic form of the river of time ... This way, even if we are separated, we can be comparable to the great Dao universe, or even more useful than the great Dao universe!""It's called the bed universe, and it will even cover the heavens and the earth. The energy of time will only flow in this long river, and it can avoid being discovered to the greatest extent ..."As he spoke, he became excited.This was what he liked the most."Everyone, we might be playing a very interesting game next!""A dove occupying The Magpie's Nest!""Of course, it's the same for these Beasts of Chaos. What we have to do now is to kill one and pretend to be the other. We have to pretend to be their Dao, their world, their memories ... How we do it under the eyes of a group of Level Seven and level eight beasts ... It's up to everyone's ability!""This matter is very exciting!"  Best novel online free at üá≥‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüáª‚Äãüá™‚Äãüá±‚Äãüáß‚ÄãüáÆ‚Äãüá≥‚Äã Was it exciting to impersonate a Chaos Beast under the eyes of a top-notch expert?Of course, it was exciting!‚Äã The venerable sovereigns who hadn't left were all shocked.This ... Will it work?"Furthermore, I will give everyone a chance ... To try out the charm of time. I will create a river of time outside of the two rivers of the Silver Moon. Of course, I am currently lacking in energy, so I can only use my great Dao River to temporarily replace it ... Everyone, you can fuse with your Dao and enter it to comprehend the simplest time and reverse time!""It's not going back to the past in the true sense. That requires extreme proficiency. It's just going back to the memories of the other party, and it's best to bring along some of the other party's consciousness and spirituality. That way, it'll be more accurate!"At this moment, a loud explosion reverberated in the distance.The rat let out a miserable shriek as it was crushed by a bright moon and smashed into pieces by a pair of giant fists!The two kings had suppressed each other and even destroyed each other.These two half-step sovereigns were slightly weaker than li daoheng and Zheng Yu, but the difference wasn't that great. In fact, both of them had the ability of battle gods.At this moment, Li Hao raised his head, and in an instant, the entire world was filled with endless power of faith!It gathered toward the moon and the giant golden fist!Li Hao was stunned, so simple ..."He was so F * cking happy! The humans here were so easily satisfied.After killing the giant rat, these humans had become believers so easily. The power of faith was instantly born, sweeping through the entire world. At this ... At this moment, some malicious thoughts even emerged in his mind.As expected, the human race still needed to be tortured. The more bitter it was, the easier it was to be fooled and create faith ...Of course, that would be too foolish!Faith, true faith. Back then, Silver Moon Li Hao had said that it was not to fool the people, but to have them believe in you after they had gained wisdom. That was true faith!Spiritual and belief, for example, the human King of neo martial arts. Neo martial arts had been intelligent for a thousand years, but they still believed in the human King and the Supreme. This was true belief. It was foolish and had too many drawbacks. It could only be done once, not forever. It was also too easy to destroy!It was still very difficult for the Dali King and Queen to walk the true path of faith. Right now, it was only because everyone had suffered too much. Now that they believed in them, if they wanted to reach the level of the human King and the others, even if everyone had gained wisdom and still trusted you, believed in you, and treated you as a spiritual sustenance, as a leader, then it would be considered a great success in the path of faith!This was the so-called path of the human Emperor!The path of faith and the path of the human Sovereign were actually similar. The path of the human Sovereign should be the final form of completion.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶A moment later, the two half-emperors returned with great excitement.At this moment, their auras were turbulent, and the power of faith gathered. They had gained countless faith in an instant, but it seemed a little superficial.As for Li Hao, he glanced at the two of them and casually said,""If you don't want to be killed by the backlash like yueshen did, you know better than me how to do it ... To reach the level of the Supreme neo martial, even if the whole world knows what he's doing, they will still believe in him ... This is true success! The Dao of an Autarch is worth learning from!""And the coordination between a Supreme martial artist and a human King ... Is also worth learning! In fact, the Supreme martial artist had walked the divine path, and the human King was considered the king path. Since ancient times, it had been difficult for the monarchical power and the divine power to co-exist! Neo martial arts are the most harmonious ones I've ever seen. The gods don't think they are gods, but the people are willing to admit that they are gods! The king doesn't regard himself as the king, but the people regard him as the king...It's not that they call themselves gods or Kings, but that the people have given them!"At this moment, there were also several powerhouses from the new martial era present. When they heard this, they were slightly stunned.Godly power, monarch power ...In fact, neo martial didn't seem to care much about these things, but after Li Hao said that, they thought about it and realized that ... It seemed to be true.In their eyes, the Supreme martial artist was a kind of belief, and the human King was a kind of belief!The Supreme martial artist was omnipotent and had calculated every conceivable possibility.The human King was invincible in every battle, and his attacks were ever-victorious!One was a God who walked the world, and the other was an Overlord who dominated the world. The two were so harmonious that they seemed to be indispensable.

Chapter 3143 The River Of Time
Even the Queen was lost in thought.After a long time, he nodded."I understand. But ... I'm more curious. If the Dali King and I walk the path of a Supreme and a human King, then what path will the Duke of Silvermoon take?"The path master was given to Qian Wuliang and Hong Yitang, and the world Master was given to Black Panther. Now, in the battle of the heavens and earth, she and the king of Dali were asked to be the God and King of the people ...What are you, Li Hao?At this moment, Li Hao was also stunned. What am I? what path do I take ...After a long time, Li Hao thought for a while and said,"it's a good question. I don't know what path I'm going to take. I don't know who I'm going to aim at either ... Perhaps, I just want to become a chivalrous hero!" A Wanderer of the martial world ..."He laughed and said,"chaos is my martial world. Everywhere I go is martial world!" Traveling the world, crossing the world with a sword, sweeping away injustice, hiding merit and fame! If I'm willing to help, then I'll help ... To be a selfish but passionate Jianghu swordsman ... Not bound by the secular world, not burdened by fame and fortune ... Having no demands is my greatest desire, I ... Have a big heart!"Her heart was very, very big!No matter how strong an expert is, there will still be some restrictions. However, I want to not be restricted. This kind of no-desire is the true greatest desire.This was a dream!Dreams might not be realized, but they had to be.I'm not the king of men, I'm not a Supreme Being, and I'm not a warrior. I'm still the same Li Hao who hopes to become the fantasized hero of the martial world, to build my martial world, to walk my martial world!He was free and unrestrained!It was easy to say, but it was the hardest to do.At this moment, the group of Silver Moon martial masters returned one after another. When they heard this, they were all somewhat shaken. The martial artists and silver Moon martial masters were somewhat dazed. This was also their dream.However, the reality was ... Now, with the chaos and the weak strength, the so-called road of Jianghu swordsmen was not feasible. They could not go on it, so they could only follow the plan and walk on the road of venerable sovereigns step by step.Who could be free and unrestrained?Who could follow their hearts?Without invincible strength, how could one be so free!At this moment, Yuan Shuo, who had not yet proven his Dao as a venerable sovereign, looked at his disciple in a daze. In fact, when we walked out of the Silver Moon and found out that the world was so big and there were so many strong people, our so-called dream of the pugilistic world had already been shattered.‚Äã And his own disciple was still fantasizing about taking a trip to the pugilistic world!Could he really succeed?To regard the chaos as the pugilistic world, what an arrogant tone! There were countless realms, countless experts, Level Seven, level eight, and even the invincible level nine venerable sovereign. A level five venerable sovereign was here talking nonsense."I want to go to my chaotic pugilistic world!"Li Hao suddenly smiled."Alright, it's just a dream. I just thought of a very good idea. It's a very interesting cultivation method. It's a special method that can pry into people's privacy and one's own!""It can bury some people's dark history and engrave it in the depths of their memories, the depths of time ... In fact, it's a shared memory brain!"Li Hao described the river of memories and chuckled.""This is a long river of memories that gathers everyone's memories ... What's the point of using the other party's aura to recover their memories? other than prying into people's privacy, it's also a way to perfect one's Dao! In the depths of my memory, I can go and observe the Dao ... It can be considered a form of resource sharing ..."Hearing this, Yuan Shuo frowned slightly,""Is it really good to pry into people's privacy like this?"Li Hao smiled."It depends on how you use it. If you use it well, it's a good path. If you don't use it well ... You'll naturally suffer a backlash!""Right now, I only have some ideas. I haven't really created it yet. Moreover, this long river has to be equipped with the functions of communication, teleportation, and covering all realms. In the end, it has to simplify the complex and combine all the functions into a complete long river of time!"The more Li Hao spoke, the more excited he became. Of course, I'm saying that it's not true chaos for my current little realm!""Using the realm as a branch of the Dao, the long river flows, and the power of ten thousand DAOs flows, completing a great cycle! The myriad worlds are self-sufficient ..."The more he spoke, the more shocked everyone was.If he really succeeded, that would be terrifying.This so-called river of time was connected to thousands of worlds. It could teleport, ferry people, cultivate the Dao, backtrack, reverse time, flow into the future, pry into life and death, master thousands of DAOs ...This ... Was an incredible feeling!Could he really succeed?The Tier 5 Li Hao had actually come up with such an idea today. And now, it was just a simulation, using his own little world as a simulation. If one day, he could really use it in the chaos, then ... It would be too unbelievable and too terrifying.All the worlds, even the entire chaos, would prostrate under his feet!Li Hao, on the other hand, was even more excited."I can't do this alone. Is there anyone willing to walk the river of memories with me, peek into the rat's past, understand its Dao, and pretend to be a Chaos Beast to guard this world?"Everyone looked at each other, and finally, someone muttered,""Thunderbolt kick is suitable. It's a little sleazy and very wretched. Northern fist works too ... But the Dao of Northern fist is a little different ... I might not be able to comprehend it. Thunderbolt kick is more suitable!"  BEst novel online free at ’ºO ã…õ ü…Æ…®’º  "Little he, do you want to get beaten up?"Northern fist looked at Southern Fist. Only Southern Fist would say such words.Li Hao laughed. He glanced at the crowd and said,""This rat monster is good at hiding, escaping, and ambushing ... Thunderbolt kick and Northern fist Shishu are not suitable for it."

Chapter 3144 The River Of Time
He looked around. Now that there were so many venerable sovereigns, he had more choices, which was a good thing. He looked at one person and said,""This place is also a gateway. Director Zhao, you do it!"What did that mean?Director Zhao glanced at Li Hao and was speechless. So, in your eyes, I'm the most like a mouse?He was really speechless!Li Hao laughed."This place is very important. It's a passage into the tianfang region. There might be many people coming and going here, even level eight venerable sovereigns like Hong Yue, Yun Xiao, Guang Ming, and Chi Yang. I'm worried that the others will be exposed. Only people like director Zhao, who can live in seclusion in Silver Moon for hundreds of years and make people feel at ease, can meet my requirements!"Was that a compliment?Director Zhao was helpless!It was really ... Awkward.Li Hao laughed again."Moreover, the river of time is only an idea. It needs to be perfected. I'll only be at ease if an experienced and prudent senior like director Zhao is the first to try it out!"Using a realm to nurture a realm, using the Mirage to cover the origin world, using Emperor Silver Moon to impersonate Emperor chaos ...All of this was a huge matter. What Li Hao said was true. This place definitely needed an experienced and prudent person to guard it. It definitely couldn't be a rash expert like the southern Fist. Otherwise, it would be too easy to be exposed!At this moment, Li Hao had a complete plan.'I'm going to ... Sweep the Dragon field!'To create a net made up of hundreds of realms and capture the Dragon field ... It was an extremely crazy, bold, and suicidal idea!  BEst novel online free at ’ºO ã…õ ü…Æ…®’º  Of course, if the Dragon Lord left with Dragon World to attack new martial, Li Hao would be happy.Then the success rate of the plan would be extremely high!Of course, if he didn't leave, he could slowly grind it down.He was different from the human King. The human King would only think when things came to a head. Li Hao, on the other hand, had always liked to set a plan's goal first and then perfect it according to the final goal. At this moment, even Li Hao himself laughed. "Moreover, although we have many venerable sovereigns, we don't have many. My most basic plan might be to sweep across hundreds of realms, and we have too few venerable sovereigns! "I hope I can reach rank six during this process and give birth to more venerable sovereigns. And if some people can't wait any longer, they can ... Walk the Dao of chaos! Don't be afraid, if you walk the Dao of a small realm, don't you want to live without the great Dao universe?"His voice was bright and clear, reverberating through the Silver Moon."If there's no Dao universe, then I'll open it myself! If he couldn't open it, then he would open a Dao domain! I even support a portion of venerable sovereigns to leave the Silver Moon. Of course, they can borrow the power of the Silver Moon first ... They can pay it back when they have the money!""The Silver Moon great Dao isn't everyone's ultimate goal ... We have to leave some opportunities for the younger generation. When the time is right, you can think that you can walk out of the chaos on your own when it is independent! We were the first batch of Silver Moon pioneers. If we don't dare to do it, do you expect our descendants to transcend? We ... Have to be bolder. The seniors such as venerable sword and Lizhu have come out on their own. I hope that I, Silvermoon, can compete with neo martial!"Li Hao's voice was loud. At this moment, he was encouraging some people to come out after vindication.Before Dao vindication, it was much easier to walk the Dao universe.However, after corroborating the Dao and becoming venerable sovereigns, the realm Lord and Dao Lord would restrict them. If the time was right, what was the harm in walking out?At this moment, all the Silver Moon martial masters were tempted.No one made a sound.Today, they didn't have a strong foundation and understanding of the great Dao, so it wasn't the time for them to walk out. But Li Hao's words had left a seed in their hearts."We ... In the future, we might be able to walk out of here.Li Hao continued,"in the future, the river of time may be the only thing that keeps us from the Silver Moon!" It's called a bed universe, but there are still many limitations. The area it covers is limited, while time ... Is boundless!"Li Hao's laughter spread."We, the people of the Silver Moon, will spread out and walk toward the entire chaos. We will maintain our connection through the river of time. In the future, the name of the Silver Moon will definitely resound throughout the chaos!"Was it a dream or a fantasy?Who knows!Perhaps, his dreams could come true."We, the Silvermoon people, don't have to gather together. Everyone is unique. As long as we can communicate and communicate, we can walk through the entire chaos!

Chapter 3145 Ever-Changing (1)
He had to create a long river passage that connected to the ethereal Plane.It could also recall memories.It could be said to be difficult, but it could also be said to be simple ... For the current Li Hao, it wasn't too difficult.In Li Hao's River of Dao, Time and Stars appeared, as well as small worlds. At the same time, the three spirits of the venerable sword appeared.The three of them were now staying in the river.The three of them had not vindicated their DAOs, but even though they were not venerable sovereigns, they seemed to have fused with Li Hao's River. They had not vindicated their DAOs in Li Hao's River, but they had temporarily placed their DAOs in the river, just like Zhang an.In this way, although he was not a venerable sovereign, his great Dao was extremely pure and was somewhat closely connected to the river.These three were more interesting ... When venerable the sword came, these three didn't show up and didn't mention that they wanted to go with him ... And venerable the sword didn't mention it either. It was unknown if he had forgotten about this, or he felt that there was no need to bring the three spirits along. After all, they were too weak.If he took her away and returned to new martial arts, it might be more dangerous.Li Hao didn't pay much attention to it. This time, he was going to use the power of his River of Dao to condense a real river of time, a River of Dao with stars and time as its core.Then, from time and star, this combination of all DAOs, he would find the Dao of the corresponding small world and connect it to his own Mirage.Of course, it was too difficult to do it all at once.At the moment, Li Hao was only preparing to cast a River and lead this Dao of the small world to connect and conceal it with the corresponding Dao of the mouse in the time and space.The time star was quickly suspended.At this time, second cat, who had just sunk to the bottom of the river, floated up. He looked at the stars and then at Li Hao. He said,"Do you want to split the DAOs out?"Li Hao nodded."We're not splitting them apart. We're just finding the corresponding great Dao and connecting them. It's like finding an interface for the DAOs in the time star to connect with the small realm."Second cat understood but didn't say anything.However, after taking a look at the stars, he suddenly said,""Can you find the corresponding great Dao?""It should be possible, provided that it exists in time and star. If it doesn't ... Then I can only find a similar Dao ... The rat monster's Dao isn't too special. The Dao that chaos beasts cultivate is within the great Dao of chaos. Those who have studied the great Dao of chaos should be able to comprehend it."It was not a special Dao. For example, Hu Qingfeng's Dao was very special, and it might not even exist in Time and Stars.It was just some basic Dao. Li Hao felt that it was not impossible for it to not exist in time and space.The difficult part was drawing out the Dao bit by bit, which was a little troublesome, because Li Hao had yet to fully understand the time star technique.Originally, this matter wasn't considered too difficult, and he could just find it himself.But at this moment, as if he had thought of something, Li Hao suddenly stretched out his hand. In an instant, a person appeared. It was not director Zhao, but Yuan Shuo.Yuan Shuo was surprised."What's wrong?" Li Hao touched his chin, looked at the stars of time in front of him, and then at his teacher. He said,""It's nothing. It's just that Time and Stars are densely covered with thousands of DAOs. I want to find the corresponding Dao, but it's a little troublesome ... Because I need to keep the stars from collapsing, I thought back to the time when teacher could explore the great Dao universe with his spiritual sense. He was also the first cultivator I, Silvermoon, could enter the great Dao universe ... Teacher, help me go in and take a look. Find the corresponding rat Dao. I'll wait outside ... Time and Stars are actually a small great Dao universe!"Yuan Shuo was stunned. A Smurf Dao universe!At this moment, he seemed to have understood what the real Time and Stars were and understood their essence."I'll go in and look?""Right!"Li Hao nodded."Teacher, although this time star is small, its great Dao is more comprehensive than Silvermoon's great Dao universe. There are many DAOs, and the internal situation is extremely complicated. You might even get lost in time if you're not careful!""Teacher, be careful. Because you're weak, I can pull you out in time ... And because you're weak, I'm more at ease ..." Zhang xuan said.Yuan Shuo's face darkened!Who was he trying to provoke?'What a fellow.' He had been thinking in his heart that his disciple was always creating opportunities for him. Although he didn't say it, it was the truth.But ... Damn it, when he heard the latter part of the sentence, he felt extremely uncomfortable.Because you're weak and lost in time, I can still get you back.The others ... Were all too strong.Yuan Shuo's face darkened and he did not say a word.p Li Hao added, teacher, aren't you going to establish the five elements domain? This is also a type of Dao domain. Please take a good look and observe how heaven monarch Zhan established it. He is a peak figure who can split a Dao and reassemble it. Even I can't understand it. Teacher ... You should learn more. "  BEst novel online free at ’ºO ã…õ ü…Æ…®’º  Yuan Shuo was speechless.He didn't say anything more.There was nothing much to say. He looked at time star and sighed,""Then, I found the corresponding great Dao ... What do I need to do?""Simple ... If you find it, teacher, you can just shout for me!" Zhang xuan replied.√®‚Ä∞¬π!The more he spoke, the more helpless he felt.Yuan Shuo ignored him. He glanced at the stars of time, sensed the great Dao of the world of rats, and sensed the aura of some rats that Li Hao had caught. A moment later, he took a deep breath, as if his soul had left his body ... And a monster floated above his head.A monster that had fused the five Forces!It had the characteristics of a Tiger, a bear, a deer, a bird, and an ape. It had wings, a bird's beak, sharp tiger claws, a monkey's head, a deer's body, and a bear's muscular body.

Chapter 3146 Ever-Changing (1)_2
This was the God that Yuan Shuo had created!God-like power!Merging forces to form a kind of God and using the God to open a domain was considered the embryonic form of a heaven's will. However, it was still very weak at the moment.The fusion of five birds and five elements.It had to be said that Yuan Shuo had never wavered in the Dao of five birds and the Dao of five elements because of his disciple's fusion of 10000 DAOs. He had been studying the five elements. He had too much but was not good at it. In his opinion, it was useless.He was most skilled in the five elements, and he had a deep understanding of them. In fact, he had created this technique himself.Li Hao observed for a while and was a little surprised.Merging force with spirit, using spirit accumulation domain, using domain to open the path ...Even though his teacher was weak ... Fine, he was weak anyway, and he wasn't afraid of his teacher suffering a blow, his research on the five elements and the five birds had truly reached a peak.It's not a mistake to reach the peak!Li Hao watched in silence. As for Yuan Shuo, Li Hao didn't need to say anything. He was the first to enter the Silvermoon universe in the past, and he was the one who discovered it.Although Li Hao's divine text Dao had gained the upper hand in the end, it was already incredible that he could walk into the Silver Moon great Dao universe without anyone's guidance.At this moment, Yuan Shuo's physical body was left behind, but his aura had entered the time star.Second cat also looked at it curiously."If you let him in, will he be able to find it?"This planet was not ordinary.The 10,000 DAOs converged to form a huge net and turned into stars. Although the time star was small and only in its embryonic form, it was much more complicated than the Silvermoon universe.Li Hao said softly,"we might be able to find it if we look at it carefully. If we can find it ... It means that my teacher has a deeper understanding of the Dao. Next, if he creates his own Dao domain, it will be more perfect!" The number one of the thirty-six heroes of the past had managed to fuse the five powers without any energy ... I don't believe that he's inferior to anyone!"In that era, the Silver Moon had no energy. He relied on his body, Shi, and the nourishment of food to fuse the five Shi, becoming the only Martial Master who could fuse multiple Shi. Li Hao had always believed that his teacher would definitely go further.A domain was the embryonic form of a Dao domain, and Li Hao's domain had been learned from Yuan Shuo.A long time ago, before Li Hao had even experienced what a domain was, his teacher had already walked the path of a domain.At that time, Li Hao didn't even know what a domain was.Yuan Shuo ... Could only say that he was rather unlucky.Every time, he would be one step ahead of others, but the process was very complicated. He had to fuse the five Forces when he had no energy, so it was thousands of times more difficult than others.Yuan Shuo had walked the path of domain before Li Hao and the others had seen a Dao domain. One step ahead was a genius, ten steps ahead ... That would be a piece of trash.Therefore, while others could easily cross a level, Yuan Shuo had a hard time. Only seventh stage venerable sovereigns could comprehend Dao domains. Yuan Shuo was a weakling who was not even a Saint. It would be strange if he could go far if he tried to comprehend a domain at that time!Second cat nodded its huge head,"your teacher is quite talented ... It's just ..."After thinking for a while, he didn't know how to describe it. After a while, he said, "It's just that ... He always likes to overestimate his own abilities. ""What?"Li Hao looked at second cat with dissatisfaction. "It's not a derogatory term ... It means that he did something that doesn't match his current realm. For example, a domain. Under normal circumstances, it's too early to comprehend it when he's a middle venerable sovereign. But he seems to have been doing this for a long time ... The difference is too big!" A child swinging a sledgehammer ... He wants to construct a Dao domain first and then prove his Dao to be a venerable sovereign with a Dao domain ... He's overestimating his own ability!"Dao domain vindication was equivalent to a seventh stage venerable sovereign!You, Yuan Shuo, a Heavenly King expert, can be considered a half-step Emperor.You're just a half-step sovereign, and you want to use your Dao domain to vindicate your Dao as a venerable sovereign ... How would those peak level six itinerant cultivators be able to stand you?The five-element Dao domain was not a weak Island.The five elements were also a great cycle, a great cycle of Dao."You're not an ordinary venerable sovereign anymore. But ... You're only at the Heavenly King level. Aren't you overestimating yourself?"  BEst novel online free at ’ºO ã…õ ü…Æ…®’º  Li Hao frowned slightly."No one said that a Dao domain must be exclusive to a level Seven. I know it, the lonely void sect, the venerable sword sect, senior Li Zhu knows it ... Many people know it. Why can't my master do it?""But he's not even a venerable sovereign!""It will be sooner or later!"Er Mao was speechless."You're a rank five venerable sovereign. You're very knowledgeable and have even comprehended a rank nine Dao. Don't you know the situation?"You must trust your master without any bottom line ... It's your responsibility that your master hasn't become a venerable sovereign yet.With Yuan Shuo's talent and his relationship with Li Hao, he would have become a level three venerable sovereign long ago, let alone a level four venerable sovereign.Now, Silvermoon had dozens of venerable sovereigns, and Yuan Shuo had become the only one of his kind. The older generation was no longer a venerable sovereign.Er Mao didn't bother to say anything more. It was too lazy to meddle in other people's business. It just felt that Li Hao, as his disciple, was too indulgent of his master. He might really be stuck at the Heavenly King level and never be able to reach the venerable sovereign level.Zhang an, for example, was stuck at the level of a Heavenly King because of his orthodoxy. If Li Hao had not persuaded him, he might still be a Heavenly King.But now, Zhang an was also about to reach the third rank.

Chapter 3147 Ever-Changing (3)
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Inside the time star.A monster had fused with it and was wandering around. At this moment, the Time and Stars were completely different from what they looked from the outside.The network lines were densely packed and spread out in all directions.The power of 10000 DAOs converged to form a drop of liquid.The moment the liquid dripped down, it seemed to transform into time.Among the 10000 Dao, Yuan Shuo's goal was to find the rat Dao. It seemed simple ... But when the monster wandered around, the great Dao suddenly rippled and a special great Dao power erupted, almost killing the monster on the spot!The power of the great Dao filled the air.In fact, a time waterdrop was even born. Yuan Shuo watched as the waterdrop flowed. He was shocked. When the waterdrop landed in the center of the myriad DAOs, time suddenly seemed to flow backward. It was extremely mysterious!The entire inner space seemed to have been turned upside down. In an instant, the 10000 DAOs disappeared, and when they reappeared, they seemed to be in a completely different position from before.‚ÄúËâπ!‚Äù"What?" Yuan Shuo was stunned and muttered,"the myriad DAOs ... Is changing!"Oh my God!Be it the Dao web or the Dao universe, the position of the great Dao was generally fixed. Therefore, the fixed 10000 DAOs had a limited number of combinations. Even if there were unbelievably many, they were still limited!However ... If the 10000 DAOs could change their positions at any time, then ... Then they would truly be limitless.This was because there were countless combinations to begin with, and if they were to change at any time ... One would not be able to capture the change in that instant at all. Even Yuan Shuo was dumbfounded. How ... Was one to find it?Time was actually not fixed!"Time ... Is never fixed ... Because of changes, backtrack and downstream are born ..."He vaguely understood that different usage of time might give birth to different combinations of 10000 DAOs.Li Hao was wrong!He had underestimated the complexity of time. Time was not a fixed combination. If Li Hao had thought so, he would have been wrong. In the end, it was impossible to reshape time."Unbelievable!"Perhaps, only by going deep into it could one see the essence. Li Hao seemed to have never been there, or rather, those who controlled time could not see any changes at all."Fortunately, I came in and saw it ..."Yuan Shuo mumbled out. Otherwise, that stupid disciple of his might not have been able to tell that Shi Guang was going to be broken down based on his methods. The moment she was broken down, even if she were to be reassembled and mimicked back to her original appearance, she would never be able to recover.Just as he was thinking, the monster was shocked. The position of the great Dao around him changed. All of a sudden, a drop of water fell from the sky and landed on his body.At this moment, Yuan Shuo felt as if he had traveled through time and space, as if he had experienced millions of years!It was like the sea had changed into mulberry fields!The next moment, the water droplets disappeared and the monster appeared. Yuan Shuo panted crazily."This ... We're finished ..."Li Hao didn't seem to notice the abnormality and didn't pull him back.But just now, he felt time flow crazily. In an instant, he felt as if tens of thousands of years had passed ...Even if a Heavenly King-ranked powerhouse sealed himself, he would only be able to live for a hundred thousand years or so. Back then, the Silver Moon had been sealed for a hundred thousand years, and even Saints had almost died. A few more drops and he might die of old age here!The time liquid formed by the convergence of thousands of DAOs could really strip one of their life force.Yuan Shuo turned pale with fright. More importantly, Li Hao didn't seem to have noticed anything ... F * ck, is your control over time that bad?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the outside world.Li Hao looked at the time star and frowned slightly. For a moment, the time star seemed to have flickered. However, Li Hao could only see the dense net of Dao inside, and couldn't see anything else, unless he also explored it ... But he was very strong at the moment, and once his divine sense entered, it might cause the net to collapse."You should be fine, right?"  BEst novel online free at ’ºO ã…õ ü…Æ…®’º  He glanced at Yuan Shuo's body. It was fine and there were no changes.Then it should be fine.It was just that ... Logically speaking, the interior of a time star was filled with a Dao web. Although it was complicated, it shouldn't be too difficult to find a Dao. One could even take the opportunity to understand some of the profoundness of the time Dao domain. This was also the reason why he had allowed his teacher to enter ... To give him special treatment.But now, was the teacher lost?Why isn't he out yet?Did I overestimate my teacher?Didn't he understand the Dao net's combination?Second cat was also looking at the star. It suddenly thought of something and said,""The interior of a time star ... Could be considered as another space, or even another space-time. Would your teacher get lost?""It can't be?""Huh?" Li Hao was puzzled."Back then, my teacher was able to travel through the Silvermoon universe alone. At that time, it could be considered a different time and space."Second cat didn't say anything. Alright, as long as you're confident.Li Hao, on the other hand, frowned slightly. At this moment, he did not say anything but looked at the stars in front of him in silence.The Dao of time might seem complicated, but if one could grasp the method, it wasn't too difficult to combine ten thousand DAOs. The difficult part was the comprehension of the ten thousand DAOs ...He felt that his teacher might have some insight.He was in a Deep State of comprehension.In that case, he would just wait. There was no rush.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Just like that, Li Hao waited outside for three days.Inside the space-time star, the monster that Yuan Shuo had transformed into was already cursing.‚ÄúËâπ!‚ÄùTwo times!He had already been hit by the drop of water twice. Each time it hit him, he would lose tens of thousands of years of his lifespan. If this continued, he might die Here of old age if it hit him again.

Chapter 3148 Ever-Changing (1)_4
The corporeal body was still there, but the God would die!Once a God died, they would be in a vegetative state.The key problem was that he didn't even cultivate a great path star anymore. If he died here, it would be difficult for Li Hao to resurrect him, unless he also explored it and used time backtrack to resurrect himself ... But the prerequisite was that he could use time here!"You scamming kid!"Yuan Shuo cursed. 'I thought it was an opportunity. You brat, do you wish that your master is dead? are you only happy when I'm too weak and you've tricked me to death?'Of course, he knew that this was not what his disciple meant. At this moment, he could only curse in this way!It was too infuriating!Very quickly, he calmed down and looked at the ten thousand paths that were changing in order around him. This one change represented one of the abilities of time: backtrack, flow, and freeze. These were the three most basic abilities of time. He had been hit twice by the downstream water, which had deprived him of his lifespan. If he was hit by the backtrack water, would he be able to recover?Of course, he couldn't tell if it was flowing downstream or backtrack. If it happened again, he might die directly."No... I can't take such a risk. I have to find that rat tunnel and use it to contact the other rat tunnels outside. I'll let that bastard Li Hao know that I'm trapped here!"Otherwise, that guy would think that I've comprehended something and was deliberately staying here."The myriad DAOs are all changing ..."He once again locked onto the rat path. He was hidden in the dense Dao net and had some perception. However, before he could get close, the path would change position, making it difficult to capture the specific position of the other party.Simply looking for it like this was definitely not the way.Yuan Shuo fell into deep thought. If this went on, he would really die Here. He didn't die on the battlefield, nor on the path of proving himself, but he died on a chance that his disciple thought he had given him ... That was why he wanted to cry.Furthermore, if he couldn't get out, that stupid disciple of his might not know that the Dao net of time would constantly change. If he really tore apart the time star, there would be no way to restore it. From then on, he might lose the power of time.Time became the last echo of chaos!"There must be a pattern. No matter how monstrous Zhan Tiandi is, he can't be able to deduce time without any patterns ... If there are no patterns, then it's not a Dao that can be deduced by humans ..."Zhan Tiandi, on the other hand, was only at the sixth rank when he was alive.In fact, it wasn't to the point where it was completely unattainable.What I want to do is not to deduce his Dao, but to find some patterns from it and lock onto that rat Dao. I'll think about it after I get out.Yuan Shuo suppressed the throbbing in his heart and began to judge, comprehend, and comprehend ...  BEst novel online free at ’ºO ã…õ ü…Æ…®’º  The great DAOs flickered with light, but they were all very weak.But here, it was a terrifying combination."The Dao is very weak. Perhaps ... I can break it by force."However, if he broke a Dao, perhaps ... The stars of time would collapse. He might be able to survive, but without the stars of time as a reference, would that idiot Li Hao be able to form another time? The probability would be difficult!"There must be a pattern to the changes ... Is it the eight trigrams, the division of reality and illusion, the division of the universe, the Fusion of the Five Elements ... Or is it a sequence arrangement ..."He recalled what he had cultivated in his life. Under normal circumstances, many things could be arranged according to the methods he had just mentioned.He silently locked onto the great DAOs and sensed the changes within. The next moment, the 10000 DAOs changed again."It changes every 360 seconds...One small cycle?"The great DAOs changed again, and the Dao net was different from before. He locked onto some great DAOs again and identified their changes in location. What was the difference?How could the balance be maintained after the great Dao changed?Li Hao had shown everyone the construction of the Dao network many times before. If there was a mistake, even if it was just one wrong sequence, the Dao network could collapse. Why was the time star always so stable?"The premise of stability must have a core that remains unchanged ... It's impossible for all of them to change ..."Yuan Shuo kept peeking, and the combinations of great DAOs kept appearing in his mind.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the outside world.Li Hao frowned."It's been four days!"Teacher, four days is not a short time.No matter how complicated the combination of 10000 DAOs is, with your intelligence, you should be able to see some clues in four days. Why are you still not out?Although the dragon world's patrol would only arrive after half a year, it would be that long at most. If it was short, it might not take long.He still had many things to do.'I have to create a fake realm first, then merge into this little realm and cover it up. There are still many things to do ... It's just the beginning, but teacher has already delayed four days ...'If it was someone else, Li Hao would have cursed them.His teacher should know his limits, unless ... He was trapped?It can't be, right?Li Hao touched his chin and glanced at his teacher's body. His body was still the same, but his divine sense was gone!At this moment, he looked at the time star again. He had not been staring at the time star in the past, but in the past few days, when he stared at it, there seemed to be some fluctuations. It was a regular fluctuation, and every few minutes, it would beat once like a heart.It looked as if it was alive.However, this was only a star. Even if it was a combination of thousands of DAOs, even if it was the embryonic form of the great Dao universe, logically speaking, it should not have any life. That beating was definitely not the beating of a heart.

Chapter 3149 Ever-Changing (1)_5
Every few minutes, there would be a faint fluctuation ... Where did this fluctuation come from?In the past, he had wondered if the stars had given birth to consciousness.However, he did not think so today.Such a star would not have a consciousness. Back then, in the great path universe, this star had shown a curious attitude, as if it could chase and run, but in reality, it was just the Dao net's self-defense.With a slight thought, a wisp of his consciousness landed on the Time and Stars. At this moment, he didn't go too deep in, only silently sensing.  BEst novel online free at ’ºO ã…õ ü…Æ…®’º  A few minutes later, Li Hao raised his eyebrows.He did not say anything.After a few more minutes ...Li Hao's eyes flickered."There's a fluctuation every six minutes. Every fluctuation seems to be different. It's as if ... There's a slight difference in time ... Different DAOs are dominating this Dao net ..."Eh?Li Hao was startled. Could it be that every Dao in the Dao network was playing a major role?Strange!According to this order, 10 Dao paths an hour, 240 Dao paths a day. If he really wanted to gather 10000 Dao paths, he would need at least 40 days to complete a basic cycle.Thoughts kept appearing in his mind.Why would there be such a slight difference?He was silent for a while and sensed for a while. Once again, he found that his understanding of time was still too little. There was a gap between time and space. The composition of the great Dao of space, if it was according to the arrangement of the Dao chess ... Was actually very difficult, but he could still pry a little.As for Shi Guang, she had yet to figure it out.After a long time, Yuan Shuo still hadn't come out. Li Hao suddenly said,""Senior second cat, can I ask you something?"Second cat lazily looked up at Li Hao in a daze."This star ..." Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"previously, no one wanted to talk about it ... But today, I'd like to ask, was this star formed by Zhan Tiandi?"Second cat looked at him for a while and said,""Probably,""Probably?""I didn't see it with my own eyes ... But ... There was a time when he showed such a star ..."Li Hao nodded. "That's right. You're probably right. You're really strict.""Have you seen Zhan Tiandi use this star?""There is ... I was born from the use of this star ... I intercepted it!""Anything else?" Li Hao nodded."Other things?"It had been so many years. Although its memory was still clear, it was a little blurry.After a long while, he said,"when he was teaching, he didn't really use this because it wasn't perfect enough ... But I remember that he once said that time is not a Dao."Li Hao nodded."I know. It's not a single Dao, but the convergence of thousands of DAOs."It was definitely not just one!It doesn't exist. It directly presented the Dao of time, but a combination of great Dao. I know this.Seeing Li Hao nod, second cat seemed to understand, and said,""The teacher said that it's not the same path!""I know, the path of combination ..." Li Hao nodded. "That's not what I meant,"second cat replied."What does that mean?"Li Hao was stunned. Second cat thought for a moment and said, "That's what I meant ..."‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùWhat did that mean?Li Hao fell into deep thought. Frowning, he glanced at second cat. Not one Dao ... Not one Dao ... Could it be two Dao, three Dao ...After a while, Li Hao was stunned.Not just one ... Was it referring to Shi Guang? wasn't it just one Shi Guang?It was a little complicated!Then, he thought about the fluctuations from before. Every few minutes, there would be a slight difference. Could it be that ... The difference was like this? time itself was different?He was stunned for a while, and his expression changed slightly.Time itself was different ... Could it be that the Dao of time was not stable and fixed?No way!Could it be that this was a Dao that could change on its own?He furrowed his brows and pondered. He continued to sense the changes in time and Stars, but his teacher still had not returned.Suddenly ...Li Hao seemed to have understood something. His expression changed slightly as he said,""Senior second cat, is time the only thing?"Second cat was stunned and shook its head,"there might be one in the past but in the future ... Of course it's not the only one!" The future is filled with countless possibilities, because we are all in the present. The past and present are unique, but the future ... Is constantly changing!""The future is unpredictable!"Li Hao took a deep breath and suddenly changed his expression.""It doesn't seem ... Good. If ... The future is unpredictable, does it mean that time is not a kind of change?""Time is always changing, and it's not like time is stagnant."Second cat was confused. Wasn't this normal?"We're finished!"Li Hao's expression changed."Perhaps I've underestimated Shi Guang."Underestimating Shi Guang wasn't a problem at all. The problem was ... I had my teacher in there, and it had been almost five days now. He had yet to come out. Perhaps ... It wasn't that he wasn't coming out, but that he was trapped!The Dao network formed by time might be a variable password, a password that was as long as ten thousand numbers.I'm finished! A password formed by 10000 different words was already terrifying. If it kept changing ... Good Lord, no matter how you deduce it, can you deduce the answer?Only then did Li Hao notice something unusual.I was thinking!'Teacher, why aren't you out yet? are you ... Are you ... Are you so trapped that you're going to die?'He didn't dare to think too much!Li Hao quickly fluctuated his great Dao. This time, it was no longer the rat Dao, but his own five elements Dao. Five small worlds appeared around him, and five great DAOs appeared. The great Dao spread and entered time!
