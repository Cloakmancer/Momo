"Can you go deep into the Dao universe?" Zheng Yu frowned."We can not! I haven't found the entry point yet, but I can sense a thing or two. "Zheng Yu was silent.Everything seemed to have changed.After a long time, he said,"the other clone has also disappeared. It's highly likely that it was devoured by Ying Hongyue!" He might have reached the second or even third stage of Dao integration by now, and a Sage will appear in a few days ... Do you think he'll change a little?""It's hard to say,"Zheng Yu didn't say anything. All of this was actually just him talking to himself.He was talking to himself.Ying Hongyue ... You'd better not disappoint me!His clone had been trapped in Star Town City. He knew that he wouldn't be able to come back, but he had been prepared. If Li Hao and the others killed him, it would cause a huge commotion. If it was Ying Hongyue ... Even if he didn't have the ability to kill the saintly way clone, the clone would still help him.The sudden turn of events just now made him even more uneasy. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  At this moment, the power of a half-step sovereign seemed to be of little value.If I wasn't a half-step Emperor, I might still be able to leave ... But I'm a half-step Emperor, so only my clone can leave. This created an even greater sense of danger for me!He glanced at the powerhouses in the city who had not yet sensed anything and suddenly snorted,""Those guys at the late stage of neo martial arts, those who betray easily, sure enough ... They're all a bunch of trash! These people ... Are not considered as neo martial artists. They are just people who have received some benefits from the neo martial artists. Otherwise ... How could the neo martial Saints be killed so easily in batches!"He felt helpless, but there was nothing he could do.After being trapped for so many years, these people had been forced to advance in the later stages. They were not as good as those true neo martial sages and he could do nothing about it."If I walk out with my true body ... Do you think the seal will break?"New Dao Zheng Yu did not say a word.I don't know.Maybe, maybe not ... But do you dare to bet on this?……At this moment, Li Hao had completely disappeared from the Dao universe.There was only one sword in the entire universe of the great path, and it was the extremely huge Galaxy Sword!Woof! Woof! Woof!The dog's barking continued.Li Hao, where are you?Why ... Is there no movement?!"Woof woof" sounds rang out continuously, reverberating through the heavens and earth. It was getting more and more mournful. Even you disappeared?Just as the Black Panther was at a loss, a shadow suddenly appeared on the greatsword in the distance. Li Hao slowly walked out of the Galaxy and instantly turned into a human figure.The power of great DAOs gathered, and in the blink of an eye, Li Hao was formed.However, it seemed to be a little different from before.Li Hao smiled and turned around.""The foundation has been laid! I am the Dao, Heibao. If I can succeed this time, I will be rich! I'll open 100 Dao meridians for fun!"The Black Panther rolled its eyes, it was scared to death! Can't you be more reliable?It always made the dog worried.Li Hao's smile became even more brilliant. After this, who would really understand me?Perhaps, Heibao was the only one who could see all this.I ... Hid my real body!"If the Galaxy isn't destroyed, I won't necessarily die. Zheng Yu, li daoheng, let's have a good fight next!The void split open and a message was sent out.……After a while, Lin Hongyu's heart skipped a beat and she quickly said,""Prepare to pray! Everyone, take charge of all areas and listen to my orders! Four ancient cities, quickly go to Hurricane city and suppress star suppression city, in case the undying fighters in the city leave!"The four ancient cities soon received their orders.If it weren't for the fact that she was the Marquis's wife ... They could have ignored her. But since she was the Marquis's wife, the Saints didn't say anything and simply followed the orders.At this moment, the sky lit up again.Lin Hongyu's voice resounded through the heavens and the earth with a hint of sorrow."In order to pay tribute to the heroes who died in battle, the haoxing continent will pray for the blessings of the heroes who died in battle one day later! "If the stars are fine tomorrow, those who pray for their sincerity will have a great chance to obtain the blessing of the spirit of the hero and cross the border in a day, reaching the peak of the mountains, seas, sun, and moon! The bright star xiuzhe will remember the unfinished ambition of continuing the brave!"As soon as these words came out, heaven and earth shook.Everyone was willing to pray for blessings, but ... They could also obtain great benefits?Really?It seemed that it was not impossible. The star military governor's office did not seem to have deceived everyone!At that moment, Lin Hongyu sent a message to some people.It didn't matter if it was true or not ... Tomorrow, the sun and moon of the mountains and seas would be born.At this moment, she also looked up at the sky, feeling a little nervous. Could she succeed?[PS: this month is over. This year is over. Happy New Year to everyone!]

2241 Chapter 376
The universe of the great path.The river turned into a sword. Li Hao sat cross-legged on the river and said softly,""Wind, come!"……On the bright star continent.Lin Hongyu's face appeared between heaven and earth. Her face was filled with sorrow as she shouted,""All wind-type cultivators in the world, control the wind and sweep away the dust. Create a peaceful sky for my heroic spirit!"The wind rose!At this moment, everyone was very serious. A strong wind instantly erupted, whistling through the world."The other cultivators should pray for blessings silently. Praying requires a ritual and a process. There can't be any mistakes. Only if the prayer is successful and I die in battle can I have the hope to return to heaven and earth and fight the nine Heavens!"Lin Hongyu's voice continued to ring out. At this moment, there were powerful figures from all over the world.According to what Lin Hongyu said, there must be no mistakes.Only then would they have a chance to revive their Natal stars. Of course, this was only hope, and it wasn't certain that they would be able to revive them. Even so, the Silver Moon martial masters were still very excited.At this moment, there were powerhouses in every region keeping watch, keeping an eye on their own surveillance area to prevent anyone from causing trouble.In fact, even if some people caused trouble, it would not be a big problem.Unless there was a problem on a large scale.……Bright star sector.The stars on the Changhe sword flickered and burst out with brilliant light. Li Hao quickly caught them. The stars shifted, and the undeveloped stars fluctuated for a moment before Li Hao quickly returned to their positions.Originally, it was difficult to determine the star's attribute before the Dao Meridian was opened.At this moment, Li Hao could tell if it was a wind-elemental star from the slightest fluctuation.Countless wind element stars were moved to a certain area. Soon, wisps of wind element power of the great path fell down like water droplets."Drip Drop ..."Under the stars, the power of the great Dao of wind even turned into liquid, dripping and flowing slowly.Time slowly passed.Seeing that it was about time, Li Hao said again,""Water element!"With wind as the foundation and water as the source, he first mixed the power of the great Dao, the storm, and the foundation of the long river.……In the outside world, Lin Hongyu gave another order,""Water-elemental cultivators can use the water veins and orifices to cleanse the world ..."Countless Water-type cultivators moved out once more.Almost an hour had passed. Lin Hongyu's armor glowed.At this moment, the person beside him appeared in the sky and said,""Governor, there seems to be some changes in shuiyun in the South ..."As soon as he said that, everyone in the world was shocked."Bastard!" Lin Hongyu shouted. We're in front of the sky screen ... Forget it, open the sky screen and reflect the South. Let's see what's happening. I want to see who dares to create chaos during the memorial ceremony!" "Yes!" Very quickly, the sky screen rotated and a powerful cultivator from the South appeared. It was none other than Empress Dowager Shui Yun. Seeing her own appearance reflected in the sky screen, Empress Dowager Shui Yun felt a little awkward. She bowed slightly and said softly, "Don't be angry, Governor. It's all a misunderstanding. Just now, a water cloud cultivator used the water vein and instantly crossed from the thousand warrior realm to the mountain sea realm. He's still advancing ... The commotion was a Little Big, and it caused a misunderstanding!"With that, he held the sky screen and walked in the air. Soon, the sky screen was projected onto a group of soldiers.One of them had his aura explosively increase.Cultivators from all over the world watched with wide eyes as one aperture after another was ignited and opened. In the blink of an eye, a complete Dao Meridian appeared, followed by two, three, four ...It was unbelievable!At the same time, a voice came from the sky,""Reporting to the governor, there are wind-element cultivators in the North who have advanced into the mountain sea realm, and are still in the process of advancing. Should we stop them ...?"Lin Hongyu's voice resounded through the sky."This is a gift from a hero. What are you stopping?" Men, reward them with 10000 energy stones, 1000 drops of the spring of life, and 10 wisps of immortal energy. Help these sincere Warriors advance perfectly!""Yes!""The sky screen has returned. These are just trivial matters. I've already said that those who are sincere will definitely gain something. Even if they don't gain anything now, they will definitely be rewarded later! The mountains, seas, sun, and moon, in the snap of a finger!"At this moment, the world was silent.However, people's hearts were a little fiery.This ... Was there really an unexpected gain?In a single day, he had entered the mountains and seas, the sun and the moon. This was simply unbelievable.Whether it was true or not ... He didn't know.But ... What if it was true?How difficult was it to reach the mountain Sea Sun Moon realm by relying on one's own hard work?At this moment, the power of the Dao Meridian between heaven and earth became more and more intense. As long as one was sincere, there would be hope ...At the same time, experts from all over the world were secretly transferring some spring of life or immortal energy to some areas. Some people had improved, which immediately caused an uproar. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Seeing is believing!Someone had really advanced right beside him!Although it wasn't the mountains and seas, nor was it the sun and moon, some only had one or two more apertures opened.However, if even one of them appeared in a city, it would be enough to cause a stir!Soon, the entire haoxing continent was in a state of madness, excitement, and agitation!Who wouldn't be happy to pray for the brave and have an unexpected harvest?Even the cultivators who thought that it was just a perfunctory process sat down cross-legged and waited excitedly for the next round of events.……The haoxing continent had made such a huge commotion that the whole world was praying for blessings, so Hurricane city was naturally not ignorant of it.Zheng Yu kept looking outside, his eyes flickering.He didn't know what he was thinking.Beside him, a few top powerhouses in the city were also looking out. Someone frowned and said,""What does it mean to pray for the world?"

2242 Chapter 376
"Cultivating the human-King path?""Or are you preparing to resurrect those who died in battle?"“……”These people had sharp eyes.Soon, he saw something. Dao meridians from all over the world gathered. It was definitely not just a blessing. This was an orderly way of gathering Dao meridians. It was not simple!However, they still didn't understand the exact reason. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  He didn't know much about the new Dao either.However, the cultivation of the human-King path that they spoke of and the ability to resurrect those who had died in battle were all possible. For example, the resurrection of gods.Zheng Yu also sensed his surroundings. After a moment, he said slowly,""The path of the human-Emperor ... There are no signs of this at the moment, and it's not cultivated in this way. Resurrecting the dead ... This is possible! Yuan Shuo and the others died in battle, but they have many new Dao meridians and Natal stars. If we can stimulate the recovery of those dying stars, we can still revive them!"Was Li Hao really resurrecting these people?Was it a good or bad thing?Should he intervene?Saints couldn't eat...However within the city, there were still a few undyings.From the looks of it, there didn't seem to be much movement. He had also cultivated a new Dao and was also sensing the situation in the great Dao universe. Although his main body wasn't cultivating, his avatar had been.After sensing it ... The situation of the great Dao universe wasn't too clear. He could only vaguely feel that the stars were moving.Do I need to stop him?Undying, there were many silver moons.If he went out to cause trouble, he might not be able to come back."Let's wait and see!"Zheng Yu frowned and didn't say anything.It might not be a bad thing to resurrect Yuan Shuo and the others.Just like Lin Hongyu, the more fetters Li Hao had, the better. With more, Li Hao would have a weakness. After Yuan Shuo's death, Li Hao had no scruples, which led to him attacking ruthlessly several times. Hurricane city had lost a large number of experts.Even if Yuan Shuo and the others were resurrected, they would only be at the sun and moon level.What they were afraid of ... Was that it was not to resurrect them.……Di da!The sound of water dripping could be heard. Under the Changhe sword, a pool of water appeared. It was filled with the power of the great Dao.The power of the great Dao condensed into liquid.However, it was a little chaotic.Li Hao didn't say a word. He stirred his blood and Qi. The liquid gradually began to merge, from disorderly to orderly. With a unique great Dao order, the power of the great DAOs was fused together and turned into a chaotic water source again.He might fail ... But the path of cultivation was all about trying.Even if he failed, he was not afraid.Ten thousand Star Quake!For Li Hao, the tremor of the stars made him feel very uncomfortable. His body had merged with the Galaxy, and the tremor of the stars was also shaking his body. A 'Dao' character appeared on the forehead of a Phantom.The 'Dao' text once again covered the entire area, radiating to the heavens and earth. "Black Panther!"Li Hao called out softly. The Black Panther quickly ran over. Li Hao's tone was slightly heavy."If ... There are any problems, I need you to do one thing. Devour the gathered Dao power. It might stuff you to death ..."The Black Panther instantly turned golden and had a ferocious look on its face!I'm afraid of this?You should have said so earlier!I'm waiting to eat!He's waiting for me here. If you had said so earlier, I would have started eating.Li Hao chuckled."Not now. I mean, you can eat it when there's a problem!"This fellow was extremely enthusiastic when it came to food. He didn't need it now.Once there was turbulence in the Dao energy, or when one of the Dao energy was difficult to merge, this was the time for the Black Panther to play its role. It would eat the excess, unbalanced, or chaotic Dao energy.Perhaps there would be many, many more!"Black Panther, don't be careless. I want to maintain a balance. There are some Dao powers that will definitely exceed the limit, such as the five elements that are cultivated by many people. If there are hundreds of millions of people cultivating it, once there is a problem ... You won't be able to devour it all!"Woof! Woof! Woof!The Black Panther looked down on all living beings and squinted his dog eyes. Who are you looking down on?The power of a great Dao was a tonic.As long as there's something to eat, I'll bear the consequences if I can't finish it!Seeing it like this ... Li Hao didn't say anything more. This dog was very smart and knew what he meant. He wasn't being arrogant, but he was giving Li Hao confidence and proving that he could swallow it."Then ... I'm afraid there are many Water-type creatures!""Woof!"The Black Panther instantly transformed into a huge golden dog. In an instant, it opened its mouth wide, and a powerful devouring force swept out. A large amount of water-type Dao power turned into liquid and fused into its body.It specialized in water to begin with, and at this moment, it could be said to be complementing each other. It was very satisfied and ate very happily!At this moment, drops of lava-like fire-elemental Dao power condensed instantly.In the outside world, it was already the fire element.Li Hao suppressed the stars, drew their power, and rearranged some of the stars that were wrong. He was so busy that he couldn't even keep up with his work. Meanwhile, Black Panther had been waiting in silence.A moment later, Li Hao's voice came.""Absorb the fire element!""Roar!"The Black Panther's body expanded once again and began to devour the fire-type energy.However, the Black Panther felt a little uncomfortable with the fire and water. As the fire element absorbed more and more, it kept forming water droplets ... The Black Panther felt even more uncomfortable, as if ... It had overestimated itself.This was too much!Li Hao didn't say to stop. The power of great DAOs was hard to preserve or discard at will. Once discarded, it could easily flow back.At the same time, Li Hao was faced with another big problem!In the endless void, stars were still gathering.As if attracted by the power of the great path, countless stars swept over. They were stars that had not been discovered before, and their arrival would disturb the operation of the entire Xinghe and even destroy the Xinghe sword.

2243 Chapter 376
Li Hao had a headache.He had already expected this, but he hadn't expected that there would be so many stars. At this moment, at least a thousand stars were crashing toward him.He quickly created a clone and flew towards the countless stars.Boom! Boom! Boom!The stars rotated, and Li Hao's clone was knocked back. He managed to stop them and teleport them over, but as the stars entered the Galaxy system, the power of great DAOs that he had extracted earlier, such as the power of wind, water, and fire elements, suddenly burst out of the stars, throwing Li Hao into a panic. The small ditch below, which had already formed a weak river, suddenly became unstable. Li Hao was so scared that his face turned pale. Fortunately, the Black Panther instantly devoured all the newly born power of the great Dao.However, at this moment, Black Panther was also having a headache!If this continued ... He would be finished.He had only gathered the power of a few great DAOs!At this point, it was already a little full. It was frantically digesting the power of the great DAOs, and a thunderous roar came from its body. There had never been a moment like this when they were beginning to dislike the power of the great DAOs too much!Perhaps, it would be better if Li Hao found more people to enter.However, if there were too many people, it would be easy to be exposed.Sometimes, Li Hao didn't trust others too much, especially this time, when it involved the reorganization of the great Dao and the Galaxy.Everything that had happened so far had exceeded Li Hao's expectations.It was too smooth ... But that did not seem to be a good thing either. It was too fast for Lin Hongyu to stop the process, and it was the same for him. He even hoped that someone would cause trouble and stop the process."My head hurts!"Li Hao's clone appeared again, because more stars were gathering. At the same time, billions of stars flickered again. At this moment, the earth-elemental stars burst out, and a large amount of earth-elemental Dao power gathered!Li Hao had no choice but to clone himself again and start extracting the power of the earth element.Li Haos were busy running around.He had no choice but to think of a way to tear open the void and send a message out,""Slow down ..."……Heavenly Star City.Lin Hongyu received the message and felt a headache.Slower?One moment it was fast, the next moment it was slow. The command had already been given, and there were so many people, not just one or two. If they were slow, it would be easy to control if there were few people, but it would be difficult to control with many people!But since Li Hao had said so, she could only think quickly. Soon, the sky screen spread her voice in all directions again."I seem to sense the return of some heroic spirits ... Everyone's efforts and sincere blessings have made the heroic spirits feel everyone's kindness and enthusiasm ... Let's stop our cultivation and listen to the voices of the heroic spirits in silence ..." At this moment, Lin Hongyu quickly sent out a message to all parties. Soon, many people heard a faint voice. It was not clear, but it seemed like someone was talking.At this moment, some people were shocked, while others were pleasantly surprised.Lin Hongyu, on the other hand, waited for a while and said with some regret,""I think I heard them say something, but unfortunately ... It doesn't seem real. Maybe it's not enough for them to present it in front of people and continue to pray for blessings! Wind-elemental cultivator, please pray for blessings again. I think I heard the voice of a wind-elemental spirit ..."Around her, some people looked at her strangely. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  You're lying through your teeth!We didn't hear it!At this moment, everyone actually felt that something was not right. After much thought, they finally realized the importance of a name and status. Otherwise, Li Hao wouldn't be here.Lin Hongyu was controlling all the cultivators in the world on such a large scale and even changed all kinds of plans at the last minute ... Someone would have rebelled long ago!In fact, it was normal for them to be taken down by force, as Lin Hongyu might be plotting something.However, at this time, due to their status, they could not say much.Li Hao had not appeared, and Lin Hongyu was still the Marquis's wife. She also had the bright stars token, and there were no casualties. Even if she was really planning something ... Everyone could only accept it.Lin Hongyu heaved a sigh of relief, but she was getting more and more nervous.Don't change your plan again!At this moment, she was even more nervous than Li Hao. Li Hao had changed his plans and speed time and time again, sometimes fast and sometimes slow. Every time he grasped the right timing, it was very troublesome and complicated, and she had to make up all kinds of excuses.She also had to make the world believe her ... She was about to lose herself after telling so many lies.……In the bright star sector.Li Hao exhaled, laughed, and muttered,""You're quite capable ... It seems that Black Panther doesn't need to absorb too much. He just needs to keep increasing the Dao energy of the other elements ..."There was too much fire-type energy and too little wind-type energy, so the Black Panther could only devour a large amount of energy to maintain its balance. However, after the second round of cultivation for the wind-type, it had replenished quite a bit of wind-type energy, so the Black Panther didn't need to devour so much.It also gave the Black Panther some time to rest and digest.As for how Lin Hongyu would keep adjusting herself ... Li Hao laughed. She would think about it herself. She wanted to take risks and reap benefits at the same time ... She had to pay something. If she really couldn't take it anymore, she would think about it later.Not far away, Black Panther was panting heavily. The sound of his body exploding could be heard continuously. At this moment, he finally had some time to adjust.He continued to absorb the power of the great Dao and forcibly opened his own Dao Meridian.One after another.The Black Panther, who was originally at the fourth stage of the sun Moon tier, had become visibly stronger. It was already at the sixth stage of the sun Moon tier and was extremely fast. Its physical body could still withstand it. The physical body of a demon was strong to begin with.

2244 Chapter 376
As for Li Hao, he had also created a small river. This River began to flow, but ... Li Hao took a look and took a slight breath. This River was only about one-hundredth the length of the Xinghe sword ... So, he probably needed about 99 more rivers of this length to simply form a true Xinghe!"Black Panther ... Only completed one percent!"“……”"Aowu!"The Black Panther let out a Wolf's howl with a hint of despair. No way?Li Hao was also helpless."It's true. That's why you only absorbed about 1% of the excess energy. There's still 99% left. Can you ... Resist it?"...Woof woof!"The Black Panther shook its head frantically. It was arrogant and despotic before, but now it was hurriedly denying that it could do it. One percent was already enough to fill it to death, and now it had to absorb 99 times more. It would definitely explode!Li Hao had a headache, too. He thought for a while and looked at the countless stars. Perhaps ... He could fuse a part of his power of Dao into some stars again, but ... This way, some stars might be shattered.Of course, some people might improve.Both were possible.'Forget it, I'll give it a try. If I gather the strength of ten thousand people, I might be able to produce some experts.'As for whether they were on his side or his enemy, those who were willing to obediently cultivate at this moment ... No matter how hostile they were, they would not be completely enemies.……Originally, Lin Hongyu had only secretly sent people and paid a large amount of treasures to forcefully promote some people.Therefore, the small number of people was actually forged by himself.However, as the prayers continued, more information came from all over the place. Lin Hongyu was surprised that some people had suddenly improved in strength.Some people had improved by quite a lot, but it was extremely uncomfortable. Compared to those fake upgraded people, these real upgraded people were in so much pain that they were on the verge of death. However, the benefits were also great!As a result, even though it had lasted for several hours and some people were getting impatient, as more and more people improved, it once again aroused everyone's enthusiasm!It was fine to get the people to do things for a short period of time, but in the long run, no matter how many tricks Lin Hongyu had up her sleeve, she would still feel a little broken. If they were already like this, many of the people who had been waiting were already getting impatient.He had to eat, right?He had to work, right?Who would've thought that they would be waiting in the same spot?However, as more and more people advanced, Lin Hongyu did not care about anything else. She quickly controlled the book of wind and cloud and used the sky screen to scan the world. There were signs of people advancing in different places!Many, many times! This time, the enthusiasm was once again aroused.Only then was he able to continue praying.Three hours, five hours, seven hours ...He had been praying since dawn. At this moment, the sky was starting to turn dark. Lin Hongyu's face was slightly pale.On this day, she constantly commanded the people to listen to her commands and made up all kinds of reasons to make the people listen to her orders. She constantly injected all kinds of energy and shook all kinds of great DAOs ...However, from day to night, if this continued ... A large number of people would become impatient.To be able to last for a day ... Was already an incredible feat.Billions of people were not working, waiting for arrangements and orders. Such a popular sentiment was actually beyond imagination.At this moment, director Zhao rushed over. He didn't say anything, but just said,""Not good, the duration is too long! It's dark ... Should the blessing continue? "When it gets dark, many people don't eat for a day and a night. Even if they don't eat, their children and elders still need to eat and sleep. Even if they are cultivators, they can't change their habits ..."Once the sky turned dark, it would be easy to lose control!He did not expect that this blessing would last from dawn to dusk, which was more than 10 hours!All the places were in chaos.In some places, some people had already given up and stopped praying.Lin Hongyu's expression was serious.She didn't ask Li Hao how much longer it would take. She thought that she might be able to solve it herself. However, it had been more than ten hours since the sky turned dark, and Li Hao still hadn't finished ... This was troublesome!"Can you hold on a little longer?"She didn't know if she should ask director Zhao, herself, or Li Hao.At the end of the day, she was physically and mentally exhausted, and her face was pale.She was worried that once it was interrupted, something big would happen.Director Zhao was silent. This wasn't the Army. The Army was still okay, but ... This was the entire nation!There were too many people!If they couldn't suppress it by force, they could only make the people cooperate with them for a day. This was an extremely difficult thing to do in any era. It was already incredible that they could do it now!……At the same time.In the universe of the great path, the river had already spread out. Li Hao panted heavily. The Black Panther had long been lying on the ground, pretending to be dead. From time to time, it would explode, and bloody holes would appear on its body!As for his aura, it was extremely chaotic, but it was also extremely strong.In fact, he was already very close to the Dao integration stage.Li Hao's aura was also getting stronger.He was also very close to the daomerge level.The river was about one-third complete ... Yes, only one-third. At this speed, it would only take another day and night. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  However, Li Hao also felt that as time passed, the number of twinkling stars decreased. Previously, there were billions of stars in one flash, but now, the number of stars was rapidly decreasing.

 "Are the people getting impatient?"He also knew the situation. From the looks of it, after an entire day, everyone couldn't bear it anymore. Even if there were various temptations, they wouldn't work.But now, he had only completed a third of it.Li Hao gritted his teeth. The next moment, he tore open the void again and sent a message to Lin Hongyu."Rest for the night and continue tomorrow! Let the Army and those who are willing to continue continue to maintain this! "Let me tell everyone, if we continue, there will be greater rewards ... Tonight, I will make more people stronger ... At least two more days! All of you, do not rest. Maintain order!"After saying that, Li Hao thought for a moment and said,""I can't hold on much longer. It's a little difficult to keep the great Dao from collapsing tonight ... I'll forge a new Dao for you tonight, and you'll have to try to absorb the power of various great DAOs. You might fail ... Are you willing to give it a try?"A moment later, Li Hao received a reply.Lin Hongyu only replied with one word.Li Hao didn't say anything else. He quickly found Lin Hongyu's main star. He knew where she was.After finding Lin Hongyu's main star, Li Hao hesitated ... He had actually thought of Lin Hongyu as the second Black Panther. If it absorbed too much power, the Black Panther's body would be strong enough to withstand it.The other party ... Might not be the same.Taking a deep breath, Li Hao said nothing more. He lifted the star with one hand, and in the next moment, the character 'Dao' appeared and instantly merged with the star. Please click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  The huge star was dragged into the river by Li Hao. Lin Hongyu's body was trembling, and blood was spurting out of her mouth. The great Dao in her body seemed to be breaking.In an instant, many people's expressions changed.Lin Hongyu waved her hand and said in a low voice,""It's fine. It's just normal training. Let the Army continue. Tell those who are willing to continue to do so not to stop tonight ... Also, maintain order in various places. We will continue tomorrow! It'll last for at least two more days ..."Tian Jian could not help but ask,"three days?" Isn't that too long?""Three days!""At least three days!" Lin Hongyu said in a low voice. If possible, they would have to maintain the current scale even at night ... That way, perhaps two days would be enough, but this ... Was too difficult! So, everyone, hold on a little longer!"After saying that, he was silent for a moment before he continued,""If many people give up ... Inform the official organizations of the city and they will be punished! Cancel the allocation of energy stones, cancel the allocation of sacred rice, reduce the quota of the martial Academy ..." The moment these words came out, everyone's faces changed.Someone said in a deep voice,"if that's the case, won't there be complaints everywhere?" We are here to bring light to everyone ... Not to create pressure!"Lin Hongyu replied calmly,"we only need them to pay for two to three days 'time. How much have you and we sacrificed for the peace of the world?" "Our enemies are endless, and Lord Marquis doesn't care about anything in return, but now ... We need them. Are they not even willing to pay a little? I didn't force them or punish them. It's just that they don't want to persist ... So why not take away some of the benefits we gave them?""Whether it's the divine rice, the energy stones, or the martial arts Academy places...Weren't we the ones who gave them all of these? What did they pay? There's a price to pay, don't tell me...We have to raise countless parasites?"Lin Hongyu ignored him and quickly said,""Director Zhao, in my name, seal the bright star order and send out a message! Once more than half of the cultivators in the city gave up on maintaining the city, not only would all the benefits be canceled, but the local officials would also be punished accordingly! If the people were not punished, the officials would be punished! Also, they are not allowed to cause any riots...As for how to deal with them, it will depend on their abilities. It will also test the officials "ability to adapt to the situation!""Inspection Division, night patrols, quickly start to inspect the world ... Chen Zhongtian, if there is a local rebellion, quickly get the inspection Division to suppress it and suppress all unusual movements. Do not let the slightest bit of news leak out!"The experts beside him all had grave expressions as they quickly left.He didn't dare to say anything.Lin Hongyu looked like she was about to devour someone. Her aura was in chaos. No one knew what was happening, but ... It might be related to Li Hao.At that moment, Lin Hongyu called out to one of them,""Martial uncle Hong, you stay here for a while. The others, go do your own duties and do your own things!"Everyone left.Hong Yitang, who stayed behind, was a little confused. He looked at Lin Hongyu, who said,""The earth overturning sword contains all things! Senior uncle Hong didn't fight for anything and focused on promoting education. He was very worthy of respect! The divine words "sword" have the grace of Lord Marquis "divine words" Dao ..."Lord Marquis is currently dealing with some difficult problems. He might need to change the true meaning of martial uncle Hong's Dao of the sword and incorporate it into the Dao of chaos, devouring the power of ten thousand DAOs. Martial uncle Hong ... Are you willing to give it a try?"Hong Yitang's eyes flickered slightly. He looked at her and said softly,""The same as you?""Yes,"Hong Yitang thought for a while."Is it your idea? or Li Hao 's?""It's mine,""It's very dangerous!"Lin Hongyu explained. He's worried that martial uncle Hong's sword intent will no longer be pure, and he's also worried that something will happen. This is only an attempt, and it's not safe. Let me try first ... To put it bluntly, he can accept my death! But if something happens to martial uncle Hong, there won't be many people left with him from Silver Moon!"

2246 Chapter 376
"His closest friends are professor Yuan, commander Liu Long, Minister hou, Secretary Yu, senior Southern Fist, and senior uncle Hong!"She seemed to have understood Li Hao. She said softly,""He hasn't been too close to senior uncle Hong recently ... Because he's worried, worried ... That the last person he's close to will die! His performance to the outside world was that he had nothing to worry about and no one could threaten him! Now, he pushed me to the surface. Actually ... If someone really uses me to threaten him, he will only be smug ... Because using me to threaten him can't be done!""But if we use senior uncle Hong to threaten him ... I'm afraid it'll be difficult for him."Hong Yitang listened quietly and glanced at Lin Hongyu. This woman was too smart.It was true!He felt that this woman was also very scary. Qian Wuliang only saw people's hearts and emotions, but he didn't really understand people's hearts. However, this woman could really understand Li Hao.When Li Hao was weak, there were not many experts who took care of him.As for the Earthcover sword, he had fought for him time and time again, from the first time he entered heaven battling city, to the battle against the monsters in the Cang mountains, to the second time in heaven battling city, to the swords gate's full support for the construction of the demon hunt squads, to the promotion of education in the world ...The Battle of the North Sea, the battle of the sky Star sea ...In all the battles, all the risks, the earth overturning sword had always been there, never falling behind.Among the remaining Silver Moon martial masters, only the Earthcover sword had truly followed Li Hao all the way here. From the beginning until now, he had not retreated even once.Among the Seven Swords, only the earth overturning sword gave Li Hao the most pointers on the way of the sword.In fact, he was not inferior to Yuan Shuo.Yuan Shuo was Li Hao's teacher, and so was overpowered sword. However, ever since Yuan Shuo and the others died in battle, their relationship seemed to have reached a freezing point. Li Hao no longer met overpowered sword alone.However ... One of the five commanders of the demon-hunter guard Army was his daughter, Hong Qing!The others didn't notice anything.However, Lin Hongyu seemed to have seen all of this.Hong Yitang thought for a while and said,""I don't have a problem with that. However, that kid's character ... Is actually very stubborn! If you tell him that you asked me to do it, I'm afraid he'll be angry ... He's in the Dao universe now, right?""Yes."Hong Yitang thought for a while and said,"if he opens the bed-calling universe again, I'll send him a message." The earth-covered sword contains all things. You're right about this!" Besides, this might be an opportunity. He's making the decision for me. This guy ..."Lin Hongyu was overjoyed and quickly said,""It's opened!"Hong Yitang didn't say much, he quickly sent a message and seized the opportunity.……In the universe of the great path, Li Hao was stunned. The next moment, anger flickered in his eyes!Lin Hongyu! Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  He hated being arranged by others! Earth overturning sword, Hong Yitang ...Just as Lin Hongyu had said, there were too few people who had followed him all the way here. From heaven battling city to today, Hong Yitang had fought for him too many times, and absorbing the power of ten thousand DAOs was an extremely dangerous thing that had yet to be confirmed.The Black Panther did not mind. This fellow's cultivation was messy and he was a demon. Even if he failed, he would just cultivate the path of the physical body.But Hong Yitang was a pure swordsman.If a swordsman's Dao was messed up, it might be difficult to recover."Bastard!"Li Hao cursed and gritted his teeth!Moreover, he didn't want Hong Yitang to be too strong. If he was too strong ... He would have a bigger goal."Just like the others, everyone is at the 7th tier, and you are at the 7th tier. It's fine as long as you don't fall behind.He was so powerful that he could battle a Sage ... No one could battle a Sage. Only my master could walk out and battle a Sage, and finally die!Li Hao gritted his teeth. Lin Hongyu ... You B * stard, how dare you make decisions for me!Suppressing the anger in his heart, he once again tore open the universe and sent out a message,""I don't need uncle-master's help, I can do it myself ..."As soon as the message was sent out, Hong Yitang's message came in an instant,""There's no need to say anything more. I want to become stronger. You owe me a lot, and you'll pay me back today. The earth overturning sword has never been weaker than anyone!"Li Hao cursed in his heart. You were beaten by my teacher in the past, and you didn't dare to fight him. You're not a shameless person, and now you're using this trick on me!Hong Yitang's sword text was very special. It had the effect of Dao text and indeed had the ability to extract the power of ten thousand DAOs.In fact, he was much more suitable than Lin Hongyu.But ... To put it bluntly, Lin Hongyu's Dao had really collapsed ... It was her own choice. Li Hao didn't force her.As Lin Hongyu said, Li Hao could watch her die, but he didn't want to see Hong Yitang die. Taking a deep breath, Li Hao panted for a while and glanced at the turbulent River. After a long time, he gritted his teeth, tore open the void, and reached out his hand. He instantly fell into the universe of the great path.Hong Yitang looked around and didn't say anything. A star moved over quickly and instantly turned into a 'sword' character. After checking, he said,""Merge into this River and extract the power of 10000 DAOs to strengthen the river, right?"He saw through many things at a glance. Li Hao said gloomily,""Yes."Hong Yitang nodded and sighed,""You've grown up and learned how to do things in the dark! "In the past, when you were in trouble, the first person you thought of was me. You didn't even think about your teacher. You've become stronger, and your heart has changed!"Li Hao was a little embarrassed.There was no other reason but the truth.In the past, when he met with trouble, the first person he thought of was indeed Hong Yitang. In his eyes, Hong Yitang had always been stronger than his teacher ... Until the battle of borderless city, when his teacher died in battle with the Saints, he was very sad and in despair.

2247 Chapter 376
After that, he didn't look for Hong Yitang anymore. It wasn't because he was weak, but ... He didn't want Hong Yitang to be the one to stand up next time.In fact, it would be very difficult to see Li Hao like this again.Hong Yitang laughed."If there's a chance to become stronger, you'd rather give it to a dog, your wife, than me. It seems that a man who wants to have a family is different. He loves his wife and pet, but he doesn't love me anymore!"“……”"Uncle-master, I didn't mean it that way ..." Li Hao smiled bitterly."You are!""No!""Just because you say it's not, it's not?"Hong Yitang laughed. The sword way star instantly merged into the river. The turbulent power of ten thousand DAOs was instantly absorbed. He felt a little uncomfortable, but he endured the pain of the countless power of great DAOs surging in. He laughed and said,"In terms of talent, I might not be able to match up to your teacher ... But in terms of tenacity and other aspects, your teacher is inferior to me! A mere 10000 DAOs is a powerful tonic for me, yet I can't withstand such a small impact. Aren't you underestimating the strongest defense, the earth overturning sword?"Li Hao didn't say a word. As the sword path stars of the earth overturning sword merged with the river, the turbulent River instantly quieted down, and countless moans were absorbed by him.At this moment, he wasn't the only one. Lin Hongyu, Black Panther, and Li Hao were also extracting the power of great DAOs to stabilize the river of great DAOs.Hong Yitang ignored Li Hao and sat down cross-legged, his sword intent soaring!Li Hao sized him up. Suddenly, Hong Yitang said,""Stop looking. Just like how you don't like others to make decisions for you, I'm the same. We're both silver Moon martial masters, and you can't make decisions for me. I, Di Fu Jian, am a top-tier expert. Hou Xiaochen and the others can't compare to me. Huang Yu and the others have all lost to me!""And now ... They're at the seventh level, and I'm at the seventh level. And I've helped you even more. What right do you have to deprive me of the benefits that I should be given?"“……”Li Hao didn't say anything."Do you think that you're making it up to me by making my daughter stronger? He was merely at the sixth level of the sun Moon realm! Besides ... If my daughter really ends up on the same level as me, don't you think it'll be an insult to me?"“……”Li Hao was embarrassed, but he still didn't say anything. "In addition, I actually want to take Liu Long as my disciple. If I take him in, that dog Black Panther can only be considered as my Grand disciple. Even his dog is stronger than me. Do you think that's appropriate?"“……”Lying on the ground, Black Panther shot him a glance but did not say anything.At that time, there was really such a possibility.When Liu Long was still in swords gate, Hong Yitang did mention this matter. Liu Long was also thinking about it but he rejected it in the end. However, both of them had many similar ideas. If they continued for a while longer, perhaps ... He could really be considered as the Grand disciple of this man? Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ  Alright, it's good that you can't afford to offend him!Li Hao exhaled."I was wrong. But ... I don't want uncle-master to die in front of me again. I'm a Lone Star ...""If you really lose, do you think we really have a chance to survive?""There are!""Wrong, there's no such thing!"Hong Yitang snorted,'foolish, stupid! Sometimes he was smart, sometimes he was stupid! Alright, that's enough. Stabilize the river and fuse more water into it. If water isn't enough, then fuse with the river itself. Whether it's Primal Chaos water or natural water, there's no need to keep the balance. Just a bit more water will make it easier to fuse with, and water will be able to contain it. "Li Hao was stunned. He thought for a moment, then extracted some water power and added it in. He didn't say anything, nor did he question it. Even if the other party was no longer as strong as him, he was still willing to listen.The winding river seemed to have become smoother.On the other hand, earthbound sword closed his eyes and no longer looked at Li Hao. His body trembled continuously, and countless moans surrounded him. He sighed in his heart. This kid ... The stronger he is, the more timid he becomes.He was not afraid of the enemy, but he was afraid that more of his own people would die.He clearly cared, so why did he have to pretend to ignore everything?On his face, a faint smile appeared. The earth overturning sword ... Would once again become famous in the world!

Chapter 2248 The Galaxy Is Formed, And He Re-Enters The Dao Integration Stage (1)
With the addition of Hong Yitang, Changhe was indeed more stable.Perhaps Hong Yitang's strength was average, but his sword writing was special, and he had a unique vision. It had to be said that his addition was a great help to Li Hao.It seemed that it had been like this since a long time ago.At that time, his teacher had left by himself, and Li Hao had no one to rely on. In heaven battling city, he had met this seemingly cowardly Earthcover sword ...Since then, he had given Li Hao a lot of support and guidance.At this moment, the teacher had left again.As always!At this moment, Hong Yitang stood out again.He was not seen when they fought for credit.Hong Yitang was always present in times of crisis. Li Hao actually admired him, but ... Who could say for sure if he was good or bad?The river gradually stabilized.Above them, stars dotted the sky, creating a boundless beauty."Martial uncle ..."While Li Hao was stabilizing himself, he suddenly spoke. Hong Yitang tilted his head and looked at him with some doubt."Say, among these stars, do you think my teacher's stars are there?"Teacher ...Hong Yitang glanced at him. Li Hao's eyes were a little unfocused, as if he was looking for his teacher's star. At this moment, Hong Yitang sighed in his heart.Yuan Shuo!Did you see that?After he died in the battle against the sage, your disciple is not as strong as you think.He was very fragile!You've all left, not just you, but hou Xiaochen, Yu Luosha, Liu Long ...These people all died in battle. For Li Hao, it might be an unbearable price. Perhaps he has always regretted it and has been looking for you.I don't know!But at this moment, Hong Yitang was extremely calm.""Definitely. I can see that there are still many stars that haven't been lit up. There must be one that belonged to them, or even more! In fact, it's very simple to resurrect your master ...",m "It's very simple?"Li Hao was stunned."Of course it's simple!" Hong Yitang nodded. "When you're strong enough and have found all the stars, you don't have to do anything. As long as all the cultivators in the world of Silvermoon have successfully opened their meridians and lit up their own stars, you can pick out the stars that haven't been lit up. They must belong to those who haven't completely died."It was so simple!Li Hao opened his mouth wide and said after a long while,""Cut it out .... Everyone has opened their meridians, all the mountain and sea realm cultivators, ten billion mountain and sea realm cultivators .... Uncle-master, let's talk about something more practical!"This is not practical.It's better for me to control the world and the great Dao universe. It was not reliable at all!But then again ... That was true.All of them had opened their meridians, and the remaining ones that had not opened their meridians could also find their origins. The remaining ones, weren't they the martial masters who had died?It made sense!However, looking at the countless dim stars, Li Hao was speechless. Why was old Hong so unreliable now?With someone talking to them, Li Hao's mood improved. He said,""Uncle-master, only one-third of the river has been condensed. There's still a lot left. You probably won't be able to hold on much longer, right?""Definitely not,"Hong Yitang didn't say anything this time and said softly,""We need to take a step further! Lin Hongyu's and my stars are in the river now, so we're both going to reach the Dao integration stage at the very least! Heibao also needs to undergo the daomerge. Even three daomerge experts might not be enough. "Even three might not be able to devour all the chaotic great Dao power."You must have injected some power of great DAOs into some of the stars, right?" he asked."Yes.""Then let's continue!""Also," he continued,"take this opportunity to inject some power of the great Dao. Some of the people in Yuanping martial arts university have not recovered, right?" There were also the Saints like li Fuhai who hadn't Changed paths, right? Let's take advantage of this opportunity ... Let them recover, change their Dao, and inject the power of a great Dao. Although it will cause some chaos, it can be done in one stroke!""They have more than a hundred peak undyings and a few Saints ... They can withstand a lot of the power of the great Dao, and they can withstand it themselves. It's not forced, do you understand? It's easy to lose control if you force it in. They're peak undying Saints to begin with, so they won't lose control!"Li Hao's heart moved."Now?""Right!""Yes." Hong Yitang nodded."I know. You don't want anyone to know what you're doing ... It's okay. As long as someone outside is willing to guide them and help them change their way, you don't need to show yourself."Li Hao frowned. Who could guide them to change paths?It was too difficult to change the path of a Saint!When Zhang an was still around, he could do it, but now ... Who could?Of course, even a Paragon undying could do it. A few Saints would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens!"If it doesn't work, I'll revive the people from Yuanping martial arts university first. If it doesn't work ... Don't forget that many heaven-battling armies have been revived! You don't have to do it alone ...""If that's the case, it'll cause too much of a commotion!" Li Hao said softly."Do you think that there's little movement now?""Three days of blessing ... Do you really think everyone is an idiot?"He looked at Li Hao and said,"don't try to fool yourself. Although everyone thinks that you're doing something, it's enough that they don't know what you're doing!" If you resurrect some people, you might be able to make Zheng Yu and the others lower their guard and think that you're just trying to make them resurrect in another path!" Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ Li Hao's heart moved, and he nodded."What do you think of Lin Hongyu, Junior Master?"“……”Hong Yitang glanced at him and smiled.""She's your wife. You're asking me, how would I know? If I knew, there would be a problem!"

Chapter 2249 The Galaxy Is Formed, And He Re-Enters The Dao Integration Stage (2)
“……”Awkward!"I had no choice," Li Hao said helplessly."I actually don't know much about her."Hong Yitang thought for a moment and said,"I won't make any personal comments. From the overall situation, from the current situation, from the individual strength, from the support ability ... All of these are fine! He was a good candidate! Are you in love with anyone right now?"“……”"If not ... Actually, choosing her is not a bad choice.""Is that so?"Li Hao thought for a moment and then said, what if you don't have feelings for me?"It's nothing. For hundreds of years, arranged marriages have been common in the star dynasty. Free love is also very rare. You will have feelings as you spend time together."“……”Alright, so that's what you're thinking.It was a waste of time!He did not say anything more. He quickly tore open the void and sent a message to Lin Hongyu, asking her to make arrangements to resurrect the students of Yuanping martial arts university.……Seeing that Li Hao was looking for someone again and had the time to resurrect them, Lin Hongyu breathed a sigh of relief.At this moment, the aura on her body was also very chaotic.However, it was getting stronger and stronger.Very quickly, she sent out a message.After a while, Jiang Yingli came over with a large number of puppet students. Lin Hongyu did not say much and quickly said,""Lord Marquis wants to change paths and resurrect all of you. The puppet bodies are too strong, and we need the help of Saints to forge weapons that can bear the weight!""Creating a physical body ... Now that the sages are free, you can choose one to help you create a physical body! All the consumed spring of life, immortal energy, and energy stones will be borne by Lord Marquis!""After changing lanes, if you still wish to stay, the Marquis has ordered that Jiang Yingli will be the commander of the Academy's Army. You can follow her ...""The Academy Army?" Jiang Yingli was a little surprised."Right, that's it for now. We'll unify it later! This includes armies such as the heaven battling Army, the raincloud Army, and the great desolate Army. They will all be adjusted and integrated later on. Since they have joined, they are now part of haoxing!"Haoxing people?Jiang Yingli thought to herself,'why is he like the human King? he doesn't put much thought into his name at all.'Did he have to add his own name to make it unique? Would the cat aliens be better?Forget it. He thought of the cat and the invincible Cat. It seemed to be the same.Indeed, the closer one is to Vermillion, the redder he becomes!However, Jiang Yingli was very happy that she could be resurrected now. She was already resurrected, so there was no rush. However, these students were still in their puppet bodies."Alright, I'll go find someone immediately ..."As the descendants of venerable sovereigns, the few Saints were also very respectful. Moreover, this was Li Hao's order.The resources were all provided by the star military governor's office, so there was no problem. It was just that there were a hundred people, which was quite a lot. However, there were also a few Saints, so it was enough for each of them to deal with twenty to thirty people. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ The puppets were very excited. One by one, they followed Jiang Yingli and ran out.Lin Hongyu laughed when she saw that.With more blood flowing out of his mouth, he frowned and looked up at the sky. Even with the addition of the Earthcover sword, the pressure was still so great. In that case, would Li Hao be under even more pressure?He deserved it!He cursed in his heart,'this man ... Is heartless ... Alright, right and wrong friends are all heartless and cold-blooded.'To Yuan Shuo, Hong Yitang, and the others, even if they were to rebel ... This fellow might even have to help them hand over the knife!Perhaps, they might even secretly provide some assistance.Lin Hongyu, this is the path you've chosen. You'll have to finish it even if you have to cry ... Since you can't rule over the world, then ... You can find someone who rules over the world and marry him.As for what would happen to Li Hao ... He didn't care!At that moment, Lin Hongyu seemed to have gotten over it. The next moment, she looked up at the sky and cursed in her heart. How heartless!Scolding was scolding, but things still had to be done.Lin Hongyu continued to spread the news to maintain the morale of the people. She then said,""Men, have all the monster plants under the divine path go to various places to guard and sprinkle the spring of life! Sprinkle more in places with old, weak, women, and children!""The spring of life is the root of the monster plants ..." A soldier beside him hesitated."Will ... Will ... Will they agree to it?""Just go!"Lin Hongyu didn't bother to say anything more. Sequoia would do his best to appease them.After these people left, he looked at Qian Wuliang who was not far away and said,""General Ying!"Qian Wuliang quickly arrived.He looked at Lin Hongyu and smiled. Lin Hongyu smiled back and said,""General Ying is wasting his talents here! I'll have to trouble general Ying to make a trip to Hurricane city!"Qian Wuliang was speechless."Go find Zheng Yu and tell him that we hope he can lend us some immortal energy, spring of life, and some energy stones!"“……”Qian Wuliang looked at her and was speechless.Are you ... Trying to kill me?"General Ying can see through people's hearts. What Zheng Yu is actually looking forward to now is for heaven and earth to accommodate him as soon as possible. As for other things, he actually doesn't care!"Lin Hongyu laughed,"tell him that it's for the students of Yuanping martial arts university to switch paths. It's to stabilize the world and the great path! If he will...We can let those undying and paragons under him walk out and change their path! As long as he dares to ... We will agree! Of course, he'll provide the resources. "Qian Wuliang nodded and said with a smile,""You know more, commander ... I'll go immediately!"Soon, Qian Wuliang left.Lin Hongyu looked at his back and scolded him again. Don't you understand?
