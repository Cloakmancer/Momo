And you're still acting like you don't know how to speak.After thinking for a moment, he nodded and smiled,"alright, let Heibao stay then."Hearing this, Qian Wuliang was relieved. The others looked at Qian Wuliang a few more times, thinking that this guy knew how to choose people. Now that Li Hao wanted to be alone, he probably wouldn't even be interested in Lin Hongyu.As expected, a man was not as good as a dog!After a simple discussion, everyone left quickly. At this moment, it was more important to seize the opportunity first, in case the neo martial artists made the first move and destroyed the ninth Rank's lair. It would be too late then.…… Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  After they left, Li Hao was silent for a while. Then he suddenly laughed."I really ... Can't get rid of her!"He shook his head.On one side, Black Panther looked at him with suspicion.Why did he say that?Li Hao seemed to understand. He smiled and said,"there are too many people. Too many people are counting on you to make a living. You'll be tired!" Most of the Jianghu's swordsmen were lone wolves. Why? Because ... He couldn't afford it, and it was tiring! So many people are counting on you to make a living, can you not risk your life? They had no choice but to be carried up! Otherwise, wouldn't it be nice to be a lone traveler?""I was thinking, this time, my strength declined, and I introduced them to neo martial arts. I should go to neo martial arts and mix with the human King ... I felt more relaxed, but in the end, they had to talk about feelings with me ... When it comes to feelings, there's no way."Li Hao laughed again."Fortunately, it's safe to go out now, and I can be self-sufficient. Otherwise ... It'll be too tiring.""Woof!""What do you think I should do?"Li Hao smiled."I've abandoned all the external DAOs. I'm too lazy to cultivate them. The Dao comes from the body. If the body is strong, the Dao will be strong!" Moreover, the connection between the external great Dao and the chaos great Dao is not very free. It's quite restrictive!""Just like how the New World fuses the Dao with the river, those who do so will also be bound. The river of time is actually the chaos great Dao of the New World, and those who do so ... Are actually the same as us! It's just that we, including the grade nine, fuse the chaos great Dao. The chaos great Dao is actually the chaotic river of time!""Demonic flame, do you know about it?"Li Hao simply explained,"he doesn't enter the long river World. Although he's rejected, he's actually not affected by the long river!" Otherwise ... For example, if the river is controlled by someone, then all existences that have fused with the Dao River will be controlled by someone!"Black Panther nodded thoughtfully."I'm actually of the same nature as the demonic flame now," Li Hao said."I've abandoned all external DAOs and completely isolated myself from the chaos. I'm almost a replica of the demonic flame. And the demonic flame ... In the New World, it's unlikely that it can defeat the experts born in the river ... Of course, there's still a chance."He might not be able to grasp the demonic flame.However, in Li Hao's opinion, not entering the river was actually an opportunity. If he had broken the river and devoured it by himself ... Even he would not have been able to control the demonic flame!Otherwise ... He actually still had some ways to control the new ruler of the long river! Of course, there was no need to.He didn't say whether Mo Yan's choice was right or wrong. At this moment, he was actually walking the same path, but the premise was ... He had to be stronger and smarter than Mo Yan.Li Hao rubbed the dog's head and smiled."Most of the power in chaos comes from the chaos great Dao. The overflowing power of chaos also comes from the chaos great Dao ... Of course, the chaos great Dao currently doesn't seem to have an owner, so it doesn't really matter ... What I'm afraid of is that it has an owner. It'll be troublesome if it does!""It wasn't easy for me to get rid of my previous system, so I want to take another path. But ... Just as everyone said, I lack energy ... Everyone knows where the source of the power of Chaos is ... Without devouring the power of the great Dao of chaos, it's too difficult for a cultivator like me to strengthen myself!"Li Hao sighed with emotion. It was very, very difficult.Where could he get enough energy?The key to making himself stronger was that in the chaos, there would not be any obvious perception, the kind that even a tier 9 would not know about.Shocking the world with a single brilliant feat!You think I'm weak, that you can judge my situation by staring at the chaos great Dao ... But do you think I, Li Hao, can be controlled so easily?At this moment, Black Panther also revealed a worried expression.That's right!Then what are you going to do? "You can't absorb the power of Chaos, you're unwilling to absorb it, and you're not melting the great Dao of chaos. Where are you going to steal energy from?Li Hao wasn't a weakling!If an expert like him wanted to absorb energy, there were many types of energy. He had very few choices to begin with."Woof woof ..."The Black Panther cried out, and Li Hao laughed,""Devouring the great Dao universe? That Dao universe is actually related to the chaos great Dao, you know? It's the same. What do you think the world is? The world ... Is actually just a branch of the long river, didn't you see? When I split open the sky, I let them merge with the Dao River to open the realm ... The theory is the same, the world of chaos is actually a branch of the chaos great Dao!"Heibao was completely helpless. He had no other choice.According to you ... I can't cultivate anymore.Li Hao smiled again."Black Panther, energy ... Is not one type. The chaos great Dao actually only provides chaos energy. This time, I've completely understood something. Spirit ... Or rather, the energy of spirit is not actually provided by chaos!"The Black Panther was stunned.Li Hao continued,"you still know about force, right?" Force, spirit, essence, Qi, spirit and blood...The power of spirit comes from the soul, will and momentum. This kind of power is the most unique!"

"Both martial masters have broken through the hundred levels. You know very well how big the difference is between those with power and those without power!" "When you absorb the same amount of energy and have power, you'll become even stronger, several times stronger! This power comes from one's own body, from one's heart, from one's will ..."The Black Panther was somewhat enlightened, but ... It was still at a loss.Force?Do you want to ... Re-cultivate your aura?This was only silver moon's weak period. The path that martial masters took, you're going back to your old path?Then wouldn't all these years of struggle be a joke?Li Hao seemed to understand it again. He shook his head. "It's not a joke. In the past, I didn't understand what force and spirit were. After walking around, I finally understood that this is called standing high and looking far. Perhaps, this is the root of my Silver moon's rise!""Force is related to spirit. Perhaps this is the greatest benefit and revelation that time has left for me, the Silver Moon!""Time is just a form of energy, while momentum is the best enlightenment that time has left for us Silvermoon people ...""To solve the problem of the ninth-rank and to break free from the ninth-Rank's control, the only way is to break their understanding!""Be it the human ruler, spring and autumn, or the future one ... They might all be able to reach tier 9 and play an absolute role in future wars, but they ... Actually have everything under control. The human ruler's myriad DAOs of egoism will still enter the chaos and devour the chaos. Everything is out in the open!""The other venerable sovereigns might not be able to do anything, but what about Tian Fang?"Li Hao's eyes turned sharp,'my goal isn't the other rank-9 powerhouses, but Tian Fang! I can see through the other nine ranks, but I can't see through the Lord of Tian Fang. In the past, he actually came into contact with Zhan, but in the end ... After Zhan returned, he might have chosen to commit suicide ... Why?""Perhaps he saw the future. In the future, no matter what happens, he will never be able to match up to tianfang. He is an expert who has truly reached the pinnacle of the great Dao. If time wasn't the only thing in existence, he might have been able to control time!"Li Hao sighed with emotion and said,"you have to know that he has cultivated ten thousand DAOs. However, the only thing he has shown us is space ... And speed. Is he strong?" You don't know! Did he have any other methods? You don't know either!""The human King and the others might be able to deal with the other tier 9 experts, but Tian Fang......Might be the biggest problem!""He called on those rank nines to go to the depths of the chaos. Obviously, he chose this place. He knew that the chaos didn't have enough spirituality to support them. Why don't the others know about it?" Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ Li Hao shared his thoughts and speculations.It was also to sort out everything."The tianfang world was born at the foundation of the chaos great Dao ... In fact, in my eyes, the square domain is the future human world!"After splitting open the sky, he made some comparisons and came to many conclusions.The four-sided domain was not in the center of the chaos, just like the human world. It was not in the middle of the river, but in a corner. Why?That was because it was a little safer there, and it wasn't considered a battlefield.It was also convenient for development.If one were to put it in perspective ... The four-sided domain was actually the core of chaos, just like the position of the human world in the future world.Tian Fang ... Was born here.Of course, new martial and silver Moon were both born here, but they were not as early as Tian Fang, who was the most ancient world."The combination of 10000 DAOs can actually form various great DAOs. However, the clone of Tian Fang only knows the spatial Dao. The more it does that ... The more it means that this fellow is very sinister!""He has five great DAOs under his command: the envoy of life and death, the envoy of yin and yang, and the envoy of light and darkness. Are you proficient in it?"Heibao was stunned for a moment before he nodded.If his subordinates knew it, Tian Fang should know it too!"The messengers of light and dark are all outsiders ... Even the body Dao's Coiling Dragon sovereign is an outsider. Why did he let these people into Tian Fang? In fact, he's also perfecting his own great Dao system. Space isn't everything. On the contrary, Tian Fang must be proficient in all kinds of two extreme DAOs!" Li Hao's eyes flickered as he said, he must be proficient in the five elements, yin and yang, light and darkness, life and death ... He must know all kinds of the Dao of the two extremes! There's no lack of powerful attacks, but this guy's clone only teleports and escapes, as if he only knows space ... The more he's like this, the more guilty he feels!"Heibao finally understood!They looked at Li Hao with admiration. What Li Hao meant was that ... The human King and the others could only be considered hired thugs. They might have a chance against some level 9 fighters, but they definitely wouldn't be able to deal with Tian Fang.So, what our boss means is ... Tian Fang is more sinister than us?In the end, Tian Fang became the big winner ... And you'll kill Tian Fang?Just thinking about it made him excited!But ...In the next moment, Black Panther was dejected. Tian Fang was so powerful, but could you make yourself that powerful by comprehending force?I don't believe it!Although it was very willing to believe in it, the thought of using Shi to fight against Tian Fang ... Made it feel that there was no hope."Momentum is actually a belief, a will, and the unification that huntian has been pursuing ... Unfortunately, huntian only knows the surface and doesn't know the root!"Li Hao chuckled and said softly,"the root of chaos is not order, chaos, life, death, Yin, and yang. Of course, it's not time either!"The Black Panther was at a loss, which Li Hao liked. He laughed and said,""The foundation of the chaos, the fundamental will, is not these. These are all things that only the strong will consider, and the strong will only be in the minority. To the chaos, ordinary people are the majority! There were countless of them! And their most basic idea was actually ... Very simple! To survive!"Black Panther was still confused.Li Hao nodded."Not life, but survival. Since you're alive, you have to survive!" This was a common will shared by everyone. Whether it was the strong or the weak, they all had to survive! Even if they're dead, they have to find a place to bury them. This is also survival, a will shared by all living things in the chaos ...""Chaos actually has the will to unify, and what huntian pursues is obedience, unity, and order. In fact, the direction is wrong, and it is difficult to achieve this at any time.""Only survival is the common goal that everyone is pursuing ... It's the same for me, the human King, the tier 9, and even the world itself. Everyone is pursuing this!""As for freedom, time, and order, these are all matters for the future. Only those who are alive have the right to talk about these things.""What I have to do is to absorb these wills that are only common and strengthen my own power. Without realizing it, as the chaos becomes more chaotic, everyone's desire to survive becomes stronger ... Only then will I have the opportunity to overtake them and break through the boundary in one fell swoop!"Black Panther nodded. In fact ... He understood. However, he still did not know how to draw upon this one common point.How are you going to absorb it?You're right, but can you still absorb the will of all creatures in chaos?Can you do it?I keep feeling that ... You're delusional.Li Hao stroked the dog's head and smiled. He patted the dog's head and said softly,""Don't worry, I have a way. We ... Either we don't do it, or we do it. We have to be the ones who decide the fate of the sect. As for the others, they're just my shields. Let them fight first, and we ... Watch the show first!"Woof! Woof! Woof!The Black Panther barked, and Li Hao patted its head again.""You're the villain. Who said that only villains can do this? Can't I be a good person? Besides, whether the villain was a good person or not, didn't it still depend on the results? In the end, the villain wins ... He's a good person!"The Black Panther wagged its tail, thinking that it made sense. It smiled and squinted its eyes.Since Li Hao had an idea, it was no longer worried. It believed that Li Hao would succeed, because ... He was too bad, too evil. Such a bad person had to be left behind for eternity.……At this moment, some of the powerhouses felt a little uncomfortable. They felt itchy all over ... They had the feeling that they had forgotten something or were thinking about something wrong.

Chapter 3772 Trinity (1)
The chaos had not completely calmed down.The turmoil was still ongoing.New martial, Silver Moon, and spring and autumn were still attacking. Although the tier 9 experts had managed to kill chaos, they had also exposed the location of the world.These Grade 9 worlds had been silent for many years.Now, they were all exposed.The chaos great Dao was unstable, and they couldn't descend. They could only watch as their own world was destroyed, which made these Grade 9s furious.……Deep in the chaos great Dao. The level nine venerable sovereigns no longer pretended to be dead. They had turned into statues only to seal themselves, to prevent their spirituality from leaking and to prevent their lifespans from being depleted too much.And now, the chaos had reached such a state.There wasn't much meaning in sealing himself again.Under the statues, countless great DAOs materialized as if they had solidified and appeared before everyone's eyes. Those were their great DAOs, which were also tier 9 DAOs, true spiritual DAOs.The great Dao was incomparably thick, and it filled the entire chaos great Dao.At this moment, someone felt that his own realm had been destroyed. He suddenly snorted and couldn't help but say,""Tian Fang ... Has your clone found a new world? "If not ... I think it's better to help everyone first and stop neo martial from attacking ..."Some people were already dissatisfied.Previously, everyone had attacked together and paid a huge price. But now, only Tian Fang's clone was still in the chaos. However, this fellow had been running around in chaos for the past few days and had not found a new world.In fact, no one wanted him to find it.Li Hao giving up time was a good thing for most people. They wished that the New World would just disappear ... Of course, it would be good for them to appear again after they descended.At this moment, Tian Fang's clone didn't stop them, causing the worlds to be destroyed.Someone else said,"if this goes on, neo martial will grow stronger. The human King will be stronger day by day. I think if this goes on ... A second huntian will appear!" Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ "Li Hao is crippled, but the human King isn't a weakling either. After all, he comes from that world. Although he doesn't control time, you should have sensed that the human King has been absorbing a large amount of World Energy and Origin Energy recently. If this continues ... He'll be close to level 9, if not level 9!"Many people looked at Tian Fang.Tian Fang's clone was there, but he didn't stop them. He only knew how to find a new world ... This made everyone even more dissatisfied.Tian Fang opened his eyes and said calmly,"it's not that I don't care about everyone's interests, but ... Currently, it's impossible for a human King to easily reach level nine. On the other hand, once huntian finds a new world and plunders time and order, coupled with the fact that so many powerful cultivators died that day, he has sufficient spirituality ... Once it's seized by him, he'll definitely be able to instantly reach level nine. Furthermore ... It's a level nine that's even more difficult to deal with than chaos!""At the moment, even if a human King has reached the ninth rank, the threat it poses to us is still limited." This was reasonable, but many people were still extremely unhappy to watch their own world being destroyed.At this moment, someone else said,"it's all because of that bastard Li Hao ... Even if he's crippled, he must be killed!" If I had known this day would come ... I would have thought of a way to kill him ..."His words were like hindsight, but they did not get the support of the crowd.At this moment, calamity said,""Brother tianfang, Li Hao opened the heaven and earth, but then gave up the heaven and earth ... I'm a little uneasy. Li Hao clearly knows that he offended us last time, and he also knows that once we descend, he'll definitely die ... But at this critical moment, he clearly has a chance to advance, but he took the initiative to give up ... What do you think, brother tianfang?"He was still a little puzzled.Tian Fang actually couldn't completely understand it either. After thinking for a while, he said,""Perhaps ... He saw the despair of the future! Perhaps, time has made him lost and unable to extricate himself, consuming too much of his lifespan ... Perhaps, he was just a passerby, and in the end, time did not belong to him. "Everything was possible.Of course, in the end, Tian Fang still said,""Of course, we can't rule out the possibility that he can continue to control the New World. This is not entirely impossible. Although he has given up now, it doesn't mean that ... He will really give up. Perhaps he will let the world grow and when it becomes powerful, he will take over and leave a backup plan in the world. This is very normal."Many people nodded in agreement.This guess made some sense.That's right!If they were in his shoes, they might have done the same."Brother tianfang, what you mean is that he's just pretending to be weak now. The New World has grown and he can take over it quickly and vindicate level nine ... Is that right?""It's possible. "Tian Fang nodded.The five elements path master suddenly said,'if a third generation time cultivator is really born, will there be a conflict with Li Hao? I don't think it'll be that easy for him to take it back. ""Then he's digging his own grave!"Someone laughed.At this moment, many people agreed with this judgment. Although Li Hao was crazy, he was obviously not a fool.His strength had declined greatly, but with so many enemies, how could he really let his strength decline?Perhaps ... This was his plan!He would lower everyone's guard first, then wait for the New World to grow before snatching it instantly. It was a good idea to reach level nine Dao validation."No matter what, since he has stripped away time, if there's a chance, kill him first!" We'll completely cut off the possibility of him taking over time. That way, we'll be able to avoid some trouble and avoid falling into his schemes again! This person is very careful and can not be underestimated. Everyone suffered a loss before ..."

Everyone nodded in agreement.I agree with this.In any case, no matter how much he planned, he would just kill him with force after he descended!At this moment, the life and death path master, who was severely injured, suddenly said,""So be it if the world is destroyed. It's a good thing that these people are constantly killing. In the chaos, spirituality will gather in a short period of time, which will be beneficial for us to descend!"After saying that, he thought of something and said in a deep voice,""Tian Fang, back when we entered this place, you said that when time fully matured, we would be able to descend freely. But now ... Time isn't weak at all. Why ... Are we still unable to descend completely?""That's right. Back then, it was said that the chaotic spirituality would recover naturally, and soon, we would be able to enter and exit freely ... But now? It's been a million years, and the chaos spirit hasn't recovered much. The great Dao still can't support it ..."The several losses made them even more dissatisfied.In the past, they had believed in Tian Fang. Furthermore, they were no fools and had judged that after so many years, the chaos should have recovered naturally. Without them frantically absorbing spirituality, it was reasonable to say that the chaos should have recovered a lot.In the end ... After so many years, his spirituality had recovered a little, but it was very little. It was difficult for even a complete level nine to descend.At this moment, many people were suspicious.The Tribulation was because he had offended Tian Fang last time, so he didn't hold back anymore. He directly voiced out the doubts and suspicions in his heart,""Brother tianfang, your spatial passage has stood in the chaos for many years. After so many years ... Your tianfang world is also at the root of chaos. I just want to ask ... After so many years, did you ... Not absorb any spirituality?"He was a little afraid, but he wasn't willing to continue playing dumb. He said in a low voice,""Therefore ... I would like to ask, over the past million years, the spirituality of chaos has only recovered a little, or ... Did someone secretly absorb it? We can still sense the flow of Primal Chaos energy, but we're isolated here, so it's difficult for us to sense spirituality ... If someone secretly takes away some of it, we won't even know. "Who was it?Of course, it was Tian Fang!He was the ninth-rank who had the closest connection to chaos.Moreover, he was extremely powerful. His tianfang world was open to the public, and his Space Channel had always existed between heaven and earth.In a million years, even a tier 9 expert who descended with all his might couldn't do it?He couldn't help but be suspicious!Earlier on, everyone had their suspicions as well. But at that time, everything was still quiet and everyone was waiting for time.But now ... They were very frustrated. ​ The Yin Yang path master added,"Right. The recovery rate of a chaotic spirit is too slow! In the past million years, no new level 9 has been born. Logically speaking ... It shouldn't be so slow to recover!""Huntian inherited some of order's spirituality, long Zhan inherited some of chaos's spirituality, while Li Hao, Fang ping, and the others have only risen not long ago. It's impossible to say that they've absorbed the spirituality in a short thousand years. Although spring and autumn isn't weak, they're nothing in comparison.""Why ... Is it that after a million years of gathering spirituality, we still can't support our arrival?""I'm more curious ... What did the time cultivator of that generation talk to brother tianfang about when he entered the chaos that year? what made brother tianfang decide to seal the chaos for a million years?"“……”All the grade-9 experts expressed their confusion, doubt, and anger.Back then, they had followed Tian Fang here to save themselves and also for the future. On the other hand, Tian Fang had worked together with everyone to predict the future. If the level nine situation continued, it would cause chaos to be completely dead.Back then, they had also harbored the thought of waiting. After waiting for a period of time, they might recover.But who would have thought that ... This wait would last for a million years.Moreover, its spirituality was still dissipating and had yet to fully recover.In the middle, they were actually all put up there and couldn't come out. They could only accept their fate, but now ... No one wanted to accept their fate. Tian Fang, you must be hiding something!The master of tianfang just listened. Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ At this moment, seeing that everyone was angry, he slowly said,""I'm sure all of you are aware of the situation back then. I've told you all about it, and I even had the path Master of Destiny divine the future. We worked together with the path master of prophecy to divine the future ... If we don't leave and continue like this, our spirituality will never be able to recover. The chaos will eventually die out, and the entire chaos will collapse!""When Zhan that year traveled through time, he talked to me ... We didn't talk much, only briefly talking about the future ... The future ... What he saw was endless darkness, death, destruction, despair ... Perhaps, it has something to do with the consumption of spirituality at the ninth rank!""I've said this before, and I'm not hiding anything. "Tian Fang sighed,"everyone, you all knew about it back then. Why are you bringing it up again today?" I've already lost an avatar. Furthermore, countless experts of my tianfang realm have been killed ... I'm also very upset. ""As for the recovery of spirituality over the past million years of chaos ..."He sighed."A million years ago, too many tier 9 beings were born, and it hurt our Foundation. Furthermore ... We've been guarding the origin of chaos all this time and also sealed off the chaos great Dao. Even if we seal ourselves, we're still constantly consuming it ... Naturally, we won't recover too much ... The key is still time. We have to use time to stabilize our spirituality so that it can be solidified and not be destroyed for a long time ... This is what we've been waiting for and doing all this time ..."

Chapter 3774 Three In One (3)
He sighed helplessly."Time is coming. Our chance is coming. Everyone ... Why are you making things difficult for me now?"Calamity said in a low voice,"brother tianfang, it's not that we're making things difficult for you, it's just that ... We've waited for too many years!" We want to know when we will be able to descend with our peak power. "I need brother tianfang to give me an answer. You're the strongest, and you were the one who invited everyone here. Everyone trusted you ... But now ..."Tian Fang nodded his head and said with a heavy heart,"I know that everyone is anxious. Actually, I'm anxious too."He sighed and thought for a while."Soon. As long as time reappears, the chaos this time will be over, and a large number of experts will die ... The new martial arts will destroy the world. This is actually a good thing for us. In a short time, spirituality will gather! There will be a short explosive period ... When time returns to chaos and the chaos is stable, it won't be a problem for us to descend!""After that, as long as time reaches level nine and the solidification is completed, perhaps ... There's no need for anyone to control it!"There was a slight change in his expression."When the time comes, there's no need to worry about who's in control of time. Since the person in control of time is disobedient ... There's no problem in killing the other party. The prerequisite is that time can complete the solidification of the spirit!""Of course, if the other party is willing to cooperate, it will be easy to talk to them. We are not people who kill indiscriminately. If the time path master is willing to cooperate, it will have a more stable effect on the chaos."Everyone started to think.p Do I still have to wait?"Then now, you can go and find a new world. Can't you find it?"Tian Fang shook his head,"it's very difficult!" "Chaos isn't small, and it's not the main body after all. Although huntian's order is also among them, without the heavenly policy of order, he can't be considered the master of order. I think ... The chance of finding him isn't big. Of course, we have to take precautions. That's why I've been following huntian. I'm worried that it'll be troublesome if he really finds him!"He explained them one by one."Brother tianfang, it's not that I'm suspicious ... But everyone is a little confused. In the past million years, there are still too few spirituality in the chaos ... Do you think that a part of the spirituality is hidden somewhere, or ... There is a hidden expert in the chaos, and his spirituality has been extracted?"Tian Fang looked at him. He was obviously talking about himself.He chuckled and said,"it's a tribulation between us. Why do you have to do this?" "If I had really hidden a large amount of spirituality, I would have descended a long time ago. If I descended in person, do you think Fang ping, Li Hao, huntian, and the rest can do anything to me? Why do you have to be in a dilemma like today?"Everyone started to think.He still had some doubts.Did Tian Fang have any hidden spirituality?It was not clear, it was hard to say.'As for why they didn't descend if they were hiding ... Perhaps they're still waiting, waiting for Shi Guang to reach grade-9. Or perhaps, Shi Guang isn't the only one plotting this ... They're also!'Although Tian Fang was very strong, with so many tier 9 experts present, Tian Fang might be able to take on two, three, or four of them ... But five?How about ten?In any case, this fellow might still be hiding something. However, at this moment, it was not good to say anything more. If they continued, they would really fall out."Let's wait for the chaos great Dao to stabilize first," Tian Fang said."Once it stabilizes, even if everyone's true bodies don't descend, their avatars can still descend ... It's better than now."The Tribulation didn't say a word. To him, the loss of two avatars was huge. He didn't have so many avatars to descend continuously.At this moment, he looked up at the sky above them. There seemed to be a heart beating there. It wasn't obvious at first, but the chaos self-explosion had almost broken the chaos great Dao.Now, the origin of chaos seemed to have been frightened and hurt.After watching for a while, venerable sovereign calamity suddenly said,""The origin of chaos has been quiet these years ... And it has recovered a lot. We haven't extracted much energy from the origin of chaos for so many years ... Brother tianfang, what do you think ... If we extract some ..."Tian Fang frowned,'this is the core of chaos! If we were to be extracted during a tribulation, the entire primordial chaos would collapse ... Do you think we would be able to survive?""I don't think so," Jie Nan laughed. Previously, long Zhan swallowed a small mouthful, and chaos also wanted to try ... They're not afraid ..."Tian Fang laughed."That's up to you ... Of course, the origin of chaos is the source of life and is related to the great Dao of chaos. You also saw it previously. After long Zhan swallowed a small mouthful, life naturally comes with a counterattack. You alone might not be able to do anything ... And if everyone goes, be careful ... The origin will shatter. At that time, everyone will have a good ending!"His eyes were slightly gloomy.Tribulation!This fellow was becoming more and more daring. He actually wanted to use the origin of chaos. To everyone, this might be very satisfying in the short term, but in the future ... It would definitely not be a good thing.Once the prime essence of chaos was dispelled...The entire primordial chaos would instantly fall into a state of deathly stillness, and no more living beings would be born. So long as this group of people died, the world would be destroyed.In the end, even if they were alive, what was the point of one person or a few people?Moreover, the world was dead. Even if you were still alive, you would die sooner or later.It was even more dangerous. The entire chaos would collapse ... And the great Dao would be destroyed. Everyone would be doomed."That's not what I meant. What I'm thinking is that it's difficult for us to descend at this moment ... But if we can extract some of the origin of chaos, even if it's just to create a clone ... The clone will be stronger and can at least help a little. After so many years of self-sealing, everyone is a little lonely ..."

"Then you can try!" Tian Fang said impatiently.Calamity smiled."If you don't agree, it's fine ... In fact, I'm not doing this for myself. For example, I'm wondering if I can extract the origin of Li Hao's family and threaten him ..."He has already lost time, why do you need to do this?" Tian Fang continued."However, if he continues to control time, he'll be a huge threat. Since he's focused on resurrecting a few mortals, why don't we draw some in advance ... To deter Li Hao? if something really happens, we'll still have some trump cards!"Tian Fang furrowed his brows and fell into deep thought.Was it worth it?Of course, this was not the only reason for the Tribulation. This was only one of the reasons. He still wanted to extract some of the natural source to stabilize his own realm and strength. In addition ... Perhaps he had other thoughts.The prime essences of chaos were equivalent to the worldheart.It was even equivalent to the origin of the great Dao.In truth, a tier 9 also wanted to control it, but of course, the chances were not high. Without the ability, if one tried to forcefully control it, they would be easily assimilated and become a part of the origin.But the Tribulation ... Perhaps he felt that if long Zhan could take a bite out of him before, he, a tier 9, might have a chance too.After a long time, the master of Tian Fang shook his head."I don't recommend doing this. If you insist, you can just try!"The Lord of calamity smiled and didn't continue.Tian Fang didn't agree, and although he told him to try ... But ...He raised his head and looked at the huge heart that was vaguely visible. He didn't say anything. It was very dangerous. Danger was only one of the reasons. He was more worried ... That there were some secrets hidden within. For example ... Whether Tian Fang had done something in the origin.Who knows!At this moment, he was very suspicious that some of his spirituality had been extracted by Tian Fang. This guy, perhaps ... Had hidden it very well. If Li Hao could think that Tian Fang was being perfunctory, so could he.Others might not care, but he did.Because the four-sided domain and his zone of calamity were almost together, he actually knew some things. Over the years, his spirituality had been recovering, but it didn't seem to have grown.,m Tianfang world had actually been absorbing spirituality for a long time.However, there was no movement.Tian Fang...What are you trying to do?He stopped thinking about it. Some people, such as Li Hao, could hardly see through the current chaos. Was he really waiting for the world to grow before he received it?Was there a need?If he were to directly control it, Tian Fang's clone would definitely not be his match. Although huntian was strong, if he joined forces with the others, there was a chance of destroying huntian ... But chaos had been monopolized by Li Hao and the others.Li Hao didn't do that!This was also surprising.Besides ... Although people in the chaos had been devouring a large amount of chaotic force recently, there was no trace of Li Hao. Had he really given up?He didn't understand!…… Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ In the dark chaos. Now, the heavens and earth were in turmoil and chaos was everywhere. The Daoist field of the heavens was destroyed, causing countless venerable sovereigns to not dare to go out. All of them could only hide in the realm and tremble.Every day, he would feel some turbulence and the destruction of the world.Moreover, they were all powerful worlds.Most importantly, they couldn't get any more information and could only wait for the results passively. Many venerable sovereigns felt uncomfortable, but they had no choice.And at this moment, in the chaos.At the edge of a small world.A man and a dog appeared in an instant.Without a sound.It was eerily quiet.Li Hao looked at the small world in front of him and calculated for a moment. A moment later, he pinched off a piece of flesh from his right hand. The flesh was crystal clear, as if there was a small Li Hao standing in it.It was extremely strange!As if his cells were splitting, the core was actually Li Hao. A force of attachment spread out from his flesh and blood.Gradually, the flesh and blood floated toward the small world in the distance.After a while, the flesh and blood attached to the world and gradually began to integrate with it.At this moment, Li Hao and black Panther were like bandits and assassins who worked in the dark. They were extremely low-key and strange. Their entire bodies were covered by darkness."The 627th ...""The right arm part is already one-tenth complete ..." Li Hao mumbled.After saying that, he looked at his right hand.His entire right hand ... Was one-tenth shorter.It didn't actually look out of place, but if you compared his arms, they did.Heibao also looked at his hand and pouted. His arms were long and short, and he was missing an arm.Of course, Li Hao was wearing a long robe, which covered his face. If one didn't look carefully, they wouldn't be able to see much.Li Hao continued to calculate, recalling and deducing something. He smiled and said,""The entire East should be able to accommodate my two arms!"The Black Panther wagged its tail and did not say anything.This was also the experience that Li Hao had accumulated.In the past, it merged with the long river of Dao, then the Thunder region, and then the New World ...Today, he was going to reforge his own flesh and blood!Using cells as Ethereal Plane and merging them into the myriad chaos realm, there were countless chaotic realms of all sizes. There were probably hundreds of thousands of them.Today, Li Hao combined himself with the arrangement of the nine Heavens that he had observed and integrated his flesh and blood into the chaotic realm.On one hand, he could absorb the spirituality, will, and survival power from it. On the other hand, he could also nourish his body.

"Woof!"The Black Panther called out softly.Could it really be taken back after splitting into such a state?Wouldn't he be finished if he couldn't take it back?"Don't worry, in every piece of flesh, there is a me evolving! A drop of blood is also a Dao and a divine rune ... It doesn't devour power, only nourishes the flesh and blood. The key lies in the will!"Li Hao grinned."Heibao, just you wait. When the time comes, the entire chaos ... Will be mine!" I'll merge with the heaven and earth and stand up from the heaven and earth once again ... At that time, I'll be invincible!"“……”You're ruthless, you have the final say.Black Panther was also speechless.I'm just afraid that when the time comes, countless little li Haos will appear, and ... With your current situation, you'll be discovered sooner or later. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao's flesh and blood had been lost, and he couldn't even reemerge.It was basically lost!This was terrifying.At his level, it was not a problem for him to reincarnate from a single drop of blood. However, he was unable to recover from his current state!Li Hao laughed."Don't worry ... It's not that easy to see through. After I complete my plan, I'll find second cat and make a copy. Then, I'll ask Hu Qingfeng to summon a shadow and fuse it with me ... It'll be no different from the real one!"Black Panther was silent.This works too?Alright, whatever you say.Today, everyone was racing against time to seize energy, but the two of them were hiding everywhere as if they were pilfering chickens and dogs. They scattered Li Hao's flesh and blood in various places, and no one knew when they would be able to do it."Heibao ...""Woof!"Black Panther looked at Li Hao in confusion.Li Hao smiled."Notify Silver Moon and the others. In the near future ... Create some chaos. Also, have lingyue take action again and spread her divine Kingdom's concept everywhere ... Change the core of faith to me!"Black Panther was confused. What did he mean?Li Hao patted his dog head."Idiot. I've been idle all this time, so people might not trust me. Why don't we let the Queen create some trouble and make everyone think that I'm absorbing the power of faith and preparing to recover my strength with faith?"At the same time, he could also comfort those strong people and tell them to stop thinking about him, that he was also trying to save himself!"Also ...""Turbulence and chaos are good for the living beings of chaos to strive for survival!" Li Hao paused for a moment and said.At this moment, he seemed to have really become the villain.Using the turmoil and chaos to stimulate the will to live of living creatures, and on the surface, they began to absorb the power of faith ... In this way, even if outsiders discovered something, they would not think too much about it.The Black Panther nodded. He was the Silver Moon Spirit, so it would not be a problem to contact the Silver Moon.Li Hao, on the other hand, took it and continued to the next realm.The Black Panther surveyed its surroundings vigilantly for fear of being discovered. It was acting like it had when it was guarding Li Hao's door. It had almost forgotten that it was also a rank seven venerable sovereign. A man and a dog were sneakily wandering around.Li Hao didn't throw the flesh and blood randomly. Instead, he combined the flesh and blood according to the arrangement of the nine Heavens and the world.Gradually, his right arm was almost bald!If this continued, he would become a one-armed man.Each of the worlds was covered by a tiny piece of flesh. In the flesh, li Haos were sitting cross-legged, as if they were absorbing something.It was barely visible!Almost no one noticed anything. Li Hao had disguised every piece of flesh with heaven concealment. It came from Lizhu. In the past, Li Hao had been so weak that he could even block the chaos lightning tribulation, let alone now.Even Ordinary Level eight venerable sovereigns would not be able to detect them, let alone the weak ones.Every piece of flesh would eventually fuse and adhere to the world's origin.Until Li Hao called it back!……While Li Hao was moving ...It was a new world. Time was also flowing rapidly. A long black River seemed to have appeared near the original River at this moment. The aura of death filled the air as a person appeared between the heaven and earth. He was somewhat proud and happy."I told you ... I didn't see wrong back then!"That person mumbled to himself."I knew it. I didn't see it wrong. As expected, what fell into the long river was the Dao of death."Today, I've opened the river of dead spirits. Between heaven and earth, I, Yin, also have a place to stand. I'm not weaker than the ancestors who created the realm in the past.'From today on, I'm ... The Lord of undead!'At this moment, the heavens and earth trembled as if a new path had been opened up between the heavens and earth. The aura of death permeated the air as the essence of countless dead people fused into the river of dead souls.At the same time, outside the river.There were two more doors!A total of three gates appeared.It was no longer the door that Li Hao had left behind in the past.In the depths of the river of time, something seemed to be fluctuating. A figure vaguely appeared, somewhat similar to Li Hao, but with some resentment."You abandoned us ..."The figure mumbled as he looked at the river. The river was surging, and the figure gritted his teeth."Since that's the case ... From today onwards, I'm no longer Cang. I'm ... The spirit of the long river!"Devour this River and control it.He had fought for him for countless years, but he was abandoned on the day the sky was split open. He was not willing!……At another location.A huge mountain in the shape of a sword appeared. One of them was a little silly and honest. After a long while, he scratched his head."I am the sky sword ... Today, I open the sky Mountain and accept all sword cultivators in the world ..."

In his mind, there were some vague memories, very few, but ... There seemed to be a figure that he could not get rid of.Time splitting open the sky?Oh, I think ... I'm the sword that opened the sky!However, she felt that ... Something was missing.I don't care, I have to cultivate too.……In the entire new world, time was running wildly, and the era was constantly changing.At the same time.In a slightly illusionary place.Su Yu opened his eyes and looked at sun god. He smiled and said,""You can go back now. I've taught you everything I should over the years!""Thank you, Emperor Yu, for your help!"At this moment, the sun god was overjoyed. He had gained a lot from listening to this person's teachings these days!At this moment, the other party was chasing him away, so he didn't dare to disturb him. He was just a little nervous."I wonder when I'll be able to see Emperor Yu again ... I'll never forget the favor I've done for you today!"At this moment, sun god was still very simple and honest.Su Yu smiled."There will be a chance. See you tomorrow. You might be surprised!"The sun god was a little confused but did not dare to ask.Soon, he turned around and left, flying back to his original world.That world was like a seed, standing between heaven and earth.Su Yu looked on silently without saying anything. He just felt something and fell into deep thought. It was interesting. This was the world where the time cultivators lived.The time King that he had seen and known before, the old fellow in his eyes ... Could he be a second generation time cultivator?Then he was the third generation?Bah!I'm not!When would the time be the same?As he thought about it, a long river seemed to appear in his eyes. He made a simple judgment and pondered. Perhaps ... Soon.Just as he was thinking, his eyes suddenly moved.The world in front of him seemed to have changed.Not long after ... A familiar aura surged out!"What?"Su Yu was shocked. Dead?How could this be!He quickly walked out of his original position. In an instant, it was as if he had crossed time and appeared in the sky. At this moment, the figure he had seen in the past was collapsing!This ... How could this be!He ... How could he have been killed?No... He wasn't killed. He ... Committed suicide?"Damn it!"Su Yu frowned slightly and didn't say anything. Was it really necessary?A star gradually appeared in front of him, as if it was floating toward him. Su Yu frowned slightly. This guy ... He really gave up on time. Why?He had a headache!After a long time, he sensed something and exclaimed,""Eh ... This is ..."Before his eyes, the stars rotated, and something seemed to appear. It was as if ... It was a memory of the past.Su Yu looked at it for a while and was slightly stunned.After a long while, he sighed and said nothing more. He waved his hand, and the star ... Began to spin madly. In the blink of an eye, it was as if the world had been reborn, and a new world appeared.It was as if it had been fixed at a certain moment ... Countless palaces appeared.One figure after another appeared, a man with a cat. The man looked at the sky and Su Yu, and with a gentle smile, he said,""What joy is there in life, what fear is there in death ... Why bother?""Boring!"Su Yu shook his head."It's just that ... I saw that your main Dao has a spirit, and I didn't want to see you, so I couldn't be bothered to listen to you. I just wanted to let this Dao spirit grow a little. In the future, it might be able to be my companion!"A white furball appeared above his head and looked at the world in front of him with curiosity.He saw a fat cat, and then a second one ...He was a little curious and confused.What ... Were these?Su Yu rubbed the fluffy ball on his head and smiled.""This is also a Dao spirit ... It's just not mature yet. When it grows, it will have intelligence and master the great Dao like you!"After saying that, he did not take another look. He was a little unhappy.It was really ... An unhappy journey.Why do you have to do this?Ping Sheng, I hate people like you the most. You're not responsible in your work and leave countless troubles for the future generations!At this moment, Su Yu no longer cared about it. He just watched from afar like a god overlooking everything. He watched the world change and grow. Finally ... He saw a man rise ...He looked a little familiar, and his eyes moved slightly. This ... Seemed to be the person from that day. It turned out that this was the person that sun god would follow in the future.This meant that ... Time was almost up!A smile appeared on his face. 'In that case, the time in my myriad world will also be faster ... If the flow of time in the three directions is consistent, then the three will truly become one!'"This world will progress to the later stages ... When the myriad worlds progress to the moment I appear ... The past, present, and future will be completely United. At that time, I can walk out!"  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  He had completely understood!At this moment, he was looking forward to it.'Even though I don't want to cause any trouble ... If trouble comes looking for me, I won't just stand there and do nothing. I'll settle all the trouble first, kill all my opponents, and then give that old time a good beating ... That'll be enough!'"It turns out ... This is neo martial!"He mumbled to himself, neo martial era.In that case, the neo martial era was the group of people he had seen last time. The master of time was considered the descendant of neo martial?He also had some doubts. The neo martial era was so powerful, so how did time rise up later?How strange!At this moment, he saw something like a spaceship flying out of the realm. His heart skipped a beat and he suddenly smiled. He reached out his hand and the spaceship that couldn't fly out of the realm instantly fell into his hand!In an instant, a world appeared around him.He revealed a smile. This was interesting ..."Time to work. Blue sky, it's up to you. Create countless living creatures and hundreds of millions of clones ... Let the neo martial artists see the strength of our myriad world!""Big brother Yu ... You're so mean!" A person laughed from behind.Su Yu shivered and shuddered. This clone was really disgusting.He then looked at one person in neo martial arts and frowned slightly ... This person had always liked to split himself. He wondered if he had any connection with LAN Tian. He should have some inheritance of the Dao of myriad worlds.However, it was time who split open the skies, and it had nothing to do with him, right?Of course, it's best if you have nothing to do with it. Otherwise ... I'll hammer you to death!LAN Tian was becoming more and more abnormal!Recently, I can't stand it anymore.I hope it's nothing, otherwise ... I'll beat you up first!In an instant, countless life-like creatures appeared in the world behind him. It was as if an entire world had appeared in an instant. However, these countless life-forms ... Were actually formed by a single person. It was extremely terrifying!Laughter, sorrow, and reunions were all happening in this illusory realm.As for the cultivator called blue sky, his main body appeared beside Su Yu at this moment. He chuckled like a child and said,"brother Yu, it's so fun. I can't wait to enter the chaos ... Do you think that I can have a soul-stirring love with the time King after I have tens of thousands of incarnations?"“……”Su Yu was speechless. After a long time, he chuckled. "I'll support you, sure!"You disgust him, but don't disgust me.When he thought of this, he smiled. It must be ... Very interesting.Shi Guang, I'm finally going to see you! I hope that you won't let me down!He turned his head to look at where the stars of time and space were originally and raised his brows slightly. He then looked at the rapidly rising human King. At this moment, time was still passing by crazily. He smiled. I understand!This person ... Might ... Not want Shi Guang! So that was how it was!So ... Time was born in a new world?How interesting!Then, he looked at the human Kings who were still fighting in the realm and fell into deep thought. This person's saber techniques ... Were somewhat familiar.He turned to look at the crowd behind him. At this moment, many people were watching and pondering. Their Dao seemed to be somewhat ... Similar to this neo martial world.From the looks of it, it could be considered to have some inheritance.So that was how it was!Was it a Trinity?Su Yu was somewhat clear. At this moment, he had completely understood the relationship between them. It was like time, past, present, and future. The Trinity, and the source of their myriad worlds, perhaps, was also here.Su Yu turned to look at the world Channel and said with a smile,""We'll be able to return in a few more days ... Everyone, the true chaos is about to descend!"Everyone was a little excited, but also a little nervous.Was it about to descend?I'm really looking forward to it!

Chapter 3778 A New Era (1)
Chaos. The turmoil was still ongoing.In the darkness.Huntian was still searching for new worlds. He had already sensed some aura of order, but the chaos was too big and the aura was too faint. He couldn't determine the specific location.At this moment, he was a little frustrated.Recently, the new martial artists had been crushing the ninth-rank worlds everywhere to strengthen themselves. As for him, because of the heavy losses of the experts under his command, he had been looking for a new world and had no time to care.And now ... As neo martial and silver Moon continued to grow stronger, he was still stuck."Order ..."Huntian looked at Tian Fang in the distance, his eyes cold.This fellow had been following him all this time ... He really wanted to get rid of him!It was too annoying!There were a few times when he had the chance to find it, but Tian Fang had appeared and stirred up the surroundings, causing the target he had locked onto to disappear. This made him a little annoyed. He didn't know if Tian Fang had done it on purpose or not.However, it was true that Tian Fang wanted to stop him from seizing the New World.This guy would rather have three generations of time than let him seize it.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  "Tian Fang!"His voice was cold,'three generations of time, are you sure you're easier to deal with than Li Hao? You've been causing trouble on purpose, don't end up getting caught in your own trap!"Tian Fang chuckled,"fellow Daoist huntian, you misunderstand. I don't mean it that way. I just want to find the third generation's tracks as soon as possible ... Fellow Daoist, you misunderstand."Huntian laughed coldly.Today, he was much gloomier and colder than he had been before.As order flowed away, the negative emotions such as darkness, chaos, and desire that he had absorbed were all erupting. With the death of the chaos Emperor, the chaos great Dao had no master. At this moment, huntian was actually close to the level of the chaos Dao master.He ... Was gradually taking control of the chaos great Dao!It had to be said that everything was decided by the heavens.He had originally wanted to Control Order and suppress chaos and darkness. Order was the main force and chaos was the secondary force. Who would have thought that order would disappear and he ... Might become the new chaos Dao master of the chaos! It was a little helpless, but also a little ridiculous.He didn't want this to happen, but at this moment, there was nothing he could do. Of course, after coming into contact with chaos, he had some doubts and emotions.In today's chaos, order had collapsed, and chaos reigned.In fact ... It was much simpler than the Grand unification of order.The Dao of chaos seemed to be completely filled with chaos.His ambition was to unify the will of chaos, but he realized that order ... Was too difficult to establish, while chaos seemed to be ten times or even a hundred times easier. He had spent a million years to establish a land of order in the West.But taking over the chaos path ... It had only been a few months, and he felt that ... He had a chance of becoming the chaos path master.What a joke!Fate made a fool of him. The collapse of order and chaos on the path was his chance to step into level nine. However, huntian ... Was still a little unwilling. It was more difficult to establish order, so it naturally had to be stronger. His path was actually a fusion of order and chaos.Now, if he were to use chaos to attain level nine ... He did not know how he would feel.On the other side, Supreme Emperor Tian Fang seemed to have sensed something and laughed again."Huntian, after chaos died, the order of the entire chaos collapsed. Now, new martial, Silver Moon, and spring and autumn are all killing everywhere. Darkness has descended in the entire chaos ... Rising from the darkness might ... Not be a bad idea."Huntian sneered,"so what if it's chaotic?" What was the former chaos path master among the rank nine experts? If I only wanted to reach level 9, I might have been able to do it a long time ago ... Tian Fang, do you think I would use chaos to vindicate my Dao?"Order and chaos. Only by combining the two could they go against Tian Fang.In the past, the master of order was killed by Tian Fang. Obviously, he was afraid of the master of order. But what about chaos?Tian Fang wouldn't be afraid of anything!The order that rose from ruin was the strong.Tian Fang didn't try to persuade him. He just smiled and didn't say anything else.There were good and bad things about the nine ranks of chaos heaven.Now that he was a rank-9, he could even more clearly understand that time was the key to stabilizing his rank-9. Thus, once he was a rank-9, this fellow would have a chance of joining their camp.Not reaching the ninth step ... This fellow was currently searching for a new world with him.It didn't mean that ... Huntian was on the same side as everyone.They were not on the same side as order.Of course, it didn't matter.If huntian didn't reach level nine, his threat would be limited.Huntian didn't pay any attention to him. He looked around and seemed to have found something. He quickly disappeared. Tian Fang's eyes moved and he also quickly disappeared and followed.Did this guy realize it?As he flew into the air, Tian Fang was thinking about something. Three generations of time ... He wasn't talking about chaos, but what kind of people were the true cultivators of the third generation?Would it be a life form born in the New World, or could it be ... The spirituality reincarnation of long Zhan and this group of dead people?If long Zhan and the rest reincarnated ... That would not be considered a surprise.However, if it was a newcomer, it would be very strange.It was actually very difficult and shocking for a newcomer to rise up in a situation where a group of people had invested their spirituality.He hoped that ... The so-called third generation was long Zhan, Yuan Shuo, or someone else ...If it was Yuan Shuo, he would not be surprised.After all, he was Li Hao's master.Li Hao might have made some arrangements as well.Very quickly, the two of them arrived at the eastern border. Chaotic force was constantly in turmoil here. Huntian frowned slightly and looked at the turbulent chaotic region."Here?" Tian Fang smiled.

Chapter 3779 A New Era (2)
Huntian ignored him and only looked at him for a while.After a long while, he suddenly said,"Tian Fang, this is already the edge of the Far East. I have some ideas about Li Hao's sky-splitting this time ... Do you think the chaos was also created by man?" "Is there any point in asking this?"Huntian sighed."It doesn't have much meaning, but ... The path of cultivation is endless and seems to never end. Is grade-9 the end of the path of cultivation? Even someone as powerful as you, who possesses all DAOs, can't seem to be able to easily suppress the heavens and earth! Is there any path above grade-9?"Tian Fang chuckled,"who knows!" If one could see the end of the path of cultivation at a glance ... It was actually very boring! For example, the time cultivator from the neo martial world might have lost all hope because he saw the end in one glance! "All these years, rank nines have been trapped in the depths of the chaos. They actually have some ideas. The path of cultivation, reaching the end, is actually the beginning of pain ..."Huntian was deep in thought and didn't say anything.He took another look at the edge of the chaos. He could vaguely sense that order ... Was within the turbulent chaotic energy.Therefore, the New World was very likely to be in the nearby area.But at this moment, it was covered by chaos.It was like a new world that had yet to advance and was difficult to find.After a long time, he said, it should be in this area ... Aren't you worried that Li Hao will summon this world back after it grows? Tian Fang, there's still room for cooperation between us ... We'll seal off this entire area. Whether it's you or me, whoever gets it will be better off than Li Hao. "Tian Fang seemed to be in deep thought."You mean ...""You use space to cut it, and I'll cover it with darkness. We'll cover the entire area and refine it bit by bit! Let the new Sky appear and not be able to escape. Let Li Hao completely cut off his thoughts of taking back the new Sky!""Of course!" Tian Fang pondered for a moment before nodding."Sure, I don't have any objections ... However, refining it a little bit is not a small project ...""I'm not in a hurry, so why are you?"Huntian sneered."The chaos great Dao is still in turmoil. Time has dragged on. Today is an opportunity for you, for new martial, and for everyone. Only for me ... It's not an opportunity!"He laughed coldly. He knew very well what this group of people was thinking.Now, stalling for time would not do him much good, and perhaps there was also Li Hao ... Which was good for everyone else.When the chaos great Dao calmed down completely, even if his true body couldn't return to its peak, he could still descend like the chaos.Tian Fang didn't say much.The two of them began to divide their work, sealing off the dark surroundings.……In the South.Li Hao suddenly turned around, raised his eyebrows, and smiled.You're quite capable!The chaos was so vast, and they had managed to lock onto the general area of new heaven so quickly. It would be very soon. To experts, a few months was nothing. It was just a blink of an eye!In such a short time, they had actually locked onto a small area ... It seemed that the power of order was getting stronger and stronger, which meant that the power of rules was growing rapidly in the new Sky."Back then, I entered the new heaven, and only three days passed in the outside world. I've spent hundreds of years ... And that's when the river of time wasn't inside."Li Hao calculated for a moment. Only four months had passed since the sky was split open.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  120 days, according to the previous flow of time, was about 10000 years.However, after the river of time was established, the flow of time might have become even more mysterious. Li Hao had no idea how long it had been since the New World was established.With these thoughts in mind, he was not worried about anything.He looked over and sneered.It was inevitable that huntian wanted to seize a new world.But what about Tian Fang?Would he ... Really be that anxious?"He's the one who's worried if Shi Guang doesn't grow up ... He's not afraid of someone controlling her at all. What he's worried about is that she won't be able to grow up ..."In Li Hao's hands, the path of time had always been a sixth-rank path.When it was in the hands of chaos, it quickly grew to Level 7 and was even close to level 8!After the creation of the world, it absorbed the power of countless great DAOs. The Dao of time could be considered to have officially stepped into the level eight Dao and became the strongest Dao in the new heaven. However, the Dao of time was still not a level nine great Dao!A Grade 9 great Dao still required sufficient spirituality.After so many years, perhaps ... The spirituality of the great Dao of time in the New World would be sufficient. After all, countless people were cultivating and perfecting the great Dao of time. Perhaps, once time flowed, there was hope for him to step into level nine!This was what Tian Fang wanted, right?"However, it's still difficult ... The Xintian great Dao is not perfect enough. I've only integrated 5000 great DAOs into it. Using 5000 great DAOs to forcefully push it to level nine ... There will still be some difficulty, unless the future emperor can make up for the flaws."Li Hao thought about this. Perhaps the nomological Dao would be stronger. The 5000 great DAOs could rival the 89000 great DAOs. Together with time Dao, it could even fight a stage nine. However, it still had some flaws in essence.He didn't care about this.It's up to the person to solve it. It has nothing to do with me. I'm already very kind to help him gather 5000 Dao laws.At this moment, Li Hao's entire body had shrunk by a large chunk, and he looked like a child!If he walked out now ... He would probably be mistaken as one of Spring autumn's accomplices.
