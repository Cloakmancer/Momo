s still in shock when he walked out of the tent.
 Independence?
 He had never thought about this before, but today, he heard it from hou Xiaochen's mouth.
 At this moment, Zhang Ting and the three major organizations ... He didn't care about them.
 He knew very well what Silver Moon would face if he became independent.
 With the suppression from the central continent and the encirclement from all over the world, the star dynasty had not collapsed yet, nor had it completely gone out of control. At this moment, there were many ambitious big shots.
 However, no one would say that they wanted to be independent!
 No one dared to!
 A starving camel was still bigger than a horse. When the building was about to collapse, there were almost no insurgents who could win the final victory when the chaos began.
 Those who were familiar with the history books would know that whoever dared to show up at this time would be the one to die.
  Moreover, since ancient times, there were very few border rebellions that eventually took over the Central Plains.
 Many thoughts appeared in his mind.
 Beside him, Yuan Shuo was silent for a while. When they were almost at his tent, he finally said,""Don't think too much, it's no big deal. A small silver Moon won't be able to cause too much of a stir even if he's truly independent. "
 "As for hou Xiaochen ... He wouldn't dare to do this unless he had no other choice."
 Li Hao nodded.
 He looked at the teacher and asked,""Teacher ... Why do you think he said that? And even want to do this?"
 For such a thing, even if he had thoughts, shouldn't he hide it?
 He just said it out so directly!
 Yuan Shuo was silent for a moment, thinking for a while, and then slowly said,""I have no choice."
 "No other way?"
 "Let me ask you," Yuan Shuo nodded,"if hou Xiaochen were to leave Silver Moon and listen to the orders from above to fight in the central region, would the night watchmen under Hao lianchuan be able to hold their ground? Can they resist the three great organizations?"
 Li Hao thought for a while and then shook his head.
 Probably ... Probably not.
 Hao lianchuan wasn't very strong. On top of that, he was a straightforward person and didn't have much prestige. This was obvious.
 Everyone was in awe of hou Xiaochen, and Wang Ming was no exception.
 Whenever Hao lianchuan was mentioned, Wang Ming would laugh. He wasn't mocking him, but rather thinking that this Deputy Minister was very interesting and that everyone liked him. However, this kind of person often couldn't give everyone a sense of security at critical moments.
  "With hou Xiaochen gone, I'm afraid Silvermoon's Nightwatchers won't be able to hold their ground."  "If he can 't, then Silver Moon will be in trouble!" Yuan Shuo calmly replied. However, if he didn't leave, he would be disobeying his superior's orders! Once, twice, three times ... He's been disobeying you so many times. If you're an expert from the central continent, do you think someone like hou Xiaochen would still be alive?"
 That was why he said he had no choice.
 Li Hao frowned, did the higher-ups not consider this? Now that Minister hou is gone, Silver Moon will be in danger. "
 "Consider?"
 Yuan Shuo laughed."The central region is in chaos. The border has actually been abandoned long ago. At this moment, they have to concentrate their forces and calm the chaos in the central region. That's their first consideration! As for a small province like the border province, it was fine if he gave it up. As long as the central region is still under the control of the dynasty, the world will not be in chaos!"
 Doesn't the central continent know how complicated the situation is?
 He knew!
 However, they still did it. They ordered hou Xiaochen to be transferred to the central continent.
 Hou Xiaochen was just unwilling to leave. Otherwise, he would have left a few years ago.
 Li Hao frowned,'how strong is Minister hou? The central region is already in such a mess, yet he still has the energy to let a middle stage three yang keep an eye on him with an origin divine weapon. If Minister hou is a late stage three yang ... It's not worth it, right?"
 He had let a middle stage three Yang Lie dormant for three years just to monitor him.
 Was this worth it?
 With this amount of effort, Zhang Ting might even be able to enter the late three yang realm in the central continent. She might even be comparable to hou Xiaochen, so why would she need to forcefully mobilize him?
 Yuan Shuo pondered for a while and shook his head."It depends on the situation. Perhaps the higher-ups suspect that his injuries have healed. If he has recovered, he would have had the strength of a peak three-sun back then. He might have really stepped into the realm above three-sun now!"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Of course, he wasn't sure about this.
  Perhaps only hou Xiaochen himself knew if he had recovered or not.
 He didn't say that he was seriously injured, but he didn't say that he wasn't injured either. In this way, no one knew the situation. Even the three major organizations, even if there were many three suns, did not dare to provoke him rashly.
 "Teacher, are you really going to leave?"
 Li Hao didn't bring up the matter again. Instead, he recalled what hou Xiaochen had just said.
 "I have to go!"
 "I've already made preparations before I came,"Yuan Shuo said with a smile. This time, whether I kill sun Yifei or get killed by him, I won't be able to go back to Silver City. After my strength is exposed, those old friends will probably miss me ... If I stay in the Silver City, I may cause you more trouble. Furthermore, martial arts have already declined in Silver moon's territory, and superpowers are nothing more than that. If I don't leave, it'll be hard for me to find more opportunities. "
 "In addition, Hongyue has been keeping an eye on the Silver City, but if it's between you and me ... Hongyue's main focus will still be on me. Ying Hongyue knows my personality. Once I leave the Silver City, I'll definitely take revenge on him!"
 He said matter-of-factly,"if I kill the three suns of the Crimson Moon and disappear, he will definitely guess that I will take revenge on him! At that time, he might still send people to Silver Moon, but he'll definitely spare more energy to keep an eye on me!"
 Because Ying Hongyue had been defeated before!
 He also knew what kind of person Yuan Shuo was.

 p If such an expert were to disappear from his sight, he would definitely find a way to find Yuan Shuo and kill him with all his might.  Yuan Shuo patted Li Hao's shoulder and said with a smile,""That's why I hope that you can reach the warrior energy level this time. Only then will you have the ability to protect yourself. If I leave, you won't have the power to fight against thousands. If you encounter any trouble in the future, I won't be able to help you solve it. "
 Li Hao lowered his head.
 "It's time to grow! Which good man doesn't go through a little hardship?"
 Yuan Shuo laughed happily."When I was young, I also left my home early and began to train. My enemies were all over the world. I don't know how many people I've killed and how many people I've been afraid of. That's how I've gotten to where I am today."
 "I'm just worried about teacher. "
 Li Hao said in a low voice,"if teacher really wants to take revenge on the Crimson Moon, there are many three suns in the Crimson Moon. I'm afraid there are also many above three suns. This is just some gossip I heard at the border. In fact, the other party might be even stronger!"
 "Isn't that good?"
 Yuan Shuo laughed,"the stronger you are, the more challenging it is!" I've only just started to accumulate the spirit and the five internal organs. I'll fuse the spirit and the five internal organs again! The road is still long. If the enemies are all the sunlit three suns, I won't feel any pressure. "
 "Back then, the Silver Moon martial forest was very strong, but why didn't there be any cheating in my generation?"
  "It's not that we can't do it, but we're all too good, far better than the previous generations. However, the bad thing is that there's no pressure from the universe. We can sweep the martial arts world as long as we're above 100. No one has that sense of urgency. As a result, a group of people who have broken through 100 can't even step into the universe!"
 "If there was one person who reached the Dou Qian realm back then, the Silver Moon martial forest would have produced at least seven or eight Dou Qian martial masters."
 When he said this, he felt a little regretful and a little proud."Actually, it's all my fault that those grandsons didn't advance! At that time, I suppressed them so much that they couldn't even raise their heads. I was only at perfection, so how could they dare to be stronger? At that time, if I were to step into the warrior tide ... Ying Hongyue, sun Yifei, and the others would also be able to do so. However, I haven't been able to make it, which has made them feel a bit lacking. "
 Li Hao couldn't help but laugh. The sadness he had felt earlier was completely suppressed.
 "Teacher, then tomorrow's battle ..."
 "Of course we're going to fight!"
 Yuan Shuo said calmly,"tomorrow, watch carefully!" "The ones I've encountered before were all supers. I wasn't able to unleash my true strength. Whether I was being suppressed or suppressed by others, they weren't martial masters. They didn't stimulate all my potential. Sun Yifei is a very good opponent!"
 "As for the ruins ... They're just supplementary!"
 "If you can defeat sun Yifei, that will be a real harvest. Treasures can't be compared to that. Treasures can be found at any time. When you have a worthy opponent, it will be your motivation to move forward."
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "So, don't worry about revealing your strength or not ... If you can kill them all, then kill them all. If you can't kill them all, then kill as many as you can. Even if you're prepared, you can still kill them!"
 When he said this, he seemed very arrogant.
 Finally, he looked at Li Hao and said,"little Hao, when it's time to be outstanding, you must be outstanding!" If one kept a low profile, no one could become a strong person! "I know what you're worried about. You've exposed yourself too much, and that's going to increase the danger as well ... But experts walk out of danger! Was hou Xiaochen keeping a low profile? Back then, he wasn't low-key at all. He was so high-profile that he even dared to fall out with Ying Hongyue, so even now, no one dares to look down on him!"
 "Qiao Feilong is low-key, right? He kept a low profile to the third Sun ... But he didn't have the time to be high profile and was killed by me!"  He mentioned two people, two different results.
 The other was so low-profile that he was even at the three suns realm. In the end, he was killed before he could even show his true colors.
 One was a high-profile person who had been high-profile for many years. Later, he became low-key after he was injured. He was so low-key that everyone thought he couldn't make it. However, with his reputation back then, no one dared to provoke him. The higher-ups could only send a three suns to keep an eye on him.
 Two different choices.
 Li Hao nodded and didn't say anything.
 Soon, the master and disciple entered the tent. At this moment, Liu Yan and the others had also returned. It was very quiet. Liu Yan didn't say anything, and neither did Liu Long.
 As for whether they had seen Tiger soul, Li Hao didn't ask.
 Tonight, everyone was quiet, giving Yuan Shuo some time to rest.
 Tomorrow, Yuan Shuo would be there.
 And his opponent was a late stage three yang from the central region. Even if everyone was full of confidence in Yuan Shuo, at this moment, they were still feeling uneasy deep down in their hearts. Three yang was one level higher than Qian warrior, not to mention the late stage!
 ……
 At the same time.
  Under a broken bridge, sun Yifei didn't put up a tent. The sky was his blanket, and the earth was his bed. Right now, he was leaning on a rock and looking at the stars.
 The starry sky was bright.
 The three disciples surrounded the area and chased away the mosquitoes for their master ... In reality, the snakes, insects, rats, and ants did not dare to get close at all.
 After a long time, sun Yifei who had been silent suddenly said,"Mo Xian, does Yuan Shuo's disciple really have the strength of a late-stage or complete-stage cultivator?"
 "The probability is."
 "Five birds sect's people ..."
 Sun Yifei thought for a while and said,"Tomorrow, you will fight! Go all out and see if you can find a worthy opponent. If you meet a good opponent, it will be very helpful for you to enter the Qian warrior realm!"
 "If I lose tomorrow ... Take your junior brothers and sisters back to the central continent!" He added.
 "Master ..."
 "Listen to me. As for the ruins, it's not important. Don't be a blade for others."

 Sun Yifei replied calmly,"although I'm confident, my opponent is Yuan Shuo. I still have to make preparations." Between Yuan Shuo and me, there's a 99% chance that only one of us will survive tomorrow. Whether it's him or me ... It doesn't matter! Back then, my biggest regret was that I couldn't enter the thousand warrior realm. I hope you can help me fulfill this dream. If you can't defeat Li Hao ... Admit defeat! "Losing once isn't scary. A Martial Master isn't afraid of losing once. No one is undefeatable. Master won't let you die so easily ..."
 "Master, I will defeat him!"
 "It's a good thing to have confidence. "
 Sun Yifei smiled and nodded,"in short, if I lose, you guys leave immediately!" Yuan Shuo won't stop you. The Grudge between me and him is The Grudge of our generation. The rules of the martial arts world don't involve family members! "As long as you don't die at Li Hao's hands, my battle with him will end. I won't go out of my way to kill Li Hao, and he won't go out of his way to target you ..."
 Hearing him say this, the few disciples felt a sense of sympathy in their hearts, but they also did not believe that their master would lose.
 How was that possible?
 The late stage of three yang!
 He was also a Martial Master who had advanced to the late stage of the three yang realm. Even in the central region, only those who were above the three yang realm could defeat his master.
 However, in Silvermoon province, a warrior Qian actually asked his master to make arrangements for his funeral.
 "Master, then ... Why don't we go back to the central continent?" the female disciple couldn't help but ask.
  I don't want to fight!
 "What a joke!"
 Sun Yifei snorted,"I came here to fight Yuan Shuo!" Whether I live or die, it's all what I pursue! As martial masters, you must remember that you can be defeated, but you can't retreat without fighting! "Unless you're one against one hundred and meet three suns, the difference in strength isn't that big. You might even have the advantage. If you choose to retreat ... That's all you can do!"
 "The path of a Martial Master is even more difficult. If you can't accept it, you can choose to become a superpower when you return. Then, you can decide your own path. "
 After saying this, he closed his eyes and ignored them.
 He needed to rest for a while and prepare for the battle with Yuan Shuo.
 At this moment, sun moxian and the others were filled with apprehension and uneasiness.
 Master's words made them unable to sleep.
 They were not the only ones who did not sleep that night.
 Many people could not sleep.
 ……
 August 27th.
 The sky had just turned bright.
 Hao lianchuan probably didn't sleep the entire night. Early in the morning, he rushed to Li Hao's tent.
 Meanwhile, in the tent, Yuan Shuo was walking slowly, not in a hurry.
 After a simple wash up, he had some breakfast.
 After wiping his mouth clean, Yuan Shuo walked out.
 Hao lianchuan looked at him, his eyes a little red.""You insist on a battle?"
 She had been wanting to look for him the entire night, but she had held back. Now, she really couldn't hold it in anymore.
 "Are you a Martial Master?"
 Yuan Shuo looked at him.
 "No!" Hao lianchuan frowned and replied after a while.
 "That's why you can 't!"  Yuan Shuo stepped over his side and strode forward,""It's rare for Silver moon's martial masters to avoid battle. Martial masters who avoid battle are either really inferior to others or are cowards."
 "A Martial Master should advance courageously. As long as you feel that you won't lose and can fight, you won't avoid a fight. This is true at any time and anywhere!"
 "Take swords gate's Hong Yitang for example, he avoided my challenge back then ... Because he knew that he was not as good as me, and he admitted that he was a coward. That's why he avoided my challenge twice, and I didn't want to challenge him a third time."
 "Hao lianchuan, you're a good person. It's just a pity that you didn't advance as a Martial Master back then ... Otherwise, you would be even stronger today!"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Hao lianchuan was speechless. There were too many people who were not martial masters.
 Who said that a Martial Master would definitely be stronger after advancing?
 "But sun Yifei is at the late stage of three yang ..."
 "I can still beat him!"
 Yuan Shuo was full of confidence!
 Hao lianchuan saw that he couldn't persuade her anymore, so he said,""In that case, let's stop here ..."
 ,m "There's no limit to the competition unless I teach a disciple. If sun Yifei admits to being my disciple, I'll stop!"  That's bullshit!
 "I'm doing this for your own good!"Hao lianchuan was a little mad.
 "There's a kind of love that's for your own good ... Unfortunately, you're not my parents, so I don't need it. Hao lianchuan, if you have the time, you should think about the consequences if I kill sun Yifei. "
 Hao lianchuan had completely given up!
 He had given up.
 "What consequences?" he asked weakly. If you kill sun Yifei, you will be the most powerful man in this area. The other organizations will probably not give up on exploring the ruins, but they will unite together. We just need to be careful of them joining hands after we enter the remains. "
 Give up?
 It did not exist.
 If they gave up and the night patrolman really took away the defensive origin god weapon, the large organizations probably wouldn't be able to sleep well.
 Therefore, he would not leave.
 It was just that the originally loose Alliance would become closer.
  Of course, this was not important.
 The important thing was, if he stopped sun Yifei from killing Yuan Shuo, what would happen?
 This was what Hao lianchuan had been thinking about the entire night.
 Thinking of this, he thought of the department head's arrangement to lend Yuan Shuo the fire Phoenix gun.
 He then caught up with Yuan Shuo and whispered,""You didn't bring any weapons, did you? I'll lend you a spear ... Do you know how to shoot?"
 "No need!"
 However, Yuan Shuo refused.
 Hao lianchuan was going crazy. He gritted his teeth and said in a low voice,""That weapon is not ordinary!"
 This was an origin god weapon!
 "No need. If I'm exposed, I'll be in even more trouble. Even if we need to use it, it'll be after we enter the ruins. "

 Yuan Shuo still refused. He knew what that was.
 But he didn't need to.
 Furthermore, the fiery phoenix spear was the only source weapon on Silver moon's side. Once it was exposed, it might attract even more trouble. It might even attract some outsiders. When that happened, they would no longer be after the ruins but the fiery phoenix spear.
 This was the first time that the fire Phoenix spear had left hou Xiaochen. If no one dared to go after hou Xiaochen, why wouldn't they go after them?
 "But ..."
 "It's true," Hao lianchuan said worriedly."You're definitely no match for him. There's still a chance if you take it."
 "There's no need for that. Don't worry. Once I win and enter the ruins, you can lend it to me again ... At that time, I'm sure there will be a surprise."
 Yuan Shuo laughed.
 When the enemy felt that they had seen through you, only to find out that what they had seen was far from everything, that would be an unexpected surprise.
 He was only prepared to fight with sun Yifei with the heart fire ape.
  He didn't even want to expose his stone saber.
 As for whether or not he could match sun Yifei, he would only know after fighting him.
 Yuan Shuo didn't want to use these more powerful weapons against sun Yifei, and he didn't have to worry too much about sun Yifei's dirty tricks. This was a tacit understanding between martial masters.
 A fair and square battle!
 Of course, it was normal for the moves to be a little more sinister. Some people specialized in these paths, so it didn't matter if the moves were sinister.
 Did sun Yifei bring a red shadow?
 Yuan Shuo felt that there was a high probability that he would not.
 If that guy knew the use of the red shadow, the first thing he would do was probably to kill it and swallow it. He wouldn't cultivate any red shadow. Ying Hongyue should also know this, so even if Yuan Shuo couldn't see it, he knew that sun Yifei didn't have any red shadow.
 Since that was the case, why would he need the Phoenix spear?
 As they spoke, the others followed one after another.
 Some people were worried, while others were excited. They were excited because they might be able to see a battle between the three suns. For them, many people had never seen such a high-level battle.
 In the distance, there were also movements in some tents.
 Some supers followed from a distance, looking forward to it.
 ……
 Only the broken bridge was left where the heavenly bridge was.
 A group of ghostly faces suddenly appeared around sun Yifei.
 Sun Yifei was cleaning up the area under the broken bridge. As for the ghostly faces, he didn't seem to see them.
 Hao Kong, who was at the three yang realm, saw that sun Yifei didn't pay attention to him and said in a deep voice,""Senior Sun, are you still insistent on challenging Yuan Shuo to a duel?"  Sun Yifei swept away a big rock with his stick and looked at him,"is there a problem?"
 "No problem!"
 "However, I hope that you can show mercy and not kill Yuan Shuo," haokong said in a low voice."Otherwise, it's easy for Crimson Moon to have a conflict with the night patrollers at this stage."
 "Fists and feet have no eyes. Once you enter the arena, there's no need to talk about life and death! Whoever wants to show mercy will definitely be the one to die in the end!"
 Sun Yifei's words obviously meant rejection.
 "Senior, this is also the purple Moon leader's idea," Hao Kong said, suppressing his anger.
 "Purple Moon?"
 Sun Yifei turned around and looked at him. He smiled and said,"When the red moon was established, it was red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and the seventh moon hung high in the sky! In my eyes, there's only that little girl from back then ... Later on, she died, and the one who inherits her now is just a good-for-nothing, and you're using her to threaten me?"
 As soon as he said that, his powers surged.
 Many of the grimace superpowers were enraged.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Regardless of whether she was truly angry or not, Purple Moon was their leader in Silver Moon. Now that she had been humiliated, if she did not get angry now and her leader found out, she would not have a good ending.
 Sun Yifei glanced at Hao Kong and laughed,"Stay away from me. I'm a little disgusted ... After Ying Hongyue established the Crimson Moon sect, I can't see through her more and more ... Especially those things around you. Although I can't see them, I can still sense them a little ... Don't come too close to me. Otherwise, I want to beat you to death and catch one to see if I can eat those things."
 Hao Kong's expression changed again.
 After a long while, he said in a deep voice,"in that case, please do as you wish, senior!" However, once we enter the ruins, I hope senior won't act on your own initiative. We have our own arrangements and don't want senior to ruin the whole plan. "
 "We'll see!"
 Sun Yifei smiled and waved his hand as if he wanted to drive them away.
 Hao Kong didn't say anything else. He and the ghostly faces disappeared from where they were. A moment later, they were hundreds of meters away. They stood on a protruding cliff. They were obviously not going to leave but to watch the battle.
  After a while, a group of men in Black appeared. They were all wearing cloaks and chose to watch the battle from a cliff.
 Sun Yifei glanced over and knew that they were from Feitian.
 The people of the red moon liked to wear ghost masks. Of course, he was also a member of the red moon, but no one forced him to wear it.
 The people of Fei Tian liked to wear black clothes and cloaks, and their actions were even stranger than the red moon.
 As for the Yama's people, there were not many who could cover their faces. However, those guys from the Yama had a strong murderous aura. Among the three major organizations, the Yama might be the one who liked to kill the most, and it was a bloody killing.
 As he was thinking, in the distance, a group of murderous guys also climbed up a cliff. The cliff was not prominent enough, so these people directly smashed the stone wall. Some earth element experts even directly created a prominent cliff.
 The people from the three major organizations had all arrived.
 They came quickly, but the others were not slow.
 In less than a few minutes, the two local mid-sized organizations also sent people.
 The people from the island of light were all dressed in white. There were quite a number of women. They drove a flying ship over. It wasn't a flying ship, but an extraordinary item. It was just that it wasn't an origin divine weapon.

 These people directly made the Flying Ship float in the air and fixed it in the air, looking down at the ground. It was quite eye-catching.
 On the swords gate's side, Hong Yitang flew over with a long sword on his back, he cupped his hands and said,""Brother Sun!"
 Sun Yifei turned his head and looked at him. He didn't ignore him anymore, but he sneered,"Hong Yitang, back then, you were one of the last few among the Seven Swords. I didn't expect that you're living so well among the Seven Swords now that the others are dead!"
 Hong Yitang didn't get angry, but he sighed.""Maybe I value my life more."
 After he finished speaking, he looked at his disciples and nodded slightly.""The disciples that Brother Sun brought this time feel pretty good. After this battle, if there's a chance, we can let the young people spar more."
 Sun Yifei followed his line of sight and saw a young woman behind him. Her eyes were sharp, and she had the style of a swordsman.
 He carried a long sword on his back, which was different from the usual superhuman outfit.
 "Have you comprehended Shi?"
 "Not yet,"
 Hong Yitang shook his head and said regretfully,"Shi is difficult to comprehend. The path of Martial Master has declined mainly because of this!"
  Sun Yifei nodded, but he didn't say anything. He thought for a while and said, "There's no need to pick a day! Hong Xiu, you and this little girl will have a spar later!"
 Hong Yitang was surprised and looked at sun Yifei's female disciple.
 Sun Yifei said calmly,"Hongxiu is in the late-stage of breaking 100, and your daughter should be the same, right?" She looks like your daughter, but I feel that she's stronger than you. You didn't have that drive back then!"
 "It's my daughter, Hong Qing. Call her Uncle Sun!"
 Hong Qing quickly stepped forward and cupped his hands in greeting."Uncle Sun!"
 "Don't be so polite, it's useless! I don't think your father is good enough. Don't learn from him and don't dare to accept the challenge. "
 Hong Qing was a little embarrassed, but Hong Yitang was free and easy.""If I had accepted the challenge, I might not be here now. Brother Sun, I'm not as good as him. Why should I trouble myself?"
 "Trash!"
 Sun Yifei cursed and laughed,"But that's right, at least you have some self-awareness!"
 Hong Yitang looked at his two remaining disciples and asked,""Brother Sun, are you going to follow the rules?"
 "I can 't?"
 "No, but Yuan ... Yuan Shuo's disciple doesn't seem to be with him. He only has a young disciple whom he had taken in a few years ago. He used to study literature, then martial arts. It has been less than three years since then."
 He meant, who's up on your side?
 Sun Yifei didn't want to talk to him. "What do you know?"
 He waved his hand impatiently."Get out of the way. I don't have time to catch up with you!"
 Hong Yitang laughed, he didn't say anything and brought his daughter to the swords gate.
 After walking for a while, sun Yifei suddenly said,"Later, Hongxiu and your daughter will hold an opening ceremony for everyone! You don't have any objections, do you?"
 Hong Yitang's expression changed slightly. It wasn't because the opening was bad, but under normal circumstances, the opening was only the appetizer of a Martial master's spar. The brutal part came later, and so did the powerful part.
 What did that mean?
 He thought that sun Yifei would send his tenth realm disciple to fight against Yuan Shuo's disciple.
 However, that was obviously not what he meant.
 Instead, he sent his eldest disciple up!
 With some doubts, he didn't ask further and nodded.""Sure!"
 "Mm, that's good!"
 Sun Yifei laughed. After they left, he looked at his female disciple,"I can't bring you here for nothing. Hong Yitang's daughter isn't weak, she's on par with you. It just so happens that you've met your match, so she's the most suitable! Don't underestimate her. Although I don't like her father, there are no weaklings in the Silvermoon Seven Swords! "Hong Yitang is known as the earth overturning sword. With one sword, he can overturn the heavens and earth. His daughter is also a swordsman, so she won't be weak. Among martial masters, swordsmen are still very strong ..."
 Hong Xiu nodded, but she was a little hesitant."Master, what about senior brother?"
 "His opponent is that Li Hao! You and Hong Yitang's daughter should focus on sparring, just treat it as sparring from the same sect ..."
 After he finished speaking, he looked at sun moxian,"you and Li Hao don't need to worry about anything. It's the battlefield!" You've been on the battlefield before. Even if he can't block a single move, you won't regret it. If you kill him, it's because the other party is weak!"
 Sun moxian heavily nodded!
 At this moment, a group of people walked over from afar.
 The night patrolmen had arrived!
 Sun Yifei saw that person from far away, that old acquaintance who he had been thinking about for many years.
 At this moment, sun Yifei stood up straight.
 "Yuan Shuo!"
 "Sun Yifei!"
 In the distance, Yuan Shuo also smiled like an old friend. He laughed and said,""Back then, I thought you were really dead. I didn't expect you to still be alive. I've attacked so many times, but not many people can survive my hands. I also want to see if I can still kill you after you've lived to this day!"  Sun Yifei laughed,"Then let's try! Yuan Shuo, I also want to see if you still have the demonic Qi that you had in the past after being a grandson for more than ten years! I had a good time killing in the central continent, but you must have had a good time hiding in Silver Moon, right?"
 Yuan Shuo chuckled but did not reply.
 Sun Yifei also stopped talking.
 Yuan Shuo waved his hand, gesturing for the others to step back. He then led Li Hao over to the other side.
 Under the broken bridge, hundreds of square meters of clean land had been cleared out. It was very smooth and there were no stones, making it stand out from the rest.
 "The old rules?"
 "Same old rules!"
 Their conversation was very straightforward.
 Yuan Shuo asked. When sun Yifei answered, he smiled and said,"We don't need to say anything! This is my disciple, Li Hao. Do you want to come at me all at once or one by one?"
 "No need, just ink strings will do!"
 "I'll set the venue and you set the rules. I'll say the same thing. Are we going to spar or fight?"sun Yifei said lightly.
 Sparring did not determine life and death.
 The competition ... Did not involve life and death!
 "You've become soft-hearted after killing so many people?"Yuan Shuo laughed.
 "I'm just afraid that if your disciple dies, you'll be disturbed!"
 "If that's the case, then let's have a competition!" Sun Yifei sneered.
 "That's good!"
 Yuan Shuo's expression remained the same as he glanced at Li Hao.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao nodded. On the other side, sun moxian also nodded.
 In an instant, the atmosphere was tense.
 At this moment, in the distance, Hong Yitang said,""Big brother Yuan, big brother Sun said to let my daughter and his female disciple open a venue. Big brother Yuan doesn't have any objections, right?“
 "Alright!" Yuan Shuo turned his head to take a look and smiled.
 Hong Yitang also revealed a smile. Even though he was already a three sun martial artist, he still felt a little guilty when facing two martial masters of the same generation.
 It wasn't that he felt that he was much weaker than them, but that he didn't have much confidence in front of them back then. Even today, he still didn't have much confidence.
 ……
 Yuan Shuo led Li Hao out of the circle and said in a low voice,""That's good. You observe that woman's moves. They're all passed down by the eyebrows-abrest stick, and the moves and secret techniques are similar. Although I believe that you can win ... You still have to be careful!"
 After saying that, he added,'when you're really unrivaled, then admit defeat. Don't force yourself! If you don't admit defeat, he'll kill you and I won't have a good ending!"
 Li Hao nodded.
 Yuan Shuo did not say anything else.
 Some things were not that simple.
 If they were really defeated and it was time for them to admit defeat, under the gazes of tens of thousands of people, the martial masters of the younger generation, who had comprehended force, would suffer a heavy blow to their force.
 There were records in ancient books that cultivated an invincible aura!
 During the cultivation period, if one was defeated, it would be the most unbearable failure for a Martial Master.
 Nine out of ten would eventually fall at the stage of force nurturing and might not be able to step into the Dou Qian class in their entire lives.
 In Silver Moon martial forest, Yuan Shuo and the others had contributed greatly to the fact that so many martial masters failed to enter the warrior Qian realm.
  They had been either killed or defeated by the few of them during the period of cultivation, so it would be strange if they could fight a thousand.
 After a while, Hong Qing walked over from the swords gate.
 Beside sun Yifei, his disciple, Hong Xiu, also walked out with a long stick in her hand.
 All the supers in the area turned their attention to him.
 Two of them had broken through 100!
 They were all in the late stage of breaking 100, which was equivalent to a battle between a Dark Moon and a full moon. Everyone was still very interested. The Dark Moon was the main force here, which was exactly what they could understand at their level.
 Many of them had never fought with a Martial Master before. At this moment, they were also looking forward to this battle to see how strong a Martial Master was.
 As soon as the two entered the circle, someone whispered,""So strong!"
 They didn't see anything, but as soon as the two entered the arena, their inner strength surged and brought with it a cool breeze. Some of the stones were lifted up, and some superpowers could still feel the power of a Martial Master.
 At this moment, Li Hao was also watching them carefully. He didn't underestimate them just because they were weaker than him.

 (I almost died from anger. Fortunately, it can still be opened after reboot.)
 "Swords gate, Hong Qing!"
 "Hongyue, sun Hongxiu!"
 There wasn't much small talk between martial masters.
 The two sides reported their origins. The next moment, Hong Qing drew his sword and stabbed. Smoke curled up, and the gravel on the ground rolled up, creating a huge stone Wave.
 "Break!"
 With a low shout, Hong Xiu struck the ground with her staff. The earth trembled and the ground trembled.
 In the smoke, Hong Xiu held a long stick and struck at Hong Qing.
 As the two women fought, they instantly entered a state of mind. They didn't probe each other too much. Their realms and abilities were similar, so it would depend on their experience and performance.
 Sword light shot out and the long staff danced.
  The fight was very fierce!
 The nearby Dark Moon supers were dazzled by the sight.
 ……
 On the night patrolmen's side.
 "Amazing!" Someone gasped."Why do I feel like he's much stronger than the martial masters we've met before?"
 Why?
 This was because he was a Martial Master with a real master, not a half-baked one.
 Be it his secret skills or his physical condition, he was at his peak.
 This kind of Martial Master couldn't be compared to those half-baked martial masters who opened martial arts dojos. This kind of secret technique couldn't be learned anywhere.
 At this moment, on the field.
 Hong Xiu brandished her eyebrow-length staff and quickly approached Hong Qing. The next moment, the long sword and the long staff collided with each other, making clanking sounds and sparks flying.
 The battle between two late-stage martial masters in the 100th stage was not a small scene.
 The field that sun Yifei cleaned up instantly became full of potholes.
 Outside the stadium.
 Someone suddenly exclaimed.
 At this moment, Hong Qing's sword pierced through the eyebrow-level stick. Seeing that it was about to Pierce the opponent's throat, sun Hongxiu's eyes revealed a touch of coldness, and the long stick quickly turned.
 Like a meat grinder, the long stick spun rapidly and directly wrapped around Hong Qing's long sword and right hand, trying to break her right hand.
 It was obvious that sun Hongxiu had deliberately revealed a flaw.
 The two women fought with extreme ruthlessness.
 Many superpowers held their breath and some of them even looked worried that the two of them would be injured.
 ……
 In the direction of the night patrolman.
 Liu Long, Wang Ming, and Liu Yan were also watching the battle.
 Wang Ming was also watching intently, as if he was very excited. After watching for a while, he turned his head to see that Liu Long and Liu Yan were expressionless, so he couldn't help but ask curiously,"Why aren't you guys nervous?"
 Liu Long's face was expressionless, and after a long while, he spat out a few words, "It's just an opening sparring session, it looks good!"
 What did that mean?
 Wang Ming was puzzled."It's already so brutal. Look, that Hong Qing's arm's about to be twisted off. How can it still look good?"
 From his point of view, this battle represented the power of martial masters, and also the danger of fighting between martial masters.
 It was very exciting!  "Captain Liu, what do you think?" he turned to Liu Yan.
 Liu Long was too strong, and it was normal for a douqian Martial Master to look down on him. But what about Liu Yan?
 Liu Yan glanced at him and paused for a moment before saying, "They're sparring!"
 Wang Ming silently understood the meaning behind it.
 Did this mean that Liu Yan also felt that this seemingly dangerous and brutal competition was just so-so?
 After a long while, Wang Ming said,"this is already the most formidable martial arts competition I've ever seen. Look, there's the sound of a sword, the sound of a cudgel breaking through the air, the rolling of gravel, the cracking of the ground ... It just looks dangerous. Minister Liu, a true Martial Master, shouldn't you be like this?"
 "You'll see him soon!"Liu Long said calmly.
 "Teacher Yuan and sun Yifei?"
 "Not necessarily!"
 Liu Long didn't say much. Who said that Li Hao couldn't bring you a real battle of martial masters?
 He didn't have much experience in fighting, but Liu Long and Li Hao had fought many times. Li Hao had the style of a Martial Master, and if sun Yifei's disciple was also a real Martial Master, then today, the crowd might be able to see the most exciting battle under the thousand-man sword.
 ……
 On the field.
 The battle continued, and it looked particularly dangerous.
 The surrounding supers were screaming as if they were dying.
 ……
 In the inner circle.
 Sun Yifei frowned. Although he had said that this was just a friendly match, he still wasn't satisfied.
 He looked at sun moxian, who was beside him, and said softly,""How do you feel?"
 Sun moxian looked at it for a while, then chuckled,""Not bad, Junior sister's Foundation is very solid."
 "And then?"
 Sun moxian was silent. There was no "then".
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Just like this.
 He played pretty well and had a solid foundation. What else could he do?
 Sun Yifei laughed when he saw that Jiang Chen didn't say anything.
 Very good!
 It should be like this, and it was indeed like this. Other than playing pretty well and having a solid foundation, there was indeed nothing remarkable about it.
 Of course, sun Hongxiu's experience was not as good as sun moxian 's. Furthermore, she did not have much experience in killing enemies. It was already not bad that she could fight to this extent.
  It would not be a problem to deal with normal superpowers.
 Didn't you see the exclamations of the surrounding superpowers?
 Sun Yifei sneered. He didn't mean to pick on anyone, but he despised all the supers who weren't martial masters. They were all trash!
 The battle continued.
 However, sun Yifei and sun moxian were no longer interested in watching. Both master and disciple looked at Yuan Shuo and Li Hao in the distance.
 ……
 At this moment, Li Hao and Yuan Shuo also looked in their direction.
 Their gazes met instantly.
 Li Hao smiled shyly and quickly lowered his head.
 On the other hand, Yuan Shuo sneered at sun Yifei.

 The four of them quickly retracted their gazes.
 Yuan Shuo said in a low voice,"that sun moxian isn't someone to be trifled with. You can tell from his posture and his eyes that he's a Martial Master!" Don't treat his Junior sister's strength as his. "
 "Yes, I know."
 Li Hao nodded.
 He wouldn't look down on his opponent. He would only fight him as his Captain ... And in his last battle, when his Captain almost killed him.
 Before the battle, he wanted to gather his sword power.
 When it came to a real battle, there was only one goal. The goal of a Martial Master was very simple-kill the enemy!
 After killing the other party, as for the rest, he could let it go.
 The master and disciple were whispering to each other. In the arena, there were constant shouts.
 In the next moment, a huge collision sound was heard.
  With two muffled bangs, Hong Qing was hit in the heart by the staff. He flew backward and spat out blood. He fell heavily on the ground, and the ground cracked a little.
 Sun Hongxiu was not in a good state either. Her arm had been pierced by a sword, and blood gushed out. She held the long staff and retreated dozens of steps before she could regain her footing. She panted heavily, but her eyes revealed a touch of pride!
 She had won!
 Although she was injured, it was true that she had won. The eyebrows-length staff had defeated the earth-covered sword.
 "I've lost!"
 Hong Qing spat out a mouthful of blood and was a little dejected. At least she had a place in the Silver Moon martial forest.
 She had challenged some of the older generation of martial masters and had won more than lost.
 Therefore, she had always felt that she was still very powerful in the path of Martial Master.
 However, one of Qi Mei staff King's disciples, who had the same strength as her, had defeated her in a spar. This made Hong Qing feel a little uncomfortable.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com In the distance, Hong Yitang didn't say anything.
 It was normal to win, and it was normal to lose.
 The disciple of Qi Mei staff King was naturally not ordinary.
 Although his overhand sword was strong, he did not have an undeserved reputation. If he was defeated, then so be it. He had not yet condensed his Shi, so the impact was not too great. It was good to fail once, so that his daughter would know that there was always someone better.
 "Big brother Sun is still good at teaching disciples. This Hong is willing to admit defeat!"
 Hong Yitang said politely and waved at his daughter. Hong Qing walked down with his sword in disappointment.
 When he passed by Li Hao, he suddenly whispered,""Don't you lose! Our Silver Moon martial forest has already lost a match. If we lose again ... It'll be embarrassing!"
 After saying that, she left, still hoping that Li Hao would win.
 After all, Li Hao was a member of Silver Moon martial forest. As for that sun moxian, who knew where he came from? in any case, he was not a member of Silver Moon, and his master had long since left Silver Moon.
 ……
 Li Hao was somewhat baffled.
 However, he didn't pay much attention to it. After thinking for a while, he suddenly said,""That ... Can you lend me your sword for a moment?"
 He recalled that he only had the starry sky sword.
 However, there were too many people present. The starry sky sword was too sharp and wasn't suitable to be exposed. The others didn't have any good swords either. This woman's sword, on the other hand, was really good. Li Hao had seen it before. When it pierced through the rock, it felt like the sword was still intact.
 Good sword!
 "A sword?"
  Hong Qing was stunned for a moment. Wasn't he a disciple of the five bird Kings?  The five bird Kings were skilled in fist, palm, and claw techniques, but they were not skilled in the sword!
 Although she thought about it, she still handed the sword to Li Hao.
 For the glory of Silver Moon martial forest!
 In the distance, Hong Yitang frowned slightly and sighed. His daughter ... Was too innocent.
 This was not good!
 If Li Hao used this sword to defeat or even kill sun moxian, he might get into some trouble for no reason.
 Of course, sun Yifei didn't care.
 However, Hong Yitang was used to being cautious. He was a little displeased at this moment, but he quickly covered it up. Forget it, he had already borrowed it. If he took it back, he would offend Yuan Shuo before sun Yifei.
 ……
 Li Hao took the sword and flicked it. He smiled when he heard the crisp sound of the sword.
 Good sword!
 He had taken off his coat. At this moment, he was wearing a tank top and leather boots issued by the inspection Office. He looked out of place.
 But Li Hao didn't care about this.
 On the opposite side, sun moxian also took out the long staff on his back and nodded at Li Hao. The two of them walked to the center at the same time.
 "I'm sun moxian, a disciple of the eyebrow-level staff King!"
 "I'm Li Hao, a disciple of the five beast Kings!"
 Both sides were very polite when they went on stage.
 The spectating supers were still lamenting the end of Hong Qing's battle.
 At this moment, another person spoke in a loud voice,""It's said that Li Hao has only joined the sect a few years ago and has been practicing martial arts for less than three years. Is he going to die?"
 "It's a pity. That was an exciting match, but it wasn't a loss. At least I got to see an exciting battle between martial masters!"
 Some of the superpowers were chatting and felt that this battle was not very interesting.
 It was definitely not as explosive as the previous match.
 On the field.
 Li Hao and sun moxian looked at each other, but they didn't pay attention to anyone.
  At this moment, they only had each other in their eyes.
 Li Hao's eyes were solemn. This was the first time he had truly fought with an expert who had achieved the 100th level. It was not a friendly match, but a battle of life and death.
 This time, it wasn't a sneak attack, but a head-on battle.
 He inserted his long sword into the ground. He was not in a hurry to use his sword, but instead, he assumed the posture of the five birds technique.
 In sun moxian's eyes, there was only Li Hao.
 He held the long staff in his hand. At this moment, he raised the long staff and the two of them looked at each other. For a moment, they did not make a move, but were looking for an opportunity.
 Outside the arena, after waiting for a while, someone became impatient when he saw that the two had not started fighting.
 "Hurry up and start!"
 "Are you playing? Two men, looking at each other, and falling in love?"
 Most of them were from small organizations, while there were fewer from large organizations. People from large organizations had a clear hierarchy. If the higher-ups didn't say anything, the lower-ups generally didn't dare to speak.

 At that moment, Yuan Shuo stomped his foot lightly.
 On the ground, a stone was broken into seven or eight pieces and shot out!
 The speed was shocking!
 Bang Bang Bang ... In the blink of an eye, half of the seven or eight supers who had been clamoring were killed on the spot!
 This move instantly shocked everyone!
 The remaining few didn't die. They were all blocked by experts. These people were about to get angry when a long stick came down from the sky. With a loud bang, the long stick was mixed with violent flames!
 One of the sun glory powerhouses was smashed into powder by the rod and disappeared from the world instantly!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The surroundings instantly fell silent.
 The rock was hit by Yuan Shuo.
 The long stick was thrown out by sun Yifei.
  The two experts didn't say anything and just continued to watch the battle.
 Meanwhile, the outside was frighteningly quiet.
 In the distance, Hong Yitang had already left with his men. Seeing this, he sneered. Forget about the previous sparring, but now, it's a life-and-death battle between their favorite disciples. You guys are still talking. If I don't beat you to death, I, Hong Yitang, will suspect that the two of them have changed!
 If you dare to talk nonsense again, these two guys might just slaughter you guys first, then decide your life and death.
 He knew the style of these guys too well, because he was actually one of them back then.
 At this moment, many people swallowed their saliva.
 He was too strong and brutal!
 With just a few words, the two of them went on a killing spree, killing seven to eight Dark Moon supers in an instant. They even killed a sun glory expert, who was the top of the Silver Moon supers.
 As for the three suns, they were elusive existences. They were only seen more often this time, and were rarely seen on normal days.
 While they were shocked and angry, they were also afraid.
 Sunlight ... Couldn't even block the staff from the other side!
 It was too terrifying!
 ……
 At this moment, the two people in the arena moved.
 When Yuan Shuo and sun Yifei made their moves, they both felt each other's strange movements. This was their chance.
 Soundlessly, the Tiger's claws dug out the heart!
 He grabbed with great force, and in an instant, a long stick was aimed at his head. Li Hao dodged and roared, his roar shaking the sky!
 The moment the staff stopped moving, Li Hao's claw struck out. With a pfft, blood and flesh flew everywhere.
 The staff, which had been frozen in time, suddenly came down, as if it was only meant to dispel Li Hao's hesitation.
 "Ha!"
 Li Hao roared. He stomped on the ground, raised his hand, and grabbed the staff. The staff fell and hit his head with a bang. Blood splattered, but Li Hao had already caught the staff with both hands, not letting the eyebrow-raising staff fall completely.  Li Hao's face was stained with blood, but he was fearless.
 He grabbed the eyebrows-abrest rod with both hands and stomped on the ground. He used all his strength and the bear fighting technique exploded. Like a giant bear, he followed the long rod and hammered down at his opponent's hands!
 Sun moxian's long rod trembled, and the force of the vibration spread over.
 His inner strength exploded like a blade, instantly leaving a bloody mark on Li Hao's hand. Li Hao still followed the long rod and hammered down. With a loud bang, sun moxian shouted and pulled out his long rod. He hit the ground with the rod, directly shattering the stones on the ground. The shattered stones shot out in all directions.
 The two of them were very fast.
 The others had yet to recover from the scene of those people being killed, but the two had already exchanged dozens of moves. Li Hao scratched the other's chest, while sun moxian split Li Hao's scalp with a blow of his staff.
 The moment the staff came down, Li Hao moved close to him like a wave.
 He punched and kicked at the opponent's feet on the ground.
 The rocks were shattered into pieces again!
 Smoke once again filled the air. In the midst of the sand and rocks, Li Hao's five birds technique was used to the extreme. The other party was also proficient in fists and legs. Although his staff was long, it was still agile. He whipped it and struck!
 With a bang, Li Hao's chest was hit by the stick. With a crack, it was as if his bones had been broken.
 Li Hao's fingers were like swords. He grabbed his opponent's wrist again, and a large piece of flesh was torn out!
 The two of them retreated.
 In the blink of an eye, he advanced again. Li Hao leaped into the air and kicked out. In the blink of an eye, a long staff appeared under his feet. The staff was like a spear, and this strike seemed to be going to pierce through Li Hao!
 Li Hao's legs were so agile that they didn't seem human.
 It looked like a snake's tail ... Or a monkey's tail!
 His leg was wrapped around the long rod, and his whole body, in an unbelievable posture, directly wrapped around the long rod and fell down. He waved his fist, punching toward sun moxiian. His inner force exploded, and the sound of explosions rang out.
 Sun moxian waved his long staff and smashed it down on the ground!
 As for Li Hao, he was like a shadow, like a monkey. His whole body was wrapped around the staff, and his fists were waving, sometimes in the shape of claws, sometimes in the shape of fists, making loud rumbles.
 The attention of the people outside was also quickly attracted.
  Li Hao, who was wrapped around the eyebrow-raising stick, kept attacking along the stick. For a time, he kept scratching out flesh and blood. As for himself, he was also smashed to the ground by the stick and was covered in blood.
 Was it beautiful?
 No!
 There wasn't the slightest bit of beauty from the previous battle between the two, only violence!
 It was an unspeakable violence!
 Blood and flesh flew everywhere, and sand and stone flew in all directions.
 The sound of bones cracking and flesh being crushed ...
 At this moment, the surroundings were frighteningly quiet. It wasn't just because of the warning just now, but also because of the bloody scene. They didn't have the heart to discuss anything. They could only immerse themselves in the tension.
 This was a life-and-death battle!
 At that moment, the supers seemed to understand the difference between this battle and the previous one.

 Before this, although the two of them had also used dangerous moves, they had too many concerns. They did not attack the lower part of the body, did not break the throat, did not stab the heart, did not ruthlessly dig out the heart, and did not violently smash the head with the rod!
 Martial masters were Born to Kill.
 Not attacking the weak points but focusing on the strong points, was this still a Martial Master?
 ……
 Beside Hong Yitang, Hong Qing clenched his fists and watched intently.
 Hong Yitang also watched silently. At this moment, he seemed to recall the past. Back then, Silver Moon martial forest was just like this. Blood was spilled on the stage, and blood must be killed!
 What sparring?
 It didn't exist!
 Today, the rise of superpowers and the decline of martial masters seemed to be a scene that had not been seen in a long time.
 ……
  In the distance.
 Sun Yifei's expression was serious, and sun Hongxiu and her Little Junior Brother were also very nervous.
 "Shameless!"
 Sun Hongxiu gritted her teeth and shouted in a low voice. Pa! Sun Yifei slapped her directly, causing her to take a few steps back!
 Sun Hongxiu lowered her head and did not dare to speak.
 Sun Yifei didn't say anything either. The reason he beat this disciple was that Li Hao's claw had almost hit his crotch. Even so, sun moxian's pants still tore open, and blood dripped down.
 Shameless?
 He was shameless!
 Other people could say it, but sun Yifei's disciple couldn 't!
 This was a life-and-death battle. If even his disciple felt that such a move was shameless, how could he still be a Martial Master?
 All the martial masters in the eyes of outsiders were dead!
 Which of the surviving martial masters didn't go through this?
 Things like gouging at the crotch and grabbing at the heart were all normal. A true Martial Master could withstand these tests, but those who couldn't would die. When they died, there was naturally no need to say anything.
 Sun Yifei looked on silently.
 This was just the beginning.
 His disciple's Shi had yet to explode out.
 ……
 In the arena, sun moxian let out a low growl and swung his staff in all directions, causing Li Hao to continuously jump around like an ape!
 Sun moxian gasped for breath. At this moment, his body was already covered in blood, and his clothes were dyed red.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, was covered in dust.
 One of his legs seemed to have some twists and turns. It seemed that the bone in his leg had been broken when he had been swept by the staff earlier.
 At this moment, Li Hao's expression changed.
 Sun moxian, who was opposite him, looked at him coldly and thrust his rod into the ground,""I've already demonstrated the five birds technique and the eyebrow-level stick. Shouldn't I be more serious?"
 As soon as these words came out, there was some commotion around, but no one dared to speak.
 More serious?
 Li Hao took a few steps back and pulled out his sword from the ground. He smiled.""My master is famous for the five bird technique. If I don't fully display the intricacies of the five bird technique, I can't say that I'm a disciple of the five bird King!"
 Sun moxian didn't say anything and pulled out his long rod!
 At this moment, a surge of power surged over!
 The smoke that filled the sky instantly dissipated!
  Li Hao sensed it, and his eyes flickered."Earth?"  Yes, the earth!
 At this moment, he felt the fluctuations of the earth. His opponent had actually comprehended Earth Force. This was too much of a coincidence. If his teacher hadn't made him comprehend sword force, Li Hao would have also used Earth Force.
 He didn't expect that the disciple of the eyebrows-abrest stick had comprehended Earth Force.
 However, he was slightly different from Li Hao.
 What Li Hao felt was Majesty, the majesty of the earth!
 A long staff seemed to be connected to the earth. The power of the earth covered the long staff. With one strike, the earth seemed to be jumping for joy!
 "Kill!"
 At the same time, sun moxian's aura changed. He was like a veteran on the battlefield. With a single strike, no matter who was in front of him, he would die!
 The long staff was like a spear, exquisite and powerful.
 Sun moxian, who used force, was more than a level stronger than before.
 Before the staff could land on the ground, the ground had already cracked.
 At this moment, Li Hao's eyes were as sharp as swords!
 Earth?
 Very good, I like it.
 The long sword struck out, and the inner strength was like a sword!
 A sword light flickered silently and disappeared in an instant. Like a shadow, Li Hao disappeared in an instant and reappeared in an instant, stabbing his opponent's throat.
 "Shadowless Sword!"
 At this moment, sun Yifei slowly said a few words and looked at Yuan Shuo with cold eyes."This old man is good at the five animal technique, but he taught his disciple the Shadowless Sword. This is unexpected."
 The battle at this moment seemed to be sun moxian's battle alone.
 The long staff broke through the air, incomparably powerful.
 Li Hao's sword, on the other hand, was barely audible.
 His entire body was like a shadow, rapidly closing in and rapidly retreating.
 When he struck out with his sword, he missed and instantly retreated.
 The Shadowless Sword was like that, like an assassin.
 The two sides were entangled again, the long stick struck one after another, and water couldn't get in.
 Li Hao's sword couldn't Pierce it either.
 In the next moment, sun moxian suddenly let out a roar. The ground split open, and the surroundings caved in. Li Hao's figure instantly appeared. In the blink of an eye, a long staff descended on him, one aimed directly at Li Hao's head.
 ? The earth Force was showing its effect.
  Without a sound, the ground around them cracked, and Li Hao's whereabouts were revealed.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Kill!"
 "Break!" Sun moxian shouted again. His staff seemed to be able to shatter the space. Before the staff could even touch the surrounding rocks, they had already been shattered and shot out.
 At this moment, Li Hao was in danger!
 This staff had split the ground apart, which was also out of his expectations. It was even more powerful than he had expected.
 This time, his legs left the ground and he felt a little uncomfortable.
 When the other party's staff fell, it was even more terrifying.
 As for Li Hao, he still didn't use Earth Force. Even if he did, he might not be able to do it in time.
 Since that was the case ...
 The next moment, a sword light burst out. In the blink of an eye, there was a second, a third ...

 Ninth refinement force!
 In that instant, he completed the change in his breathing technique. The more he was at this moment, the calmer he became. Li Hao had actually used another secret technique at such a critical moment.
 "Slash!"
 Li Hao slashed with his sword, and six sword energies instantly overlapped.
 The long sword slashed out!
 Boom! Boom! Boom!
 There was no clear sound of collision, only the sound of violent collision.
 Li Hao was struck down by the staff. He stomped on the ground with both feet. Although he was stuck in the ground, he was still extremely violent. He stomped on the ground and used all his strength to slash his sword. With a clatter, the long sword cut along the staff!
 Hurry up!
 It was extremely fast!
  Sun moxian's expression changed slightly."What great strength."
 He let go of the long rod in his right hand. Otherwise, this sword would have cut off all his fingers.
 The moment he let go of the stick, Li Hao grabbed it and violently stabbed him. With a loud bang, sun moxian's chest was pierced by the stick. His bones were broken, and he spat out a mouthful of blood!
 And this mouthful of blood happened to be spurting towards Li Hao.
 Li Hao also spat out an air sword!
 Bang! Bang!
 Blood and gas exploded in the air.
 The surrounding people were dazzled by the sight.
 They all held their breaths. At this moment, they all understood that both sides had reacted too quickly. If they were not careful, one of them would have died.
 Especially Li Hao!
 In mid-air, it suddenly exploded ...
 Only Liu Long and a few others knew how dangerous it was. Even Liu Long was sweating nervously. That moment was too fast. If Li Hao couldn't complete the breathing technique and burst out six times of stacking force, he wouldn't be able to block that stick!
 "Good boy!"
 Liu Long's heart trembled. Li Hao had already completed the sixth fold of the ninth-form force. More importantly, in that instant, Li Hao had actually completed the transformation of his breathing technique. How calm could he be?
 According to the time and common sense, there should be hope of completing it.
 However, that required absolute calm.
 This kid, was he born for the martial Dao?
 Who could remain so calm in the face of death?
 If he made a slight mistake, he would be struck to death by the staff. Wasn't he afraid?
 ……
 On the field, Li Hao used the ninth refinement force and instantly reversed the situation.
 He had injured sun moxian with a single strike.
 The next moment, the two of them were entangled once again. Even though sun moxian used force and Li Hao didn 't, he was still not suppressed by the other party. Only now did he feel Li Hao's strength.
 He had strengthened his five internal organs, a strong body, the nine-refinements force, and many other secret techniques. All of these had balanced out the difference in their force.
 His body's ability to take a beating was too strong!
 Even sun Yifei could only frown when he saw it from afar.
 Under normal circumstances, even if the other party was able to withstand sun moxian's strike, his internal organs would still bleed and shatter.
 However, the inner organs of Yuan Shuo, the last disciple, were too strong!
  He was actually fine!  This shouldn't have happened!
 He looked at Yuan Shuo and Yuan Shuo looked back at him with a smug expression. His lips moved slightly,""So what if it's Shi? The breathing technique of five birds was unparalleled in the world! Martial masters don't have any weaknesses. Their five internal organs are still their strong points!"
 Sun Yifei was silent.
 He looked at the stage. At this moment, he had less confidence in sun moxian.
 Even if Li Hao didn't show any signs of force and looked like he was comprehending sword force, his disciple couldn't gain the upper hand at all with the nine refinements force, Shadowless Sword, five birds technique, and his powerful internal organs.
 Earlier, when the two of them were warming up, he thought that Li Hao would stop here. It seemed that he had underestimated Yuan Shuo, and even more so his disciple.
 ……
 On the field.
 Li Hao and sun moxian's fists and legs clashed. Both sides once again fought until blood and flesh flew everywhere. Li Hao retreated, and sun moxian also retreated a few steps. Both of them were somewhat serious.
 Li Hao's head was still bleeding.
 The blood on sun moxian's body had almost dried up. He clutched the long rod tightly again, and his blood had also dyed the long rod red.
 Li Hao also grabbed the sword that had been stabbed into the ground. With a smile, he drew his sword and attacked again!
 The pressure did not seem to be big enough!
 In his mind, the sword that day appeared again.
 He drew his sword!
 Break me!
 Kill the enemy!
 Sun moxian's expression changed. With a violent roar, he struck out with his long staff. In a row, he struck out dozens of times. Bang Bang Bang ...
 The staff and the sword were both treasures.
 At this moment, under Li Hao's sword-wielding, cracks appeared on the staff and the sword.
 The next moment, there was a loud boom!
 The sword and the long stick exploded into pieces!
 Countless fragments shot out!

 Wang Ming's eyes flickered when he saw a shard shooting toward him. He was also very serious at the moment as he reached out to grab the sword shard. The next moment, his expression changed slightly, and a pair of Golden Gloves suddenly appeared on his palm.
 That was his metal-elemental energy.
  Creak!
 With an ear-piercing sound, the sword fragments mixed with some sword Qi directly cut the Golden Glove in half. Drip, drip, drip ... Blood flowed out of his hand.
 Wang Ming didn't have his usual joking and scolding attitude, only solemness and heaviness.
 I'm riyao!
 These were just the fragments of the weapons that had been shot out by the two of them. While he tried to block it, it had actually cut through his mystical energy defense and injured his palm, almost cutting it off.
 He ignored the pain and silently looked at the wound on his palm. It was deep into his bones!
 At this moment, Wang Ming seemed to be a little absent-minded.
 Some of the surrounding experts also moved to block the fragments.
 Some supers wanted to try.
 A Dark Moon superpower tried to burn the fragment with fire in his hand. However, the fragment pierced through the superpower as if it had no defense and shattered the man's head!
