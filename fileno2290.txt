However ... Before he could say anything, a man walked out of the energy mass produced by the self-explosion like an ancient giant. His hand covered the sky, and at this moment, he was like a giant bear reaching out to grab the other party!He instantly grabbed the other party into his arms!Like an adult holding a child, Li Hao wrapped his arms around the man's neck and grinned.BOOM!It directly exploded!In an instant, the bodies of the Nine Saints exploded!The longsword pierced through the air. BOOM! Screams of pain rang out as the Saints who had just gathered their spiritual energy were instantly killed on the spot!All of this happened too quickly.It was so fast that other than those who knew, everyone else was stunned.Only Zhang an and the others knew that the Saints had been so polite to him ... Precisely because they knew how powerful Li Hao was.But ... He was still shocked.Nine saints!In such a short time ... They were all killed!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In Hurricane city.Zheng Yu crushed the throne without saying a word. Behind him, the Heavenly Kings had extremely ugly expressions!He was dead!As soon as the Nine Saints left ... They were all killed by Li Hao.Clearly, Li Hao had been waiting for them. Zheng Yu smiled coldly.""Good move!"What a good method!It could actually create a clone of a peak Saint, passing off the fake as the real one. If this wasn't a good method, what was?Who would have thought that Li Hao could create such a clone?The dozens of saints in the city ... Had all been killed!BOOM!There was another boom, and a blood Saint was killed instantly. He couldn't wait for help.The remaining seven blood Saints were all pale.With the help of the Nine Saints, they had thought that they could turn the tide of the battle ... But in the end ... They were all killed in an instant?How strong was Li Hao?Nine saints!It would take some time to kill nine pigs, but ... Li Hao killed them as fast as he killed the pigs!"Good method, good method!"On the other side, Ying Hongyue forced Li Hao to retreat with a slash of her sword. She was a little gloomy and cold. "It's really good!"As for Li Hao himself, he floated in the air, looked over, and smiled.""Ying Hongyue, this is a good place. You haven't seen it yet!"Ying Hongyue was startled. Li Hao chuckled. At this moment, he stretched out his hand and made a grabbing motion. A person suddenly appeared in the air. When Ying Hongyue saw the other party's appearance, she instantly turned pale with fright!This might be the first time he was truly shocked!Even when Li Hao had killed nine saints ... He hadn't been this scared.That was because he still had the confidence."Li Hao!"Ying Hongyue's voice became a little shrill. Li Hao smiled playfully."Ying Hongyue, are you surprised? My true body is here. Guess ... Where I went before?""Impossible!"He wasn't the only one. The remaining seven blood Saints were all in danger of fighting one against two. However, at this moment, one blood Saint was still stunned. He let li Fuhai pass through his body and said with a blank expression,""Blue Moon?"He knew this woman!He also knew where the other party was.He also knew how many experts there were. There were a total of five Heavenly Kings, 12 Saints, and hundreds of undyings ...Then ... Why would Blue Moon appear here?Li Hao's huge palm pinched Qing Yue's head. Qing Yue struggled violently but couldn't speak. She could only look at Ying Hongyue with a pleading look in her eyes ... Run!Li Hao had killed all the experts in Thunderbolt city!He killed them all ... No, only I was left!Ying Hongyue's face was slightly flushed. She looked at Li Hao, gritted her teeth, and growled,"Let her go!"Li Hao chuckled and said,"Ying Hongyue ... Do you still care about a woman?" No, you don't care. What you care about is the possible consequences of her appearance here ... I think you will be satisfied!"With that, he tore through the void and an ancient city descended!At this moment, Ying Hongyue's body stiffened. Earlier, she still had some hope and thought that Li Hao had caught qingyue because she had rushed out rashly. Now, when this city appeared, she knew that everything had been destroyed by Li Hao!  Best novel online free at ùöó0ùöüùöéùöïùöãùöíùöó  The five Heavenly Kings were gone, and the entire lair was destroyed, not a single one was left!All of their foundations, everything ... Had been destroyed!How he did it was no longer important.The important thing was that he had schemed for decades, but in the end, all of it was gone.Ying Hongyue spurted out a mouthful of blood. She looked at Li Hao with a slightly flushed face and said in a soft voice,"Li Hao...You're forcing me, aren't you?"Li Hao laughed,"yeah!" I'm forcing you, so what? Come, continue to draw out some venerable sovereign power, or even turn it into his clone. I'll wait for you. Don't forget what the foundation of this city is. I've taken the red moon! Do you think that even if you fuse with more ... So what?"Ying Hongyue's expression changed drastically, and her voice suddenly became sharp."Impossible! That's impossible!"Yes, he knew.Venerable sovereign blood!It was impossible for Li Hao to take away the blood of venerable sovereigns!Absolutely impossible!At this moment, he was a little crazy. He had actually been planning for the blood, but he didn't dare to move, for fear that the other party would really take over his body. But now, Li Hao was telling him that he had taken the blood.This was even more shocking than killing five Heavenly Kings.Li Hao laughed. Seeing his somewhat crazy appearance, his smile was incomparably brilliant. Do you like this result?"

Then, he squeezed a little harder until Blue Moon bled all over. Ying Hongyue's eyes revealed a hint of fierceness. She instantly charged at Li Hao with her sword in hand. Her sword pierced through the void. This sword was extremely powerful, and it also contained an extremely violent Thunderbolt power!The other Li Hao, on the other hand, turned into a fierce tiger and blocked his way!Li Hao's smile was bright. With a boom, he crushed Blue Moon!At this moment, they suddenly released some restrictions and blue moon's voice sounded,"Red Moon ... I don't regret it ..." He said.Pfft!Ying Hongyue spurted out a mouthful of blood. Li Hao was so vicious!He knew that Blue Moon would say this the moment she released the restriction. He deliberately released the restriction before the other party died. He did it on purpose!He just wants to break my Dao heart!"Li Hao!"Ying Hongyue went mad. She let out a mournful roar and slashed out with her sword. It instantly turned into lightning and started a fierce battle with Li Hao's clone. In the blink of an eye, bloody wounds appeared on the clone's body.However, Li Hao's original body didn't care about him. Instead, he fell into the forbidden Sea and punched!BOOM!The forbidden Sea exploded, and with a wave of turbulence, Li Hao's voice resounded through the world.""Alright, stop pretending! I know you too well. Pretending to be a love-struck fool? You want to escape? You want to escape with the skeleton now, don't you? What are you thinking! I'm ... Your best friend! The person who understands you the most isn't your friend, but your enemy. Ying Hongyue, I understand you very well ... Don't you think so?"Boom! Boom! Boom!The forbidden Sea trembled violently, and an illusionary figure appeared. It was also the reflection of the red moon, but it was very illusionary. At this moment, it was about to enter the skeleton's body when it was punched out by Li Hao!Ying Hongyue, who was fighting Li Hao's clone, changed her expression again.This time, he became a little sinister!Li Hao!Li Hao!This B * stard, this bastard. Even at this moment, Li Hao was still on guard against him!Li Hao's smile was incomparably brilliant. He struck out with his sword and instantly pushed the shadow back. The long sword disappeared in an instant, and in the next second, with a boom, it exploded near a blood shadow. With a boom, the blood shadow was instantly compressed into a Blood God.Li Hao strolled leisurely and said with a smile,""You still have a chance to escape ... Draw in more power of the Crimson Moon, or completely merge your eight meridians ... You still have a chance after devouring all the bloodlines of the Yama and flying sword immortal! If you don't use your trump card ... You won't have the chance!"Flying sword immortal!At this moment, Zheng Yu suddenly looked at the flying sword immortal beside him, and the expressions of the other Heavenly Kings changed slightly.On the forbidden Sea, Ying Hongyue suddenly quieted down. She looked at Li Hao and smiled, but she was a little sad."Li Hao ... Not killing you might have been my biggest mistake!"He had too many trump cards!Thunder City, the forbidden Sea, the skeleton, the bloodline of the eight great families ...With so many trump cards, not to mention one Heavenly King, even three to five Heavenly Kings might be killed by him if they really wanted to kill him.But ... What was the result?As a result ... All his trump cards were removed by Li Hao bit by bit, and the people around him were almost all killed by Li Hao!  Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Blood Saints were dying one after another.Two, three, four ...Ying Hongyue smiled miserably. She knew that she had lost today. She had lost terribly!At this moment, he looked around, gritted his teeth, and smiled."Li Hao ... You win!"After she finished speaking, two bodies appeared in her hands. They couldn't be seen clearly, but they instantly shattered and fused into her body. Her eight bloodlines instantly merged into one and became extremely stable. Ying Hongyue's aura instantly skyrocketed!He was infinitely close to a Heavenly King!The eight great bloodlines had been stabilized, allowing him to break through some of the restrictions of heaven and earth. This heaven and earth ... Was closely related to the eight great families. With the eight great bloodlines merged into one, his aura rose all the way up. With the Crimson Moon Power merging into his body, he extracted countless energy from the forbidden Sea!In the blink of an eye, he seemed to have broken through to the critical point. With a loud boom, the power of a Heavenly King swept through the world!Ying Hongyue's expression wasn't good, and her eyes were very dark!Heavenly King?Early Heavenly King?Was this what he was after?Naturally not!Reaching the sky in one step and becoming a half-step sovereign was his plan. But now ... He had become an unstable Heavenly King. What was the use of that?What could a Heavenly King change?Meanwhile, in Hurricane city, Zheng Yu frowned slightly. At this moment, he had put aside the death of the Nine Saints. He just looked into the distance silently and fell into deep thought. These two people ... Had more cards up their sleeves than he had imagined!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, the Queen turned around and ran.A bunch of terrifying lunatics!He had thought that Saints were invincible, but dozens of them died so easily. If he didn't run now, he would be captured by Li Hao after the battle.Run first!It was too terrifying!Nine saints had been killed in an instant, and Ying Hongyue had become a Heavenly King. Li Hao was probably no weaker than a Heavenly King ...This battle was no longer a battle between Saints.It was a battle between Heavenly Kings!The blood Saints were almost all dead. Li Fuhai and the others all ran to help Zhang an suppress the skeleton. With more than a dozen Saints working together, even a true Heavenly King would be useless!The king of Dali had been dumbfounded for a long time. At this moment, he was wearing his boxing gloves and looking at Jiang Li face to face!Compared to these people ... The two of them were no different from fools!From the beginning to the end, he was just a bystander!Whether it was anxiety, nervousness, fear, or excitement ... It seemed that there were only emotional changes, and they couldn't interfere at all. In the end, a total of 17 Saints had died!

That's right, all eight blood Saints were killed!Only the skeleton and Ying Hongyue were still there!This battle ... The king of Dali had no idea what was going on at all. A group of Saints had died in such a muddle-headed way!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Ying Hongyue's aura became more and more powerful, and Li Hao, who was originally blocking her, disappeared in an instant. The next moment, he merged into Li Hao's body.Li Hao held the starry sky sword and looked at Ying Hongyue. He said with a smile, "How's the taste?""It's still alright!"Ying Hongyue replied coldly. Her eyes flickered as she looked at the experts who were surrounding the skeleton."Do you want to fight me one on one?"He walked toward Li Hao and said coldly,""Do you know that you've ruined my plans for decades! Do you think ... You're really my match?""It's hard to say!"Li Hao laughed."I only know that Red Moon sovereign is very happy that you're so powerful and even connected to the seal. He can integrate more. Ying Hongyue, I'm so scared. I'm scared that you've been ... Possessed! If you were possessed by a venerable sovereign, how could I take revenge? I want you to be killed by me, not by that venerable sovereign ... Why don't you lower your strength and I'll let you go after extracting some of the Crimson Moon's power?"Ying Hongyue's eyes were dark and cold."You can try!""I'll try it!" Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  A domain appeared, and the two of them instantly disappeared. The next moment, two figures appeared in the domain. BOOM!A boundless rumbling sound resounded through the heavens and earth!Two incomparably powerful existences were fighting in the domain!On the forbidden Sea, 14 powerhouses joined forces to besiege the skeleton, and they were actually doing a great job!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, in the sky.The man with the sword said softly,"both of you are talented!" In one battle ... Li Hao wiped out all the Saints. This strength, this forbearance ... Also, Thunderbolt city is gone. Perhaps, more than a few Saints have died!"Where are the Heavenly Kings?What about the Heavenly King that Red Moon sovereign had transformed into?Are they all dead?It might be!In other words, many Heavenly Kings had already died in this battle.What a terrifying kid!In this battle, Li Hao could be considered to have completely swept away all the obstacles. Ying Hongyue was left all alone. The world was vast, but he was the only one. All his plans had failed. Perhaps, this kind of blow was even more painful than killing him! Ying Hongyue was someone who wanted to compete with venerable sovereigns."What do we do?"Yueshen was a little nervous. This was the first time she had been so nervous.It was too terrifying! At this moment, she felt that these two people were very terrifying. They were both hiding too many things. Although the one in front of her was also very terrifying, how old were the two below?"Ying Hongyue can't die. It'll be very troublesome if he dies!"At this moment, the man with the sword said softly,""You can make your move! Since we've already been exposed ... There's no need to worry anymore. The Saints on Zheng Yu's side have all been annihilated, and only you can possibly save Ying Hongyue ... Attack and suppress Li Hao!""Attack ..."Yueshen was shocked. Now?"Yes."The moon goddess didn't say anything else. In an instant, the moon in the sky shone brightly. The Queen, who was running away, suddenly looked up, and her expression changed. The real Moon Goddess was about to make a move!The limit of the world was the peak of a Saint.However, the moon goddess was the Silver Moon's Foundation and core. At this moment, it seemed to have received some support from heaven's will ... The bright moon actually seemed to be erupting with the aura of a Heavenly King.The Queen's expression changed slightly. Li Hao was so capable that he actually managed to lure this guy out!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the domain, Li Hao and Ying Hongyue's battle caused the world to change colors.At this moment, a powerful force of the Silver Moon suddenly attacked the domain. A bright moon emerged, and a beautiful figure, like a god, stood on the Silver Moon and looked at Li Hao with cold eyes.Compared to the Queen he had seen for the first time, she had a much more sacred feeling!At this moment, the entire Silvermoon world seemed to be shaking. In the distance, the goddess's voice was clear and cold."Li Hao, it's time to stop!"At this moment, Li Hao was actually vaguely suppressing Ying Hongyue, who was at the Heavenly King level. In addition, it was very likely that the other side would soon suppress the skeleton. The moon goddess knew that if this continued, Ying Hongyue would either be killed or possessed by a venerable sovereign!This was not the result they wanted to see.At this moment, Li Hao laughed."Zheng Yu suffered heavy losses. You guys, on the other hand, have been sitting back and reaping the benefits. You look down on all living beings and look down on them, treating the world as your chessboard ... You've really overestimated yourself and underestimated the heroes of the world!"At this moment, Li Hao suddenly laughed out loud. His laughter shook the world, and it was cold and ruthless."You guys ... Want to lead me too?""Your Majesty ... Your Majesty, I ... I'll give you some benefits. Remember this favor!"At this moment, yueshen was slightly stunned.The next moment, the sky above her head suddenly split open, and a drop of blood appeared. It was very large. The moment the blood appeared, Li Hao smiled and muttered,""The blood of a venerable sovereign ... I don't dare to use it. I'm afraid there's a trap ... So I'll give it to you!"BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated through the heavens and earth.Boom! Boom! Boom!A bright moon began to explode in an instant, and the power of countless silver moons spilled out directly. The entire Dali dynasty was shaking violently!At this moment, a sword appeared and slashed out!The blood that exploded gave off an extremely powerful pressure that suppressed the entire world!"Venerable sovereign's blood essence!"At this moment, several voices were heard. In the Dali dynasty, one person shouted angrily,""F * ck, are you going to blow up the Li Dynasty?"

He instantly disappeared!Zheng Yu immediately drove Hurricane city to escape!The man with the sword raised his sword and slashed down. This time, his expression changed slightly and he shouted in a low voice,""Escape!"The void split open, and the half-moon let out a cry of pain. The moon goddess's body shattered instantly, with a shrill, terrified, and despairing look ... She kept breaking apart. Fortunately, at that moment, the man with the sword slashed out and cut everything in half!The moon god threw down more than half of the moon and instantly entered the great Dao universe, the void Dao universe!As soon as she escaped, the man's expression changed slightly. The whole world was pressing on him, as if he had encountered a great threat. The man's expression changed. He glanced at Li Hao and said softly,""You ... You're ruthless!"With that, he tore the sky apart and disappeared.BOOM!A deafening sound swept across the entire world!At this moment, the entire Dali dynasty was in danger. At this moment, a punch came down, and the sky changed color. The huge energy ripples were suppressed instantly. A figure kept retreating, gritting his teeth and cursing,"‚ÄúËâπ! The world hasn't recovered yet ... You bastards!" Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé How ruthless!Self-destruction with the blood essence of venerable sovereigns!That's F * cking cruel!One punch after another, the world changed color!But at this moment, Li Hao didn't say anything. He only attacked with his sword, attacked, attacked!Ying Hongyue continuously vomited blood, and her expression also changed drastically!The next moment, with a wild roar, his body suddenly exploded!The domain was instantly shattered!At the same time, at the edge of the forbidden Sea, a small branch broke off instantly and turned into a person. It was Ying Hongyue. She had even given up on her Heavenly King body. At this moment, she only had one thought-escape!Li Hao had gone crazy!This time, he wasn't just scheming against himself, he was scheming against everyone!The blood essence of a venerable sovereign was actually used to bomb the moon god!At this moment, yueshen's original body was almost destroyed. The sword-carrying man was too strong and had to escape into the universe of the great path. If yueshen's original body did not recover, he had no hope of coming out!As for him ... If he continued to fight, he would definitely die!At this moment, the Heavenly King's body was no longer important. He wanted to escape, and his heart was filled with endless fear!Endless uneasiness!As for Li Hao, he threw out his sword and charged straight at Ying Hongyue, as if he had expected this.Just at this moment, a person suddenly disappeared from the escaping city!Zheng Yu frowned slightly, but he raised his hand to stop the Heavenly Kings.The next moment, the flying sword immortal appeared in front of Ying Hongyue and attacked with his sword!Thunder and lightning struck!BOOM!Li Hao's long sword was actually stopped for a moment. The flying sword immortal instantly grabbed Ying Hongyue and fled in a panic, disappearing into the void!Just as Li Hao was about to give chase, an extremely powerful aura suddenly erupted from the skeleton behind him. It instantly gathered countless amounts of energy and was about to explode. In the distance, Ying Hongyue was extremely weak, but she revealed a fierce expression!At this point ... There was no need for any backup plans!Li Hao, this crazy guy.Just as the skeleton was about to explode, suddenly, a fist smashed down. With a bang, the skeleton collapsed instantly. A voice seemed to be shouting something!However, it was destroyed in an instant!An illusionary figure was faintly visible. It was somewhat angry and extremely annoyed."Get lost!"After saying that, he disappeared instantly!His voice came."Li Hao, you're quite something. Don't chase him anymore. If you really kill him, do you really want the venerable sovereign to break the seal and come out?"Li Hao showed a faint smile and laughed heartily."Many thanks for senior's guidance!"Saying so, he looked up at the sky and laughed."Guys from the void Dao universe ... Senior Zheng Yu suffered such a huge loss. I blew up half of the moon goddesses 'main bodies ... I've also helped you guys close the gap. You're not angry, right?""Hahahaha!" At this moment, Li Hao's laughter spread across the world.""Half-Emperor? Sword Dao half-step sovereign? How amazing! It's just that ... It's as if heaven and earth can't tolerate you. You've slaughtered the Li family, but do you dare to walk out of the moon?""This world ... Is the world of the Li clan!"Li Hao's voice was full of arrogance, madness, and dominance!I've won this battle!As for Ying Hongyue ... She wasn't going to kill him in the first place. If she really killed him, the seal might really be broken. But ... Wasn't it better not to kill him?They were all dead!The Heavenly King body is gone, the forbidden Sea is gone, everything is gone. Now, he will go crazy, and I ... Want him to suffer endless pain! The pain of all his plans being destroyed and all his calculations falling through!"Ying Hongyue, I'm waiting for you to take revenge on me! "It's just like how I've always been plotting to take revenge on you. I'm well aware of the pain, helplessness, and pain that I've experienced. Everything that I've experienced ... You have to experience it!"In the distance, Ying Hongyue kept coughing out blood, and her face was getting paler.Li Hao ... You animal!He regretted it!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Hurricane city.Zheng Yu suddenly laughed. He laughed so hard that he leaned back and looked up at the sky. He laughed so hard that he didn't know what to do."Hahaha ... You ... You're so pitiful!"Nowadays, one wasn't afraid of being miserable, as long as there was someone who was more miserable than them.Yueshen's entire body had almost been blown up, and the other party was trapped in the Dao universe. She had probably lost control of the world in an instant, and it was a problem whether yueshen could recover!'You've been scheming ... In the end, you've been blown up by a drop of venerable sovereign's blood essence!'Strictly speaking, many saints had died on his side. It looked worse, but in reality ... The moon goddess herself was too important. Those Saints really couldn't compare to the moon goddess!More importantly, the Queen in the distance was absorbing the power of the Silver Moon like crazy!It was really hard to say who would be the moon goddess next time!Although this Queen was stupid, she had absorbed too much of the Silver Moon's power ... She might really be replaced. The moon goddesses were the key to her control of the world. It was obvious who would be the one to suffer!Zheng Yu laughed out loud!Only a group of Saints had died!It wasn't much. The terrifying one was Li Hao. The most miserable one was the guy who was forced into the Dao universe. This guy's losses were even greater than Ying Hongyue 's!"Li Hao ... The human Kings of your generation ... Might not be as good as you!"He sighed with emotion. Li Hao was truly capable. In this battle, all sides had suffered heavy losses, but Li Hao had truly cleared all the obstacles this time!Venerable sovereign's blood essence, even if he got it, he couldn't bear to explode it, right?Perhaps he could figure out how to become a venerable sovereign!In the end, Li Hao blew it up just like that!It was also because of this that yueshen was severely injured. Otherwise, even a Heavenly King would have a hard time dealing with yueshen.At least ... He would hesitate!Zheng Yu thought to himself and sighed. Could it be that ... I'm really not as good as this guy?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the distance, the Queen was almost going crazy with excitement. Countless Silver Moon Power quickly entered her body. Without the moon goddess, she now controlled a part of the Silver Moon. Now that a large amount of Silver Moon Power was rushing over, she was extremely excited, excited, and also extremely terrified ...Li Hao was truly a terrifying guy!The moon goddesses ... She knew how terrifying the moon goddesses were, but ... They had just come out today, and Li Hao had already blown them to pieces ... This was too tragic. The Queen chuckled inwardly.What a pathetic fellow!The first time it appeared, it had almost died. Now, it might not be able to be saved. The damage caused by the venerable sovereign's blood essence was not so easy to recover!"Foolish generation!"The Queen sneered. She looked at the sky, how stupid!He actually dared to look down on Li Hao?

Chapter 2294 The Next Step (3)_1
Yueshen had been destroyed, the Saints had been killed, Zheng Yu had escaped, the man with the sword had been forced to retreat into the universe, and the entire thunderstorm city had been wiped out.This battle could be said to be a complete victory!In this battle, no one on Li Hao's side suffered any losses, because almost everyone was just a bystander.In this battle, Li Hao had schemed against all sides.With his own strength, he had killed all the unexpected factors in the cradle.Even if that beginner God appeared at the last moment, it was barely within Li Hao's calculations. He was not completely unprepared, but he came and left quickly, so Li Hao did not bet everything on it.Since the other party was not willing to meddle in other people's business, Li Hao was not willing to risk his life to fight with him.This person was extremely powerful.Moreover, the suppression of heaven and earth did not seem to exert too much pressure on him.This person was extremely powerful!Even if he gambled everything, it might not be useful.At the edge of the broken Forbidden Sea.All the experts were excited, excited, and a little nervous.They all looked at Li Hao, the young man who had turned the tables. They were all shocked.As for Li Hao, he was as calm as ever.He silently looked in the direction of the fleeing crowd.Ying Hongyue escaped. It was the flying sword immortal who took her away ... It was obvious that he had guessed correctly. The flying sword immortal might be Zi Yue, and Zi Yue ... Was she Ying Hongyue's daughter or her true self? it was still difficult to tell.The Queen had escaped. This time, the Queen had profited.After absorbing a large amount of the Silver Moon's power, the Queen had a chance of becoming a Heavenly King. Furthermore, she might not be suppressed by the world.Zheng Yu had left and lost a few Saints, but to Hurricane city, the loss of strength was not too great.Li daoheng had retreated. His opponent was a half-step sovereign of sword Dao ... He had been forced to retreat into the universe of the great path not only because of the suppression of heaven and earth, but also because this person had massacred sword city. After all, this world had been controlled by the Li family's sword venerable for many years.He had massacred the Li family ... If he were to force his way out now, he might be targeted by heaven and earth, and the seal might even be completely broken.Thus, he was forced to hide in the Dao universe.Even at this moment, Li Hao still had so many enemies. Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé However ... He had almost wiped out all the parties involved.Almost all the forces below the Heavenly King level had been wiped out.Not far away, Zhang an glanced at Li Hao and sighed.This battle ... Was an outcome that no one had expected.Li Hao had won!A complete victory!It was even more glorious than expected. He looked at Li Hao for a long time before he said,""The battle here is over, so we'll take our leave first!"The Saints were also very polite."Marquis Li, you have eliminated a large number of invaders and traitors in this battle. This is worthy of celebration. If there is a chance in the future, come to our galaxy city as a guest!"These people ... Were really polite.He had no choice but to be polite.On the one hand, Li Hao was not their enemy, and he had helped them eliminate many strong enemies. On the other hand, this young man was ruthless, strong, and extremely scheming. If he had not taken the initiative to find Zhang an, no one would have expected that he had hidden so much.It was very dangerous to go against such a person.Li Hao turned around and smiled at the crowd. The next moment, he reached out his hand, and two golden pills appeared. He said softly,""Seniors, you've contributed a lot in this battle, so I should be getting more. However, I need more ... These are two Heavenly King-level clones of the blood God! Although it might not allow one to break through to the Heavenly King realm, it can still advance one step further on the divine path!"After saying that, the pill flew towards Zhang an.Zhang an was a little hesitant, but Li Hao calmly said,""Division Chief Zhang, you don't need it, but the seniors do. He's not a traitor and has been in seclusion for many years. He has countless hidden injuries. Putting others aside, I think this senior of the Zhang family still has hidden injuries. Otherwise, how could the Zhang family's saber be so weak?"Two Heavenly King blood deities!He knew that Li Hao had forged three in this battle.As for the two Heavenly Kings who had died earlier ... Li Hao had compressed the one he had killed into a Blood God, but the tree hadn't been compressed, or perhaps it couldn't be compressed anymore. Thus, Li Hao had only obtained four Heavenly King-level blood gods in total.She gave him half of it all at once.Of course, if he didn't help in this battle, Li Hao wouldn't have succeeded.But ... Killing the traitor and the people of the Crimson Moon was something he had to do.He wasn't really helping Li Hao.However, since Li Hao had said so, he understood what Li Hao meant. If you gave, I'll give you something in return. There was no need to say who owed who. This guy was extremely clear about grudges and was unwilling to talk about favors."Then I'll take it!"Zhang an didn't refuse any further. He accepted the two Heavenly kings of the blood God and quickly left with the rest.The star River City appeared.Zhang an entered the city and stood on the city wall. He glanced at Li Hao, and the star River City quickly disappeared into the void.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶As soon as Zhang an and the others left, the others came forward one after another, all somewhat excited.The king of Dali and Jiang Li were slightly nervous.At this moment, the skeleton was also here. Its aura was strong, and its pressure was very strong. However ... The skeleton was just a skeleton at this moment. It might have been revived a little, but it was almost destroyed by Ying Hongyue.Not only that, but he was also punched by the God of beginner martial at the end ... The remnant of his consciousness that had recovered was completely destroyed.Li Hao glanced at the king of Dali and then at the skeleton. Every bone was white jade in color.Every bone was filled with a powerful aura. There was also an aura that came from the wilderness, or rather, the aura of a beginner martial artist. This could be a true beginner martial artist, or even the first generation of beginner martial artists!

If it was the first generation ... That would be extremely terrifying!The king of Dali was a little uneasy, but Li Hao smiled and said,""Although the king of Dali did not contribute much in this battle, the God of beginner martial did. In that case ... You can take this skeleton with you!""What?"The Dali King was shocked. Take him away?All of them?Li Hao had said that he wanted half, and he had agreed.In fact, at this moment, he was worried that he wouldn't be able to get even half of it.In the end ... You want me to take them all away?Really?The king of Dali couldn't believe it. Li Hao said indifferently,""It seems that the king of Dali doesn't need all of them ..." "No, I ..."Li Hao smiled."It's fine. Take him away. But I have a small request!"The king of Dali was a little apprehensive. He was afraid of Li Hao.When he heard that there was a request, he immediately felt a little uneasy."Marchioness Silvermoon ... Just say it!"He tried his best to act like he didn't care, but in reality, his brain was spinning madly. Was there a conspiracy?Are you trying to scheme against me?Are you trying to trick me?Was there anyone in the world that Li Hao hadn't tricked?They had all been scammed!I definitely can't trick him!"I'm actually not very interested in the beginner martial Dao...But there's someone on my side, Deputy Director Zhou of the administration. He cultivates the Golden body, but he hasn't incorporated it into the origin. It can barely be considered the path of the beginner martial Dao, but not the path of the origin!""His golden body is here to receive a gift from a senior. He's unwilling to give it up, so his progress has been slow. Director Zhou has made great contributions to heavenstar. After you bring the skeleton away, I'll let director Zhou enter the Li Dynasty. The king of the Li Dynasty only needs to help him reach the Dao integration stage!"Li Hao pointed at the skeleton."If you absorb this skeleton, you'll have a chance to become a Heavenly King!" I'll give you a Heavenly King and a Dao integration stage super mighty figure in return. What do you think?"The king of Dali calculated madly.Was it worth it?Of course!Not to mention, it was okay and not too much of a request. He knew that director Zhou's talent wasn't bad. It was just that he had been cultivating the Golden body, which was why his progress couldn't keep up. Strictly speaking, director Zhou's inheritance and his inheritance were connected.It might be related to celestial ruler Batian or iron head venerable sovereign."Alright!" He quickly nodded. A Heavenly King's skeleton in exchange for a golden body expert who was currently at the mid-stage of the sun Moon realm to advance to the Dao integration stage ... This was a very fair and reasonable deal. A complete skeleton was definitely much better than an incomplete one!At this point, he still wanted to say something to express his attitude. For example, he wanted to say that he wouldn't make Li Hao an enemy ..."Say hello to that senior for me," Li Hao said before he could say anything."As long as that senior doesn't participate in the war and doesn't enter the haoxing continent, we'll be eternal allies!"He didn't finish his sentence, but if that entering the heavenstar realm cultivator took the initiative to invade ... Li Hao would fight him no matter how strong he was!Even if he couldn't defeat them, he didn't fear them!"I will!" The king of Dali nodded solemnly.Li Hao nodded."Of the four kings, the Queen is expected to become a Heavenly King, and so are you. That Queen is not clear-headed, and I don't have much time to keep an eye on her. If you can really advance, you can help me keep an eye on her when you're free!""Alright!"The Dali King agreed readily. Not to mention a Queen becoming a Heavenly King, even if she became a half-step Emperor ... She was still a little afraid. However, she was not that afraid of this kind of straightforward and boorish man.Li Hao, Ying Hongyue, and the others were the ones who gave him a headache.Because you would never know how much the other party had hidden. You might think that you had won, but in fact, you had lost very badly.He was shocked ... At this moment, he felt that he had made a big profit. Would he lose money?He didn't know!Forget it, I'll just take it one step at a time. Li Hao's respect for me must have something to do with that beginner God. Otherwise ... Li Hao wouldn't have given me so much face.Without saying anything, the Dali King quickly took the skeleton and left with Jiang Li.He didn't want to stay a moment longer!As soon as they left, li Fuhai stomped his four hooves with a heavy heart.""This is a skeleton of a beginner martial stage half-step sovereign ... And you just ... Gave it all to the other party?"Li Hao smiled.He said softly,"I'll give it to him. That person is too strong!" Furthermore ... It's going to be difficult for director Zhou to reach the Dao integration stage. I'd like to see how the Li Dynasty will help him. Director Zhou Can be considered the inheritance of the celestial ruler ... If he can't level up this time ... I can't help him level up!"Li Fuhai didn't say anything.Li Hao glanced at the crowd. In the end, he looked at Vajra wood, an expert from martial Union. He had very few dealings with this person, and he had also joined the Alliance quite late.At this moment, the diamond Wood turned into a strong man with golden light all over his body. Best novel online free at ‚ìù0‚ì•‚ìî‚ìõ‚ìë‚ìò‚ìù His strength was not too weak, comparable to general Huai.These people had all done their best in this battle. Although it wasn't too dangerous, they still contributed a lot in killing the eight blood Saints and controlling the skeletons.Li Hao didn't say much. He glanced at it and nodded slightly. Then, he looked at the broken Forbidden Sea and smiled."Even though Ying Hongyue and the skeleton are gone, there are still treasures and energy in the forbidden Sea! Saints, please work hard and compress the forbidden Sea. Take away all the treasures in the sea and the entire Forbidden Sea!""Tomorrow, you will command heaven battling city, berserk Thunder City, dingtian city, borderless city, and martial Union to meet me in Heavenly Star City!""Yes!""Yes!" The Saints took this seriously and hurriedly replied.Today's Li Hao ... Had truly convinced them. In their opinion, he had reached the peak in both strength and strategy. So many powerful enemies had suffered heavy losses under his torment, and now, he had even retreated in various places.

Chapter 2296 The Next Step (3)
In this world ... Even if the Queen and the king of Dali both advanced to Heavenly King, they would not be able to touch the Heavenly Star at all.Now, even if heaven and earth had recovered to the level of a Heavenly King, and the Heavenly Kings in Hurricane city could come out, would Zheng Yu really dare to let those few Heavenly Kings out?Not necessarily!Until the day he could become a half-step sovereign, it could be said that heavenstar stood at the peak of the Silver Moon, unshakeable by anyone!It wasn't that heavenstar was powerful, nor was it that the powerhouses from neo martial were powerful, but that Li Hao ... Was unpredictable.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶He was waiting for the few new martial Saints to go and compress the forbidden Sea.Li Hao looked at the earth overturning sword, then at Lin Hongyu, and finally at the Black Panther. He smiled and said,""What are you still thinking about? Let's go back to Heavenly Star City first. "He waved his hand and a River appeared.Li Hao stepped into the air, and the others quickly followed. The river seemed to pass through the void. Lin Hongyu and the other one were a little surprised. Was this a treasure?Li Hao, on the other hand, thought for a while and suddenly said,""That person ... Is He Li daoheng?""What?"The earth-overturning sword was stunned. Lin Hongyu was also puzzled."Lord Marquis, are you saying that the person who attacked just now might not be li daoheng?"How could this be?Didn't they always say that this person was li daoheng?Who else could it be but li daoheng?Li Hao raised his head and looked at the sky. After a long time, he said,""The sword intent is very strong! He was also extremely powerful! But ..."After some thought, he asked,"is this really li daoheng?" In my imagination, li daoheng's schemes were unparalleled. He shouldn't be like this ... It's true that he's strong in battle, but ... He's slightly worse than I expected!"This is still lacking?The two of them did not speak. That person was very terrifying. With just a glimpse, he had split open the energy mass of the self-explosion of the venerable sovereign's blood essence with a sword. That was under the suppression of heaven and earth. If he really used his full strength ... Even a Saint would probably be killed in an instant with a sword!This ... Was this called bad?Li Hao, on the other hand, kept thinking.He would never think of any enemy as weak, even if Zheng Yu looked very stupid now ... Was he really that stupid?Could such a fool really become a half-step sovereign?Zheng Yu might still have some of his own schemes and calculations.As for this li daoheng ... From what the ninth Division commander had said, at such a young age, he could already see through people's hearts and play with his group of friends in the palm of his hand. Such a person had been around for a hundred thousand years, but in the end, for this battle ... Li Hao had actually prepared even more.The venerable sovereign's blood essence was only one of them.The second was the great Dao universe!He had even thought that if li daoheng interfered, he would find a way to summon that star again. The back of the star might be the void Dao universe, and he could use the river to attack the void Dao universe, forcing li daoheng to retreat.This was his real plan!The blood essence of a venerable sovereign exploded and crippled the moon goddess ... To be honest, in Li Hao's opinion, li daoheng's scheme against Wushuang would be very difficult to succeed! How could such a shrewd and calculative person not know that there was venerable sovereign's blood essence in thunderstorm city?In the end ... He had succeeded!This was what Li Hao was puzzled about. Everything had gone too smoothly. Although he had made ample preparations, Li Hao was still somewhat disappointed that he had forced li daoheng into a corner so smoothly!It was a battle of wits and courage, and the joy of fighting with others was endless!Li Hao had taken advantage of this li daoheng the first time he met him ... In fact, Li Hao was not happy. Instead, he was a little disappointed. He even suspected that this person might not be li daoheng!Or perhaps ... It might not be li daoheng's true body. Could it be a clone?But ... His clone had the strength of a half-step sovereign?Of course, if he had a clone, why didn't li daoheng have one?There was another reason why he determined that the other party was a clone.New Dao!This sword-carrying man did not have much power of a new Dao, but Li Hao felt that li daoheng must have cultivated a new Dao or even mastered the void Dao universe ...'Could it be that he is like me, or perhaps slightly different, and has kept his original strength in this man's body while his main body is still cultivating in the void Dao universe? He's cultivating a new Dao ... And it's very difficult for him to reach the Dao integration stage at the moment ... I haven't even figured out how to do it, so he shouldn't be much faster than me ..." That was a possibility!If that was the case, this man with the sword on his back might just be a container for the old Dao!Not only this man ... Zhang an might have done the same.In fact, Zhang an had not revealed much of his power of new Dao.One of the five Saints in Star River City was very mysterious ... Was this person Zhang an?Li Hao suddenly laughed.They were all very interesting!While preserving the old Dao, he was also accommodating the new Dao. With both DAOs present, perhaps he was waiting for the battle power of the two DAOs to be equal and then combine them to break through some barriers in one fell swoop. Could li daoheng be planning to become the venerable sovereign?And Zhang an ... Could it be for the sake of a pseudo-Emperor? n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Many thoughts and guesses appeared in his mind.Outsiders might not care about the sword, but Li Hao could infer too many things from it. From his personality, strength, attack trajectory, and methods, the sword-carrying man might be strong, but he might not be a master!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶There was no need to say more about this. There were some things that he had to know in his heart.Saying too much would only add to his troubles.In this battle, no matter what, he had won. It was perhaps the greatest and most glorious result he had ever achieved in so many wars.The group of people quickly entered stellarsky city.In the governor's office.Everyone was waiting. Seeing them return, they quickly shouted in excitement,""Congratulations to Lord Marquis for displaying your divine might and killing a Saint and King, bringing your might to the world!"

They already knew the result of this battle.In fact, many people were near the Cang mountains, waiting for the result. Non-Saints were unable to participate in this battle, but they were ready at any time.In the end, they didn't need to fight hard.In one battle, Li Hao had dealt with all his enemies, which made them even more excited! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Li Hao smiled and looked around.""When did you learn to flatter?"At this moment, director Zhao walked out with a bright smile,""Lord Marquis, this is not flattery! This battle ... Was too exciting! We suddenly feel that half-step sovereigns and venerable sovereigns aren't fearsome. This has completely broken the fear of the old era powerhouses that the new era humans have!""Alright, half-step sovereigns are terrifying, but venerable sovereigns are even more terrifying!"Li Hao smiled and walked into the hall.Everyone followed him in. Li Hao sat down on the throne. Seeing Lin Hongyu standing there, he pointed to his left and said,""Hongyu, sit here!"Everyone's eyes flickered, but they didn't say anything.Lin Hongyu did not say anything and sat down on the upper left.The others took their seats.On the upper right side, director Zhao wanted Hong Yitang to sit, but Hong Yitang declined. The two of them exchanged pleasantries, but in the end, it was director Zhao who sat.Li Hao just looked at it and didn't say anything.After everyone sat down, Li Hao said,""Now that the world has recovered, it can already accommodate Saints and even peak Saints! I've said it before, I don't want everyone to be left too far behind me!""Everything I've done today is to reduce the amount of interference those people cause to my Heavenly Star!""In this battle, we killed 29 Saints, 5 Heavenly Kings, and over 100 undyings ..."Everyone gasped!Although they knew that Li Hao had taken down Thunderbolt city, they were still shocked to hear that he had killed five Heavenly Kings.They knew that there was a high chance that he had killed a Heavenly King.Perhaps one, perhaps two ... However, he did not expect that there would be five of them!Oh my God!It was simply unbelievable!Li Hao ignored their reactions and continued,""Now, we have two Heavenly King blood deities, 20 Saint blood deities, and 100 immortal blood deities ... In addition, we've also seized some worthless things that aren't of much use!""The Heavenly King Blood God won't make you a Heavenly King in a single bound ... But for some suns and moons, devouring it will open many meridians. Perhaps you can complete the first cycle and enter the Dao integration stage. I think there's a good chance!"In other words, there was a high chance of two Dao integration experts being born.At this moment, many people were moved.Lin Hongyu and Hong Yitang had both reached the Dao integration stage due to a stroke of good fortune. However, many of the remaining cultivators were at the seventh, eighth, and ninth levels of the sun Moon tier, but no one had reached the Dao integration stage yet. The time was too short.Li Hao continued,"these two Heavenly King-level clones of the blood God must be properly distributed. For now, combat strength isn't the most important thing. I need to improve them. They'll be of great use immediately!" "Strength is the foundation for improvement ...""Who do you think can take the two Heavenly King blood deities?" he looked around at the crowd.Director Zhao directly said,"everything is up to Lord Marquis!" We didn't make any contributions in this battle! If Lord Marquis is not easy to distribute, why don't we let Governor Lin and director Hong do it?"Li Hao smiled."I'll give you one!""I ..." Director Zhao hurriedly said."But I'll give it to you. You have a mission to complete."Director Zhao's heart moved,"Lord hou's orders!."He naturally wanted to improve.The daomerge!He had already reached the eighth level of the sun Moon tier, and was even close to the ninth level. However, it would still be difficult for him to reach the Dao integration realm."It's been half a year since the promotion of National Education, and the martial arts in the world are also developing with glory. There are 99 provinces, and now there are two more provinces, making it more than 100 ... The situation in the entire Heavenly Star is very complicated ... I don't even know most of the Governors-General!"Li Hao slowly said,"what you need to do is very simple!" Reorganize the entire Heavenly Star, including administration, law, education, finance, agriculture, industry, and commerce ... I want a complete reform! Including the change of name in heavenstar, and even the opening of a new calendar!"Li Hao said softly,"it's time!" "Now is perhaps the best time and the calmest time. This time, all sides have suffered. I want to make a big change in the entire Sky Star dynasty ... A big revolution! You have to be fast, very fast .... It's easy to say, but in reality, it's easy to conquer the world, but very difficult to manage it .... If you can take on this mission, then you'll definitely get one of the two Heavenly Kings 'blood deities!"Director Zhao kept silent and started to think.He really wasn't simple!Accepting this mission ... Would be very, very troublesome!The world today was filled with people from all walks of life. Although there were not many powerhouses, sometimes ... It was not just a matter of powerhouses. Comprehensive reforms, ten billion people ... Countless benefits had to be measured ...He might even offend a large number of people ... It would not be easy to get the Heavenly King Blood God!Li Hao's intention was obviously not to suppress the world by force, but to sort out the world. This ..."I ..." He said after a long while."You can't do it?""I ... Can take it, but I need a lot of people to cooperate ..." He said."Hong Yu will fully cooperate with you! Military cooperations...If there's any trouble, we'll just suppress them!"Director Zhao heaved a sigh of relief. That was good."Then I'll ... Accept!""Yes." Li Hao nodded and looked at the rest."Who among the remaining people thinks that they can take the last Heavenly King Blood God?"

Chapter 2298 The Next Step (3)_5
He looked at one person, and it was none other than Qian Wuliang.Of course, Qian Wuliang was tempted.However ... At this moment, he was a little hesitant. He had the ability, but Li Hao had said that battle prowess was not the standard. He was also at the eighth level of the sun Moon tier, and it was his dream to reach the Dao integration realm.However, Li Hao had been watching him.Obviously, he was asking him to step forward.He quickly thought about it. Why did the Marquis ask him to stand out and fight for the blood God's spawn?Just to reward me?Absolutely not!When Li Hao got impatient, Qian Wuliang walked out and said in a deep voice,""This subordinate would like to fight for the remaining one!""What can you do?"Li Hao laughed. At this moment, he seemed to be slightly relaxed. He leaned back in his chair and said,"Give me a reason!"Qian Wuliang hesitated for a second and quickly said,""I'm willing to take the divine Kingdom and try to merge it into the bright star dynasty!""Not enough!""I can also solve the chaos between the White saint cult and the kui mountain Demon tribe," Qian Wuliang added helplessly,"and unite the entire haoxing continent ...""Not enough!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùEveryone was secretly speechless. This wasn't enough?In fact, it was already very troublesome!What kind of result did the Marquis want?Qian Wuliang struggled for a long time before saying bitterly,"this subordinate ... Is willing to jump into the void Dao universe and be the vanguard for Lord Marquis to conquer the void Dao universe!"Is this the result you want?"You can Enter the Void Dao universe?" Li Hao was puzzled.Qian Wuliang really wanted to cry ... Even though he could see through people's minds ... This man was just toying with people's minds.He felt that when he faced Li Hao ... He was always being schemed against!'Don't you know if I can or can not?'Qian Wuliang gritted his teeth and said,"it's possible ... It's possible!" I can try. When I advance to the Dao integration realm, I might be able to connect to the Dao universe and instantly jump into it. If ... If I am discovered, I will die without a doubt. If I am not discovered, I am willing ... To be the coordinates to help Lord Marquis locate the location of the void Dao universe!""It's too dangerous!"Li Hao frowned."Your subordinate is not afraid!"Qian Wuliang gritted his teeth and said,"I will die for the bright star dynasty!" "You're really not afraid?"Li Hao laughed."I'm not afraid!""Alright, the last Heavenly King blood deity is yours!""Many thanks, Lord Marquis!""You deserve this!" p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t   At this moment, no one said a word. Although they were envious, these two ... Were really not easy to get!Qian Wuliang didn't want to take it at all ... At this moment, his heart trembled. "I knew that I would have to pay a high price if I wanted to improve. It's too dangerous.""Don't worry," Li Hao said at this moment."The moon goddess is injured and her star is dim. Li daoheng is busy saving her! The situation of the void Dao universe is unknown ... You might not be in trouble. If something really happens, I will help you revive after we take down the void Dao universe!""Many thanks, Lord Marquis!""Also, the Heavenly King Blood God is only one of the rewards. If you can really help me locate the location of the void Dao universe ... There will be a huge reward when it's done!" Li Hao added."This subordinate will definitely die!"Qian Wuliang bowed and gritted his teeth."Then ... I'll bet!"If he didn't take a few risks, how could he rise from a nobody to the fourth or even third Dao integration expert after Li Hao?It was worth it!He had no choice. One of them was Li Hao's wife in name, while the other was half a master. As for director Zhao, he was the Prime Minister of the world. As for him, he had only surpassed everyone else because he had risked his life.Li Hao nodded slightly. At this moment, two blood gods flew out.The two experts 'hearts trembled when they received it.The power of a great Dao was so rich, and the special power was so rich. This thing was too extraordinary. When he held it in his hand, he felt like his body was breathing, and when he smelled it, he felt his qi and blood boil!"The remaining 20 divine Dao blood gods might not be able to help you reach the Dao integration stage ... But they can help you all improve!"Li Hao looked at everyone."However ... In this battle, the new martial artists who joined us from heaven battling city have contributed a lot. Half of them will be given to them. As for the remaining ten, Hong Yu will distribute them!"Lin Hongyu's heart skipped a beat and she nodded.Li Hao casually threw out a storage ring, which not only contained the divine pills but also many treasures at the immortal level."Martial uncle Hong!"Hong Yitang quickly looked at Li Hao, who said,""Martial uncle is in charge of the world's education system, and you can't just be in charge, you can also push out new things! Cultivation techniques need to be innovative and applicable. You can't go all over the world with just one cultivation technique ... Martial uncle must keep this matter in mind!""Understood!"Hong Yitang nodded and Li Hao continued,"the world has been in chaos for a period of time. Wars have been going on and many people have lost their homes. The swords gate has experience in setting up child care centers and nursing homes ... Senior uncle, please take care of them. I don't want anyone to starve to death in this extraordinary era and be forgotten in some corner!""I'll definitely do my best!"Li Hao nodded slightly and looked at the others.""The cultivation of the great Dao lies in the heart! A strong heart, a strong person! "I once said that I was in charge of the great Dao, and I hoped that all of you could become the Dao Masters of the various forces. I still stand by my words. Don't forget your hearts, and don't forget the fields that you were originally good at! "Sky sword walks the sword Dao, while Overlord blade walks the saber Dao. Although you walk the mental saber Dao, it's also a type of saber Dao ... An attribute-less Dao Meridian can be cultivated, but it must be cultivated! But ... You can't forget what you're good at!"

"Only my own characteristics will have the uniqueness of the future!""Tomorrow, the five main cities will gather ... I'll move the five main cities into the great path universe to suppress the great path. The world will be more relaxed, and perhaps ... It will be able to accommodate a Heavenly King very soon!""Now, the number of cultivators in the world has increased by countless times. The existence of the ancient city is no longer stabilizing the world but is somewhat restricting it. I will further speed up the recovery of the entire world ... If my strength can't keep up ..."Li Hao said slowly,"on this road, although I don't want to leave everyone behind, everyone will fall behind sooner or later!" I can't wait for you all here forever. The situation doesn't allow me to wait forever! The Silver Moon was only a small world in the greater universe, not the entire place ... There were venerable sovereigns and half-step sovereigns here. How wonderful would the world be? Are we going to be trapped in this place for the rest of our lives, fighting with those rotten, unbearable people who have been abandoned by the times?"Li Hao's tone was very arrogant!However, everyone just listened quietly.Perhaps ... Li Hao wasn't just arrogant.Back then, who would have believed that he could kill so many Heavenly Kings in one battle?This was a man who was good at creating miracles!After a long time, Li Hao waved his hand."That's all I have to say. You may leave now and think about it. In addition ... If you want to enter the Dao universe and study the Dao, I might be able to do it!" Tomorrow, they could enter the ancient city together! In the future, I might leave a special passage for you to come and go to the great Dao universe to seek your true self! As long as you don't intentionally destroy the stars, you can do whatever you want!"Everyone's expression changed. Lin Hongyu frowned."Lord Marquis ... This ... Isn't very appropriate ..."It was too dangerous!Li Hao laughed."The Dao can not be cultivated by one person. Just like this time, I can improve because the people are United!" Entering the path of cultivation is actually helping themselves, and also helping me!"At this moment, everyone's feelings were complicated.Li Hao, who had mastered the great Dao universe ... Actually ... Allowed them to freely enter and exit the great Dao universe. This ... Was truly audacious and bold!He didn't seem to be afraid that someone would sneak into the universe of the great path and do something to him.What a terrifying guy!Even the enemy would be shocked if they knew about this!Everyone expressed their thanks and left without saying anything more.After they left, the Dao integration experts remained where they were.Hong Yitang smiled."I'm leaving?""What are you joking about, uncle-master?" Li Hao laughed.Hong Yitang was a little embarrassed. Young people didn't fall for this. He wasn't embarrassed, but he was.He glanced at Lin Hongyu, who was also calm ...  Best novel online free at ùô£Oùô´ùôöùô°ùôóùôûùô£ Hong Yitang could only sigh in his heart. It's good to be young. She's not embarrassed or shy at all ... Alright, he didn't make fun of her and returned to his serious expression.At this moment, Li Hao said,"this battle is only a small victory!" It seemed like a glorious victory, but in fact ... It's just average!""The true core power is still not destroyed!""Now, Zheng Yu, li daoheng, Red Moon Emperor, and the God of beginner martial are the four most powerful people in this world! Our goal is to get rid of them ... Or we can live in peace with each other like the God of beginner martial!""Even if the God of beginner martial is a half-step sovereign, that means there are three half-step sovereigns and one venerable sovereign ... Let's put aside the God of beginner martial for now. Among the remaining three sides, venerable Red Moon sovereign is the strongest, li daoheng is the most mysterious, and Zheng Yu is the most obvious ... We can only be considered to have won if we can get rid of these three sides!"The two of them had grave expressions. This was not easy to resolve.The weakest was a half-step Emperor!"Do you remember the saber in the ruins of star suppression city?"Li Hao said,"this blade ... Can't be touched easily. The God of beginner martial might have something to do with this blade. He definitely didn't leave it here casually. Besides the world itself, this blade is the most important thing in this world ... The reason he left it behind might be related to this blade!"The two of them nodded and waited for Li Hao to explain his plan. Li Hao gently knocked on the table and said,""Zheng Yu isn't easy to deal with either. The other party didn't seem to have made any arrangements in the past 100000 years, but everything is hard to say ... This person can reach the half-step sovereign realm, is he really that stupid?""But that venerable sovereign ...""What?" The two of them were stunned. Li Hao smiled."That venerable sovereign is an outsider. He has been sealed and has been entangled with Ying Hongyue for a few years, but he hasn't been able to gain any advantage. In fact, in my opinion, this venerable sovereign is the easiest to deal with, not to mention his strength."Both of their teeth were aching!Li Hao continued,"I want to enter the seal ... I'll enter with my main body!" However, after I leave, there might be people paying attention to my whereabouts ... Hongyu, after I leave, you have to do one thing. "Lin Hongyu's expression changed."I've merged your star great Dao into my Natal Galaxy ... It's mixed with thousands of DAOs. Now, besides me, you and uncle-master can also open the great Dao universe. As long as I give you some authority, including giving the character 'Dao' to one person, it will definitely open smoothly ..."He looked at the two of them and asked,'who can control the divine text of the word' Dao '? Who's willing to help me draw the attention of the powerhouses?"Hong Yitang's expression changed slightly."I'll do it ..."Lin Hongyu frowned and said,"let me do it!" Education is not a small matter, and the cultivation of all the people is related to the strength of the entire great Dao and many other things ... Moreover ... Martial uncle is in charge of the great Dao universe, so it's not convenient for you to come and go. As for me ... I'm the Marquis 'wife, after all, so it's not very noticeable for me to travel to the great Dao universe. "Hong Yitang smiled bitterly. This ... Alright, it made sense.However, he was still a little worried.Moreover, Li Hao was actually going to enter the seal to find a way to deal with venerable sovereigns ... This ... Was simply ... Terrifying, and they were afraid that they would die at any time."Hong Yu it is then!" Li Hao smiled.He looked at Lin Hongyu and said,""This is a matter of great importance. Other than you and me, no one is allowed to leak this information! If I'm not careful, the great Dao universe will go out of control, and I'll die ...""If I betray you, I'll definitely ..." Lin Hongyu said in a low voice."Alright, that's enough!"Li Hao interrupted him and said no more. Then, he thought of something and threw out a storage ring."This is a fruit from the Heavenly King fruit tree. As for its specific uses, the other party might not be telling the truth. You can make your own judgment ... Whether you want to give it to others or use it for yourself, it's up to you!""Also, I might need to go to sword city ..."After thinking for a while, Li Hao said,""The sword city is still sealed, so it might not be simple. Even if there's no one left, it might not be useless! The sword Saint has lived for many years, so he might still have some secrets ... I still need you to do something. If the seal changes ... No, it doesn't change ... The few of you, from today on, chase after Ying Hongyue and make sure that she has no way to go! As long as the seal moves, quickly attack and kill Ying Hongyue!""On one hand, it's to divert my attention. On the other hand, it's to make people mistakenly think that the mutation was caused by killing Ying Hongyue! Also, keep an eye on that idiot Queen. It might not be a good thing for her to devour a large amount of Silver Moon Power this time. Be careful that she might be controlled at any time ... This woman's brain isn't working well, and she might be tricked to death!"Thinking of this, Li Hao thought for a while and nodded.""That's all. As for senior Zhang an and the others ... Don't worry about them for the time being. He has his own ideas, so I won't interfere. If there are any urgent changes, you can ask them for help!"After giving all the instructions, Li Hao said no more. Seeing this, the two of them prepared to leave.The Black Panther was not willing to leave. Li Hao frowned."You go too ... It's no use following me! I can't bring you to the seal ... You're too weak!"Black Panther was speechless.After lying on the ground for a while, it wagged its tail at Li Hao and left, somewhat disappointed.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶After everyone had left, Li Hao let out a sigh of relief.This is all I can do.I'm walking too fast, can you guys ... Keep up with me?He closed his eyes and began to cultivate, not thinking about it anymore. Perhaps ... In the end, he would still be alone?
