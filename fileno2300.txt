Li Dynasty.In the temple.The skeleton was thrown aside. The king of Dali and Jiang Li stood in the hall, waiting for something.After a long time, a human voice was heard."What is your request?"The king of Dali was silent for a while before saying,""Can you guarantee that the Li Dynasty will remain independent of the Silvermoon?"At this moment, the king of Dali was less overbearing and more helpless.He couldn't win!"Your choice is the same as the initial martial state's choice when the human king rose that year ... You hoped to be independent of neo martial state. In the end, it was proven that this was not a good choice. The initial martial state was almost cut off, and the new martial state rose!""Then ... If senior is willing to help, Dali may not have to rely on heavenstar to reverse the situation!" The Dali King sighed."My God has unparalleled combat strength ... Why not ..." Jiang Li interjected."What does it have to do with me?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe two of them were speechless.The voice rose again in the hall, whether it's Silver Moon, Li Hao, or Red Moon ... None of them are related to me! I'm staying here not for you to conquer the world, nor for anything else ... I have my own ideas, and of course, they have nothing to do with you!""In every era, there will always be someone who will rise!" "The right time, right place, and right people. Times create heroes, and heroes will also create an era ... People like us lack the vigor of the past. It's very difficult for people who lack vigor to create a new era ..." Jiang Li said in a deep voice,"Your Majesty is still alive!" There were still people in the Li Dynasty! If our God is willing ... The Li Dynasty will have a chance!"This time, he could witness the power of this God of beginner martial.A single punch destroyed the skeleton of a Heavenly King.And it was under such circumstances. One could imagine how powerful this God of beginner martial was when he used his full power.The moment the venerable sovereign's blood essence erupted, this person could actually suppress it!It was unbelievably powerful!However, for such a person to remain silent for 100000 years ... It was simply unbelievable and baffling.Then ... What are you doing here?He didn't seize the world, didn't kill rebels, didn't create an era, just to sleep?He didn't do anything!The feeling of eating and waiting for death!"Why should I assist someone who isn't very smart to fight for the world with a group of strong people? If I really wanted to be a support, why didn't I support Li Hao? The more you do, the more mistakes you make. The less you do, the less mistakes you make. Not doing is good!"At this moment, the God of beginner martial arts said something very meaningful,""I only know that it's good to send charcoal in the snow, but ... If I send it the wrong way, it will be a huge trouble! Adding flowers to the brocade was fine, but adding the wrong one would also be a big problem! "You treat me as if I don't exist, and I treat you as if you don't exist ... It doesn't matter if you're the expert who created the era, or the expert who created the era ... You don't care about him, and he doesn't care about you!" "From the very beginning ... I didn't care. Right or wrong, what does it have to do with me? I won't fight, I won't ask, I won't create trouble, I won't solve the trouble ... Then the trouble has nothing to do with me!"The Dali King said in a deep voice,"senior, do you think so?" However, to others, how could they allow others to ..."  Best novel online free at ùô£Oùô´ùôöùô°ùôóùôûùô£ "Wrong!""You're wrong," the man said again."If this bed becomes someone else 's, then I'll leave this bed. I won't sleep here. The world is so big, where can i not sleep?" If the Silver Moon was not enough, there was still the White moon, the Crimson Moon, and the green Moon ... How vast was the universe? If you don't allow me to sleep, I won't sleep ... What does it matter?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe two of them were completely speechless.What the hell is this?The king of Dali seemed to have thought of something and frowned slightly. "Senior's meaning is ... Could it be ... Senior can leave the Silvermoon world?""Can you guess?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùI'm not guessing!If he could really leave Silver Moon ... That would be unbelievable!At this time, apart from the venerable sovereigns, was there anyone else who would leave Silver Moon?Could it be ...He didn't even dare to think about it!In this era, the strongest was a sealed venerable sovereign who had not come out yet. If this person was really a venerable sovereign ... Why was he waiting here?It would be easy to seize the world!Just as he was thinking about this, the voice sounded again. "You're not a smart kid. Don't try to guess me. Besides ... If I really want to take over the Silver Moon world ... When I see venerable the sword the next day, he'll kill me with a sword. Are you going to help me?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù"We're all acquaintances ... The Zheng family can do it, the Li family can do it, we're all newcomers, we're all powerhouses of the later era, we can even take the Crimson Moon ... Only US old people can't take it! "People don't care about the younger generation's misbehavior, but we're all from the same generation. If you seize it, the human King will beat you, the sword Master will beat you, the blood master will beat you, the Supreme Master will beat you, the Emperor Cang will beat you ... They will say that you have the ability to seize my land of new martial arts and the small world. Who do you think ... I can beat?"The king of Dali was dumbfounded. There was such a thing?But ... But ... It seemed to make a little bit of sense."Then ... Then, if senior is really ... Really strong ... Why don't you do something to calm the chaos and appoint someone to control the world ... For example ...""Like you?"The voice rose again,"why?" Why should I make a move? What does it have to do with me? I'm not from this generation! The sealing of the Stargate was done by the sword Saint, and it had nothing to do with him. Whether he was here or not, he could just pretend that he was not here! The development of the times and the development of the great Dao, was it not an opportunity? Cutting off one's fortune is like killing one's parents ..."The Dali King was speechless!The voice continued,'as for the designated person ... The designated person is a good person? Who knows! There are so many ingrates. Besides ... What benefits can they give me? I don't need any benefits! So, don't expect me to help you with anything. The only thing I can help you with is that you don't leave the Li Dynasty. If someone wants to kill you, I can help you collect your corpses!"

The first sentence was to protect them, but the next sentence was to collect their corpses!As soon as he said that ... The two of them broke down.So, you won't care if we get killed here?Just collect the corpses?The king of Dali had completely given up and said helplessly,""Forget it, I understand what senior means! Then let me ask you one more question, is Li Hao ... A Heavenly King?""I don't know,""You don't know?""Heavenly King ... Is there a Heavenly King level in the new Dao? No... How would I know? The great Dao was different, so why did he have to substitute it into the origin? Strong or not, let's see who's stronger!"At this moment, the two of them knew that this was an expert who did not care about anything.I don't care about this, I don't care about that, what does it have to do with me!This kind of guy was so annoying!Of course, to some people, such an existence ... Was actually very comfortable. If you don't care about me, I won't care about you either.The king of Dali did not count on him anymore and said,""Senior, I have one more question. Li Hao asked Zhou Chuan to come to the Li Dynasty to study the skeleton with me in an attempt to reach the Dao integration stage. Zhou Chuan seems to have inherited the Golden body of a powerhouse ... Is this a trap?"The voice rose again,"of course there is. You idiot, you definitely can't win against this guy full of schemes!" Zhou Chuan had inherited the nine transformations golden body Dao! Do you know what the nine transformations golden body means? If he reaches the Dao integration stage, he'll have to consume 81 times the resources of others. One Dao integration expert is equivalent to 81 Dao integration experts. Once he reaches the Dao integration stage, he'll be able to fight a Heavenly King!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äùp "I don't think it's enough to give all of your bones to Zhou Chuan. I'll have to put your pair of boxing gloves on them as well. With all the resources of the Li Dynasty, Zhou Chuan can probably reach the Dao integration realm!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe king of Dali was dumbfounded!The voice continued,"the nine transformations golden body. The first transformation of the Golden body means that he's an expert of the same level. The nine transformations all the way consume a lot of energy each time. Once he completes all nine transformations, he'll definitely reach the Dao integration realm. Is there a third transformation now?""...I don't know. I'm probably at the middle stage of the sun Moon realm ...""Then at most, rank two!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù"Then ... Then I promised to help Zhou Chuan reach the Dao integration realm ... I didn't ..." The Dali King was on the verge of a mental breakdown."Do as you see fit. You've agreed, but if you can't complete it, you'll have to think of a way!"There was a hint of a smile in his voice."You can absorb all the power from the skeleton. Perhaps you can attain the so-called Heavenly King level. Perhaps you can give it your all and fight Li Hao to the death. By then, what's the big deal about breaking your promise?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù"Senior ... Are you joking with me?" the king of Dali was completely dumbfounded.Even if I become a Heavenly King, I might not be able to defeat Li Hao!"I can't do anything about that. Do as you see fit. Do you expect me to help you with something you've promised? I'm not your father, and even if I was your father, I can't do anything about it. I'm poor, and I don't even have a place to stay. The heavens are my blanket, and the earth is my bed ... Don't come looking for me in the future!"The Dali King's face was full of sorrow!I ... I've really been tricked.How could Zhou Chuan consume 81 times the resources of the same level to advance?That was impossible!  Best novel online free at ùô£Oùô´ùôöùô°ùôóùôûùô£ To think that it would not even be enough to give him all the bones ...This ... Was unbelievable!"You may leave!" At this moment, the voice sounded again. The king of Dali had no choice. He dragged the skeleton with heavy steps and left with Jiang Li in frustration.It was really ... A promise that made people despair!After they left, a shadow appeared and muttered,""Test me? Why! Even the human Emperor won't care. If the sky falls, you'll have to take responsibility, so why should I care about you?"Looking up at the sky, he calculated for a while and laughed,""I'll sleep on my own. Don't disturb me anymore. It's a pity that it hasn't been completed after a hundred thousand years ... How troublesome!"As soon as he finished speaking, he completely disappeared.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.In the Western Region.The Queen was currently absorbing the power of the Silver Moon to strengthen herself when she suddenly opened her eyes. In the distance, two figures appeared. Ying Hongyue's face was a little pale, and beside her was the flying sword immortal who remained in his original appearance."Your Majesty ..."BOOM!The heavens fell and the earth cracked!The power of the Silver Moon shattered the world.A burst of sword intent erupted and pierced through the heavens and earth. However, he was still forced to retreat several steps. The flying sword immortal coughed out blood non-stop, and Ying Hongyue's face became even paler."Your Majesty, I ...""Get lost!""Get lost, you jinx!" The Queen shouted coldly. If Li Hao didn't want to kill you with his own hands ... I would have killed you right now! Are you leaving or not?"This jinx actually came to find him!Did he really think he was an idiot?She couldn't be bothered to listen to him. She only knew one thing: Li Hao had been keeping an eye on this guy. Li Hao wanted him to be deserted by his friends and family, making him live in fear every day. Whoever got involved with this guy would die without a doubt!This fellow had been scheming for so many years. Who else was around him now?There was only one flying sword immortal ... There might be a problem.It was hard to say if he was alive.Who would want to mess with this guy?"Your Majesty, I have a way for you to go one step further and replace the real Moon Goddess ..."BOOM!A bright moon shone on the ground, and the power of countless silver moons swept over. Seeing this, Ying Hongyue did not say another word and quickly escaped!Crazy!I didn't even finish my sentence and didn't even give him a chance.He quickly disappeared from the spot.After they left, the Queen heaved a sigh of relief. Why is this jinx targeting me?It's better to get lost quickly!It would be safer to stay away from this fellow. Otherwise ... It would be too dangerous!The Queen looked at the central mainland with mixed feelings.He was indeed powerful, but ... He couldn't win against these people.

2302 Chapter 385
Could it be that he had been wandering around the world?It was really a headache, and there was nothing he could do about it.Although he was getting stronger and stronger ... But ...'Also, there are more and more Dao meridians in my body. Some of them are getting stronger. I didn't notice it in the past, but now ... Could this be a trap?'A trap in the Dao universe?Just thinking about it made him shudder.Had he been tricked by Li Hao?When he first met Li Hao, he should have been close to him. At that time, he didn't know that he had met Li Hao ... But that time, he felt an extremely close feeling. Now that he thought about it, it might have been unusual.Li Hao might have one of my Natal stars.In the past, she had never considered this, but now ... She felt that something was wrong. Li Hao might have been in control of her life and death, and even ... Plotting against the real Moon Goddess!If the true Moon Goddess wanted to descend and possess me ... Or take over my body, would Li Hao instantly descend and kill her on the spot?The more he thought about it, the more helpless he felt.They were all a bunch of bastards!Today, she was indeed thinking more than before, but she always felt that she was living in the shadow of this group of people.Looking at the Silver Moon land, he felt like he had no hope. He didn't know if he could walk out of this cage one day!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Li Hao didn't feel much of a disturbance in the situation.In fact, he had not gained much from this battle.He didn't need these.In fact, the gains were all in the battle.This included the improvement of his will and momentum, killing the Heavenly King, snatching the venerable sovereign's blood essence, and the success of his scheme ... To him, all of these were huge improvements, both in confidence and in strength.Waiting passively was not the result Li Hao wanted.The recovery of the world was getting faster and faster.Was it far from the pseudo-Emperor realm?With such a passive stance, when would he be able to resist a pseudo-Emperor?Those who could achieve great things would not wait passively. Only by taking the initiative to attack and seize opportunities would they have a chance to succeed. Opportunities were created for themselves, not just by waiting.At this moment, the five big cities rumbled as they were teleported into the great Dao universe by Li Hao.The five big cities stood under the starry sky. Below them was the rolling river. Of course, no one noticed this at the moment.After the five cities entered the Dao universe, Li Hao no longer cared about the rest. He disappeared into the Dao universe alone.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The ruins of Star Town.It was very quiet.No one else came here.At this moment, Li Hao arrived.The throne shuttled through the void, bringing him into another space-time. It was still the same saber, exuding a terrifying pressure. It was the might of a venerable sovereign!He couldn't get close! p Even at this point, Li Hao was still unable to get close.It was only at this moment that he could feel how weak he was and how powerful a venerable sovereign was.Emperor might!He did not come here to snatch the saber, but to resist the venerable sovereign's pressure. He wanted to familiarize himself with the venerable sovereign's pressure so that he would not be at a loss if the red moon sovereign suddenly released her pressure!This was Li Hao's real purpose.His qi and blood surged.Li Hao sat cross-legged, resisting the emperor's might and cultivating in silence. All kinds of forces kept emerging. He would cultivate here these days to familiarize himself with the emperor's might. When he no longer trembled and dared to draw his sword, he would even dare to attack Red Moon sovereign!It didn't matter whether they could win or not. What was important was to break the fear in their hearts.Li Hao opened his eyes and kept looking at the saber.The blood-red long saber stood in the void.There seemed to be a sleeping cat among them.The cat ... Emperor Cang?It shouldn't be.A descendant of Emperor Cang?Maybe not!Li Hao didn't know exactly what it was. If there was anyone in this world who knew, it would probably be the God of beginner martial arts. The power of belief was born in the Li Dynasty, but it had disappeared all the time.Li Hao guessed ... That it might be here!The one they believed in was not that one, but this one!The power of faith had been devoured by the man, the knife, and the cat.He had a vague guess that perhaps the faith of the Li Dynasty was to revive this cat and wake it up from its deep sleep. The God of beginner martial's mission might be to protect the cat's consciousness.It should be related to the blood Emperor!Revered sword probably knew about it, but he didn't stop him. Instead, he chose to acquiesce. He even allowed the other party to carve out a territory in the land of Silver Moon to collect the power of faith.One must know that at that time, the gods were all killed, and such belief in the divine Dao was not allowed."The human king's sword and inheritance are here, and the celestial ruler's gloves and inheritance are here ... Maybe, they are all for this guy?"Li Hao made a judgment in his heart. What was the use of these inheritances?At present, it didn't seem to be very powerful.Then what was the point of leaving behind an inheritance?Just to prove that they had been here?Or could it be ... That it was not really an inheritance, and he was just here to take a look?Li Hao gently rubbed his temples. He was thinking too much. He didn't know if he would go bald.After thinking about it, he couldn't help but wonder if there was any hope of entering the seal. If there was just a tiny bit of hope ... To seize the initiative?That was a venerable sovereign!In fact, it was safer to sneak into Hurricane city than to seal it, but ... Hurricane city's control was very strict, especially after the destruction of Thunder City. Zheng Yu would definitely not give him such an opportunity again."If I want to turn the situation around, the only way is ... That star. But I've lied to him before. The Galaxy and the star didn't change much, and he's no longer interested. Even if I try again and find no new changes, I might not be able to find that star again ..."

2303 Chapter 385
Li Hao kept thinking.Perhaps, he would gain something if he went to sword city. Sword Saint had lived there for many years, so he might be able to find some unique insights of Sword Saint. Also, if the Li family were all killed, what would his status be?He suppressed the thought and once again comprehended the might of a venerable sovereign!The immense pressure forced him to retreat continuously.The feeling of qi and blood being depleted!At this moment, Li Hao took out two words: Zhan Tian!This was also left behind by the blood Emperor!Sure enough, as soon as these two words appeared, the pressure was weakened a little, and Li Hao could even continue approaching the saber.  Best novel online free at ùô£Oùô´ùôöùô°ùôóùôûùô£ Li Hao, on the other hand, was also very bold. After some consideration, he covered himself with the word and continued to approach the blade. He only stopped when he could see the cat clearly.It was a fat cat, and it seemed to be sleeping.Li Hao glanced at it and was a little lost.This knife ... Seemed to be the other party's Shack.Using a venerable sovereign's saber as a Shack was indeed extraordinary.The next moment, the two characters disappeared. Li Hao took the initiative to withdraw them. A powerful pressure mixed with saber intent erupted instantly. With a boom, Li Hao's body was instantly broken, and he was sent flying in the blink of an eye!Blood flowed!The throne appeared, and Li Hao was instantly taken away and disappeared.This was exactly the result Li Hao wanted.He could feel it at a close distance and experience the impact at a close distance. This saber did not have any killing intent. It was the most suitable for him to familiarize himself with the power of a venerable sovereign.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Again and again, Li Hao entered the ruins, ignoring his injuries.Every time, he would try to touch it up close. He even wanted to touch the knife ... It was evident how bold he was!Here, he had gained quite a lot and even gained some insights.If there was another eruption of the venerable sovereign's blood essence, at least Li Hao would be able to react. He would not need to rely on the power of the river and the weak power of time to weaken the power of the venerable sovereign's blood essence to suppress it.At this moment, Li Hao, or rather, this body, had already opened 105 meridians.He was very close to reaching the third level of the Dao integration realm!However, with this kind of strength, he might be able to fight some fake Heavenly Kings ... But if he were to encounter a true expert, he would only be courting death.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Li Hao had spent a lot of time comprehending the venerable sovereign's pressure.It had been a full month!Now, Li Hao's training time was getting longer and longer, and it was often more than a month.Time was also moving towards July. At this moment, it had been exactly one year since Li Hao had officially stepped into the gate of martial arts. It had only been four years since he had started practicing the five birds technique.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Silver City.Now, it was frighteningly quiet. The ruins stood between the sky and the earth. As the Silver City continued to erupt with war and the aura of experts, there were no living things left in this place.Hurricane city did not seem to be standing there any longer.Zheng Yu wasn't too worried about what Li Hao would do now.Ying Hongyue didn't even dare to come here. She was currently being chased to the point where she wished she was dead. How could she still dare to escape back to the Silver City?It was in this place where all living things were destroyed.Li Hao had returned.Li Hao strode into a dilapidated courtyard. Things remained the same, but people had changed. It had only been a year, but this place seemed to have experienced countless years.Dust filled the air as the houses collapsed.The small courtyard where his teacher used to practice martial arts had already become a ruin.Li Hao entered the house. It was also a mess inside. There were only some traces of the past, showing the erudite nature of the owner.The books were scattered all over the floor, as if they had been flipped through.After Yuan Shuo and the others left, someone else had probably come. Perhaps it was for the secret skill of five birds.Putting away the scattered books, Li Hao stood in the empty room for a moment.After a long time, he said slowly,'I want to go and take a look ... If I can come back, perhaps ... I can win and resurrect you! If he couldn't come back ... Then there was no other way! You also said that you can't force anything, as long as martial Dao goes according to your heart! Zheng Yu and the others might be easier to deal with ... But they're all on high alert. We'll only have a chance if we catch them off guard and surprise them!""Teacher, please give me your blessings!"‚Äã Li Hao murmured softly.At this moment, he looked up at the sky. The seal was still there, but it was weaker than before. The eight blood veins also seemed to be in a mess.One could imagine how difficult it was to sneak into a venerable sovereign's territory with one's true body!Li Hao took a deep breath. Perhaps only time could allow me to sneak in without being noticed by venerable sovereigns."Contact me at any time. The moment you can't contact me ... Attack Ying Hongyue!" He said.Li Hao sent a message. Soon, Lin Hongyu's reply came."Alright!"As always, it was simple.Just as Li Hao was about to leave, he received another message.""Be careful!"Li Hao smiled but didn't reply.The figure disappeared in a flash. Soon, an illusionary figure appeared under the seal. A line of blood spread out. Li Hao pondered for a while. A sword wrapped around him, and he disappeared from where he was, leaving only a sword floating in the air.The sword slowly began to merge into the seal.At this moment, in the distant West, the battle broke out again. Several Saints were attacking one person crazily!It was Ying Hongyue!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Ying Hongyue's face was deathly pale as she continued to flee.In his body, the power of the Crimson Moon continued to accumulate.He looked back and coughed up blood. His eyes were a little gloomy."Lin Hongyu! If Li Hao could kill me, he would have done so long ago! You've been chasing me all the way. Do you dare to kill me?"Behind them, Lin Hongyu held her scimitar and said calmly,""If I can't kill him, I'll just seal him! Suppression was also fine! It's not bad to let you run away like a stray dog! The pain you've brought to my husband ... Can only be repaid in this way!"

2304 Chapter 385
Ying Hongyue coughed up blood and sneered,"husband?" What a joke! In Li Hao's eyes, you're just a chess piece! Li Hao only wants you to help him suppress the world. He's even more heartless than I am!"Lin Hongyu chuckled and said,"so what if it's a chess piece?" "I'm happy to do so. At least ... I'm in control of the world and everyone knows me, Lin Hongyu! I have power, authority, dignity, and everything ... Ying Hongyue, where are your women? But now? If they were all dead, how could he be called an amorous swordsman? People like you will only be ridiculed and abandoned. Even if your women die, they will be recorded in history and become synonymous with stupidity ... They will be spurned by the world!"Extreme mockery!Ying Hongyue's expression was unsightly. She didn't say a word as she tried to escape again.From all directions, experts were chasing after them.Lin Hongyu's voice continued to reverberate,"the taste of a stray dog, it doesn't feel good, right?" If you still have any sense of shame, why don't you just commit suicide, so that you won't be left with a bad reputation for the rest of your life? if you die, you can still be free!"Ying Hongyue ignored him.In his heart, he was boiling with anger.Damn it!Since when did Lin Hongyu dare to humiliate him like this?At this moment, another Saint blocked their way. Ying Hongyue was extremely furious."Why did you chase after me?"These people must have a purpose!‚Äã There must be!'Damn it!'Otherwise, the experts under Li Hao's command wouldn't have had nothing to do at this moment.If Li Hao really wanted to kill him ... He wouldn't have been able to escape that day.Even if a flying sword immortal attacked, Li Hao still had a chance to kill him, but he didn 'T. He was worried that the seal would break.The seal ...He quickly turned around and shouted,""You're chasing me because of the seal?"Lin Hongyu's heart skipped a beat. She smiled and said,""You guessed it? How amazing! He had calculated everything! You're right, it's for the seal. We have to break the seal and deal with the venerable sovereign ..."Go to hell!Ying Hongyue almost cursed out loud!It was wrong!That was a venerable sovereign, so he shouldn't be. Then what was the reason?Lin Hongyu chuckled."Alright, let's not play this anymore. It's boring!" Guessing back and forth is simply a waste of time for a stray dog like you. Strip away the eight great families "bloodline and I'll let you go!""Zhenxing city!"Ying Hongyue instantly understood and coldly shouted,"Delusional!"  Best novel online free at ùô£Oùô´ùôöùô°ùôóùôûùô£ That blade!So that was how it was!Li Hao tried in vain to deprive him of his eight great families bloodline and take that saber. I was wondering why these guys kept chasing him, but couldn't kill him.This explained everything!Lin Hongyu sneered,"you're asking for it!" Kill!"BOOM! In all directions, experts appeared one after another. In an instant, Thunder rumbled. In the dark, someone slashed out a sword of lightning to block all directions. His combat strength was also extremely powerful!However, at this moment, the sky cracked open and five big cities came crashing down."Li Hao!"Ying Hongyue's expression changed drastically. Li Hao had actually come. Only Li Hao could open a great Dao universe.In order to obtain the bloodline ... Li Hao had actually been in the vicinity all this time.He didn't dare to think too much. In an instant, his qi and blood exploded as his eight meridians merged into one. The power of the Crimson Moon was drawn out and covered his entire body. He fled instantly and didn't dare to stay any longer. He had consumed a lot of qi and blood!Lin Hongyu raised her brows and looked up at the sky. She shouted,""Continue the chase!"‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, within the seal.Red Moon sovereign frowned slightly.A faint Crimson Moon Power spread out as he muttered,""Little guy, it seems that you're quite injured ... Are you still unwilling to accept me completely?"After he finished speaking, he chuckled.However, this was a good performance. The more the power of the Crimson Moon was extracted, the more troublesome it would be and the harder it would be to expel. Recently, he had been absorbing it crazily. It seemed that he had been hit hard.After so many years, to be able to resist the temptation and the invasion of the Crimson Moon's power, Ying Hongyue still had courage and wisdom.However, from the looks of it, the person who destroyed thunderstorm city ... Might be dealing with him.A large amount of the Crimson Moon's power was being absorbed by the other party.If this continued ... Ying Hongyue would eventually become a part of him!It was a good thing!The shadows in all directions trembled slightly. Every time the power of the red moon was used, it would trigger the fluctuation of the seal. It was normal, so the red moon Emperor did not care.At this moment, at the edge of the eight trigrams Formation, a small sword, like cosmic dust, slowly swam along the edge.Every time he swam, the movement was very small and weak. Every time he swam, a special force would overflow and cover everything. Li Hao was extremely careful when facing a venerable sovereign, even if it was a sealed one.He's in!Li Hao was relieved that Lin Hongyu did not notice him the moment he entered. Lin Hongyu's timing was not bad. Although she was ambitious, she was reliable.Just like Qian Wuliang, he could get things done, but his ambition was not a problem.In the distance, an ancient city was silent in the dark void.This was Li Hao's first goal.He wanted to go to sword city to take a look.After entering sword city, perhaps he could hide his tracks and not need to be so careful. This venerable sovereign did not attack and occupy sword city, and Li daoheng did not take sword city away. This sword city might be a little special.He might even have left behind some methods of the sword venerable so that the two would not dare to touch sword city.The small sword was moving slowly.He was extremely careful!In front of a venerable sovereign, he could not afford to be too careful when sneaking into sword city. He was here to deal with the venerable sovereign, unlike Zhang an, who was here to deal with Silvermoon himself.

2305 Chapter 385
Li Hao didn't know how long it took him to move little by little.The small sword was trembling slightly.As it got closer to sword city, the small sword seemed to be somewhat familiar. It seemed to miss the city, but it was also a little restless.He's back!At this moment, the small sword suddenly scuttled. Li Hao actually felt that he had lost control of it. The small sword instantly drilled into the huge ancient city ahead. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The entire ancient city suddenly trembled.Li Hao cursed in his heart!'Damn it!'Bastard!This sword ... I really want to smash it.You've killed me!Within the sword city, there were even waves of sword intent.The ancient city, which had clearly been destroyed, seemed to have been revived at this moment.In the distance, the venerable sovereign suddenly turned his head. His eyes lit up as he looked at the sword city and sneered,""The people have already left. It's just a city. Although it's considered your old home, do you still want to rebel?"He didn't feel anything wrong because of this sword light. It was obvious that this wasn't the first time that sword city had been in a state of unrest. It had happened many times in the past hundred thousand years.Li Hao, who was extremely nervous, did not receive the venerable sovereign's thunderous blow.The venerable sovereign Hong Yue didn't seem to want to get close to this place.This made Li Hao feel a little more at ease, but he was also a little depressed. Damn starry sky sword ... I'll tear you apart and reforge you later. You're not obedient at all!At this moment, he was brought to a place by the small sword.According to Li Hao's judgment, it should be similar to the city Lord's mansion in other places.The place where the sword venerable had stopped?Or the place where the grandniece of the sword venerable, the real ancestor of the Li family, lived?The entire city seemed to have been completely destroyed.Only a small amount of sword intent remained in the city. The sword intent was like a rootless duckweed that covered the entire ancient city, giving the silent ancient city a little more life.The entire city was overflowing with sword Qi, and it could be seen everywhere.It was as if the city was a sword!A real sword!Sword city!As the small sword entered the sword city, the floating city suddenly started to move slowly. In the distance, the shadow of venerable the sword suddenly burst out with sword Qi from the corner of the eight trigrams!A sword came!The red moon Thearch snorted. This formation-breaking technique had been weakened several times over the years. However, the illusionary shadow of the sword venerable could still attack. It was really infuriating!However, this also represented how strong the sword Saint was.Even if it was just a Phantom, even if it was only maintained by the array, it still suppressed him for a full 100000 years."Li Changsheng, your illusion can't last much longer! When I break out of the seal ... The Silver Moon will definitely turn into a river of blood!"The shadow of the sword venerable did not say a word and attacked again and again! The Stargate above venerable sword's head also glowed with a faint light. A freezing force suppressed the world and the venerable sovereigns 'outburst. In other places, a few weak shadows also gathered their power and a huge Eight Trigrams slowly appeared.The venerable sovereign frowned slightly. Why was the eight trigrams Formation completely activated today?Had he been using too much of the Crimson Moon's power recently?As he thought about this, he quickly retracted the Crimson Moon's power and allowed his physical body to collide with all sorts of powers. The seals were set off with explosive waves of energy. At this moment, the distant sword city gradually entered the dark void.The venerable sovereign looked back and frowned slightly.He had always suspected that this ancient city was the real starry sky sword. Of course, he didn't have any evidence.Because he couldn't get close. The seal was one point. The other point was that when he tried to get close before, it caused the sword intent to burst out, even the killing sword intent of the sword venerable appeared. In order to not be seriously injured and completely sealed, he could only choose to avoid the city.If it was only li Changsheng's cultivation place, it should not have such power.So ... Perhaps this was the real starry sky sword. As for what Li Hao was holding, it might just be a replica, or a child sword of the mother-child sword. He couldn't tell."The longevity sword ... Isn't dead yet. How annoying ... Have the two sides started a war yet?"He mumbled. Had the Crimson Moon world and the neo martial world started a war?If the battle had started, longevity sword would have been the first batch of top venerable sovereigns to fight. But now, the shadow was still there, and the sword will was still there. The other party was probably still alive!At this moment, he sighed.The Crimson Moon great cosmos wouldn't lose, right?However, he couldn't care less about that. Right now, the only thing he could do was break the seal as soon as possible. Although he felt that the flow of time was different, no one was sure if it was true.However, the Crimson Moon great cosmos shouldn't have been completely defeated. Otherwise, he would have been severely injured.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, Li Hao was a little dumbfounded. Why did the city ... Move by itself?I'm not controlling it!I had just entered the city, and it seemed to move on its own. His expression changed slightly. Could it be that there were still living people in the city?If there was, why didn't Zhang an and the others appear when they came in earlier?‚Äã Li Hao was extremely vigilant. He was still hiding in the small sword, motionless.However, when he didn't move, the starry sky sword seemed to be attracted by something and began to move slowly. It seemed to be out of Li Hao's control, which made Li Hao so angry that he really wanted to break it!If something were to happen this time, it would definitely be caused by this small sword!At the same time, the sword essence in sword city was getting more and more brilliant.In all directions, waves of sword essence overflowed.In the city, there was a huge tree in the shape of a sword. It had long been broken into pieces, and only a few broken roots remained. At this moment, this broken tree seemed to move slightly, as if it had absorbed some special sword intent.In another place, a stone that seemed to be a Whetstone also exuded a faint sword intent. The stone trembled a little.At this moment, the stone was still stained with blood that seemed to have been silent for countless years.The entire city seemed to have been revived after the starry sky sword entered.However, there was not a single person.Only some remains were left.The sword city drifted further and further away from the Stargate area. It drifted in the dark Universe and disappeared. In the distance, the venerable sovereign took a few glances and gradually lost the traces of the sword city. He became more and more confused.This city had been silent for many years. Why did it suddenly show signs of recovery today?

2306 Chapter 386
Sword city.It was broken.Unlike the other main cities that were completely preserved, this city seemed to have experienced countless Wars. The city was covered in all kinds of sword marks.One by one, the houses collapsed.This was the main city, and it was the main city where the sword Saint was in charge of. It was protected by the sword will of the sword Saint, but now, it was in ruins.A small sword was moving in the middle of the city Lord's mansion.From time to time, a sorrowful cry could be heard.Sword city was really destroyed.In the city Lord's mansion, there were faint traces of blood. Even after countless years, it was still filled with the smell of war. Sword intents ran through the city, because ... A battle had broken out here!A group of swordsmen were fighting and killing each other in this place.Sword city ... Had internal strife!In the small sword, Li Hao silently sensed, experienced, and sensed ... He had guessed the outcome of sword city, but it was a little different from what he had imagined. An intense battle had broken out in sword city.Some people had resisted before, but they were not killed without resistance.Here, the sword intent represented the swordsmen.However, in the end, the resistance was still completely massacred.They were all dead!Li Hao walked out of the small sword and stepped into the sword city territory. Sword intent rose from under his feet and soared into the sky. As if he had sensed the return of the starry sky sword, sword intents swept over!The sword intent swept past Li Hao's body, making him feel the threat of death.Bone-piercing, cold, and sharp!This was the sword of the sword city!  Best novel online free at üá≥‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüáª‚Äãüá™‚Äãüá±‚Äãüáß‚ÄãüáÆ‚Äãüá≥‚Äã Li Hao looked around and sighed. Sword city was completely finished.The sword venerable, who had dominated the world in the past, couldn't protect sword city after he walked out of the Stargate. The descendants of the Li family might have died long ago. No, there might be Li Daozong and Li daoheng.As for himself ... He was 99% sure that he was not a descendant of the sword Saint. He was not even a descendant of his grandniece.To be honest ... He could only be considered an unrelated descendant after the starry sky sword had modified him.The Li family had the Li family's bloodline. It was very likely that it was because they had always been wearing the starry sky sword, which had influenced them for generations."I see ..."Li Hao murmured,"I was wondering why the bloodline of the Li family in front of me wasn't as strong as the bloodline of the Li family behind me."I thought it was atavism!'So that's not the case. My father's bloodline is inferior to mine because I've been modified more by the starry sky sword. As for my grandfather, he's definitely inferior to my father ...'The bloodline of the next generation of the Li family would be more concentrated than that of the previous generation. Therefore, in his generation, the Li clan had even produced a sword eye!In other words, it was the sword eye that could see through weaknesses. This was something that only a sword venerable had.Previously, he thought that it was a sign of atavism, but now it seemed ... Bullshit, he did not have the bloodline of the revered Sword Master. How could there be atavism? the Li family was not the descendants of the revered Sword Master. How could they atavism be the body of the revered Sword Master? Instead, it was the starry sky sword that had been modified from generation to generation!"I'm actually not considered a descendant of the Li family?"Li Hao chuckled helplessly, but he soon said,""But, everyone thinks so ... Even if it doesn't count, it does!"It had to be counted!If it doesn't count, isn't it not Orthodox enough for me to say that the world belongs to the Li family?If li daoheng were to say that this world was the Li clan's world to begin with ... And that he was more Orthodox than himself, then wouldn't he be struck to death?At this moment, Li Hao's mind was running wild.In fact, what did it matter if he was or not?A hundred thousand years later, countless generations later ... Who would care if it was the Li family's legacy?Perhaps, the sword Saint himself would not care.A hundred thousand years meant that there would be a total of five thousand generations of descendants!Was this still considered a descendant?If he really wanted to do it this way ... There was no way to do it.Perhaps his ancestors really did come from the Li family of sword city.Who dared to say otherwise?Holding the starry sky sword, Li Hao looked at the small sword.""So, you've been staying in my Li family for 100000 years, transforming our family generation after generation ... You're really the one who succeeded and failed. If you didn't transform, my parents wouldn't have died!""Of course, if it weren't for your modifications, I might not have been able to reach where I am today."It was hard to say.The starry sky sword had been sealed for 100000 years and had been remodeled unconsciously. It was just that the wearer was constantly penetrated by the little energy that overflowed from the sword. The starry sky sword, on the other hand, had the sword intent of a sword venerable, which was the easiest way to reverse the bloodline."Do you still remember who took you out that year?"Li Hao looked at the starry sky sword. Did li daoheng take it out?In order to continue the Li family's bloodline and activate the starry sky sword?Or was there some other reason?Or, was it really just an accidental loss?Unfortunately, although the starry sky sword had a little consciousness, it seemed to have dissipated a lot after it had been shattered the last time. Although it was almost fully repaired, it seemed to have lost its memory.Since he didn't get an answer from the starry sky sword, Li Hao had to investigate it himself.The most important person in sword city was still venerable the sword.Li Hao had some hope, but it wasn't too great. If there were any good things, li daoheng would have taken them away. Why would he leave them for him?Of course, there were some things that the other party definitely could not take away. For example, the place where the sword Master comprehended the way. There might be some true sword intent left behind by the sword Master, but he could not take it away, could he?There was also this city. With the eight major cities gathered, perhaps they could restart the world.In front of him, there were sword marks everywhere.Li Hao lowered his body and touched a sword mark that still had some sword intent remaining. A sword intent burst out and pierced Li Hao's palm. Li Hao's eyes flickered with golden light, as if he had seen a shocking sword intent burst out.

2307 Chapter 386
At this moment, a brief scene flashed through his mind.A swordsman drew his sword and slashed!When the sword was drawn, the essence, energy, and spirit would become one. When the sword was drawn, the person would die!An eternal sword mark was left in this place!"Sage!"Li Hao mumbled. This was a true Saint whose origin had not been severed!This sword seemed to have returned from the depths of time and space. Li Hao concluded that the Heavenly Kings of this era might not be able to withstand this sword. Perhaps, with one strike, the Heavenly Kings would be cut into pieces!"One strike of the sword will exhaust all of one's essence, Qi, and spirit. To be able to kill the Heavenly King of this era, and perhaps even stronger ... The sword Dao of the sword Saint!"The Li family's swords had a major flaw.It didn't last long!If one's essence, energy, and spirit were united, and one sword could not kill the enemy, one would die.Even the sword Saint was the same.The name of one sword Hero resounded throughout the new martial era.If I can't kill you, I'll be done for ... This strike wasn't just a random strike, but a strike that combined spirit, energy, and soul."The sword Saint didn't hurt the enemy ..."Yes. Li Hao took a look. The sword mark was intact, and there was no sign that it had been blocked.The sword mark was very complete!This meant that the other party had dodged the sword easily.If this person was li daoheng, then li daoheng probably already had the power of a Heavenly King a hundred thousand years ago. He was a very terrifying guy.This Heavenly King was a Heavenly King from a hundred thousand years ago, not the current one.Only the Heavenly King could easily avoid this sword.Li Hao was well aware of the Li family's sword. It had the ability to lock onto the enemy. If the enemy wasn't much stronger than you, they wouldn't be able to avoid the sword.Li Hao touched the sword mark and continued to walk forward.He had felt despair, determination, anger, and pain in that sword. This meant that the person who had performed the sword knew the person who had killed the Li family. It was indeed an internal conflict.This was the city Lord's Manor ... The front should be the office area, and the back should be where the Li family members lived.Behind the city Lord's Manor was an extremely huge house.From the entrance, there were sword marks everywhere. Countless sword marks were densely covered ... An intense battle had broken out here!Li Hao continued to touch the sword marks. Every time he touched them, he could feel a sword intent and a shadow flashing before his eyes. There were old people, children, women, and even children slashing the sky with swords!The Li family members were all swordsmen!"What a Kendo clan!"In his arms, the starry sky sword was trembling violently.Li Hao's eyes were also sharp. If it was li daoheng who did it, he was so vicious and ruthless!Exterminate the Li family! Even the children were killed. Why? What was he after?Just to kill more happily?Killing the enemy was one thing, but what was the big deal about massacring the entire Li family?"I don't think the sword Saint has mistreated him ... After the sword Saint left, he slaughtered the entire Li family ... This man ... Is too vicious!"This was not emotionless. The great Dao was emotionless!The so-called emotionless was just a state of mind. It adhered to the justice of the great Dao and had no self, no family, and no kin. It did not mean that it would kill people randomly. If it killed people randomly, it would not be called emotionless, it would be called animal.  Best novel online free at üá≥‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüáª‚Äãüá™‚Äãüá±‚Äãüáß‚ÄãüáÆ‚Äãüá≥‚Äã As they continued forward, the entire house was still filled with sword marks.But very quickly ... Li Hao discovered something unusual. There was no li daoheng's sword intent, or rather, no one's sword intent. He didn't know if it had been wiped out by him, or if ... This guy's sword intent was already so terrifying that every strike just happened to be able to kill, neither too much nor too little. After killing, the sword intent disappeared.The former wasn't a big deal, as Li Hao could do it.If it was the latter, to be able to control it so precisely while facing an enemy, then this person's sword intent was terrifying to the extreme!Who could guarantee that every time he killed someone, his power would not increase or decrease by a single point?He just happened to kill his opponent, and his sword intent dissipated, so did his energy dissipate?"The former means that the other party is an expert. The latter means that the other party is not just an expert, but an expert at the pinnacle of the sword Dao!"Li Hao made his judgment and continued to move forward. He saw the first house.He opened the room ... It was very simple, with a bed, decorations, tables, and chairs ...There was nothing else.It was unknown if the people inside had died in battle or had left long ago to fight.On the Li family's side, most of the people should have gone out to fight.The ones left behind should be a group of old and weak women and children.Li Hao frowned."When the sword venerable goes to war, the Li family's experts will definitely follow. An immortal like the ninth master is still in heaven battling city, so it's understandable that he doesn't go. If li daoheng is an expert, or even a Heavenly King ... Can't the sword venerable see it? Why did you leave this person behind?"Could the strongest man in the world really not see how powerful li daoheng was?Then why ... If the Li clan's powerhouses had all gone to war, it was still understandable for a few Saints to stay behind to guard the place. But if li daoheng was a Heavenly King, why did even a Heavenly King stay behind?There were more and more mysteries.Li Hao continued to walk forward. After walking through the entire Li family's mansion, he soon frowned.It seemed that ... He did not see the residence of the sword Saint.As a venerable sovereign, it was reasonable to say that a mansion should not be so ordinary if it existed. There was nothing special in the entire Li family courtyard.Li Hao frowned.Not only that, the library in the mansion was also empty.The Treasury seemed to be empty as well.Anyway, when he opened them, they were all empty. They had been ransacked."Nothing!"Other than comprehending many different sword intents, he really had gained nothing.

2308 Chapter 386
Li Hao smiled bitterly!He was really ... Helpless!The most important place in the huge sword city should be here, but there was nothing here. Was he going to waste his time here?He had sneaked into the sword city at the risk of being killed by a venerable sovereign.He was still wondering if there were any gains here that could be used to deal with venerable sovereigns.Good Lord, there was nothing!Didn't venerable sword live here?,m Li Hao fell into deep thought.After thinking for a while, he suddenly floated into the air and looked around the entire city. There were many places in the city that were filled with sword intent.Apart from that, there was another place where the sword intent was thick.Li Hao's heart moved, and he quickly rushed over.It was said that there was a sword tree in sword city. As a Guardian monster plant, it must have been left behind to guard the city. Had this tree been killed or something else?This should be an expert at the Saint level.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Li Hao rose into the air. Since sword city was moving, he could no longer see the venerable sovereigns. He was much bolder and quickly landed somewhere.Very quickly, he was moved.He left the place again.This seemed to be an Academy!"Magic City University of martial Sciences, Xuanji sword City branch!"Li Hao landed at the entrance, and his heart skipped a beat. This ... Seemed to be very unknown, and he had not heard many people mention it."Mcmau!It was the place where the human King had studied, where the sword venerable had taught, where a large number of venerable sovereigns had been born. Zhang an had also studied in mcmau before. Many, many powerhouses had studied here.However, Silver Moon still had a mcmau branch?He was not famous at all!He knew about Silver Moon martial Sciences University. It was the Academy where the eight great families trained their children. There was also Yuanping martial Sciences University, which trained the descendants of venerable sovereigns."Mcmau is such a well-known University. If it has a campus, it should be quite well-known.Moreover, they were in sword city.The eight main cities did not have any martial arts universities. They only had one, and that was Silver Moon martial arts university. Other than that, there were no other martial arts universities in the eight main cities.But there were a lot of primary and secondary schools."That's strange ... I've never heard anyone mention it. Even the ninth master didn't mention it. If there's a martial arts university in sword city, why would the ninth master go to Silver Moon martial arts university?"Li Hao was a little confused."Venerable the sword was once mcmau's teacher. It's normal for him to build a sub-academy here, but why isn't he famous?He had also never heard of anyone from this sub-academy?The entrance to this Academy was very large, and it seemed to occupy a large area.The place with the second densest sword essence in the city was here. The surroundings were quite empty, with almost no buildings.Li Hao looked at the large characters outside the school gate, which were a little glaring. Could it be that ... This was personally written by the sword venerable?Li Hao quickly approached!When he looked carefully, he vaguely felt the sword intent. He was about to touch it when a character exploded with a bang, and bloody wounds appeared on Li Hao's hand!Li Hao's expression changed. The next moment, he snorted. "You're really good!"The sword intent was very strong, and the words were very strong, but ... In fact, the words had been dug out by someone, leaving only some afterimages. Obviously, these words could really have been written by the sword Saint, just like the two words "Zhan Tian."Unfortunately ... Li daoheng had taken it."Ten words, eight more than Zhan Tian ... Li daoheng!"Li Hao gritted his teeth. This was probably the greatest harvest this time. Good Lord, it was poached by this grandson. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  After blowing up one of the Phantoms, Li Hao had yet to touch the other characters. In an instant, the other characters exploded one after another. Ten thousand sword intents burst forth. Li Hao retreated instantly and drew his sword to slash!Bang Bang Bang!With a series of sounds, Li Hao shattered the overflowing sword intent. If he wasn't strong enough, he might have been able to kill an ordinary Saint.Was this a warning left behind by the other party?The school gate, which was originally a little magnificent, suddenly looked a little down and out without these few words.Li Hao strode into the campus.There weren't any sword marks here. It seemed that no one had been here in the past.The entire school seemed to be newly built.Li Hao had a vague idea. "Don't tell me ... It was built later? The school hadn't even started to recruit new students when war broke out, so this place was abandoned before it could become famous?"There was still a possibility.If that was the case ... Li Hao felt a little regretful. A school that had yet to open had only a few words at its best. Now that it was gone, it meant that there was almost nothing good in this place.However, at this place, there was sword intent overflowing behind him. A battle should have broken out here.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Li Hao continued to walk toward the back of the Academy.A large, broken tree suddenly stopped moving and returned to its deathly stillness, as if it had completely died. All that was left was a body full of sword marks and a root that had been cut off at the waist.A moment later, a figure appeared.It was Li Hao!Li Hao also saw a tree. It was completely broken, with only a few roots left. The broken roots were like sharp swords, rooted in the ground."Sword tree?" Li Hao was startled.The sword city's Guardian monster plant was not at any other place, but in this newly built campus!He was dead!There were only a few stumps left on the tree. The roots were broken and in a mess. To ordinary people, it was a good thing, but to Li Hao ... It was worthless.This place was the area where he had sensed the extremely rich sword essence.He examined it carefully. He could vaguely feel two sword essences clashing.

2309 Chapter 386
Obviously, li daoheng had paid a price for killing the sword tree. The two sides had fought here. This tree was Raised by the Sword Master. It was said that the sword Master had been practicing his swordsmanship under this tree.This tree could even be considered the direct descendant of the sword Saint. Strictly speaking ... He could even call the human King senior brother!"The peak of the Saint plane?""Even the sword tree planted by the sword venerable was killed ... That guy is a little scary!"Li Hao mumbled, feeling a little regretful.He sighed and said,"it's a pity that the Li family and this tree couldn't protect sword city. It seems that the sword venerable has miscalculated!" Galaxy Sword, we're a hundred thousand years too late ... Otherwise, we could have tried li daoheng's sword!"Without a sound.No one responded.There was only one huge tree in this place.Li Hao said regretfully,"it seems like there's no hope!" The Silver Moon world bestowed by the human Emperor is about to fall into the hands of the enemy. What a pity!""I wanted to find some ways to deal with Zheng Yu, the venerable sovereign, and Li daoheng, but I found nothing!"Li Hao said something unceasingly, somewhat resentfully.The starry sky sword in his hand trembled slightly and let out a cry-like sound.The sword city was gone!At this moment, Li Hao sighed again and again. With golden light flashing in his eyes, he said,""Even if I inherited the sword eye of the sword Saint, what's the use?""If I'm not strong enough ... What can I do?""After cultivating for a year, I can only kill a few pseudo Dao Heavenly Kings ... What can I do?""Everyone says that I can raise the Li family's prestige again and take back the Li family's territory ... But ... The enemy is strong, how can I take it back?""Little sword, little sword ... There's no hope in this life. Perhaps we can't even leave this place. Perhaps you and I will have to spend the rest of our lives here!"Li Hao was extremely bitter. Sighing, he waved his sword and attacked!His essence, Qi, and spirit united as one, and his long sword pierced through the air. "I'm too late! I have the will of the sword Saint, but I don't have the strength to match it ... I don't have the time to cultivate for a year!""The seal is broken. Venerable sovereigns run amuck. This is fate!"The sword intent swept across the world!At this moment, a faint and almost imperceptible spiritual energy emerged from the broken tree.There was no sound, no movement, just silently observing.Li Hao brandished his sword, as if he was extremely depressed, and pierced the sky!In the end, he sighed."Forget it. If it's gone, then so be it. The sword tree is dead. Dig out the roots and bury them!" When the seal is broken, sword city will be completely destroyed ... Starry sky sword, you and I will also be buried here! That's good!"He raised his long sword and was about to dig out the roots.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The broken roots stood still.As Li Hao approached, he even raised his sword to dig. Suddenly, the root trembled, and a sword intent headed straight for Li Hao!Li Hao was shocked and swung his sword!He shouted angrily,"who's the demon?" He dared to attack the direct disciple of the sword venerable! I'm the direct descendant of the sword Master, the new master of the starry sky sword. This is sword city, how can you be so presumptuous?" ‚Äã As soon as he finished speaking, the long sword went straight to the tree stump!At this moment, an extremely broken and tottering shadow appeared. From its appearance, it was actually a woman ... Extremely weak.At this moment, Li Hao's heart skipped a beat!The sword tree was female?In fact, he had already noticed something unusual. This place was obviously different. The moment he approached, he sensed something special. Of course, Li Hao guessed that it might be a descendant of the sword tree ... Like the Emperor guards!It was an old tree giving birth to a new tree.But now, it seemed that this might not be the case.Because this shadow was so weak and broken, the old tree gave birth to a new tree. It was not like this. Although the Emperor guards were weak, they did not have this form.This was obviously the shadow of the sword tree. The other party was still alive!However ... It had been so many years and he had not recovered at all?Or could it be that it was more serious in the past, and he had already recovered a little?Li Hao was actually very happy. There was finally a living creature!As for whether it was a male tree or a female tree ... That was not important.Supreme Sword remained unmarried ... Li Hao was too lazy to gossip about this. He had said all that just now to lure out this tree. It must be worried that it would be an enemy!At this moment, it had appeared, which was a good thing!The illusionary figure was on the verge of collapse, and sword intent appeared on its body.He couldn't see its appearance clearly ... But from The Phantom, it should have a good figure in human form.He ignored Li Hao's sword and said weakly,""How did you get here?""Who are you?""Why play the fool?" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The female swordsman seemed to ignore Li Hao's question. Her voice was weak, but she remained calm. "Didn't you say all this to lure me out? I'm out.
