‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ At this moment, it wasn't just Li Hao's side.The other three venerable sovereigns also saw many Yin swirls in front of them, and their expressions changed.Emperor Min Han almost cursed.He didn't have many Yin swirls around him, only five, but they were all mid-grade Yin swirls. These things were indestructible, and they couldn't be killed.If he encountered five ... Forget it, run!At this moment, Sui han could not care about anything else. He had to escape first.In an instant, the four venerable sovereigns in the huge Dark Divine Palace were all running away.In the dark, the yin swirls followed them like shadows.A burst of laughter came from the depths of the hall.Should he still cultivate?Still trying to be mysterious?Let's chase him for three days and three nights, and we'll talk about other things after we survive.This was how cruel the darkness element was.If he could survive, then he would talk about other things. Otherwise, there was no need to talk about other things. Best n0vel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã ùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìã‚ÑØùìÅùí∑ùíæùìÉ As for who would survive ... It would depend on luck.Of course, there were ways to solve it, but few people could do it. The darkness shrine was actually a test for the secret agents 'disciples in the past.The Outlander world had existed for countless years, and was boundlessly powerful. It had countless disciples. This was only the first stage, but it was enough to make people despair.There were only a few people who could really pass this round.That was the accumulation of countless years, and those who passed in the end could be counted on two hands.These people were all elite geniuses of the tianfang world.As he thought of this, the existence in the hall disappeared.I'll take a look again in three days.As for the three days, if everyone here died, even if the guy with the aura of the three messengers died, it would be because of his lack of skill. The yin Chi that chased them actually had a special characteristic, it was slightly slower than those of the same level.The stupidest way was to run for three days and three nights. If he didn't slow down and maintained his peak speed, there was still a chance of survival.Of course, the premise was that you could maintain your peak speed for three days and three nights after consuming so much energy ... That would be considered a genius. At the very least, it would prove that you had a strong foundation.No one had ever used such a method to escape. Even a top venerable sovereign would find it difficult to maintain his speed for three days at his maximum speed.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the main hall.Li Hao also wanted to curse.Damn it!There must be something wrong with this. There were dozens of Yin Chi chasing after him. More importantly, his domain had lost its effect. Once he condensed his domain, it was as if this place did not allow it. This caused him to be unable to block his aura and shake off these things."Why is this so?" "My domain can't appear because this place is considered the core of the dark Demon Ridge and it's suppressing my domain?"That was the only possibility.As soon as the domain appeared, it would lose control and shatter. Not only could it not hide the aura, but it would also cause the aura to spread out and attract more dark Yin swirls.Unlucky!Of course, being unlucky was one of the reasons. Li Hao suspected that there might be something spiritual in the dark Shrine, which was doing this on purpose.This wasn't a baseless guess.Everything was fine before, and now it suddenly became like this. This often meant that something was wrong.At this moment, he was holding the dark Dao accumulation crystal, so he could still see far.Suddenly, Li Hao's eyes flickered. In the distance, another venerable sovereign seemed to be being hunted down, followed by many dark puppets.The other venerable sovereigns from The Dark World?Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. He quickly changed his direction and avoided contact with his opponent.After avoiding the other party, Li Hao suddenly changed direction and ran forward with the other party. He kept following the other party, wondering if he could lure all the yin Chi that were chasing him to them.Don't chase me, go after him!The venerable sovereigns of The Dark World were all his enemies. He would rather they die than him.However, those malicious vultures behind him seemed to have set their eyes on him.Even though the other party had just escaped from his side and caused a great commotion, the yin Chi that was chasing Li Hao didn't leave.Strange.This meant that everyone was being chased by the yin Chi, and the yin Chi wouldn't be lured away to chase after the others?If that was the case ... It would be troublesome.In other words, just like the chaos lightning tribulation, it was targeted. Even if he attacked someone else's yin swirls, the other person's yin swirls would not attack him?At this thought, Li Hao's heart moved.Was it like this?"Undying and imperishable ..."He then thought of another property of the yin swirls. If he couldn't use his domain, these Yin swirls would be immortal. Even if he killed his opponent, the dense dark force here would quickly replenish these Yin swirls.Thoughts emerged one by one.Then, he looked at himself, who was constantly absorbing the power of darkness to complete the construction of his bridge between life and death ...The undying Yin swirls were filled with the power of darkness.The next moment, Li Hao had an idea. He quickly chased after the venerable sovereign who had just escaped. At this moment, The Dark Crystal in his hand covered his body as he chased after the venerable sovereign.This temple seemed to be infinitely large. Perhaps this was also a characteristic of a territory.Within the domain was heaven and earth.He quickly caught up to the other party, who was also a third stage venerable sovereign. The number of Yin Chi following behind him was not as many as Li Hao 's, only about seven or eight. However, for a third stage venerable sovereign ... It was still very difficult.Among them, there were three or four at the third rank, and the rest were at the first or second rank.

Chapter 2681 The Light Pole Commander (3)
At this moment, Li Hao had caught up with them. He didn't say anything, and his sword was silently drawn.Shadowless Sword essence!He stabbed his sword at a stage one Yin Chi, and a powerful force instantly exploded in its body. The stage one Yin Chi ignored Li Hao and allowed him to stab into its body.Li Hao's eyes flickered. He looked at the other Mantis and ignored him.He continued to pursue the other venerable sovereign.The same was true for the rank one Mantis that was about to explode. Ignoring Li Hao, it dragged its crippled body and quickly recovered before it continued to chase after the rank three venerable sovereign."As expected!"Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. He turned his head and glanced at the yin Chi that were chasing him ... If Pi han could help him deal with these Yin Chi, they would not resist and would only be killed by him.No matter how strong it was, no matter how much it could recover, it would still need energy.The power of darkness in this place couldn't be endless. As long as he killed until his hands went soft ... These undying existences would really die.It was a pity that ... This method did not seem very practical.Would Sui han help him kill these Yin Chi?Just thinking about it felt impossible.Of course, everything was unknown. What if mi Han's brain was muddled, or he thought that he could obtain the dark Tao accumulation crystal by killing these Yin swirls?Perhaps, the other party would also do it.At this moment, what he had to do was to kill the stage three venerable sovereign Yin Chi. If he could not kill him once, he would kill him a few more times. If he could break his opponent, he might be able to seize The Dark Crystal.If he could duplicate those dark crystals infinitely ... That would be even better.A moment later, Li Hao made a decision.As for killing these Yin puppets, this third stage venerable sovereign would be able to escape ... What did it matter?Killing the other party was not a simple matter.Having made his decision, Li Hao wasted no more time. He caught a level-one dark Mantis and killed it continuously. The other party didn't resist or counterattack, but only stared at the venerable sovereign.To Li Hao, it was just a target.A stage one target was too weak in Li Hao's eyes.What kind of expert was a target that didn't resist or counterattack?He kept killing this rank one Yin Chi with only one thought ... If it didn't drop a Dark Crystal, then he would continue to exhaust this guy and consume a large amount of dark power.The dark power of the dark Demon Ridge was definitely not endless. Otherwise, it would not require the blood essence of a venerable sovereign every time it opened.This proved that the Taoist connotation here was not as good as before. It needed the blood essence of venerable sovereigns as a trigger to trigger the appearance of the Taoist connotation, which meant that the energy here was actually limited.Once it was used up, he would need to replenish it from the outside world.As long as the return Dragon Emperor didn't fill it up, this place might not be able to show its Taoist connotation.In that short moment, Li Hao thought of many things. In front of him, the fleeing venerable sovereign did not realize that there was an extra person behind him who was killing the rank one Yin Chi madly. At this moment, he had no time to escape and had no time to care about this.As for the movements behind him, he would only treat them as the yin Chi's pursuit. He did not even dare to turn back for fear of wasting time.At this moment, he was even more anxious to find tuo han to save his life.In the huge Hall, the four venerable sovereigns were all fleeing.While Li Hao was fleeing, he was also killing the stage one Yin puppet. The surrounding dark energy surged into the body of the stage one Yin puppet.And Li Hao was no longer satisfied with such consumption.Soon, he started to kill the other Yin swirls while the first rank was recovering. After all, these things would not attack him.He didn't know who had programmed this ... Did this mean that everyone had to work together?Li Hao wasn't sure.However, he knew that if there was more than one person in the hall, as long as there were two people, both sides might be able to deal with the yin puppets in this way.However, at such a dangerous moment, who would help others deal with the yin Chi when they saw so many Yin Chi and their legs went soft?

No one would be grateful to him for helping them.The pursuit was still ongoing!During this period, Li Hao actually encountered another level three Supreme Emperor, but the other party saw a pile of dark puppets from a distance and turned to run without saying a word!He didn't dare to get close.At first glance, there were dozens of Yin puppets. The venerable sovereign was so scared that he thought they were the yin puppets who were chasing after mi han.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The chase continued for half a day.At this moment, Li Hao had already killed the Mantis dozens of times. When he killed it again ... With a loud bang, the dark energy in the surroundings stopped surging.Instead, there were some changes. A Dark Crystal dropped and no longer absorbed the surrounding energy.Li Hao's heart moved."A hundred times?" He seemed to have killed this first stage puppet a hundred times!In the end, the other party no longer resurrected, but directly exploded."What a trap!"Which normal person would kill a venerable sovereign a hundred times?If they could resurrect after killing him once, they would be in despair. If they killed him twice and resurrected him again ... At this moment, no one was willing to kill him again. Killing him again would be a waste of time and energy. They might as well run away.If the other party was still alive after being killed three times, 99% of the people would completely give up on killing.

Chapter 2682 Light Pole Commander (3)
Kill a hundred times ... Only Li Hao would do that if he was determined to exhaust the dark energy in this place.However, there were also benefits.Although he was exhausted, after killing the other party 100 times, he had also dropped a level-one darkness crystal and a Dao accumulation crystal. It was not bad.There were still some gains!During this process, Li Hao had also been consuming energy to build his bridges of life and death. Right now, he had exactly 250 bridges.Just like that, one of the yin Chi that was chasing after the rank three venerable sovereign had disappeared.During this time, Li Hao was actually killing other Yin Chi.With an accurate answer, Li Hao was immediately full of energy.Regardless of whether his energy was depleted or not, his opponent would be completely dead after he killed him a hundred times ... For Li Hao, this might be his lucky day. A Yin Chi that did not resist was actually quite easy to kill!It was easy to kill, and the harvest was not small.Although killing a hundred times was tiring, it was just tiring. There was no danger.At the same time, he could also help him sharpen his sword. Best n0vel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã ùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìã‚ÑØùìÅùí∑ùíæùìÉ Then, Li Hao continued to kill the yin Chi, one after another ...After the first time, the speed became faster.In front of him, the third level venerable sovereign who was still fleeing was exhausted and desperate. At this moment, he turned his head and saw that the number of Yin puppets in the darkness seemed to have decreased.He was instantly overjoyed.However, the next moment ... His expression suddenly froze. The number of swirls that had just decreased suddenly increased. Because the other party paused for a moment, Li Hao also paused for a moment, causing the swirls that were chasing Li Hao to catch up. The originally small number of swirls suddenly mixed together, and there were dozens of them.p The third level venerable sovereign was terrified!Why are there more?At this moment, he didn't dare to stay any longer and started to escape frantically.Li Hao, on the other hand, did not care about him at all. He continued to hunt down the yin swirls. They were all good stuff. The dark Dao accumulation crystal contained the Dao accumulation of a level eight venerable sovereign. Whether it was for personal cultivation or for Silver Moon cultivators, although it was not dark-type and not very useful for great Dao Comprehension, the pure energy contained in it was enough for them to cultivate for a long time."As long as I don't get killed by the yin Chi behind, to me ... This seems like a pretty good treasure hunting trip!"Li Hao was somewhat happy.As for his own audacity, it was not really that. He was sure that the energy in this place was limited and he could not use it without limit. Even if he did not get any treasures, it was necessary for him to kill these Yin swirls.It was definitely not the right way to keep running.As a venerable sovereign, he shouldn't keep thinking about escaping. He should be thinking about counterattacking and exhausting himself. This was the right thing to do.As for the dark great world, he had no idea what the other two venerable sovereigns had chosen.However, the man in front of him had been running without counterattacking or consuming the yin swirls. If it had not been for Li Hao's help, he would have been caught by the yin swirls and torn to pieces in a day at most.I'm saving this guy right now! At this moment, Li Hao had already killed three Yin Chi. There were five more Yin Chi chasing the other party, which was not a lot. These five Yin Chi had also died many times. The later they died, the faster they died.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, Li Hao seemed to have completed a treasure-hunting journey.The dark aura in the hall, on the other hand, had indeed been greatly consumed. Every time he hunted, a part of the dark aura would be obliterated, and then the other party would be resurrected. In the end, Li Hao would take The Dark Crystal.If this continued, the dark energy in the hall would be consumed at a rapid rate.Counterattacks and exhaustion were also the key to this test.It was almost impossible to achieve a simple hope of fleeing for three days and three nights.Finding the key in a crisis, having enough courage and courage to turn around and counterattack, and killing some Yin swirls, was also a part of the test of the dark hall.Killing other people's puppets was also crucial.However, very few people could achieve this. Most venerable sovereigns were lone travelers. Most of them relied on their individual courage to turn around and counterattack. They completed the pursuit with their powerful strength and extraordinary courage.The first trial that the secret agent had set up years ago was not only a test of cooperation, but also a test of individual decisiveness, strength, and courage ...He also had unparalleled endurance.These were the key to clearing the game.As long as he was satisfied, he could clear the game.Even so, most people were still unable to do it.As for killing them a hundred times, the dark ghastly Mantis would explode. This could be considered a small incentive set by the dark emissaries. However, very few people would get it.There were too few people who could persist until the 100th kill.At this moment, of the four venerable sovereigns in the hall, two were on the run, Li Hao was chasing after another venerable sovereign's yin Chi, and mi han, a rank five venerable sovereign, had chosen to fight back!As a fifth rank venerable sovereign, he still had some courage at the critical moment.He also knew that this was not the way to go.Even though he knew that the yin swirls were immortal, he still chose to fight back. He guessed that the energy of the yin swirls was not infinite. Of course, he also felt that the dark energy in the hall was weakening.Clearly, these Yin swirls were also consuming energy.As a result, as his counterattack began, the energy in the entire Hall was consumed at an even faster rate.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶One day.The venerable sovereigns in front of him were still running, but their speed was much slower than before.At this moment, the yin Chi that was chasing after him was all gone.

Chapter 2683 Light Pole Commander (3)
It was actually Li Hao's sinister Vulture that was moving.The other party was panting for breath after a day and night of escape. He had actually met his other companion once, but neither of them had time to communicate before they quickly fled for fear that the other party's sinister Vulture would join the ranks of pursuing him."Phew ..."The third level venerable sovereign was panting heavily.At this moment, he could still feel the tireless pursuit of the yin swirls behind him. Fortunately, he also sensed some movement. The dark energy in this place had been consumed.As for why it would be consumed, who knew?He only knew that as long as he could hold on for a little longer, he might be able to survive.The premise was that the power of darkness here had to be completely consumed.He panted, and his speed slowed down significantly.The moment he slowed down, a thin sword silently stabbed into his back.After Li Hao dealt with the yin puppets, he certainly wouldn't let the venerable sovereign get away with it.The other party had been running for a day and a night, and had used up the most energy.Li Hao could clearly feel the energy consumption in this place. Perhaps soon, the darkness here would dissipate. If he did not kill this guy now, he would have one more enemy when the three venerable sovereigns gathered.Since that was the case ... This time, Sui han would be the bald commander.The longsword pierced into his body!At this moment, the venerable sovereign felt that something was wrong. It didn't seem like a sinister attack.He turned his head and saw Li Hao's appearance. He couldn't believe it.Venerable Emperor Hao Yue?How was that possible?He had always thought that it was the yin Chi that was chasing him, so why was it Haoyue?Why was it like this? Best n0vel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã ùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìã‚ÑØùìÅùí∑ùíæùìÉ That was impossible!Also, behind Haoyue, there seemed to be a lot of Yin Chi.In the end, was it the yin Chi that was chasing after him, or was it chasing after Haoyue?Just as this thought appeared, the aura of death exploded in his body and his life force rapidly flowed out. He had already used up a lot of energy, and as the power of death continued to appear and his life force continued to be extracted, he became weaker.The dark energy in his body gathered together and he wanted to fight back. However, a destructive force burst out and froze the last bit of dark energy. The power of water and fire exploded in his body!The power of the great Dao in his body instantly collapsed.He was still in disbelief.This is ... Haoyue?First stage venerable sovereign?How could that be possible?The vitality in his body had completely disappeared. After running for a day and a night, a third level venerable sovereign was easily killed by Li Hao. A large amount of power of life and death fused into Li Hao's River of Life and death.This person could be considered to have been killed by the Dao of life and death. Li Hao smiled. Another one.The people of the Dark World are so nice. There are six venerable sovereigns, and I've killed three of them. The last one was killed by the yin puppet outside. Now, there are only two venerable sovereigns left in the entire dark world.His next target would be the remaining rank three venerable sovereign.The few malicious fiends behind the other party were also his targets.As for Xi han...The current him was still not his match.Li Hao wasn't worried about the yin swirls that were chasing him, because a lot of the power of darkness had been consumed here. If he used a little more, the yin swirls would weaken. If he killed them a hundred times, he would be able to harvest a large number of dark crystals.A moment later, Li Hao continued to stare at another venerable sovereign.At this moment, not only had he obtained a large number of dark crystals, but he had also built 10 bridges of life and death after a day and night of pursuit, absorption, and consumption. He had already built 250 bridges before.At this moment, the number had reached 260.He didn't know how much time he had saved.In the outside world, without any opportunities, Li Hao felt that it would take at least a year to build a bridge. This was actually very normal.If he wanted to reach the peak of stage three, he might need more than a hundred years.This was still him.If it was others, from the initial stage of grade three to peak grade three, they might need thousands or even tens of thousands of years.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Li Hao did the same thing to the second venerable sovereign.First, he had to deal with the yin Chi that was chasing him.One by one, they were killed.Dark crystals dropped one after another. The venerable sovereign was actually exhausted. Every time, he felt that he was going to die. He had no energy to run anymore and wanted to fight back ...However, every time he turned around, he would see dozens of dark Yin Chi, and he immediately lost his confidence.He could only continue to run!Fortunately, there was always a way out. These dark swirls did not seem to be as fast as before and seemed to be getting weaker. They were unable to catch up to him, which made him a little happy.Although he didn't know how long it would take to solve this problem if this continued, at least he wouldn't die now.More importantly, the dark aura in the hall was not as strong as before.He judged that if this continued, the darkness would dissipate after a day. At that time, it might be his chance.Li Hao obviously wouldn't give him such an opportunity. On the second night of Yin Chi's pursuit, he stabbed his sword into the body of the venerable sovereign, who had almost exhausted his energy. The power of life and death burst out and killed the last low-level venerable sovereign of The Dark World.This time, he had obtained a total of 18 dark crystals.In addition to the few pieces he had obtained earlier, he had used up two pieces. Now, he had a total of 20 dark crystals on hand.Behind him, the dozens of Yin Chi that were chasing after him were clearly much weaker than before.These were also treasures in Li Hao's eyes.If he killed these Yin Chi, he might be able to get a few dozen more.

However ... The darkness in the hall had dissipated a lot. There was only a thin layer of dark energy left. It was unknown how long it would take for the dark energy to dissipate completely. This speed was clearly beyond imagination.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶After spending another day, as the dark force dissipated, the yin Chi that was chasing them became a little weak.Although the yin puppets that were chasing him would counterattack or even besiege him, Li Hao dealt with them one by one. Gradually, the number of Yin puppets chasing Li Hao decreased.Very quickly, only a few rank three Yin Chi were left behind.In fact, at this stage, Li Hao would sometimes explode and drop dark crystals after killing the yin Chi dozens of times. Obviously, it was because he did not have enough dark energy.At this moment, in the distance, for the first time, Qiu han had killed a rank four dark Mantis.The moment he received the crystal, he still felt that it was a little unbelievable.This thing ... Could be killed?He was also covered in wounds and gasping for breath. He had used up a lot of energy, but he was still very excited when he got The Dark Crystal. It was a level four Dark Crystal, and it contained the Enlightenment of the dark great Dao of a level eight venerable sovereign.For more than two days, if it wasn't for the fact that he could constantly feel the dark energy dissipating, he really wouldn't have been able to persist.It was precisely because Li Hao kept killing the dark Mantis that the power of darkness was weakening. He sensed an opportunity and persevered until now, which was why he had gained so much.Mi han was overjoyed!Perhaps, this is my chance.He then looked at the remaining dark swirls behind him. There were five of them chasing after him, and now that he had killed one, there were four left.At this moment, the four dark puppets were all treasures in Chuhan's eyes.Although he had consumed a lot of energy, but ... If he killed these four Yin swirls, he would get four more dark crystals. The key was that two of them were level five Yin swirls. Best n0vel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã ùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìã‚ÑØùìÅùí∑ùíæùìÉ After killing a Yin Chi with such strength, the level eight Dao accumulation contained in the dark Crystal must be extremely rich!In his joy, Lai han did not care about his injuries anymore.He only had one thought ... To kill them!At this moment, Qiu han went crazy and started to fight back. On the other side, Li Hao was also killing the dark puppets that were chasing him. The dark energy in the hall started to fade.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶It took a lot of time.When Li Hao killed the last Yin Chi that was chasing him, he heaved a sigh of relief.However, his expression quickly turned serious.He had gained a lot in these three days.He had already collected 52 dark crystals ... This was an unimaginable amount of wealth.As for the bridges of life and death, he had built more. At this moment, there were a total of 280 bridges. In three days, he had built about 40 bridges of life and death. He didn't know how much time he would have to spend in the outside world.But here, it only took three days.He still needed 80 more to reach the peak of rank three. At this rate, he would be able to reach it in ten days to half a month.Unfortunately, the power of darkness seemed to be dissipating completely.Just as Li Hao was having such thoughts ...On the other side, Chuhan had killed the last Yin Chi with a single punch.A piece of Dark Crystal appeared. The joy in his eyes had reached its peak!The dark energy in the surroundings had completely disappeared at this moment.In fact, he had been hearing some voices and thought it was the remaining two venerable sovereigns. He also thought that it was not easy for the two of them to hold on until now.Now that the crisis was over and he had gained a lot, he was also happy.Just as he was about to pick up The Dark Crystal, he looked around ... As the darkness receded, although the hall was still dark, it was no different from daytime for a strong person.About tens of thousands of meters away, in the empty Hall, Sui han did not see anyone else. He only saw a person who was almost impossible to appear here.Haoyue!He was stunned for a moment and looked in that direction.Li Hao, on the other hand, was not surprised at all.He looked at The Dark Crystal at Chao Han's feet and was speechless. A Tier 5 Dark Crystal?This guy also made a fortune!"Greetings, Thearch drought!"Li Hao was quite polite, but Chao Han was stunned for a moment. He looked at Li Hao in disbelief."Haoyue?"How was that possible?What about the people from The Dark World?What about the other two venerable sovereigns?How could Haoyue be here!"It's me!"Li Hao smiled.This venerable sovereign seemed to have consumed a lot of energy.Of course, even if a fifth rank venerable sovereign consumed a lot of energy, there was a high probability that he would not be able to match up to it at his current stage. He was only a third rank venerable sovereign, and there was a huge gap between the two of them.However, there was nothing to be afraid of.Tuo han still found it unbelievable. The next moment, his eyes turned extremely cold,""Third rank?"He sensed Li Hao's aura. He was not a level one venerable sovereign, but a level three one!At this moment, Li Hao's progress was so fast that he couldn't hide his aura.Even the river of life and death was overflowing with energy.There were too many!"Where are my men?"He looked at Li Hao, his eyes even colder.Li Hao said innocently,"I'm not sure. I saw venerable Emperor Xin Han not long after I came in. Why? did the other fellow Daoists not come here?"Mi Han's expression became uglier.You just came in?Was that even possible?His expression was extremely unsightly as he put away the type 5 crystal without a sound. He even began to absorb some dark energy to make up for his consumption.

In his heart, he was on guard.Although this person was only at level three ... He was clearly only at level one before. Who knew if he had hidden his strength? moreover, he had consumed too much energy. Right now, his strength was not even half of his peak, only at level four.If this person was still hiding something, wouldn't it be terrible?More importantly, where are my colleagues?Why is there not a single one!Moreover, Li Hao was calm and composed, unlike him, who was still gasping for breath after exhausting himself greatly. Did this person really just enter?Many doubts appeared in his mind.He looked at Li Hao gloomily and said,"fellow Daoist Hao Yue has hidden himself well. He's actually a third stage venerable sovereign ...""Level 1 and Level 3 are only low levels!"Li Hao smiled and did not continue. Instead, he pointed at a small door in the depths of the hall.""Senior Chao Han, I think you should be more concerned about whether the door in front of us is a treasure land."They had barely touched the walls before, but now they found that there were barriers around them.At the end of the path, there was a door.At this moment, even mi Han's attention was attracted.Treasure land?The core of the darkness shrine?He was immediately overjoyed, but soon, he became vigilant. This Hao Yue ... Who was he?As a rank five venerable sovereign, he was now a little afraid of Li Hao.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.In the Great Hall behind the small door.Three days ago, the owner of the voice seemed to have just woken up and seemed to have seen something. He was slightly surprised."No more?"There was a lot of dark energy.It was actually gone!Moreover, the image also showed that there were two people left. This time, there were actually two people who were still alive, which was too surprising. Best n0vel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã ùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìã‚ÑØùìÅùí∑ùíæùìÉ The owner of the voice glanced at Li Hao ... As if he could see through the dark crystals on Li Hao's body, and couldn't help but curse. "He's too greedy!"No wonder it was gone!They were all killed by this guy.It could only be dropped after being killed a hundred times, but this guy had so many dark crystals. Did it mean that he had killed venerable sovereigns hundreds of times in three days?Although this was also one of the ways to clear the game, but ... Very few people had done this before.She was really ... Speechless. He had only taken a short rest to recover some energy, but in the end, the first stage of the dark hall had almost been destroyed by them.Damn it!Just as the two people outside, one pretending to be calm and the other a little vigilant ... Suddenly, a voice came,""The first stage has been passed. Both of you have passed. You may enter the second stage. Come in!"The two of them, who were initially at daggers drawn, instantly turned serious and looked towards the small door.The sound seemed to be coming from inside the door!This place ... There were still living people?An assassin?That was impossible!That was an eighth level venerable sovereign. If he was really here, he would have come out a long time ago. Why would he only appear now?If it wasn't the secret agent, then who was it?At this time, the two of them looked at each other and didn't say anything else. No matter what, this place was still extremely mysterious. They should put aside their grudges and take a look first."Senior mi han, please!"Li Hao was very polite. Sui han raised his eyebrows slightly and walked toward the small door without saying anything.Li Hao heard the other party's voice.""Fellow Daoist Hao Yue, let's put aside everything else for now. This is the place where the Dao reserves of a level eight venerable sovereign are located. If we can obtain some good fortune here, everything else is just a small matter!"Even though Li Hao's aura was only at the third stage, he didn't dare to be careless.He had some judgment in his heart. His companions might have been killed by this guy!This included those outside!This fellow was calm and collected in front of a Tier 5 expert like him. This made Xi han guess that this person might be a Tier 4 or even a Tier 5 expert.If that was the case, there was a reason why he was on good terms with Kong Ji.Perhaps, it wasn't just because of their friendship, but also because of their strength.Otherwise, a level five venerable sovereign would have been too polite to Li Hao. Kong Ji kept calling Li Hao "fellow Daoist" without any condescending tone."A hidden Tier 5?"Mi han thought to himself and was a little shocked. How did this person manage to hide so perfectly?He couldn't help but think!He was already exhausted from dealing with all of this, but this person was so calm. He felt like he had already killed all the yin puppets that were chasing him.In addition, at this moment, the Voices from the Inside of the small door made him give up the idea of probing.Let's enter first!Perhaps, the two of them would need to work together to deal with some dangers.

Chapter 2686 The Chessboard Of The Great Dao (1)
The small door opened.What came into view was an empty Hall. There was almost no decoration in the entire Hall except for a futon, which made people look sideways.Both Li Hao and mi han turned their eyes to the futon.Treasure?The core of the entire Dark Demon Ridge? Also, where did the voice just now come from?Just as the two of them looked at the futon, a figure appeared.Xin Han was shocked, and Li Hao also took a few steps back."Dark Demon Emperor?"Mi han was a little nervous. Could this be the eighth-rank venerable sovereign?"There's no need to be vigilant. "The illusionary figure appeared with a noble and illusionary appearance. Its voice reverberated,""I'm not the master of the dark Demon Ridge. I'm just a weapon spirit!"Artifact Spirit!The two of them instantly looked at the futon. Could it be that the futon had attained Dao?The chaosverse was omnipresent.It was not a rare thing for an Artifact Spirit to achieve Dao.However, it was difficult for the weapons of the strong to attain Dao. On one hand, it was because of the suppression of the strong. On the other hand, it was because the nature of the weapons of the strong was too strong. A strong nature made it difficult for them to give birth to spirits.If it was just an Artifact Spirit, it would be much safer.The secret agent was an eighth-grade spirit beast, but his futon couldn't be too powerful, right?The aura of this shadow was not easy to distinguish.The praying mat also seemed to have a reserved spirit aura, but countless dark auras were overflowing from the praying mat. It could be sensed that the dark aura of the entire Dark Demon Ridge came from there.This place was indeed the core of the dark Demon Ridge.Li Hao didn't say anything. Mi han was a little nervous, but he still said,""Senior, we've passed the first stage just now. What's the meaning of this second stage?"The shadow looked at the two of them, not in a hurry to respond."You're from The Dark World?"Mi han was shocked, but he still said,""Yes.""The Dark World ..."The mysterious man seemed to be a little emotional, and after a long time, he said,""I see that you don't have the great Dao universe, and The Dark World ... Has been destroyed?""Yes."Beihan became even more nervous.The mysterious man laughed."Don't be nervous. Many years ago, the secret envoy came from The Dark World.""What?"Beihan was shocked. How was this possible?A level eight venerable sovereign!If he was from The Dark World, how could there be no news about him? Best n0vel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã ùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìã‚ÑØùìÅùí∑ùíæùìÉ Li Hao was also shocked.The other party came from The Dark World? That would be troublesome!He had just killed several venerable sovereigns of The Dark World.How could an emissary from the Outlander world come from The Dark World?The next moment, the shadow said,"that's all in the past. In fact, there were some grudges between the dark Envoy and the realm Lord of The Dark World. Back then, the dark great Dao didn't have a master yet. The dark Envoy and the Master of Darkness had a conflict. Both sides wanted to seize control of the great Dao universe ... During that period, some accidents happened. In the end, the dark Envoy was defeated and retreated. He was brought to the tianfang world by the master and became the dark Envoy later."As soon as these words were said, the excited Sui han instantly became nervous.Was there a conflict?He had been excited just now because they were all from the same macro world, but now he was extremely nervous.A rank five venerable sovereign's emotions kept changing as the other party spoke.Li Hao was also secretly shocked.This person was clearly doing this on purpose.The next moment, the shadow seemed to look at Li Hao and asked,""Where are you from?"Li Hao's heart skipped a beat, and he said,"bright moon world!" It's just a small world ...""A small world?"The shadow seemed to be smiling.A small world?Indeed, he did not have the aura of the great Dao universe, but this person ... Not only did he have the auras of many emissaries, but he had also seen Li Hao's River of Life and death.The river of life and death had some signs of a Dao master.However, it was not the Dao universe.The experienced and knowledgeable illusory figure actually had some judgment. It should be a Dao River that was naturally opened with the power of ten thousand DAOs as its main Dao.Opening a Dao River was not considered a Dao universe.It could only be said to be the embryonic form of the great Dao universe.Was there such a person?There were!The chaosverse was filled with countless geniuses. Some of them had created their own Dao rivers, and some of them had limitless accomplishments. Some of them had only been a flash in the pan, and then quickly faded away into the masses.The path River was actually a rare thing, and the person who could open it was not simple.But ... For advanced venerable sovereigns, it was nothing.Wasn't controlling a mature Dao universe better than an incomplete Dao River?It was just a personal choice.But in any case, it was impossible for Li Hao to come from a small world. This was The Phantom's judgment. People from small worlds did not have such an opportunity or such insight to open up a Dao River.The other party should have entered the Dao universe and even controlled the Dao universe. It might be an immature Dao universe.As long as there was a universe of the great path, it would definitely be a great world.The mysterious man didn't say much. Everyone had their own secrets.Looking at the two of them, the mysterious man continued,"this is the secret envoy's cultivation place. Originally, the secret envoy was still here. No one was allowed to trespass!" Now that the dark emissary has left Tian Fang for countless years, this place has been constantly worn down. In a few years, it may completely collapse and become an ordinary land. ""The two of you are fated to be able to break through the first level and complete a test today ... It can be considered fate.""What's your purpose in coming here?"the mysterious man asked slowly.Chuhan hesitated for a moment, but still quickly said,""I hope to borrow some of Lord dark emissary's insights to strengthen the Dao of ultimate darkness and restore the great Dao universe of The Dark World! The great dark world was attacked by a powerful enemy, and the great Dao universe was shattered. The great Dao was severed, and the inheritance of the great dark was severed ... Now, senior, you said that the dark Envoy came from the great dark world, so there's even more hope!"

Chapter 2687 The Chessboard Of The Great Dao (2)
"How about you?"The mysterious man looked at Li Hao, who coughed and said,""I'm not too interested in the Dao of darkness or the Dao of darkness. I'm very interested in techniques like domain space and self-sealing heaven and earth!"The mysterious man was a little surprised. Domain, sealing the world?That was true!Perhaps the way it was said was different, but the shadow still understood. The entire Dark Demon Ridge was a domain space.The shadow was silent for a while before he said,'I can satisfy the request of this venerable sovereign from The Dark World! What you seek ... In fact, be it a domain space or sealing the world, the secret envoy doesn't really understand it. In fact, it was the master of Tian Fang in the past who helped the secret envoy establish the dark Demon Ridge. "Simply put, these things were related to the master of Tian Fang.The secret agent was not very good at this.Li Hao frowned slightly. The secret envoy didn't know much about this?The reason why he wanted to understand this was also the truth. In fact, it was also the key to perfecting his own River of Dao, including perfecting the heaven and earth, perfecting the Dao universe ... Opening the sky by himself. These were actually all very important.Beside him, mi han was also slightly shocked.The master of Tian Fang?Rank nine venerable sovereign!Tian Fang master was also the only level nine venerable sovereign recorded in the nearby region.Perhaps he was the only level nine venerable Emperor in the entire chaosverse.Of course, the chaos was too vast. Even the Lord of a major world might not be able to travel all over the chaos in his entire life. Therefore, it was unclear if there were still life forms, worlds, and rank nine Masters in other places.As for the master of Tian Fang, he was the only level nine venerable sovereign that everyone knew of.This darkglow Ridge was actually built by the other party for the secret envoy.And Haoyue, on the other hand, had a good appetite and good eyesight.He actually knew a little about the domain Li Hao mentioned, but ... It seemed to be something that only world Lords would be involved in.Of course, a small world's master might also know a little.He couldn't determine Li Hao's identity or strength.The mysterious man didn't say much and directly said,""If you pass the second stage, I can give you a chance to comprehend the Taoist connotation left by the dark Envoy, the origin Taoist connotation!"When Xi han heard this, he was instantly excited!The mysterious man looked at Li Hao."If you pass the second level, I'll give you a chance ... Since you know the structure of this place, you should also know that there's an essential core here. You can also sense the treasure. Whether you gain anything or not is entirely up to you.""The Dao is like this ... I can't give it to you directly. Even if I give it to you, you might not be able to comprehend it! The Dao comes from the heart, and as long as there is enlightenment in the heart, it is as much as you can comprehend. "When the two of them heard this, they were excited at first, but then they understood that there was a prerequisite, the second stage.Li Hao took the initiative to ask, what is the second stage?"Simple!" "This is the place where the secret envoy cultivates and comprehends the Dao," the mysterious man said casually."Everything is naturally related to the Dao! They also won't say that they'll let you fight each other to determine the winner and then decide whether to pass or not. That would be too childish. ""What the two of you need to do is actually very simple!"The mysterious man waved his hand, and a chess game suddenly appeared in front of the two of them.Although it was called a go arrangement, it was different from a regular go arrangement.The chessboard was horizontal and there was only one chess piece on the entire board.The mysterious man laughed,"see that?" There is a chess piece on the board that represents two people. From the starting point to the end, there are a total of 9999 squares. As long as you can move the chess piece and move through a thousand squares, you will pass the game!"After saying that, he said leisurely,"if you can pass 2000 squares, you can ask for another request. If I can satisfy it, I will!" If you walk 3000 steps and so on ...""In the past, the powerhouses of the tianfang world loved to play this game. It was called the Dao chess!"Li Hao and mi han looked at the chessboard at the same time.The chessboard was horizontal and horizontal, with 9999 squares.Moving 1000 squares was considered clearing the game?Li Hao's expression changed slightly after a simple examination.Both of them were venerable sovereigns, and they were not ignorant juniors. At first glance, the chessboard was crisscrossed, and each grid seemed to be a great Dao.How was this a game of chess?This was clearly a Dao-seeking!Yes, the struggle of Dao. Best n0vel online free at —Ä—ü‚Ä°¬´–≤–Ç‚Äπ—Ä—ü‚Ä°¬∑–≤–Ç‚Äπ—Ä—ü‚Ä°“ë–≤–Ç‚Äπ—Ä—ü‚Ä°–Ü–≤–Ç‚Äπ —Ä—ú‚Äú—ì–≤‚Äû“ë—Ä—ú‚Äú‚Äπ–≤‚Äû–á—Ä—ú‚Äú–É—Ä—ú‚Äô¬∑—Ä—ú‚Äô—ï—Ä—ú‚Äú—ì Mi Han's expression changed. He was good at the way of darkness, but that was all he was good at. At this moment, his expression changed and he said,""Senior, it seems that you need to be skilled in many areas in order to have a chance of completing it ...""No!"The mysterious figure gave a negative answer."If your Dao is strong, you can understand all DAOs! One ray suppressed ten thousand rays, so naturally, they could move forward smoothly! The dark Envoy was only good at the dark Dao, but he could go very far in the past!"Far, far away?Not clearing the game?Li Hao was a little puzzled, can't an assassin clear the game?"I can 't,"The shadow smiled."Although the secret envoy is strong, he can't complete the entire journey. Before leaving tianfang, the secret envoy played his last game of chess. He walked 8000 squares! According to the master of Tian Fang, completing 8000 squares means that you have the strength of a rank eight venerable sovereign. At the very least, you have not fallen behind in your comprehension of the Dao and have reached that level!""If I pass ... I'll be at the master of Tian Fang's level!""Senior, are you saying that a third level venerable sovereign can only walk 3000 steps at most?" Li Hao asked in surprise."That might not be the case!"The mysterious man smiled."A fifth-rank venerable sovereign can only walk 3000 steps, or even less. The key is your comprehension of Dao. A third-rank venerable sovereign can walk 5000 steps. It all depends on your perception of Dao."

Chapter 2688 The Chessboard Of The Great Dao (3)
" 1000 squares means that you've passed. This also means that ... 1000 squares may not necessarily be what a first level venerable sovereign can pass. Otherwise, what's the point of such an assessment? If you can even pass a first level venerable sovereign, then why is there a chess game?""The game of chess is actually full of wisdom. It's not that whoever is stronger can go far.""I still remember that many years ago, someone came here and played against the shadow emissary. He only had Level 6 strength, but he passed 9000 squares and even attracted the master of Tian Fang ..." The mysterious man said with emotion.Li Hao suddenly thought of someone.Battling the heaven Thearch!Of course, it was just a thought. The two sides were not in the same era.Zhan Tiandi, the number one genius of the yin-yang world, had not only influenced an era, but also the entire yin-yang world and the Silvermoon world.However, the age difference between the two sides was very far.The era of war was just over a hundred thousand years ago.As for Tian Fang's experts, they had disappeared tens of millions of years ago.Rank six, and he had passed 9000 squares. Was that considered to have reached rank nine venerable sovereign comprehension?Then Tian Fang's breakthrough ... Was considered a peak rank nine?Not a simple ninth level venerable sovereign?Of course, this was only the comprehension of Dao and not the strength. Even a rank six who had passed 9000 squares might not be able to compare to a rank seven venerable sovereign.For both Li Hao and Sui han, it was relatively easy to solve the obstacles by force.And this seemingly simple barrier was actually not easy.Li Hao said,""Is there any danger?""There are some ... But as long as you don't rashly move the chess pieces, it's not a big problem. However, if you make the wrong move ... It's very easy to be devoured by the Dao!""You can't leave," the shadow said bluntly."You have to leave. If you force yourself to leave, you'll be easily backfired if you don't have enough strength and Dao marks. You might be able to withstand it once, but twice is fine ... If you do it multiple times, your great Dao will be damaged! So, if you can't leave, then don't force it. "As soon as he said this, the two of them had some thoughts.At this moment, Sui han was actually thinking about something. Best n0vel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã ùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìã‚ÑØùìÅùí∑ùíæùìÉ Since this person is just an Artifact Spirit and not a secret agent, I'm a fifth rank venerable sovereign. What about this person?Do I have to follow his idea and go through this chess game?I'll take it by force ...Such a thought flashed through his mind, but he suppressed it at this moment. He could give it a try first. If he really couldn't pass, he naturally wouldn't be satisfied with nothing.It would be best if he could pass it. He would first comprehend the dark Taoist connotation.After all, it was hard to tell how strong the artifact Spirit was.Li Hao, on the other hand, looked at the chessboard again and said, "It's not as simple as moving the chess pieces, right?""Of course."The mysterious man smiled,"I need the two of you to condense Dao marks and use them to activate!" The so-called Dao mark, both of you should be able to understand it. It is the Dao heart condensed from your comprehension and perception of the Dao ..."Li Hao nodded. In fact, things like one's life and death Stars represented one's comprehension of Dao.In this way, it would be a pure Dao competition.In this way, it was easy to get injured. The great Dao was injured!Physical injuries of people like Li Hao were not serious, but once their DAOs were damaged, such as Li Hao's life and death Star, they would either drop in level or die.It was the same for killing venerable sovereigns. The first way was to destroy their physical bodies. The second way was to destroy all the marks of their great Dao.This was a true killing!Using Dao marks to move the chess pieces was actually dangerous.Li Hao didn't say anything.The bird that takes the lead gets shot.Pi han was stronger than him. Li Hao was also wondering if Pi han, a fifth level venerable sovereign, would consider using force to solve the problem.As for playing chess ... It was so boring.F * ck him!Li Hao thought to himself that he might be able to benefit from this.This shadow was most likely an Artifact Spirit with the strength of a middle stage venerable sovereign.It shouldn't be a high level venerable sovereign. If it was, the dark Demon Ridge wouldn't need external energy at all. A high level venerable sovereign, even a tool spirit, could achieve something similar to opening a great Dao universe.Such an existence could be completely self-sufficient.At that time, the dark Demon Ridge was probably not like this.Therefore, it was highly likely that the other party was only at the intermediate level.As for being weaker ... It shouldn't be. The weapon spirit was born, and it was a top-tier weapon spirit, and it was born from a level eight venerable sovereign. The weapon spirit couldn't be too weak. The other party had a complete spirit, so it was at least mid-tier.Such a thought appeared in Li Hao's mind.At the same time, it was also born in mi Han's mind.The shadow seemed to know nothing and said again,""Do the two of you want to challenge the second stage? If he didn't want to challenge them, he could leave now. Once you walk out of the dark Demon Palace, you'll be able to leave the dark Demon Ridge. "Li Hao had been waiting.As for Sui han, he was also waiting.After waiting for a long time, Li Hao still didn't say anything. He was also speechless. He wasn't sure about Li Hao's strength, so it wasn't easy for him to make a judgment. He was also worried that Li Hao would benefit from it. In the end, he said,""Good! I want to challenge him!"At this moment, Li Hao sighed.The sigh was heard by the man and the shadow.The two of them seemed to have understood what he meant, and he cursed in his heart.'This dog thing is expecting me to take the initiative to attack, right?'She really had bad intentions!This Artifact Spirit was at least grade four, and grade six was normal. If it was at the sixth step, then it would be a huge problem.Why should I stand out?I'm a fifth rank venerable sovereign, can't I go a thousand steps?

Chapter 2689 The Chessboard Of Dao (1)_4
When he walked over, he would directly comprehend the Taoist connotation."I'm also willing to do so!"Li Hao said.If a fifth step doesn't stand out, then I, a third step, should keep a low profile.Playing chess ... Let's leave first, who knows how far we can go.A moment later, Li Hao condensed a Dao mark that looked like a star. The shadow glanced at it and said meaningfully,""It's best to merge all of your comprehensions and condense the strongest Dao mark. Otherwise ... It's easy to be defeated. For the chess player, breaking a part of the Dao mark will leave some great Dao scars. The wounds of the great Dao are the hardest to heal. "Li Hao didn't respond.Let's see what happens.If this chess game was a trap, wouldn't he be finished?Xi han didn't say anything either. Apparently, he was thinking the same thing as Li Hao. He wanted to gather a part of it first.The two's human marks merged into the chessboard in front of them. A chess piece on the chessboard seemed to have transformed into a human and appeared on the chessboard.At this moment, the chessboard seemed to have been activated.There were 9999 grids, and on each grid, there was some power of Taoist connotation.Front, back, left, right, up, down, he could walk all the way.This chessboard was also very interesting.You can go anywhere you want.There were 10000 squares in total, 100 squares in both directions. Except for the square where he was, which didn't have the power of Taoist connotation, the others had it. However, the other party said that he had passed 9999 squares, which meant that he had to pass all the squares. Best n0vel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã ùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìã‚ÑØùìÅùí∑ùíæùìÉ Of course, finishing 1000 squares would be considered a pass.At this moment, Li Hao didn't say anything. He merged his mind with his Taoist connotation. At this moment, he felt like he was in a different world.Metal, wood, water, fire, earth-all sorts of elements were present.All around was the accumulation of the great Dao.Li Hao's eyes flickered. This was a good place!Where did this Go board come from?It contained all kinds of great Dao intent, somewhat similar to the great Dao universe. Could it be that ... The chessboard itself was an extremely powerful treasure? the chessboard in front of him and mi han was probably just a projection, not the real one.Was this shadow the spirit of the chessboard or the praying mat?At this moment, Li Hao began to have some doubts.Previously, because he had seen a futon, his first thought was that this thing was the futon's weapon spirit. However, now that he had entered the chessboard, he realized that if the chessboard itself was here, it should be an extremely terrifying weapon."There's one more thing. There's so much Taoist connotation in it. This chessboard was made by a top master. It can't be refined using the great Dao universe, right?"Li Hao took a deep breath. He had no choice but to think so. Which normal person could truly comprehend ten thousand DAOs?Only the Dao universe had it!Therefore, using the universe of the great path to refine a chessboard was not a bad idea. Furthermore, the difficulty of refining it would also be reduced. Otherwise, if one were to expect an expert to refine it, that expert would need to have some research on the myriad DAOs.A person's energy was limited. Even if Li Hao felt that he was quite talented, in fact, he had only been studying a few great DAOs since he had reached rank 3. He had not really studied all the DAOs.The so-called sword of a hundred DAOs and sword of a thousand DAOs were mostly just a simple understanding. The core was still the same."A treasure land!"At this moment, Li Hao suddenly had an idea. A treasure land for comprehending the myriad DAOs.He had grasped a great Dao universe and tried to comprehend 10000 DAOs, but ... They were all very troublesome. They were all mixed together, and just separating them was a huge project.Li Hao had tried it before and eventually created the river of chaos. Later, he gave it to Hong Yitang. However, the power of ten thousand DAOs was too weak back then. Today, he only had some DAOs of the mountains, seas, sun, and moon. There were very few DAOs at the Dao integration level.However, the fact that this place was damaging the Dao reserve of a venerable Emperor meant that the DAOs here all possessed the power of a venerable Emperor.It was extremely terrifying!Even if they were only a few great DAOs and not really stronger than venerable sovereigns, it still meant that these great DAOs were of a very high level.Li Hao stopped thinking about it. He quickly moved his chess piece and entered another world.In an instant, the flames rose.This was a fire elemental world!Fire element ...Li Hao allowed the chess piece to be burned by the fire. After a moment, he shook his head slightly. It was alright, but it was far from the fire element that the seventh level venerable sovereign had explained to him.He didn't gain anything here.Stopping here would only be a waste of time.He quickly entered the second grid. This time, there were tens of thousands of lightning bolts. On the chess piece, some traces of lightning appeared as it was slashed by the lightning.Li Hao had a deep understanding of Thunderbolt.Although the chaos lightning tribulation was essentially a destructive power, it was also a type of lightning. The chaos lightning tribulation was the most terrifying lightning tribulation in the world, and this simple lightning tribulation was not of much help to Li Hao.He was very clear about this.Li Hao continued to move forward and entered the third grid.On the side, venerable Emperor Min Han was the same. He was a level five Supreme Emperor after all. Even though he did not know much about other great DAOs, he had some understanding of them. He was even faster than Li Hao and cleared more than ten squares in the blink of an eye.He didn't have a deep understanding of the power of great DAOs that burst out from some of the boxes, but he could use his powerful Dao marks to sweep through them. This way, he could pass without any obstacles.
