But now, Li Hao had spread to the East. With thousands of emperors gathered in a thousand different worlds, the commotion was too great, and the area was too large. It would be difficult to clean up the mess.On the side of new martial, they were still competing with the ice world.Moreover, the other party was not your subordinate, so he would not have the time to care about you.Dao Qi, Wu Shan, and the Thunder Emperor were all new level eights. There weren't many level eights. As long as the other party had a few more level eights, they wouldn't be able to match them.Not to mention the three sides, even Samsara still had three venerable sovereigns. If Peng Cheng came, even if there were four, Li Hao might not be able to fight against four rank eights without the interference of neo martial artists.Samsara was very powerful!Li Hao said,"this is my Dao!" It was also the fastest and easiest way to gather and open the Dao of myriad worlds! Otherwise, how long would it take for me to comprehend and interact with them bit by bit? how long would it take for me to perfect the ten thousand DAOs? The great DAOs I've seen today are all common great DAOs, and the further I go, the more difficult it will be!"Collecting 3000 great Dao was very simple. If there were 4000, then an additional 1000 great Dao might take up more than the time of the first 3000 great Dao. The further one went, the more difficult it would be because there were more repeated great Dao.If he didn't use this method, he might not even be able to perfect time even if he spent millions of years.Second cat knew about the situation but it was still worried."So, can you fight against a grade 8 now?""After completing 1200 Jie, the extremely weak rank-8 might be able to match ..."Second cat was helpless. That was nonsense.Although it was fast and strong, it was still ... Not enough.Li Hao had to have at least the power of 5000 DAOs like the human King to be qualified to stand proudly in the chaos. The human King was the standard of the top experts in the chaos."Then what do we do?"Second cat looked at him."If they really come, are we just going to take it or run?" If I run, I'll have to waste a lot of resources in the early stages, waste a few months, and become a joke to everyone. "No one would believe that they could try again if they failed the first time.Therefore, he had to succeed this time.Li Hao nodded slightly and looked at chaos, as if thinking about something. After a long time, he said,""This time, it's a crisis, but also an opportunity! If we get through it, my heavenly Daoist sect will be able to be established and give everyone confidence ... Even if we can't rely on neo martial, they may not have the time to care about us. They will also be in trouble themselves!""So ..." Li Hao paused for a moment, looked at second cat, and slowly said,""Therefore, when necessary, I will merge the realms! My body can't handle borrowing the power of the outside world, so you'll have to help me absorb the chaotic energy ..."Second cat was speechless, but this was just a small matter. It still felt that it was not enough."At that time, even if you can fight against a rank eight with 3000 laws, what if Samsara and the others attack? Samsara and kun Peng are both experts, stronger than you ..."Li Hao nodded. In fact, this was not enough.They were unable to pose a fatal threat to them!It was too difficult to gain a firm foothold, even if there were several level eight venerable sovereigns here."Let's go to the future!"Li Hao smiled."Three bodies in one!"Li Hao's eyes were cold,'at worst, I'll have to go through another life and death situation! I want to merge the past and the future! Three bodies as one, it's no longer my three bodies. I'm going to merge the body of the human King and the body of the person in the future. I'm going to borrow the past and the future, use the power of the inner world, the river of time, and the power of laws to merge into one. Even if I die again, this time, I'm going to complete the construction of my dojo!""Er Mao, today, I will communicate with the future. You go to new martial and find Emperor Cang and human King ... Tell them that when the time comes, I will walk through time, borrow the past and the future, and combine my three bodies into one! I hope human King can borrow some strength ... I haven't borrowed strength for a long time, but that doesn't mean I can't ..."He had already gone through the path of life and death four times!And now, his lifespan had been reduced by 400000 years! However, in order to build the dojo, so what if he had to go again?The success of this matter would be the foundation of his foothold in the chaos. Since the Samsara Emperor dared to come, he would make him suffer this time!Li Hao was also determined.It's fine if you find trouble with me, but if you ruin my future, I'll ruin your life!"I hope that in the future, the sleeping person will agree to lend me the power of rules to help me sort out the rules and fight against the disorder with order. Even if he doesn't have 5000 Dao laws, he can still fight against reincarnation!"But ..."He felt a little helpless in his heart. However, that person didn't seem easy to get along with. He was someone who had been sleeping soundly in the river of time and had a heavy mood when he woke up. He hoped that he wouldn't see him and send him flying with a sword.

Chapter 3481 The Lucky Cat (1)
As the saying goes, the future is not the only one, and the future can not be pursued.Li Hao wasn't sure if he would meet the sleeping person in the future or in another time and space.There would be tens of thousands of them in the future!Last time, he met that person. Would it be the same person this time?Li Hao didn't know.However, if that person was one of the tens of millions of futures, he should be one of the most top-notch existences among them. If he could reach that step in the pseudo-chaos, one could imagine that his talent, strength, and temperament were all first-class.Therefore, if there were countless branches in the future, this person's location must be the widest one, right?The probability of meeting the other party was very high!Time was the most terrifying existence among the ten thousand DAOs.Walking past, chasing the future ...This time, Li Hao was not strong enough to establish the heavenly Daoist Rite, but there was a high chance that he would be attacked by powerful enemies in a month.On new martial arts 'side, even though the Supreme martial artists were scheming against each other, there were still 15 level eight venerable sovereigns waiting for them.Any slight movement could be a disaster!This time, he had to think of a way on his own. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The stars of time appeared once again.A long river appeared in front of him without anyone seeing it. Li Hao looked at it silently for a while, then stepped onto the river.p He didn't know if he would be able to see that person this time.If they did not make any preparations, they might not be able to connect to the future if they were attacked by a strong enemy.……The waves of the long river.Before his eyes, some images appeared, scattered and broken. The future seemed to be very vague.No one could see clearly what the future would be like in the current chaos.Only by following this long river could he perhaps get a glimpse of it.He walked in the air, the river shaking beneath his feet. Li Hao strode forward, following the current. He didn't know where he would go. Although his lifespan wasn't consumed much, it also meant that time was passing.The consumption of lifespan actually wasn't here.Communicating with the future was the key to the consumption of time. If one only saw and didn't speak, didn't care, and didn't participate, it could only be said to be a kind of prediction of the future. However, once one participated, it was a change of fate!The two could not be mentioned in the same breath.In the past, he had gone through neo martial, which was the only one in the past, and it had not consumed much energy.After that, he borrowed the future Past body and fused the three bodies into one. When they fused, it was only an instant in the future. Borrowing his own power to move the power of the future also had a consumption, but it wasn't a big consumption.If he walked into the future now ... The future of this long river no longer seemed to be his.It could be seen that the future of the river of time might really not be decided by him.Li Hao's mind was filled with thoughts as he walked.His face was pale and gradually weakened.It felt like a long time had passed, yet it also felt like an instant.The next moment, thunderous snores came again, like the sound of waves in the long river. Li Hao was confused. Did I go back to the previous moment, or ... Did this person continue to sleep after I left? He actually ... Fell asleep again?What kind of person would keep sleeping in the river?Li Hao was puzzled!Or could it be that after the chaos was unified, he felt that the world was boring and thus fell asleep?He was puzzled!A moment later, he seemed to have crossed into another long river. The long river fluctuated, and the thunderous snoring instantly disappeared.In the next moment, an angry voice was heard."What?"At the end of the river.A person appeared, but his appearance could not be seen clearly. Just like how Li Hao could not see him clearly, the person opposite him could not see him clearly either. It did not matter whether he could see him clearly or not. At this moment, the two of them looked at each other across the river again, just like last time!He seemed to be a little angry!The people at the end of the river were a little unhappy.Why do you keep disturbing me?Was it really that difficult to sleep with her once?The person in front of him was looking at the upstream of the river. There was a person who was going downstream. It seemed ... He had some impression of that person in his memory. In this River, time was in a mess, and he could not tell the difference in time. He only had some jumbled memories. Perhaps, he had slept for too long and had forgotten all of them.However, he knew that this person ... Might be the time King of the past.He was an invincible expert who had left behind legends in the myriad world after going back and forth to the river time and time again. Had he encountered danger again?Just as this person was thinking, Li Hao, who was opposite him, slashed out with his sword, and a slightly mixed force spread out.The man at the end of the river waved his hand, and the two energies crossed each other.The long river started to surge.At this moment, both Li Hao and the young man at the end of the tunnel felt a special power that crossed space and time.Li Hao once again felt the clear power of rules.Among them, the power of Chaos was completely removed.At this moment, Li Hao was lost in thought. This time, he could feel it more clearly than last time. The power of a great Dao was pure, boundless pure, as if all the chaotic forces in the chaos had disappeared.What about the chaotic force?Had the chaotic energy within it completely disappeared?The Dao ... Seemed to have a life of its own, and it learned to self-cultivate?Self-cultivation?Li Hao's heart stirred. Divine text ...Back in Silver Moon, he had once allowed the divine text to devour the Dao and transform into divine text. He had cultivated on his own and cultivated different techniques to purify the power of the great Dao. However, he had not been able to purify it to such a level back then.For a moment, countless thoughts appeared in his mind.Life!At this moment, he seemed to have realized something. The last time they had met, the other party's sword had only hit venerable Emperor fleeting life and had not made contact with Li Hao. But now, the two of them had crossed paths.Li Hao instantly had a clear understanding.

Chapter 3482 The Lucky Cat (2)
He looked at Li Hao. At this moment, Li Hao seemed to have understood something. His expression changed. I think I know.Why would the future be this pure rule force?The great Dao of the future ... Seemed ... To have been given some life!Yes, vitality.It seemed like it could purify itself! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The source of life was an existence that Li Hao had never been able to figure out. He had never been able to figure out how the world contained vitality and how to give birth to living creatures.Today, he seemed to have some ideas.Why was the great Dao so pure ... Because the great Dao here seemed to be ... A kind of life?Did this mean that the great DAOs could be cultivated by themselves, and the great DAOs ... Could also become living beings?Li Hao was stunned!The great Dao was the great Dao, and the great Dao ... Could create living beings?This ... How could this be possible?This was equivalent to the stars in the great Dao universe cultivating themselves into life!Didn't that mean that when the great Dao was extremely pure, it could even become a living existence ...At this moment, Li Hao's mind was in a mess.He seemed to have thought of something.The gray cat!What was Emperor Cang?Was Emperor Cang the incarnation of Dao?He was born in the great Dao universe. There was no life in the great Dao universe, so why was Emperor Cang born?As for the future Dao, it seemed to contain a special power of life, which made the Dao full of spirituality. A Dao with spirituality could expel impurities by itself, and naturally, it would be more orderly.If Emperor Cang was also such an existence ... Did that mean that order had always existed?Battle!At this moment, he suddenly thought of war. Was Emperor Cang related to war?If there was, did it mean that Zhan Tiandi had already discovered some power of order? and the river of the future could produce such power of order because it had some ordered genes?The key to order, was it life?……On the opposite side.The young cultivator frowned when he sensed Li Hao's great Dao.It was very chaotic!Although there were many types of great DAOs and they were very powerful ... They gave people the feeling that they were ... Extremely filthy.How could it be like this?The young man also fell into deep thought.Was the world, the chaos, and the forces of the past so mixed? The power of great DAOs and rule forces should be extremely pure.It was the existence of time that caused the energy that came into contact with them to change.A thought appeared in his mind.Suddenly, he looked at the other side again. They could communicate, but in this space and time, every communication would cost a lot of energy. Therefore, Li Hao didn't say anything.Li Hao struck again with the power of a thousand worlds. The river trembled as his sword fell!The next moment, divine runes appeared under the sword.The young man looked at it in silence, feeling it. First-generation divine text?Did the path of the divine text exist in that era?What was divine text?The divine text was the Dao!The divine text was the embodiment of the Dao, the simplification of the Dao. When a divine text was cultivated to the extreme, it would become a great Dao. From the outline of the divine text to the end, the divine text would have a spirit, merge the Dao into the Dao, and then master the rules. This was the divine text.However, the existence of divine text ... Wasn't it simplified during the era of the king of Wen?Many thoughts appeared in the future young man's mind. So ... The divine text had already existed?He looked over and felt that something was wrong.The divine text ... Was too dry, too mixed, and too ... Rigid!That's right. At that moment, he discovered something different. His eyes moved slightly. Divine text was a simplified version of rules. Divine text actually had a spirit. Divine text could even think and even become a living spirit. When cultivated to the extreme, divine text could even form a spirit by itself!The spirit of a powerhouse integrated into the natural order, and could even become the spirit of the natural order, becoming the natural order itself.However, if this person before him was the time King, then this divine text was a little too dull and had no spirituality at all. It was just a manifestation of the Dao.A thought emerged.He vaguely understood that the reason why the time King was harassing him once more was because ... He had reached a bottleneck in his Dao Comprehension?"Being chased by a powerful enemy? You can't survive anymore?"Thoughts flashed through his mind. He was the best at making up ... Speculations.There was no need to communicate. One only needed to look at their actions, the situation, and guess."You're looking for me ... To investigate the formation technique of rule force? But what I don't understand is that I was born with such natural laws ... The natural laws of heaven and earth exist!"The thought emerged, but in the next moment, he understood something. Perhaps the key was in the divine text. The other party's divine text did not have a spirit.How could he bestow the great Dao with spirituality?He didn't know how the first generation of spirits was born, but he knew how spirits were born in his era!Therefore, at this moment, he violently pulled out a tributary from the long river!The young man smiled when he saw that the person opposite him was slightly stunned, as if he was looking at him. Suddenly, he reached out his hand and pulled out something from the endless world ... A white ball of fur!,m He didn't know how the first spirit was born, but he did know how.In the next moment, he forcefully stuffed the White hairy ball into the great Dao. Under hairy ball's dazed gaze, he punched down, causing hairy ball to explode with a bang. In the next moment, the exploded hairy ball fused into the branch.The river, which originally lacked spirituality ... At this moment, it seemed to gradually give birth to some spirit. The tributary gradually began to squirm. A moment later, as if time had accelerated, a great Dao tributary suddenly transformed into a furball ...

Chapter 3483 The Lucky Cat (3)
It had once again returned to its appearance as a fluffball!Did you understand?The young man shrugged his shoulders and threw hairy ball on his head. At this moment, Li Hao's expression changed.……"Spirit ... Soul!"Li Hao's expression changed. He might have figured out how spirits were born.But at this moment, Li Hao's expression changed.The next moment, he turned around and left. He didn't mention anything about borrowing power again. He directly escaped into the upstream of the river and disappeared.At the end of the river, the young man was a little confused.What's wrong?You ran away after you understood it?Why are you running so fast?We haven't even exchanged a few words, and you've already run away after disturbing me ... Forget it, I've been taking advantage of you for a long time in the past, so I won't hold it against you.He was still a little confused, but now, he was a little interested.Suddenly, after Li Hao had completely disappeared, he laughed and muttered,""Hairy ball ... Do you think that the era of the time King would be very interesting? This guy opened a long river and stored a divine weapon, so why didn't he come to get it?"On top of his head, hairy ball was at a loss. It was also sleeping when it was suddenly grabbed and punched. Its large eyes were filled with confusion.Who was it?The time King?Who was the time King? The young man sighed."Forget it. I'd better take advantage of the time to catch up on sleep ... Perhaps, peace won't last long. Chaos ... True chaos? Fake chaos? The chaos in the sword? The chaos outside? How boring ..."……At this moment, Li Hao fell from the sky, his face pale.He didn't care about the chaotic aura and just sat there in a daze. Originally, he wanted to talk about the three-body power-borrowing technique, but at this moment, he didn't move, as if he wasn't interested.The rules!Orderly!Soul!In this world, Dao had no spirit. Only living beings had spirits, so they were called living beings, not Dao spirits.And the method to give birth to living beings ... Was actually ... Actually to fuse the spirit of living beings into Dao!Li Hao didn't say anything.At this moment, he seemed to have completely understood something. In fact, he should have thought of this long ago. Yes, the great Dao was mixed, the universe was mixed, and everywhere was mixed. It was too difficult to expect the heaven and earth to purify it. Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  What to do?His body had merged with the great Dao, his body had merged with the stars, and his incarnation had become the great Dao!Only in this way could the Taoist body become one and take the initiative to go deeper into the purification ...At that moment, divine words appeared in his hand. He didn't think there was anything wrong with these divine words at first. However, after looking at them again today, he realized that these divine words lacked some spirituality.If he killed a person and merged his spirit into the divine text, he would cultivate the Dao as well. For example, Nanquan cultivated the Dao of fire. If he killed Nanquan and took his soul, he would use his power and spirit to merge with the Dao of fire. The divine text of fire would then be able to cultivate naturally, purify itself, and use the spirit to control the Dao!In the beginning, he might not be able to purify it completely quickly, but as time passed, he would definitely be able to do it.Li Hao was silent. Of course, this was voluntary. It was best to take the initiative!At this moment, he suddenly felt a little fearful. Why would there be countless nomological Dao in the future?Those DAOs seemed to have rules and intelligence from the very beginning ... Why was that so?The river I opened up?"If I created a false chaos ... Then doesn't that mean that I fused countless souls into my realm?!It won 't!Li Hao lowered his head and looked at the endless void. No way. Why would I do that?Even if I fail, I won't do it.It didn't seem like a big deal for a human's soul to merge with a great Dao, but ... This ... Seemed to be the demon Dao, the true demon Dao!"When the divine text is cultivated to the extreme, the divine text will merge with the power, the power will merge with the stars, and the stars will become DAOs ... Does this mean that when that time comes, all the Silvermoon people will cultivate themselves into DAOs?"An innate Dao body!Li Hao's expression changed again. All Silvermoon people were born with Dao bodies and had natural meridians of the great Dao. If they reached the extreme, would they become the great Dao?Would it gradually be melted by the great Dao?Silvermoon people, innate Dao bodies, time Dao ... Great Dao universe, time core ...At this moment, Li Hao's expression changed.The Silver Moon was a new world that was born after the departure of Time and Stars.In other words, an orderly world would be born in the time star in the future.And this order ... Was from now on, from Silver Moon?Li Hao was a little confused as this thought came to his mind.Could it be that the silvers were born for order?Was everything destined?No, nothing was destined!Li Hao silently closed his eyes and fell into deep thought. At this moment, too many thoughts appeared in his mind. If the Silvermoon people had really cultivated their Shi to the extreme and integrated it into their Dao, then they would cultivate their Dao as if it were their own. Was this the demonic path, or was it the correct path?Humans had cultivated their Dao!Cultivation, cultivation ... Could it be that the right path was to cultivate oneself into a Dao?Could he escape?"Seize the Dao and merge it into one!"Li Hao mumbled to himself."One man, one Dao. If I cultivate the Dao, the Dao will become me. What if I turn the Dao into an orderly rule and then devour it back?"Human form again!Cutting off one's Dao, leaving behind some tails, and regrowing the broken tail, could the Dao regrow?He would, right?If that's the case ... Then it doesn't matter anymore. It's just a temporary change in form. I cultivate the Dao, and the Dao is in my body!His tense expression gradually eased.Then, he thought of the person who had destroyed the small white ball with a punch. The small white ball had swallowed the Dao and returned to its original form. This meant that it could be converted.Fusing with Dao did not mean that one had completely become a slave of Dao.

Chapter 3484 The Lucky Cat (1)_4
Perhaps, I was wrong.At that moment, Li Hao thought of turning people into slaves and providing them for his own cultivation.But now, on second thought, what if he swallowed the Dao to regenerate?Receiving Dao into the body!That's right, this was what it meant to absorb Dao into one's body. It was like planting a tree. When the Dao grew, if the tree was cut down, the roots would still be there, and the Dao should be able to be reborn."Taking in Dao into the body ... This is similar to cultivating the Dao universe and eventually leaving the Dao universe. It's just that it's more thorough to turn one's body into Dao to cultivate!"Li Hao touched his chin. This definitely had its advantages and disadvantages.He had never tried it himself.He had actually tried to completely integrate himself into the river of the great path. However, at that time, he had only integrated his body into the river and had not completely turned himself into the Dao."Eh ... That's right. Why do you want to merge the southern Fist with it instead of master?""That's not right. Why don't you want to completely cut yourself off and merge with it?""A Paragon has tens of millions of incarnations, and every single one of them is fused with a Dao. This ... Doesn't this also mean that he's using order?"Li Hao's eyes flickered.He thought of one person, the Supreme neo martial.He had many clones, and each one of them was infused with a Dao. Was this a kind of spirit bestowment technique?He had given the great Dao a soul!The Paragon's book of Dao had such a tendency. Of course, from the looks of it, the Paragon hadn't completely integrated himself into it. He was only a clone, and his clone only had a part of his spirit. The main body was still with the main body.And Emperor Cang was born in the great Dao universe. Did it mean that Emperor Cang was actually the spirit of the great Dao that was born from the new martial great Dao universe, just like the little white fluffball he saw in the long river?At this moment, Li Hao thought of many things!In addition, back when he was still in Silver Moon, he had tried to get everyone to merge with the great Dao and give himself strength. However, it was only a temporary integration of Shi at that time.It was a trend of bestowing the spirit of the great Dao ... But not completely.At this moment, Li Hao thought of many things. He linked some of his past actions that he didn't care about together and thought of the future path of rules. At this moment, a complete line gradually formed in his mind.If the person in the future came from the pseudo-chaos that he had created, and the Dao in the pseudo-chaos was orderly, it meant that he might have tidied it up and even integrated it into the Dao. His soul would merge with the great Dao and turn the great Dao into a spirit!Finally, swallowing the Dao into the body?"The inner world of a human King, is it considered a kind of devouring Dao into the body?"The thought reappeared.He wanted to cultivate himself. Was this considered a kind of devouring Dao into his body?The master of Tian Fang had taken away all the energy of the great Dao universe and plundered all the power of the great Dao. Was this considered taking in the Dao into the body?Perhaps, both!The chaos itself was developing in an orderly manner.The power of order ... Removed impurities.At this moment, Li Hao seemed to have found some clues.At that moment, second cat appeared and looked a little unhappy.""Don't let me go there next time. The big cat grabbed me and insisted on sharing the dried fish with me ..." Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  It didn't like to eat it! The big cat really had no taboos. It ate everything.However, the big cat was extremely enthusiastic. If you didn't eat it, the big cat would be on the verge of tears. It was difficult to refuse such kindness!Second cat mumbled a few words and smacked its lips. Li Hao was stunned. He glanced at it. "So ... You ate it?"“……”Second cat rolled its eyes and wagged its tail.Do you think I've eaten? "Have you met the so-called future people?" it asked."I did."Li Hao nodded."Did the other party agree to lend you power?""I didn't ask."“……”Second cat was speechless. Then why are you going to the future?Did it really not consume one's lifespan?Are you tired of living too long? do you want to torment yourself and consume a little more energy?"Or do you think that it doesn't matter if we're going to walk to death anyway? it's just for fun, so there's no harm in walking a few more times?How could this person be like this!"What did the human King say?" Li Hao smiled.Second cat didn't ask Li Hao any more questions and said,"The human King said that if you want to borrow it, you can ... Write an IOU!""What?""He has some understanding of time. He said that if he lent it to you, he might lose his power at some point in time. It's very dangerous. This time, he said that he would need at least a universe like a high level eight universe, a universe like reincarnation, to repay the debt ..."Li Hao couldn't help but laugh!He thought about it and didn't rush to say it. He looked at second cat and said,"Second cat ...""Why don't you add me as your senior now?"Second cat glanced at him. This guy had been calling him "senior" recently. Sometimes he didn't even call him "senior" anymore. He called him by his name. What an impolite little guy!Li Hao laughed again."Senior second cat ... I have something that I'm a little confused about. In principle, if I extract fragments of the past and judge the past, can it be considered a manifestation of Dao?"Second cat was stunned. What did he mean?Was it considered Dao?It didn't quite understand what Li Hao meant. It looked at Li Hao with confusion. It used to understand Li Hao's questions, but now it didn 't."If the past can be considered a path in the long river, then can senior second cat's appearance in the human world be considered a rebirth?" Li Hao explained.Second cat was stunned for a moment and started to think seriously.After a long time, he was a little uncertain."I don't know. It's hard to say ... If you think of this piece of the past as a Dao, maybe ... It is a Dao. If you really think so, it can be considered a rebirth of the Dao, right?"

Chapter 3485 The Lucky Cat (1)
It did not know how to explain the fragment of space in the past. Was this a kind of great Dao?Li Hao's eyes flickered."Then, senior second cat, other than the ability to devour, do you have any other special abilities?" he asked."Instinct ..."Second cat scratched its head with its short paws, confused.Other than devouring, what other instinctive means did he have that he was good at?After a long time, second cat said with uncertainty,""The special ability you mentioned, what ability is it?"Li Hao glanced at it and thought about it carefully. Devouring was just a method that second Cat Used to imitate Emperor Cang. Or rather, it still thought that it was a copy of Emperor Cang, so it had always used devouring in battle.He didn't see second cat, so he used some other special means.Did it?Li Hao felt that it definitely existed.A fragment of the past, an illusory space. If this was a type of Dao, what kind of Dao was it?Was the space that second cat was in the past, or was it a scene inside the great Dao?Was this space only used by Zhan Tiandi to observe the new martial arts?Or was there a deeper level of research?Also, it was said that there were not only er Mao and Zhan Tiandi, but also real living beings in it. The new martial arts book, the fragrance Emperor, had lived in this space for a long time.Living beings could also enter!If it was intercepted, living beings could enter.It was like a dream, like an illusion, like reality!The illusionary second cat had not completely descended into the human world back then, so it was almost immortal.But now, he had lost this ability.Back then, er Mao wasn't strong, but even if it was killed by an enemy's attack, it could be resurrected at any time. It was just like how the blood Emperor used the power of the world to resurrect er Mao.The two cats themselves were illusory.The alternation of reality and illusion, true and false ... In this case, could it be regarded as a way of opposing true and false?Everything had a Dao!Er Mao was an illusionary body of Dao. Therefore, as long as the Dao existed, er Mao would never be destroyed. True and false would always exist. Thus, when er Mao merged with the Dao, he was an undying existence.But now, second cat subconsciously felt that it was alive and had become a real existence. It could no longer be immortal, so it felt that it was going to die ..."Li Hao ..." Seeing Li Hao staring at it in a daze, second cat felt a little awkward and couldn't help but interrupt Li Hao,""Why do you keep staring at me?""I think ... If I kill senior, can senior still be resurrected?"  Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  Was this human language?Second cat was furious!I've been working hard for you. I'm just a sleeping cat, and now I've become your slave, and you still want to kill me!Are you even human?But at this moment, Li Hao laughed."Senior, the real and the fake, who can say that the past is fake? The past was an illusion? Senior, are you really a replica of Emperor Cang?"What did that mean?Second cat didn't really want to talk about this. It was a little uncomfortable. No one ... No cat wanted to be a copy of another cat. Even if it didn't hate big cat, big cat was very good to it and respected it ...However, whenever second cat was mentioned, it would be said that it was big cat's past."Senior, since you are the past of Emperor Cang, why can't you be the past of anyone else? What's the difference between real and fake?""In the past, was senior the only one who existed in that space? Didn't they say that there were still many existences? These existences, are they one, or are they independent?"Second cat was stunned.Looking at Li Hao, Li Hao said!"If I say that space is a great path! Then! 'Ll go to the great Dao.! It's a Dao that imitates, copies, and alternate between reality and illusion. Senior two cat could be anyone's past, could imitate anyone, and senior two cat would be a Dao spirit, not a clone of anyone!""Senior second cat, perhaps ... It is the embodiment of Dao itself!"He had never thought about this before.Today, he saw the future. He saw the White furball merge with the Dao and transform into the Dao. He suddenly thought of something. Was second cat really a copy of big cat?Just big cat's past?Why couldn't it be a living being born from an entire Dao?At this moment, second cat looked at Li Hao in a daze.I'm not a clone ... I'm ... Dao Ling!The spirit of the great Dao?I am a Dao!"But ..." It was a little confused."How can Dao give birth to a soul?"Some had heard of weapons turning into spirits, some had heard of mountains and rivers turning into spirits, some had heard of the world nurturing the will of heaven into spirits, but they had never heard of the great Dao turning into spirits!Wasn't the great Dao independent?Li Hao finally figured it out. He said excitedly,""Why not? Swords could become spirits, mountains and rivers could become spirits, and sometimes, after being nurtured for a long time, any existence had the hope of becoming a spirit! It might not be necessary for the soul to merge with it. For example, the sword seal, sword tree, and sword stone had all become spirits! Their master, revered sword, has been nurturing them. His thoughts and soul are spreading, so naturally, he can also nurture objects into spirits!""And senior ..."Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"if you're a great Dao, a special great Dao that has always been by Zhan Tiandi's side, and then you've been nurtured for a long time and given some of Zhan Tiandi's spirit ... Will you give birth to a spirit? In my eyes, you're no weaker than any other expert. Why do you have so much knowledge? don't you come from Zhan Tiandi?"Second cat was at a loss. After a long time, it looked at Li Hao."Fine, even if you're right, I'm not a replica of the big cat, I'm ... Dao Ling, but ... I'm only at the seventh rank. I have nothing to do with the danger you're about to face, right? Shouldn't you be thinking about how to resolve this crisis?"

Chapter 3486 The Lucky Cat (1)_6
You didn't even greet the people from the future!"No hurry, no hurry! There's still a month left!"At this moment, Li Hao smiled brightly.""If senior second cat is really an illusory existence, can he copy me?""What?"Second cat was stunned. What did he mean?"Senior second cat, can you make a copy of me, and you ... Become me?"Second cat was stunned. Impersonating you?I'm only at the seventh step, and you're the same ... Even if we can impersonate each other, our combat strength still remains the same."Senior second cat, if you can clone one of me...Then can you clone thousands of me?"What did that mean!Second cat was really confused this time.Li Hao, on the other hand, was excited."What I'm saying is that I'm in control of a thousand worlds, so my power is only average. But if you can clone all of Silver moon's cultivators into me, it'll be difficult to tell the difference between real and fake, and the great Dao will be the same. If you can clone all of the rank eight venerable sovereigns, I'll be them, and they'll be me ... There's no need for past and future. They'll be my past and future, my clones ... If my clones become one, will it ... Help me improve infinitely?""I'll convert the Dao of the Thunder World into my Dao. I'll convert the Dao of Wushan into my Dao. I'll convert the Dao of the Dao chess into my Dao ..."Second cat understood this time, but it still couldn't believe it. It felt that Li Hao had overestimated itself."I ... I can do this? How is that possible?"I don't even know!Li Hao explained,"in the fragment back then, countless people existed, including Zhan Tiandi, Emperor Cang, and the heavenly Hound ... Everyone was good at different DAOs. Why can they all be presented?" Could it be considered a kind of copy? Since senior two cat had treated him as a clone of Emperor Cang, did that mean he could use Emperor Cang's Dao of devouring? Since it can imitate Emperor Cang, why can't it imitate any great Dao?" "Impossible, I can't do it ..." Second cat shook his head."Senior, why don't you try?"Li Hao persuaded him,"if you succeed, it means that you're not a clone. You're a real existence. You're the spirit of a great Dao!" A real living being is not just a dispensable cat clone ..."At this point, he was slightly startled and suddenly stopped speaking.If the past could not be cut off ...He had always felt that Zhan Tiandi was somewhat inconceivable. He could actually cut off the past, which was not like a sixth-tier or ninth-tier cultivator could do."However, I've always carried some hope and fantasy. If I can do it, I can intercept it and completely resurrect some people.However, today ... He was a little absent-minded.If er Mao was only the spirit of Dao, then ... Did that mean that it was impossible to intercept it?At this moment, the figures in his mind, which were gradually becoming blurry, suddenly became even more blurry.Li Hao fell silent.Dad, mom, Xiao Yuan, can't you chase after the dead?Am I ... Really unable to resurrect you?It's not feasible to extract you from the past, right?  n0vel online free at 𝓷0𝓿𝓮𝓵𝓫𝓲𝓷 Er Mao was not an inconceivable fragment of the past. He was the spirit of the great Dao, and Emperor Cang might also be the spirit of a great Dao.Zhan Tiandi might have been studying the spirit of the great Dao for a long time.Hence, two cats were born.Second cat seemed to understand Li Hao's thoughts. If he wasn't a cat of the past, then ... Did that mean that the past couldn't really come to reality?"Li Hao, I'm probably a replica of the big cat ..." Li Hao sobered up, looked at second cat, and laughed."Senior ... You're really good at comforting people."Second cat might have noticed something.However, Li Hao wasn't someone who was easily disappointed. He smiled and said,""It doesn't matter! Zhan Tiandi was only at the sixth step, but I ... Will be even stronger! "I don't need to cut off a fragment. I can return to the past and cut off some of the source of spirituality. If I can capture the source of some people who haven't cultivated, I might be able to find it ... Just like when I traveled to the new martial arts past, I traveled to the Silver Moon and cut off some of the source of spirituality from people in the past. It's the same. So, senior, you don't need to comfort me!"Second cat wagged its tail and didn't say anything."Then I'm not a replica?""I don't think so!" Li Hao smiled."That means, if I can copy something, copy the power of DAOs ... This will prove that I'm actually a Dao spirit!""Right!""But I don't know how to do it!""I ... I only know how to devour," second cat said."No... You are subconsciously treating yourself as a replica of Emperor Cang, which is why you only know how to devour! "Your Dao is very special. Perhaps you'll need to immerse yourself in it with your true feelings. For example, if you want to clone me, then do so ... Observe my past, understand me, and become one with me. Make yourself believe that you're me ... Then you'll be able to clone me!""You mean, I should go through your memories and look into your past. Is that ... Appropriate?""What's inappropriate about that?"Li Hao smiled."There's nothing to hide about my past. There's nothing I can't tell anyone!" "If it really works, we don't need to borrow the strength of others this time. We'll take it on ourselves! Not only that, if it's really proven that you're Dao Ling, then ..."His eyes flickered and suddenly he laughed."Then, the cultivators of Silvermoon are all born with Dao bodies that conform to the great Dao. They are born with Dao bodies ... And Dao spirits! If this is a cultivation method, everyone can transform into Dao!"At that time, something interesting might happen.Second cat didn't know what was going on, but it was impressed!Well, you're right. Although I think ... I really don't know how to do it, I also believe that I'm dao Ling. Yes, I'm dao Ling, not a replica of the big cat. Thinking of this, I suddenly feel ... Very happy!"Then why don't you open the river of memories to me and let me see your memories?""If I can duplicate myself into you, it'll be hard to tell the real from the fake," second cat said excitedly."I'll become one with the great Dao. Does that mean that I can completely merge my power with yours and you can merge your power with mine?""Right!""This is so interesting! Now that you've put it that way, I think I might ... Really be able to do it?"Even though it wasn't sure, at this moment, it was willing to believe it.In fact, it knew very well that Li Hao was just making a guess. He wasn't really sure.But what if it was true?I'll be very happy!Li Hao's face was also full of anticipation. If it was proven that ermao was really Dao Ling, many things would change greatly.This included the comprehension of ten thousand DAOs!He had been wondering why Zhan Tiandi had so easily comprehended 10000 DAOs in new martial. If Zhan Tiandi had mastered the replication Dao like er Mao, or even a core Dao, Zhan Tiandi's core ...In that case ... With this great Dao of duplication, it would be much easier to comprehend 10000 DAOs if he could duplicate them!At this moment, his expression changed slightly.If that was the case, then Zhan Tiandi's comprehension of the myriad DAOs and the gathering of time might have an explanation as to why he could do it so quickly.It also explained why er Mao had been living in the same fragment as Zhan Tiandi's projection. This was because ... This Dao had been replicated from a certain period of time and repeated over and over again. It was the most profound memory.At this moment, looking at second cat again, it was as if he was looking at countless treasures ... Was this the Lucky Cat?

The core of second cat was duplication.If this guess was true, it would likely overturn some of his previous guesses. Of course, for the current Li Hao, if second cat's core Dao was the Dao of duplication, it would be of great help to him.Dao spirit!The great Dao gave birth to a spirit and transformed into order.With such a guess in mind, he looked at er Mao again and it was as if he had seen countless treasures.Joy was written all over his face.As for second cat, Li Hao's stare made it uncomfortable. Am I a master of duplication?I'm not sure myself, but Li Hao, who is in front of me, is excited."Li Hao, whether it's ... I'm not sure myself ...""It doesn't matter!"Li Hao looked at second cat like a weird uncle coaxing a child. He smiled brightly and said,"Second cat, the people of Silver Moon are not ordinary. They all come from the time and star. And the 10000 DAOs of the time and star ... If my speculation is true, some of them might have come from duplication, which is you!"Li Hao firmly believed that Zhan Tiandi was a genius.However, for a genius to comprehend 10000 DAOs without any Foundation and even integrate 10000 DAOs to form time ... This was too terrifying. The other party had not even walked out of the neo martial realm. Best novel online free at nσνEℓnєXт  Unless he was constantly replicating some great DAOs. Although that would be extremely monstrous, it was still acceptable.Otherwise ... Li Hao would be too self-abased.He had Zhan Tiandi's time star in front of him. Now, it could be said that he was imitating it. He had been imitating it until now, but he still had no idea. He hadn't even completed the 3000 great Dao, let alone 10000.The difference ... Was too great, unbelievably great, and this was Li Hao, who had reached Level Seven in a short time.In comparison, the venerable sovereigns in the chaos could commit suicide.Therefore, there was a 99% chance that a duplicate really existed."Then ... What do we do now?" Second cat looked at Li Hao. Li Hao quickly said,"You entered the river of my memories first. I think that even if you don't know me well enough, you can't copy me!"Second cat thought about it and felt that it made sense.The river of first impressions?The river Of Time and the River of memory were actually one. It was just that to pry into memories, one needed to trace back to the source of the person. This point separated the river of memory and the river of time.Now that Li Hao's real body was here, it was naturally not difficult to trace the source.The human and cat quickly took control of time.Soon, a long river appeared before his eyes.……The waves of the long river.This time, it was different. This was actually Li Hao's first time going back to his past. He didn't like to think about the past, but at this moment, he did so with er Mao. His life was actually very short, but his memories were like a long river of endless waves. Each wave represented a major event, and they seemed to flow on endlessly.This also meant that Li Hao had experienced too many things over the years.Going back all the way to the end ... This meant that the moment of Li Hao's birth was actually very short, and he reached the end in the blink of an eye.The man and cat quickly fell into the river.……This might be the first time that Li Hao ... Or rather, countless people, perhaps never before, had seen themselves fall to the ground, crying.Yes, in his memory, Li Hao had been born.That year, spirit Qi began to recover in the Silvermoon world. Superpowers also began to appear that year. Li Hao's birth seemed to have witnessed the birth of superpowers.Silver City.The house in his memory.The middle-aged woman next door was not an Auntie yet, but a young married woman. She was completely different from the Auntie who would nag endlessly in the future.The creator was so magical.The aunties in her younger days were still very quiet. Who knew that she would be so naggy when she was old?His mother was very young.Like a bystander, Li Hao's will was integrated into it. He watched everything and watched himself grow up bit by bit. Li Hao had been very happy in his childhood. He had a happy family. Although he wasn't rich, he wasn't poor.He had a house, and later, his father even bought a car. In the small silver City, he could be considered a middle-class family.If this continued, Li Hao would probably be very happy ... Of course, he could also be destroyed at any time, because the Silver City was very important, and many people were paying attention to it.……In her memory, the scenes of her playing with Zhang Yuan when she was young appeared again.This childhood friend had been very obedient since he was young. He listened to Li Hao, and the two of them walked through the streets and alleys, reigniting some of Li Hao's faded memories.After a few reincarnations, some of her memories had faded.However, this time, when he looked back at his past, his memories seemed to have been triggered again.Father, mother, brothers ...The reappearance of these figures, which had gradually disappeared from his memory, was actually an act of uncovering his scars, but Li Hao accepted it calmly.A part of his memory had disappeared, but he didn't do it on purpose. He had died a few times and resurrected a few times. Every time he resurrected, some of his feelings would fade. Gradually, he still knew that these people existed.But slowly, it was as if ... She had forgotten something.Humans were too forgetful.After looking at his past for a while, Li Hao was suddenly stunned. He knew his past well. Before he was 18 years old, there was almost nothing special about him. At this moment, he was stunned not because he was special ...

It was because ... At this moment, he saw Yuan Shuo.When he was young, his teacher seemed to be in Silver City as well. Silver City wasn't very big. When Li Hao was four or five years old, Yuan Shuo must have chosen to stay in Silver City to save his life. At that time, superpowers had risen a few years ago, and Yuan Shuo was a little difficult to deal with, so he chose to stay in Silver City.Seeing Yuan Shuo wasn't strange.The strange thing was ... There was actually a woman following Yuan Shuo, and most importantly, it was not the Azure light sword!Li Hao was speechless!Teacher, this ... When he was young ... No, when he was living in seclusion, he wasn't young anymore. He seemed to be in his fifties, and at that time, Yuan Shuo was still hitting on girls! Seriously ... In the past, he had always thought that his teacher was a man of virtue and prestige. Even when everyone called him old demon, he had always thought that his teacher was a gentleman. So, it turned out that he was so shameless.It was really ...I can't look too much!If she looked at it too much, her image would collapse.Yuan Shuo was only a corner of his memory. The Silver City was too small, so it wasn't strange to meet him. Li Hao had even met Liu Long when he was young. At that time, Liu Long had been an ordinary patrol officer of the Silver City's Patrol office.The two sides brushed past each other. They probably didn't expect that after more than ten years, they would have a great encounter.Li Hao suddenly felt that it was quite interesting to see his own life from the perspective of a bystander.Second cat was beside the consciousness light ball.At this moment, second cat was also watching carefully.After watching for a while, he felt that Li Hao's childhood was actually very simple. There were not many misfortunes. Moreover, Li Hao, who had been intelligent since young, was well-liked by the people around him and lived a happy life.Until ... The memories kept passing by, until that day, when the young Li Hao saw two charred corpses, badly damaged ... His parents had died in an accident in a car accident ...At this moment, Li Hao's life had a huge change.Looking at the scene in his memory, Li Hao was silent.His childhood and youth were all happy.Everything had changed from this moment on. It was also from this day that the red moon organization had begun to invade. The secrets of the eight great families of Silver City had begun to spread, and the descendants of the eight great families had been killed one after another.Accidents kept happening in this small city.After his parents 'death, he had thought it was an accident. At that time, although Li Hao was sad, he continued to live his own life. His brother Zhang Yuan cared for him a little more, so Li Hao didn't feel too lonely and desperate during this period.Later on, he and Zhang Yuan went to the Silver City ancient Academy together.Due to his better memory and talent, he was chosen by Yuan Shuo to study the ancient language system with him. From then on, he became Yuan Shuo's last disciple in the Silver City ancient Academy.The memories kept on flashing by ...Li Hao's will tensed up slightly. Ermao also felt it. Li Hao, who was a rank seven venerable sovereign, was a little nervous at this moment.…… The memory came to a rainy night.A red shadow appeared.At this moment, Li Hao's will wavered. He even wanted to interfere and kill the shadow! Best novel online free at nσνEℓnєXт  He knew!His memory of that night was too clear. His brother had died on the same night, and before his death, he had asked him to leave the ancient academy. That was how the Silver City's Patrol division's patrol officer, Li Hao, had appeared!In the past, Li Hao only knew the latter part.He wasn't too sure what was happening in front of him, but he saw it today.The red shadow seemed to be wavering.In Li Hao and Zhang Yuan's dormitory, there were some fluctuations between the two dormitories. Obviously, the red shadow might not have expected that on this day, she would feel the auras of the two bloodlines of the eight great families.Perhaps he had sensed it, but Li Hao's aura was even more intense. His original target was probably Zhang Yuan, but now, he was wavering. In the end, he was led by the person behind the red moon and entered Zhang Yuan's dormitory.Li Hao's will instantly entered!Second cat followed him in.In the dormitory, it was dark and lightless. A red shadow suddenly entered Zhang Yuan's body. Zhang Yuan, who had been sleeping soundly, was suddenly jolted awake. His entire body seemed to be on fire. He was in extreme pain, but he could not make a sound!Self-ignition!In fact, the red shadow was burning his bloodline power, the Zhang family's bloodline power.At this moment, Zhang Yuan was in so much pain that he couldn't make a sound. It was as if his entire body had been burned to ashes. He was in so much pain that he even gave up struggling.Originally, the red shadow's supernatural power could easily deal with an ordinary person.Let the other party die in ignorance!He was unable to resist or resist.But at this moment, Li Hao discovered that the extremely pained Zhang Yuan seemed to have also discovered and seen something. His bloodline was ignited to the extreme, and the rich power of his bloodline seemed to let him see something ...Next door!A red line of blood!It was the eight trigrams Formation that the eight great families had used to seal the red moon sovereign. At this moment, Zhang Yuan felt as if he could see his own blood-red threads breaking apart.And next to him ... Was Li Hao. A line of blood also floated above his head.He didn't know where the desire to live came from, but Zhang Yuan, who was originally lying on the bed, unable to move, suddenly struggled at this moment. With a bang, he fell from the bed.In the dormitory, there were other people who seemed to have been awakened by this movement. Someone shouted a few times, but there was no response. In the dark, Zhang Yuan crawled, struggled, and pained ...

Chapter 3489 Copy (3)
At this moment, Li Hao finally realized what had happened that day.He had always known that on that stormy night, when everyone went to bed early, there was some movement from the bedroom next door. Gradually, the movement became louder and louder, and there were even screams. It was also that movement that prompted him to get out of bed and go to watch the show.In the end, he saw a scene that he would never forget.However, he didn't know that before this, Xiao Yuan had already given up struggling and accepted his fate.In the end ... He started to struggle.Did you see the last line on the eight trigrams, which was connected to me?In the darkness, a person was crawling with all his might. The dormitory door was clearly very close, but he struggled, crawled, and squirmed like a bug. The locked door became his greatest barrier, and he could not jump over it.His head hit the door, and the huge movement completely woke up the people in the dormitory.Someone turned on the light, and the next moment, there was a cry of surprise.Someone hurriedly opened the door, and someone tried to help Zhang Yuan up, but he was scalded and screamed. Zhang Yuan's body seemed to be on fire, and his screams echoed throughout the dormitory.As for Zhang Yuan ... He watched the door open and continued to climb.It wriggled out of the door bit by bit. In the surroundings, there were already many students, but no one dared to approach. All of them were shouting loudly with horror and fear ...It wasn't until the door next door opened, and the current Li Hao walked out of the dormitory, that Zhang Yuan, who had been wriggling and climbing, finally felt relieved.The corners of his mouth opened and closed slightly, as if he was saying something to Li Hao ...Li Hao knew what he was talking about.Quickly run!Yes, Li Hao still remembered this day.His brother had died on this night, and that night, everyone was in a panic. No one paid attention to what Zhang Yuan had said, and no one could see what he had said. They only saw his mouth opening and closing, as if he was asking for help ...Only Li Hao knew that he had to escape!……The memories of the past kept on shaking.Second cat didn't know much about the past, but it was shocked that an ordinary person had managed to crawl out of the hole, find Li Hao, and let him escape.Perhaps ... Without Zhang Yuan's struggle, a year later, on a stormy night, Li Hao might have died without a sound like Zhang Yuan. Then, the entire Silver Moon, the entire chaos, would not be like today.It was also that night that Li Hao saw Zhang Yuan's Red shadow and felt a suffocating sense of danger from Zhang Yuan's struggle and warning!That was how Li Hao came to be today.He walked out of the Silver City's ancient Academy and entered the inspection Office. He investigated the truth, understood the superpowers, and completely stepped into the Martial Master System. He broke away from his mortal body, and that was how he was today.Second cat, who had thought that he knew Li Hao very well, suddenly realized that he was actually the one they didn't know.No one saw this scene.Even though they knew that Li Hao's parents and childhood friends had died because of the red moon, no one knew that this was the exact situation in the past.What they didn't know was that on that day, as long as Zhang Yuan didn't struggle and gave up, he would have died silently. The red shadow would have disappeared, and Li Hao would never have seen it again. He wouldn't have found anything wrong with it, and he wouldn't have left the ancient academy completely. A year later, Li Hao would have died the same way. The bloodline of the eight great families would completely belong to Ying Hongyue ...Perhaps, that was Ying Hongyue's story.The memories continued to flow. At this moment, second cat saw more. It saw Li Hao at the inspection Office, slowly finding out the truth. He understood superpowers, martial masters, Red Moon ... Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  After that, up to the time it was resurrected, it knew everything.……The river rippled.Li Hao and second cat's consciousness left the river.Time and space trembled.Li Hao regained his calm.At this moment, second cat was somewhat sympathetic. He looked at Li Hao and asked,"you want to revive him?"At this moment, Li Hao was calm and unaffected. His face was calm. Why not? When I killed Ying Hongyue back then, it was too easy on him! If I had known that little Yuan would die like this ... I would have made him experience even more pain!"Second cat wanted to say something but didn't in the end.Ying Hongyue was already dead.In the red moon world, only the red moon sovereign was still alive.His revenge had been taken.However, it was very difficult to resurrect people.Too many people in the Silvermoon world had died for an ordinary person who had not cultivated or activated his Dao Meridian. Even if there were really Dao meridian stars, they would be like a speck of dust, a grain of sand, floating in the Silvermoon great path universe.A trillion!Which one would belong to an ordinary person like Zhang Yuan? Even someone as powerful as Li Hao couldn't resurrect all of them.If he really did that, Li Hao would have to die.Li Hao didn't dwell on this. He looked at second cat and said,""Now, you've seen all of my memories. It's not a simple description, but from the inside out ... Do you have any thoughts?"Second cat wanted to roll his eyes. What was he thinking?Copy?How could it be that simple?Besides, it was not sure if it would be fine.It also buried this past in its heart. Clearly, Li Hao had not completely let it go. He had left Silver Moon and targeted Red Moon not only because of neo martial, but also to find an excuse for himself.Dealing with Hong Yue might also be related to Zhang Yuan and his dead parents.
