        Zhou, please be direct."
        "Li Hao might come, or he might enter heaven battling city. If he's in trouble ... Will general Yuan take the risk to save him?"
        Yuan xingwu frowned,"is director Zhou very concerned about this?."
        Did this have anything to do with the director?
        "I'm just curious. Li Hao is a very bold person who takes risks easily. He has a deep hatred for the three major organizations. I'm worried that the star Army will cause unnecessary trouble if they act rashly."
        Yuan xingwu considered for a while and said,"yes, but the premise is that I can take risks, but I won't take others with me. Li Hao is my Junior Brother in name, but I'm not familiar with him. I should save him, but there's no reason for my brother to lose his life to save a stranger!"
        "Mm, that's good!"
        Deputy Director Zhou didn't say anything more. He stood up and said, "That's it, then. "
        There were only three questions, or rather, four.
        No one knew what Yuan xingwu was thinking. Li Hao, on the other hand, was extremely calm. He wasn't surprised by this answer at all. Even when the other party said that he wanted to save him ... He felt that there was no need to answer this way.
         He was right. They were not familiar with each other. It was the first time he had heard of this name.
        If it were him, he might have replied,"if I can save him, I'll help. If I can 't, I'll just drop him ..." Thus, Li Hao didn't think there was anything wrong with Yuan xingwu's answer. But Deputy Director Zhou, did he specifically ask this to tell him that the other party was unfriendly to him?
        Then he would be thinking too much.
        Li Hao's mind was much calmer than he had imagined. He had never felt that anyone had to pay anything for themselves.
        This included the time when he had met the red shadow. It was only when he had helped his teacher enter the universe of warrior power that he had hoped that his teacher could help him. Before that, he would rather bear everything on his own.
        In this world, a favor was the most difficult to repay!
        It was too troublesome to owe a favor that could not be repaid in a lifetime.
        ……
        After they left the tent, Li Hao once again escorted them back.
        Behind him, Yuan xingwu was also looking at Deputy Director Zhou, who knew what he was thinking.
        After walking for a long distance, Deputy Director Zhou continued,""Wang Ming's information isn't complete. I'll give you a copy. It's more complete and mostly correct, unless someone's hiding it very deeply ... Take a look."
        After saying that, he took out a small booklet and handed it to Li Hao.""This is all the information we've gathered this time. In addition, what you hear and see are all false. Your teacher's disciples are actually not simple. Last time, hou Xiaochen asked Hu dingfang to lead the team into the ruins, but it was actually quite complicated. Hu dingfang is Chen Yuhua's husband, and Yuan xingwu is Chen Yuhua's senior ... So, this time, the star Army might say they're stopping us, but in reality, it's hard to say. "
        Li Hao pretended not to hear it.
        Don't tell me this!
        It was useless.
        "I entered the ruins for a simple reason. My goal is simple: to become stronger.
         Comprehending the forces of water and wood and collecting divine power stones and origin weapons were mainly for the small sword. As for the rest ... He had promised to help hou Xiaochen get the origin weapon. He would help if he could. Even if the second rise of superpowers led to a great disaster and the seal was broken ... He didn't care!  What does it have to do with me?
        Even if the world is destroyed, does it have anything to do with me?
        If we're going to die, we'll die together!
        Hence, at this moment, Deputy Director Zhou felt like he was casting pearls before swine.
        This young man was really patient.
        He was impervious to anything!
        He had said so much tonight, but the other party didn't seem to listen at all and still didn't say a word. He didn't even seem to be interested in Yuan xingwu's side.
        When they were about to reach the military camp, Deputy Director Zhou asked the question that he was most curious about,"Li Hao, why don't you ask how many secrets we know? Perhaps, I will tell you. "
        Li Hao was silent.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Seeing Deputy Director Zhou look at him, he smiled and said,"Secret...When all your enemies are dead, there will be no more secrets. Even if there are secrets, they can be buried!"
        “……”
        Deputy Director Zhou frowned and looked at him.
        This answer was beyond his expectations.
        What did that mean?
        Did he have a strong killing intent, or did he say that on purpose?
         Li Hao, on the other hand, was too lazy to say anything more. It was not that he was bloodthirsty, nor that he was not curious. It was just that he recalled the scene in the illusion that day. He had said that if the murderer was obedient, he would surrender and commit suicide, and if he was not, he would kill everyone ...
        Every time Li Hao thought of this, he felt that forcing him to reveal his secret, showing mercy, and forcing the enemy to compromise ... Were all jokes!
        I have the power to kill all of you. If you don't kill yourself, I'll kill you all!
        Yes, it was so simple!
        That person was still as cool as ever!
        Therefore, he was not interested in the secrets that these people had. They treated it like a treasure and were afraid that others would find out. It was just a joke.
        With incomparably powerful strength, no matter how big your secret is, I'll kill you with one strike. You can hold it in until you die!
        The biggest regret in life was probably to have unspeakable secrets until death. What a pity.
        Deputy Director Zhou was totally speechless. He didn't say anything and left.
        As he walked, he sighed in his heart. This is so F * cking strange. Yuan Shuo didn't really teach Li Hao how to kill. This Li Hao ... Is he really too bloodthirsty, or did something unexpected happen?
       
        After watching Deputy Director Zhou enter the military camp, Li Hao recalled everything he heard today and suppressed it in the depths of his heart.
        It was interesting that there were internal disputes within Silvermoon.
        Moreover, this dispute ... Was it real or was it just a show?
        In any case, there were not many good people in Silver moon's current life.
        Li Hao didn't leave immediately. Instead, he walked forward.
        Wang Ming was still waiting up ahead.
        Seeing that a black hou had arrived, he suspected that it was Li Hao, but he was not sure. He said,""Brother, you were looking for me? Answer my question first, what breed of leopard is this Black Panther?"
        “……”
        Li Hao was speechless. He wasn't cautious when he should be, and he was blindly cautious when he shouldn't be!
        "Dog!"
         Wang Ming was instantly overjoyed."You're finally here! Where did you go just now?" he asked hurriedly.
        I've been waiting for you outside for a long time.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Come out!"
        "I'm grounded. "
        "Come out first, it's fine."
        Okay.
        Wang Ming glanced at the soldiers on both sides and took a step forward. As expected, the two didn't care about him. He was a little surprised; they hadn't let him out before.
        At this moment, Li Hao couldn't care less about this. He hurriedly walked out and turned to leave.
        Wang Ming hurriedly followed.
        After walking for a while, Li Hao turned around and said helplessly,""Who allowed you to go to the confidential room to check the information?"
        "Ah?"
        Wang Ming was stunned for a moment before saying,"No, why would I go to the intelligence room to check? I'm stupid, I just asked a friend to find out about the situation, what do you mean?"
        “……”
        Li Hao was speechless.
        What a fellow, Deputy Director Zhou didn't speak a single word of truth, right?
        So, he wasn't sure of his identity in the beginning.
        Did he say that on purpose?
        He was really speechless.
        These people had been officials for a long time, so they could tell lies without any sense of disharmony.
        Therefore, it was hard to tell whether the other party was telling the truth or lying.
        Li Hao stopped thinking about this and said,""Where's the information?"
        Although the other party had given him a copy, Li Hao naturally trusted Wang Ming more than Deputy Director Zhou. Besides, whether it was true or not, it would be clearer when they compared it later.  "I'm ready ..."
        Wang Ming took out a big notebook from his pocket. Seeing this, Li Hao casually threw a ring to him."Storage rings. Next time, don't keep them in your arms. How pitiful!"
        At the moment, he did not lack storage rings.
        Previously, he had collected a lot of storage rings. There were storage rings from the six three suns, the 17 three suns that died later, and the two sunguangs. There were also storage rings when he killed Yu Xiao and Huang Jie. In total, Li Hao had seized 25 storage rings.
        Now, other than the one he gave Liu Long, he kept the rest with him.
        Wang Ming was overjoyed to hear this!
        This thing was not cheap.
        "Senior brother, you're the best!"
        Wang Ming wanted to flatter him like crazy, but Li Hao was too lazy to listen. He glanced at Wang Ming, thought for a moment, and then said, "It's easy to level up. You just need to break the superpower lock. You can see five superpower locks, right?"
        "Yes, yes!"
        "I'm a genius!"Wang Ming was excited.
        Five super locks meant that he could enter the rising light without a hitch. The prerequisite was that he had enough capital. Otherwise, it would be useless even if he saw nine of them.
        To be able to see five, he was indeed a genius. People like Hao lianchuan could only see four. Now, he had stopped at three yang and was not moving forward. In order to show the next super Lock, he had to pay a huge price.
        Li Hao thought for a while and said,""If I give you enough metal-type mysterious energy, can you break through to the rising light?"
        Wang Ming thought for a moment, then shook his head."That won't do. It's not enough to just have the mysterious energy. Actually, it's also very dangerous to level up superpowers. I heard that there's a barrier between three suns and rising sun. I'm not too sure about the details, but it might involve some spiritual level things. However, there is enough energy. Three yang is possible ... But it also needs to be absorbed bit by bit. "
        He could not digest that much.
        "Do you have enough energy to break through to the radiant sun realm?" Li Hao asked after some thought.
        Wang Ming's eyes lit up!
        The last time he broke through to the radiant sun tier, Li Hao had extracted metal-elemental energy for him. He still hadn't forgotten that kind of energy. It wasn't as violent as mysterious energy. It was very gentle and very comfortable to absorb. He almost moaned.
        And the effect was super good!
        After the breakthrough, the burden on his body was not that great.
         At this moment, he was looking at Li Hao expectantly. Senior brother, are you going to give me some benefits?
        Li Hao looked at him and said a moment later,""I know a lot of superpowers but not many of them are close to me. Even fewer are willing to help me during critical moments. You guys are my junior brothers and sisters. If I am in danger, are you willing to help me?"
        "Of course!"
        Wang Ming hurriedly said,"of course!" Of course ... You can't ... You can't do anything to my family. You can 't. "
        "Why would I?" Li Hao smiled.
        "I still have a batch of mysterious energy," he said after some consideration."Give it to Hu Hao, Li Meng, and yunyao to use. I won't be meeting them." As for you, we'll talk about it after I come out of the ruins. "
        He knew a lot of superpowers, but these were the first few he met. Yuan Shuo even took them in as disciples in name.
        Although he had only casually accepted it ... It didn't mean that there was no implications.
        It was easy to become a superhuman but difficult to become a Martial Master.
        To tell the truth, if Liu Long had been given so many five elements to temper his five internal organs, Wang Ming might have already reached three yang. This wasn't an exaggeration, it was the truth, and he might have even advanced a great distance on the three yang road.
       
        There were many drawbacks to superpowers. Powerful supers wanted to become martial masters. It could be seen that those people also knew the problems with superpowers, so when they reached the level of sunguang, they were considering the next step of converting to superpowers.
        However, Li Hao didn't think that all superpowers were bad.
        At the very least, some of the superpowers were still very powerful.
        He then threw a storage ring to Wang Ming."There are some things for cultivation inside."
        "Senior brother is the best!"
        Wang Ming patted her again, but it was a pity that she wasn't a woman, so it was very greasy.
        Li Hao didn't care. He was about to leave when Wang Ming hurriedly said,"By the way, my grandfather said that not many officials will be going to the remains the day after tomorrow. Minister hou has fought for a spot for you, and no one else is allowed in ..."
        Li Hao frowned slightly.
        "Where are the loose cultivators?"
        "Rogue cultivators can enter as long as they pay!"
         Li Hao was speechless. After thinking for a while, he nodded and left quickly without saying anything.
        Wang Ming waited for Li Hao to leave. He was so excited that he couldn't die. He hurriedly checked the storage rings and was ecstatic. So many storage rings! Why was Li Hao so generous this time?
        He hurried back to the military camp. As soon as he entered, his grandfather appeared, giving Wang Ming a fright.
        His grandfather didn't criticize him for anything and just calmly said,""You went out to meet your friends?"
        "Yes."
        "I heard it's the Wei Wu Army?"
        "Right!"
        Wang Ming nodded."A Martial Master friend I used to know. He's doing pretty well in the Wei Wu Army, so he's here to catch up with me."
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Wang Peng ju looked at his grandson and said after a moment,""Think about it carefully. Of course, I won't interfere with you, but you have to be aware of one thing. Although no one says anything, although everyone is trying to avoid it ... The eight great families are still a huge explosion point!"
        With that, he turned around and left.
        He didn't say much, only telling his grandson to see some things clearly.
        The eight great families must be a huge explosive point. Hong Yue had been staring at them, but in fact, many people were also silently watching. No one talked too much about the eight great families, but that didn't mean that no one paid attention to them.
        In fact, the real powerhouses were all paying attention!
        It might not be a good thing for his grandson to be too close to Li Hao.
        But he didn't say it directly, and let Wang Ming make his own choice.
        After his grandfather left, Wang Ming pursed his lips and didn't pay much attention. Explosion point?
        So what!
        Only at the explosion point would there be opportunities. If it didn't explode, there wouldn't be any opportunities.
        His grandfather had been cautious his entire life, and as a result, he had lost the position of Commander-in-Chief of the White Dragon Army. This position had been almost certain to go to the Wang family.
        In order for the Wang family to have a more stable footing, he had made himself one of the night patrols. However, hou Xiaochen didn't care about the night patrols at all. All he cared about was the Wei Wu Army.
        It was another failed investment!  In the end, he didn't get anything, but he got a safe name. And then?
        What was the use?
        As for himself, Yue Ming and Yue Manyue had gone to the Silver City and advanced quickly. He was already in the middle stage of the sun glory realm. This time, Li Hao even had the intention to invest heavily in him. In the future, perhaps three suns and sun glory wouldn't be a problem.
        He had a big mouth and was loud, but his brain was fine.
        The energy that Li Hao had given him last time was too special. Wang Ming felt that as long as he had enough, he would be able to reach the peak of three suns, let alone the rising sun, and it wouldn't take too long.
        His grandfather had been in contact with superpowers since 20 years ago. Now, he had only just reached the peak of three suns. It was still a little difficult. It was only because he felt too much pressure recently that he used up all the resources of the Wang family and pushed himself up.
        Since the Wang clan didn't have any great opportunities, it was better to get close to those with great opportunities.
        At that moment, Wang Ming instantly threw his grandfather's words to the back of his mind. Eight great families ... Unfortunately, my Wang family isn't one of the eight great families, but fortunately, I've gotten the title of Yuan Shuo's in-name disciple.
        ……
        At this moment, Li Hao didn't care about Wang Ming's situation.
        Wang Ming might be shouting, but sometimes he could still do things quite appropriately. At the very least, he would do well and accomplish what you asked him to do.
        As he walked, he looked at the information Wang Ming had given him and compared it with what he had seen. Li Hao gradually had an idea.
        He didn't need to rush to see what director Zhou gave him.
        After walking for a while, a person appeared in the dark. It was Liu Long.
        "Who did you leave with just now?"
        Just now, Liu Long had been waiting outside. When he saw Li Hao leave with an old man, he was a little confused.
        "Director Zhou of the administration Bureau."
        "Oh ... He recognized you?"
        "Yes."
        Liu Long was a little surprised, but not too surprised. He walked back with Li Hao and said,""Don't interact much with these people from the general Administration. Scholars become officials for decades, and they speak the same words as humans and ghosts."
         Li Hao laughed.
        "Boss, have you heard of Yuan xingwu?"
        "What?"
        Liu Long was a little surprised, but he still nodded,""Of course, your eldest martial brother. When I was working in the Silver City, he and your master were both in the Silver City. Naturally, we knew each other and had a few dealings. He's pretty good, except for his extreme personality. I actually quite admire him. "
        "Extreme personality?"
        "Yes,"
        Liu Long explained,"he's a little extreme. After the rise of the superpowers, your master was suppressed by others. He was more anxious and angry than your master. Later, he ignored your master's objections and ran away from home ... That's probably what happened. After that, I'm not sure where he went. Did you see him?"
        "Yes."
        Li Hao didn't say anything else.
        He walked for a while and said,""The houtian remains have opened. Does boss want to go in?"
       
        "If you want to go in, then go in if you can. If you can't ... Do as you see fit."
        Liu Long still wanted to enter, not for the benefits, but to see more battles between experts. As a Martial Master, if he kept fighting with people who were weaker than him, he would not be able to improve himself.
        Now that he had barely stepped into the spirit accumulation realm, it was the best time for him to spar with experts and quickly improve himself.
        Li Hao thought for a while and said,"we'll see. If it doesn't work, it'll be difficult for us to enter as unaffiliated cultivators. After all, everyone might have our photos. If it doesn't work, we can follow the example of the three major organizations and wear masks and cloaks. I believe no one will check it."
        The three major organizations had always been like this. Who would check their appearance?
        There were also many itinerant cultivators who were like this.
        "You're not going with Minister hou and the others?"
        "Let's talk inside. "
        Li Hao didn't say anything more. The two of them returned to their stop in the town.
        ……
         27th of September.
        This time, no one was sparring. It had only been a month since the last battle between Yuan Shuo and the eyebrows-abrest stick. However, many people felt that it had been a long time.
        Yuan Shuo was still killing in the central region. Hong Yue had been chasing him, but she couldn't catch him.
        Yuan Shuo's methods were far beyond ordinary.
        Breath control, disguise, concealment, counter-tracking ...
        This person was proficient in everything.
        He had been in Silver City for more than ten years. He had nothing to do, so he specialized in studying these unorthodox methods.
        Not only that, but Yuan Shuo was also very familiar with the geography and culture of the central region. He had escaped many sieges and killed many Crimson Moon experts, causing them to be exhausted.
        He once again displayed the fierceness and ferocity of the devil from back then.
        ……
        At the same time.
        The three great organizations were in an uproar.
        On the red moon's side.
        Blue Moon kept frowning. Beside him, Green Moon was frowning as well. The tsunami had yet to return.
        According to their agreement, even if they couldn't catch Li Hao, they had to return before the 28th and enter the remains together. One more or one less Xuguang would still make a difference.
        "Not only elder tsunami, but the 16 Lords of Hell led by Banshan and the king of Samsara have not returned."
        Ziyue gave a simple report and said,""Our people went to the Cang Mountain, but it was very dangerous. There were some big demons there. On the way, we met a three yang demon, so some of the people who went in were either dead or injured. They chose to retreat and couldn't find the trace of elder tsunami and the others."
        Green Moon was a little irritated."So many people are chasing after a few martial masters. The strongest is only that Li Hao. He hasn't even reached the sunguang level, yet we actually lost him ... Is tsunami an idiot?"  It was not a good thing that he had not returned at this time.
        LAN Yue thought for a while and said,"if he really didn't come back, then forget it ..."
        Lu Yue said unceremoniously,"forget it?" Setting aside the problem of suguang, Li Hao was being chased by the tsunami. It was best to capture him alive or kill him. If not, they could come back together. Stop chasing him and let Li Hao come back. At least they would have a chance to enter the relic! Now, they're all gone, and you call this letting it go?"
        She snorted in dissatisfaction.
        LAN Yue, this trash, mobilized so many people, but in the end, he suffered a huge setback.
        As expected, that b*tch's son was trash!
        Blue Moon glanced at Green Moon. As a second generation Blue Moon, his status was naturally not as high as this person 's. However, as a fellow July, this was not the first time Green Moon had targeted him. On the other hand, he did not dare to target Purple Moon too much.
        Even if the purple Moon was only the third generation.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com However, Ziyue had a powerful backer behind her, while he did not.
        LAN Yue was very calm."Then we'll wait a little longer. We'll wait for a day. If he still doesn't return tomorrow ... Then we can only wait until we get out of the ruins to see."
        What else could he do?
        Green Moon only knew how to complain, but in reality, she did not do anything serious.
        At the side, Purple Moon couldn't stand it anymore. Although Blue Moon was sometimes stubborn, she still did some practical things, even if she wasn't very successful.
        At this moment, seeing Lu Yue repeatedly berate him in front of everyone, Ziyue said,""Aunt Peacock, let's discuss what we should do after we enter the remains tomorrow."
        They were about to enter the remains, but they didn't have a goal in mind. She was also very helpless.
        Seeing that Ziyue had spoken, Lu Yue's angry expression eased a little, and she said,""This time, before we came, our leader said that our first goal is to capture or kill Li Hao and bring back his body. The second goal is to figure out the specific situation in heaven battling city ..."
        "What?" Ziyue was a little surprised."What do you mean by 'get to the bottom of the situation'?"
         Wasn't he supposed to seize treasures, origin God weapons, and treasures?
        Green Moon was actually not too sure either. At this moment, she could only say, "That's what the leader said. He didn't make any hard requests. However, there's one thing we need to do. Don't touch anything in the city. Also, be careful of hou Xiaochen and the others. It's very difficult to kill him, but we can try to force him to use his full strength. "
        Everyone was frowning, not quite understanding what the leader meant.
        "Before I left, I asked the leader. The leader said that hou Xiaochen can't go on for too long. He's very strong, but he can't fight a long battle. So, we have to slowly wear him down."
        "In addition, when we arrive at heaven battling city, we just need to find out whether this is the real heaven battling city or not,"
        “……”
        The group of people were at a loss.
        The real heaven battling city?
        What did this mean?
        Green Moon was also very helpless. Sometimes, the leader would speak like this, and it was inexplicable. She could only continue,""It's just ... It's just ... I actually can't explain it clearly. You know our leader's style, but he only said one thing. If it's the real heaven battling city, we'll naturally know when the time comes, and if it's not, we won't be able to feel it. "
       
        The group of people were speechless.
        Forget it, I don't care anymore.
        Everyone understood that Ying Hongyue didn't have any clear requirements for their target this time. The only clear target was Li Hao.
        It was obvious that in Ying Hongyue's eyes, Li Hao was much more important than any origin divine weapon.
        This made everyone even more confused. Was Li Hao really that important?
        Since that was the case, why didn't they focus all their strength on Li Hao, but instead split up their forces to pursue Yuan Shuo? or was Yuan Shuo a great threat?
        ,m In addition, the leader couldn't leave rashly, otherwise, it would be easy for organizations such as the night patrollers to seize the opportunity and destroy the important core position of the Crimson Moon. However, there were many strong men in the group of elders, and there were several members of the priest ranking list. Why were they not seen?  Although Qiyue of Hongyue was also a leader, the situation was a bit complicated. Ying Hongyue was either a person who cared about old relationships or ... She was a perverted person. Qiyue of Hongyue, the first generation, except for Ying Hongyue herself, was actually all women.
        LAN Yue, these people were the second generation, and they only became men.
        Therefore, the strength of the leaders of the seven moons sect varied. Some of them were not as strong as the elders. However, the members of the elders did not have any complaints. Everyone knew that Hong Yue was the family and Ying Hong Yue was the leader. It was the same whether his female friends were the leaders or not.
         Even though they were suspicious, they knew that Ying Hongyue was sometimes very strange. When she was in a good mood, she would say something. When she was in a bad mood, she would get angry if you asked too many questions. It was very scary.
        ……
        On this day, Hong Yue was not the only one discussing.
        The one who was most frustrated should be King Pingdeng from Yama's side.
        At this moment, his expression was very ugly.
        Not only did the king of Samsara not return, but the sixteen Lords of Hell had also disappeared.
        He had given the order that if they couldn't find Li Hao, they should return before the ancient remain opened. However ... It was going to open tomorrow, early in the morning, but he still hadn't seen Li Hao.
        Where the hell did he go?
        The Green Mountains ... Were very dangerous.
        With the sixteen Lords of Hell around, his strength would increase greatly. If these people didn't return, he would only be at the middle stage of the rising light realm.
        King Pingdeng was also extremely irritated and kept sending people to investigate.
        The reincarnation King is a bastard. If he dies, he dies. But don't implicate my men.
        ……
        As the three major organizations anxiously waited, those people still didn't return even late into the night.
        It was the 28th.
        At dawn, the heaven battling city ruins would open again.
        The sky was still dark, but the ruins were already packed with people.
        In the inner area, a group of night patrollers and the Wei Wu Army surrounded the wall, blocking everyone's way. At this moment, the Wei Wu Army and night patrollers were under great pressure. There were too many people here this time, and there were many powerhouses.
        Many people were only there for the treasures, while some were there for hou Xiaochen.
         As time passed, more and more people gathered.  Moreover, some important figures had also started to enter the venue.
        "Xu Feng is here!"
        Someone recognized Xu Feng, a figure on the God tier master ranking list. He had landed on a cliff and didn't come down.
        "Heavenly Star city's Liu clan has also sent people!"
        "Are they from the Linjiang governor's mansion?"
        Someone recognized another group of people. They were from Linjiang, Silver moon's neighbor.
        Linjiang's system was slightly different from Silver Moon 's, as Silver Moon had four major organizations working in parallel.
        It was the same for Linjiang, but the director of the general Administration of Linjiang was powerful and held a high position. He had the absolute advantage and the right to speak in Linjiang. He unified several major organizations and formed a new organization, the Linjiang governor's office, the number one person in Linjiang in both name and reality.
        At this moment, people from the Linjiang governor's mansion had also arrived.
        With the arrival of the experts, the entire Valley was bustling with noise and excitement.
        At this moment, a burst of laughter could be heard."Everyone is early!"
        The next moment, a rough-looking man with an unkempt beard stepped through the air. As his foot landed, a loud boom was heard, and many stones were cracked. Some people recognized this person.
        "The southern Fist is here!"
        "This guy, this is not a place for him to be arrogant. Outside, everyone will at least give some face to the imperial family, but inside ... Who would care about the title of Imperial coach? He's a pure Martial Master who has changed his blood a few times. It's said that he's very strong, comparable to the three suns ... But this time, it's nothing. "
        The arrival of the southern Fist also caused a heated discussion.
        However, not many people cared.
        Even some people from Sky Star City only glanced at it and didn't pay much attention to it.
        ……
         On the cliff.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Xu Feng, whose hair was covered in white frost, glanced at Nan Quan and chuckled,""Southern Fist ... I heard that a triple blood transfusion also has the combat power of three suns?"
        Beside him, the old man glanced at Nan Quan with a complicated look in his eyes. He nodded,""There is such a saying."
        "Yes."
        Xu Feng didn't say anything. He looked into the distance and frowned,""Qi gang is also here."
        This was a true opponent.
        Although they were both on the God tier Masters Ranking, sakgang was from the Division of Administration. He was very powerful and ranked much higher than him. They were both in the mid-stage of the Sunglow realm, but he was stronger than him.
        As far as Xu Feng knew, a few people on the God tier masters list had arrived.
        Aside from LAN Yue of Red Moon, Qi gang of the administrative department was one of them. In addition, it was said that an elder of Fei Tian had arrived. He was a very famous shadow swordsman, who was also on the God tier Masters Ranking list and had assassinated a Sunglow master.
        Xu Feng was observing the surroundings. At this moment, many people were also observing.
       
        There were indeed many experts.
        ……
        Li Hao had also arrived.
        Li Hao wasn't wearing his black armor anymore. He was wearing a mask. Different from Red moon's ghostly mask, he was wearing a Tiger Mask. Normally, it would be quite eye-catching, but now, it wasn 't.
        Because there were a few people wearing masks near him.
        These wandering cultivators were also worried that something might happen.
        If he got the treasure and his identity was known, it would be hard for him to escape the pursuit. It was better to hide his identity from the beginning.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao didn't care about them. He looked around and compared them with the information he had obtained the day before yesterday. He had already recognized many people.
        Xu Feng, who was at the middle stage of the rising light realm, was one of the more famous ones among these people.
        In the distance, an official was rushing over. It was the outsider, Qi gang, who was also at the mid-stage of the rising light realm.
         He knew Hu Qingfeng, who was at the early stage of the rising light realm.
        On Red moon's side, many people had also arrived. Li Hao glanced around and saw a few sunguang orbs. One of them was even stronger than Qi gang. It was probably Green Moon Green peacock.
        Green Moon and blue Moon. In addition to these two rising lights, there were two more rising lights on the Crimson Moon's side. One was at the early stage of the rising light realm, and the other ... Was actually at the late stage of the rising light realm. However, the light clusters were not too obvious, and the information did not show it. It seemed that they had hidden their identities.
        It was the same old thing!
        These people loved to do such things, but unfortunately, they couldn't hide it from Li Hao.
        As he was thinking, his eyes suddenly moved.
        On Hong Yue's side, a young man was also looking around. He seemed to be looking at something. Li Hao followed his line of sight, and his expression changed.
        This person seemed to be looking at people who he was sure had hidden their identities.
        They were all very powerful, even including some martial masters!
        ……
        At this moment.
        On Hong Yue's side, the young man looked around and said,""There are a few three suns in the crowd. I can't see the light of dawn, but even if the three suns hide, they can't hide the superpower lock that they broke. I can feel their superpower lock breaking ..."
        "Also, there are a few powerful martial masters, all of whom have power."
        This person's eyes were slightly different from the others. There was more white in his eyes, but if one didn't look closely, one would notice something.
        Green Moon didn't mind, and only transmitted, "I'm going to see hou Xiaochen!"
        In the distance, hou Xiaochen had already arrived.
        ? The young man looked over, and his eyes immediately bled. He groaned and transmitted a message,""I can't see it ... I can only see a spear that looks like it's going to tear the void apart ... I can't look at it anymore. If I keep looking, my eyes will be disabled!"
        Green Moon was a little solemn. Was it that strong?
        The person in front of him was one of the members of the heavenly eye.
        It was very difficult to cultivate a heavenly eye, so even there were not many Crimson moons. This time, he had specially brought a heavenly eye who had cultivated deeply to this place in order to better observe all parties and deal with some of the dangers in the remains.
        Who would've thought that he'd be at a disadvantage against hou Xiaochen right after arriving?
        ……
        In the distance.
        Hou Xiaochen also looked over at Hong Yue. He looked at the young man and smiled.
        He whispered to the people around him,"the heavenly eye ... It's good to have a heavenly eye. You can see things that others can 't. Rumor has it that Li Hao has also opened a heavenly eye. What do you think?"
        No one replied.  Kong Jie, who was beside him, was looking around. After a while, she asked,""Old hou, do you think Li Hao will come?"
        "I don't know about that."
        "You're too humble!"
        Kong Jie laughed and said,"he should be here. Forget it. Let's not care about him. He probably has his own thoughts." Old hou, there are quite a few experts coming from all over the world this time. Are you confident?"
        "I still need the Secretary to take care of me."
        "Forget it, I can't do that!" Kong Jie laughed.
        As they were chatting, hou Xiaochen looked at someone in the distance and frowned,"The earth overturning sword is here again?"
        “……”
        Everyone looked into the distance. Over there, Hong Yitang was also drilling in like an ordinary person.
        Hou Xiaochen frowned and didn't say anything.
        "Earthcover sword ... It's been getting more and more dispirited these years," Jin Shan said in a low voice, raising his eyebrows.
        That look, it didn't have any of the demeanor of the second of the Seven Swords back then.
        Steward Yu and frenzied sword looked over in that direction, but they did not say anything.
        ……
        In the distance.
        Hong Yitang had come alone this time. He was squeezing through the crowd and stepped on someone's foot. He looked around and wondered where Li Hao was hiding.
        It was as if he was at a market, and he kept squeezing.
        This caused some people in the surroundings to complain. If it weren't for the fact that there were experts from various major forces here, some people would have wanted to beat him up.
        As they were squeezing, someone beside them transmitted a message,""Martial uncle Hong is also here?"
        “……”
        Hong Yitang felt a little strange. He glanced at a Martial Master with a Tiger Mask not far away and also transmitted his voice,""I'm just curious, how did you manage to conceal your power?"
        Influence was actually very difficult to conceal.
        Even if they couldn't sense it with their superpowers, they couldn't hide it from other Martial Master powerhouses.
        "It's just a small trick!"
        Li Hao was also excited."Now that senior uncle is here!" He said."I can rest assured!"
         Hong Yitang rolled his eyes.
        What was there to be at ease about?
        "Uncle-master, do you have any goals this time?"
        "No, I just want to get some blood deities. My heart is weak, so I can't do anything about it ... Do you want to give me some?"
        "I don't have any, either."
        "Then what should I say?"
        Hong Yitang indeed didn't have many goals. He just needed to get some Blood God.
        As for Li Hao ... Forget it. He didn't really want to ask this guy for help.
        "Martial uncle, shall we go in together later?"
        "Don 't, you go your way!"
       
        Hong Yitang refused.
        Li Hao didn't say anything. A moment later, a Martial Master wearing a Tiger Mask appeared behind Hong Yitang. He had been following him. Since he was already here and had seen everything, what was the point of being pretentious? he was going to follow Hong Yitang!
        As for the fact that Hong Yitang had entered for the blood God ... Li Hao didn't really believe it. Of course, he didn't completely believe it.
        People like Hong Yitang had a strange way of doing things, and no one knew what he was up to.
        He didn't establish a powerful sect, nor did he hold a high position like hou Xiaochen and the others. He had the style of an idle martial cultivator, but he rarely showed himself, so he kept a low profile compared to Tian Jian and the others.
        No matter what, he knew that he was powerful, so he just had to follow him!
        In front of him, Hong Yitang was speechless.
        This guy is still sticking to me!
        Forget it, it's fine. It doesn't matter.
        At this moment, Hao lianchuan's voice was heard from afar,""Those who have registered and paid the fee can enter directly! Those who didn't sign up, those whose strength was unknown, and those who hid their strength, all of them had to pay according to the sunguang rule! If you are a Martial Master, you will have to pay according to the three suns rule!"
         "If you don't want to pay so much, then show your strength. Supers have to be inspected by the Super detector. If you want to hide your strength, no one will stop you. Just pay the fee like how sunguang does!"
        “……”
        Around them, many people cursed in low voices.
        How black!
        Who would be willing to reveal their full strength and let you investigate?
        The superpower was paid according to the sunrise price, which was ten divine power stones. How many people could afford it?
        As for martial masters, they had to pay according to the three suns rule, which was also frighteningly expensive.
        A Martial Master shouted,"how many martial masters are there in the three suns?" It's hard to judge a Martial master's strength, but it's at the peak of Qian warrior. It's too expensive to pay according to three suns!"
        Hao lianchuan set up a big table and said calmly,"then we won't go in. Martial Master douqian is just like sunlight. Are you going to die?" It wasn't easy to judge a Martial master's strength, so did he really have to fight? We'll pay according to the price of one divine power Stone. It's good enough that we didn't ask you to pay according to the price of the rising light. If you don't want to go in, then don't go!"
        “……”
        The group of people cursed in low voices again!
        It was too expensive!
        As for Li Hao, he secretly complained. While he was thinking, Hong Yitang suddenly sent a voice transmission,""Pay for me. I gave you the divine power stones last time. I don't have any money."
        “……”
        Li Hao was completely speechless!
        What a ... Trap!
        Very quickly, he followed the rest and squeezed his way over. After a while, it was his turn. Hao lianchuan did not even raise his head."Martial Master or superhuman?"
        "Martial Master,"
        "How many people?"
        "Two people."
        "Two divine power stones or 2000 cubic meters of mysterious energy!"  “……”
        This was a real windfall!
        Li Hao was also convinced. With this, many people might be eliminated and not be able to enter. It was too expensive.
        He didn't say anything and took out two storage rings, both full.
        Hao lianchuan took it and checked it. Then, he threw two empty storage rings to Li Hao and two tokens, both of which had the word "Wu" written on them. They were very rough iron tokens!
        "After it opens, you and your companion can each take one ... By the way, do you want to buy a few more? You can't enter without a tag. "
        "No need!"
        Li Hao was speechless. This person had started a business. This time, the night patrolman would probably make a lot of money.
        Hao lianchuan didn't say much. He lowered his head and continued to work on the next task.
        In a short while, storage rings were placed in front of him. With a wave of his hand, he put all of them into the storage ring. Some of the people who saw this were green with envy. In just a short while, the other party had collected at least tens of thousands of cubes of mysterious energy and more than ten divine power stones.
        This was for the others, and some of them had already registered for the qualification a long time ago. This time, Silver Moon had earned a fortune.
        Li Hao also stared at it. He felt like robbing it.
        Forget it, we're family. I won't Rob you.
        Moreover, there were so many experts watching.
        However, he would have to get it back later. He didn't need to spend money to enter, and now he had wasted his money.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com As everyone obtained the qualifications, some of the poor could only watch helplessly. They were all a little depressed and upset, but Li Hao felt that if one was so poor that they couldn't even afford to pay the entrance fee ... They shouldn't gamble!
        There was a high chance that they would gain nothing and even lose their lives.
        A moment later, as the sun rose, hou Xiaochen spoke,"Open the ruins and enter in an orderly manner. Don't panic!"
        As the waves of energy hit the wall, the water rippled and the ruins opened again!
        ……
         At the same time.
        In heaven battling city.
        The floating old turtle looked like a statue, but its eyes seemed to have gained some intelligence as it looked into the distance.
        Another person came.
        Below, a Black Dog was napping in boredom. It seemed to have heard some movement and its tail wagged. It opened again?
        I can go out now?
        Here, he was so hungry that he was almost skin and bones.
        ? Further down, in the mansion, the Golden-armored warrior was still sitting on the high platform, holding the Black Tortoise seal in his hand. Just like before, it was as if the last time someone had broken in was a thing of the past.
        The vast heaven battling city was extremely quiet, not a single sound could be heard.
        [PS: I'm going out for dinner. The next chapter will be a little later, around five or Sixo' clock.]
       
        Outside, the remains had officially opened.
        With their previous experience, they were not in a hurry to enter. There was nothing in the outer city and the inner city gates were not open. If they did not use the second passage, superpowers would not be able to fly, so they were not afraid of people breaking in.
        The gold-tier Warriors were still there, so there was no need to worry that someone else would get there first.
        p It was still the same. The individual cultivators were the first to go in. They were all in a hurry, as if they were afraid that the treasure would be gone. They were also the ones who died the fastest. The individual cultivators who went in last time were all annihilated!  Li Hao and the others were currently unaffiliated cultivators.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com They paid the money and entered.
        The price of the three suns was the same as the price of a Martial Master. Hong Yitang held the iron token and no one said anything. In fact, now that the swords gate had joined the Wei Wu Army, it wouldn't matter if they didn't pay.
        At this moment, hou Xiaochen and the others looked at Hong Yitang, then at the Tiger-masked man.
        They were all wondering if this person was Li Hao.
        Of course, he was not sure.
         It was because Li Hao and Hong Yitang didn't seem to be that close, but why would Hong Yitang allow a large number of swords gate martial masters to join Li Hao's demon hunt squad?
        Just as he was thinking, a figure flashed past. The next moment, Nan Quan quickly stepped forward and laughed,""Then I'll go in first, I'll take the good stuff first!"
        Some of the experts on the outside ignored him.
        Going in so early, was he courting death?
        This Southern Fist guy, did he still think that this was the Silver Moon martial forest of the past?
        The north and south fists had long become a form of the past. Old demon five birds of the past was now being chased to the ends of the earth.
        Nanquan didn't care. He jumped up and instantly rushed into the rippling wall.
        Li Hao and Hong Yitang didn't stop and directly entered.
        As for Liu Long, he was mixed in with the crowd. Li Hao didn't care that he was among the unaffiliated cultivators. It might be safer if he didn't act with him.
        ……
        His vision turned black, and when he reappeared, he was on a large platform.
        Hong Yitang was also familiar with the place. He had been here before.
        At this moment, there were many people gathered on the platform. They were all the itinerant cultivators who had entered earlier.  The southern Fist was also there.
        When he saw Hong Yitang, he quickly ran over and chuckled. Then, he looked at Li Hao and said telepathically,""This is my first time here. Can you two bring me along?"
        The two of them had been here before.
        It was better to follow them than to wander around alone.
        Although he was very strong, ancient ruins like heaven battling city might contain great dangers. Let alone him, even existences one level stronger than him would not be able to return from these ruins.
        At this moment, someone among the wandering cultivators seemed to know something. He shouted,""It's best if we all act together. The three great organizations and the Silver Moon officials are all very powerful. If we act alone, we might become their Pathfinders! Also, there's a passage in front later. You have to follow the passage and don't walk out of the passage. If you walk out, you won't be able to come back!"
        Nan Quan looked at Li Hao, who rolled his eyes. Don't look at me. Last time, I was directly teleported to the outer city. I don't know what happened this time, but I didn't get teleported to the outer city. I don't know if it's because I've become stronger, but the teleportation system here can't teleport me anymore.
        Did it become heavier?
        However, the last time he came back, he had walked through the passageway once. He transmitted his voice,""There's a pitch-black passage in front that leads to the outer city, but it's not too dangerous. I'm not sure what will happen if we walk out of the passage, so it's best not to move ... There seems to be something outside the passage!"
        At this moment, Hong Yitang also transmitted his voice,"be careful. This passage might be a tree hole. Once you walk out of the tree hole, you might be in great danger. This tree might cover the entire outer city ... And is connected to the transverse Canyon outside. It's the key to keeping heaven battling city from being buried."
        Li Hao was startled. Trees?
        A tree hole?
         Hong Yitang continued,"after you go in, be careful. Don't move about in the passage. This place is actually more dangerous than you think. Last time, I felt it. Sometimes, I would be attacked by some tree branches. These tree branches still have some life, but I don't think they are too strong. Three suns can easily deal with them ... But there's nothing wrong with being careful!"
        Nan Quan also raised his eyebrows. Li Hao had shared some information with Hong Yitang, and he didn't hide it. "It seems that this heaven battling city is really very dangerous. In fact, there are some records in some ancient books. Heaven battling city ... The imperial family has given us some information, and the ancient books have records that this city once welcomed a Supreme Master. When that Supreme Master passed by, he left behind some Supreme treasures that made heaven battling city a Supreme existence, representing his will ... The information given by the imperial family is not very clear, but it reminds us that this city has an extremely special meaning."
        Li Hao couldn't help but recall the scene he had seen that day.
        A Supreme existence?
        The person who was called venerable sovereign?
        The man left behind the two words "Zhan Tian." In that instant, the entire city reveled in excitement and fanaticism. It was as if the two words "Zhan Tian" had too many meanings.
        The elderly city Lord seemed to be so excited that he was about to faint.
        It seemed like the royal family had a lot of information. They even knew about this.
        Of course, there should have been records of the ancient civilization. It was impossible for such a major event to not leave behind any traces. After all, that great figure seemed to be extremely powerful and important.
        Nan Quan continued,"also, this city might have left something behind by the other party. It might even be his will!" If that was the case ... Then it would be too valuable! To let the powerhouses of the ancient civilization be called Supreme existences, it might be so powerful that it's beyond our imagination. If we can find such a treasure ... Then we'll really make a big profit!"
       
        Did he say those two words?
        Li Hao thought to himself, but didn't say it out loud. Some things could be said, but some things could be forgotten.
        "Are we going with the wandering cultivators or are we going to act on our own?" Nan Quan asked.
        "Did I say I'm going with you?"
        Hong Yitang was speechless. Who wants to be with you!
        Nan Quan chuckled and transmitted his voice again,""If you're not with me, then who are you with? If we go together, we'll be able to take care of each other. With Li Hao here, we'll sneak into the city and sweep everyone. No one can stop us. If hou Xiaochen comes, we'll beat him up until he calls us "dad"!"
        Hong Yitang was speechless.
        Li Hao didn't care. He said telepathically,""Then let's go to the second passage first and take a look. Last time, I didn't go, but martial uncle Hong did. Are there any benefits and effects?"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "It's not that effective," Hong Yitang said telepathically as he walked."It might be better for superpowers, but for us ... It's not that good." "However, the second passage should have some sort of assimilation effect. It will assimilate our auras and make us more compatible with heaven battling city, allowing us to avoid some danger. As for the deaths of the supers, it's highly likely that they've retaliated or their superpower fluctuations are too strong. They'll be seen as a provocation and disobedience, so we'll pass through them naturally later. "
        Li Hao understood.
         The three of them didn't care about the others and walked straight inside. There, a dark passage appeared.
        The three of them stepped in. At this moment, the passage was rustling, as if something was crawling, but they couldn't see anything.
        Not long after he entered, he suddenly heard the sound of something breaking through the air. Li Hao threw a punch, and the thing in the darkness disappeared in a flash. Li Hao seemed to have seen something. He thought of what Hong Yitang had said. It was indeed a branch, but it came and left quickly.
        The attack power was not too strong, it was probably on the same level as the sunlit stage.
        Last time, Li Hao didn't see it clearly, and he didn't see it in person because the three suns opened the way.
        Meanwhile, Hong Yitang grabbed onto a tree branch, and the branch struggled violently. At this moment, the passageway even started to tremble slightly. Hong Yitang let go immediately and sent a voice transmission,""Don't deal with these branches, just drive them away. If you break them or cut them down with your strength, be careful not to suffer even greater trouble! In this place, the weaker it is, the safer it is. You can't destroy it even if you want to. However, if the strong are too arrogant, they will die a miserable death!"
        Sometimes, a person who drowned knew how to swim.
        You don't know how to swim, but you're afraid.
        Now that he knew, he didn't know fear.
        He thought that he had understood the remains and was powerful. It was normal to fail in an easy task. Even Hong Yitang did not dare to be careless here.
        The tunnel wasn't very long. Halfway through, Li Hao's group heard exclamations from behind.
        Then, there were screams.
        Obviously, some of the weaker ones couldn't even withstand the attack of the tree branches. They were either Yue Ming or the weaker ones in the sunlight sect. They didn't have time to react and were pierced through by the tree branches.
        The three of them didn't care about this. Once they entered, they accepted death.
        No one forced them to come in. Wealth came from danger. Clearly, danger was approaching now. If they died here, they could only say that they were too unlucky and too weak.
         Behind them, there were constant exclamations.  There were many people entering this time. There were probably hundreds or thousands of wandering cultivators, far more than the last time.
        ……
        Li Hao's group of three advanced.
        Along the way, there were also tree branches that constantly disturbed them, but they were all repelled by the three of them and did not cause any trouble.
        In the darkness, the three of them walked for a while. Soon, a faint light appeared. Li Hao knew that they would reach the outer city. As soon as they left, they would reach the large square, where many people had died last time.
        As soon as he walked out ... Li Hao's footsteps stopped.
        Similarly, Hong Yitang stopped in his tracks. The two of them stopped at the same time. However, Nan Quan was a little confused. He looked at the two of them. At this moment, Li Hao's eyes revealed a hint of surprise and shock.
        Not only him, but Hong Yitang's expression also changed slightly. He looked into the distance and saw a few black shadows flashing past outside the square.
        The two of them looked at each other, their eyes filled with shock.
        Black Phoenix!
        That's right, they couldn't have seen it wrong. Hei Teng had been active in the square just now.
        "What's wrong?"
        Southern Fist was curious.
        "Blackpeak!"
         Li Hao sent a voice transmission."Last time, a team of 1000-man guards was completely taken care of by us. We even took Black Phoenix. But ... I saw black Phoenix just now!"
        Hong Yitang looked for a while and said,""It's either the remaining ones from last time, or ... It means that this city has more than just the black armored guards from last time. There might be more, but they didn't appear before, or they're in another direction. Right now, we can only enter from this direction. Are there any other gates? If there is ... It means that there are four city gates and four thousand-man guards. The one we destroyed last time was only one of them. "
        There was another possibility. Hei Teng was still in the city and had come out this time.
        No matter what, this meant that the danger level had increased.
        The originally carefree Southern Fist had also quieted down.
        "What do we do?"
        "Cold! Of course, we have to keep moving forward. Before the others come, we will go to the second passage, enter the outer city, and then enter the inner city. Don't look for the gold-tier warrior, get some divine energy stones for self-protection first!"
        These words received the approval of the southern Fist.
        Right!
        He had to prepare enough divine power stones first. Only with enough divine power stones could he hope to unseal himself and not become a super.
       
        The three of them didn't say anything more and quickly walked forward.
        After that, more wandering cultivators entered. They seemed to have heard some news and felt that the outer city was no longer a threat since hei Teng was dead. Not long after, some superpowers entered the outer city.
        They were very fast, as if they were afraid that someone would snatch it from them.
        After a short while ... A series of miserable screams rang out!
        It was difficult for these black hou to deal with the three suns, but it was not too difficult to deal with the sunlit tribe. They were silent, and although the sound of their footsteps was obvious, some of them were so fast that they did not care about the sound of their footsteps ... They thought that others had come in ahead of them, so they naturally died a miserable death!
        The ground began to absorb the blood and corpses again.
        ……
        When Li Hao's group of three went directly to the second passage and began to walk down the passage ...
        Behind them, a group of experts began to enter.
        Hearing the screams from within the city, some people's expressions changed. Some looked at hou Xiaochen's group, who frowned and calmly said,"The black Phoenix was cleared out last time, but it seems like it has appeared again! Entering the city rashly will only lead to death. Unless you are powerful, otherwise ... These black Vatican are enough to make everyone suffer!"
         In the crowd, Ziyue frowned and said in a deep voice,""We cleared out all the black Phoenix last time. Why are there still more?"
        Hou Xiaochen was too lazy to reply.
        Go check it out yourself!
        He glanced in the direction of the second passage. Hong Yitang and the others had come in advance with Li Hao. Did they go to the second passage, or did they enter the city?
        At this time, there were people everywhere.
        The quiet ancient city was completely awoken.
        The sound of clamoring spread in this place.
        Someone suddenly stepped into the air and directly stepped into the outer city ... The next moment, there was a loud bang and he was directly blown apart.
        Hou Xiaochen was speechless.
        Did he not understand at all?
        To be honest, if one were to ask around carefully, one would still be able to find out some information about the crisis. So, there were still people who didn't understand the situation at all and came here directly, and then ... Sent themselves to their deaths?
        Did these superpowers think that the heavens were the boss and they were the second boss?
        'As expected, no one knows how to cherish a power obtained rashly. No one knows what caution is. A bunch of idiots!'
        At this moment, someone in the crowd shouted,"are you an idiot?" You can't fly, you have to go through the second passage before you can fly. Otherwise, there is a no-fly formation in this place and you will be attacked. If the three suns are attacked, they will die!"
        This time, someone suddenly realized.
        Not everyone had not done their homework, but there were indeed some lone travelers who did not care too much. They only knew that there were benefits and treasures everywhere, and then they came in on impulse.
        Now, a group of people had died.
        A few powerful rogue cultivators had been trying to gather the crowd, but they had failed several times. It was only now that a group of people had died that some people realized that this place was not so safe!
        Very quickly, some people started to form cliques and factions, looking for powerful itinerant cultivators to cooperate with.  At this moment, Ziyue stepped forward and shouted,""We can't enter the city rashly. There's black Phoenix in the city and their defense is strong. Once the superpowers fluctuate or leak out, it will cause them to attack!"
        "There's a restriction in the air. Unless it's sunguang, even a peak three-yang cultivator will die without a top-grade original divine weapon to protect their Dao! If you're willing to wait, you can enter with Hong Yue!"
        Find cannon fodder!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At this moment, the members of the red moon were also worried. Did this mean that the silver-tier Warriors from last time might appear again?
        This was very F * cked up!
        Although the silver-tier warrior was only at the three-sun level, that was under the condition that it was not awakened. Once it was awakened, the other party would probably have the combat power of the rising light, which would be very troublesome.
        Also, entering the second passage was extremely dangerous.
        But this time, everyone knew that if they didn't go through the second passage, they would encounter danger and even more trouble. They had to go, otherwise, it would be difficult to enter the inner city.
        All the major factions began to head toward the second passage.
        ……
        At the same time.
        Li Hao's group of three entered the small house in the second passage.
        It was pitch black.
        The moment Li Hao entered, he felt as if he had entered darkness. There was no sound in his surroundings, as if Hong Yitang and Nan Quan, who had entered together, had disappeared.
        However, after a while, Li Hao's eyes seemed to have gotten used to it and he saw something.
        At this moment, Li Hao gradually saw more things.
        It seemed to be a small house. It was squarish, and there seemed to be a door in front for people to go out. There was no one around.
        And above the roof, there seemed to be a net falling.
         The dark net fell mechanically.
        Li Hao was a little surprised. This ... Was what they meant by a sense of seal. Superpowers were sealed by this net and could no longer be leaked, allowing them to walk in the city?
        He raised his head and looked at the net. He was not sure if there were any disadvantages.
        However, at this moment, it seemed that he could not avoid it.
        What about the southern Fist and Hong Yitang?
        Could it be that there was not only one but many of such small houses? when everyone entered, they would enter different small houses. Then, the big net would fall, as if it was stamping you, and you would be able to enter the city smoothly?
        Mechanical operation?
        Why can I see it?
        Suspicion rose in Li Hao's heart. Could it be related to my eyes?
        He didn't care about the net that was slowly falling. He couldn't avoid it anyway. He looked around. The door in front seemed to be closed. The small house was not big, about 30 square meters. It was squarish and five to six meters long.
