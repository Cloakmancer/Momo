He had a headache, and he couldn't solve it in a short time.He could only take it one step at a time. There would always be a way out.In the worst case scenario, they could squeeze in for a while or simply put everyone to sleep. As long as the time was short, it wouldn't be a big problem. Of course, in that case, if anything happened to Li Hao, everyone would die.If it didn't recover, with the passage of time, it would also cause death.They had all been destroyed. No matter how many people there were, they could find a small world and force it in. It would barely fit. It was just that it was inhumane. But at this point, even humanity could not do anything.……As the dragon world disappeared ...In Li Hao's direction, the sector Lords started to arrive one after another. The Dragon Lord's departure had nothing to do with them. He was a super important figure, and whether he was present or not didn't affect them.If one day all the level 7s left, there might be chaos, but now, there were still a bunch of Level 7s here, naturally it had nothing to do with these sector Lords.……The Silver Moon's venerable sovereigns also started to sneak in.He didn't move quickly, nor did he dare to move too quickly.……While Li Hao was planning ...At the eastern end of the Dragon field.Over there, towering pillars stood in a forest, and lightning flickered faintly.The Thunder region had stood here for countless years.Usually, the chaos lightning tribulation was so powerful that no one dared to come and go as they pleased. However, after the recent period of peace, some bold people began to try to travel through the lightning territory and enter and exit.The outside was very big, which was the expectation of the experts of the square domain.As for the four-sided region, the destruction of a rank nine world was what the experts outside expected.As a result, the Thunder region became a barrier that many experts wanted to pass through.In this extremely terrifying Thunder region, there was a world that was half hidden and half visible. Half of it was in the Thunder region, and the other half was in the outside world.The entire Thunder World was divided into two parts.Half of the territory was filled with lightning and thunder.Although there was not much lightning in a normal territory, even the air was filled with the power of lightning.Under normal circumstances, a major world would have more than a hundred billion people.However, the Thunder World was different.There were many experts in the Thunder World, but it was not suitable for ordinary people to live. It was difficult for the weak to survive. In addition, the Dragon field had sealed them off, and they had to take risks and travel through the Thunder field from time to time. After countless years, the current Thunder tribulation only had a population of about thirty billion.This was a level 7 world!Even silver Moon, who was not considered a force back then, had a population of ten billion.A tier 7 world with only three times the population of the Silver Moon ... One could imagine how difficult it was to survive. Half of the world was almost uninhabitable, and only experts could enter to cultivate and explore.  Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  The remaining half of the world also had lightning eruptions all year round. This also led to the fact that there were almost no other cultivators in the entire Thunder World. They were all lightning cultivators and could not cultivate other cultivation techniques even if they wanted to. There were no such elements in the world.Thunderbolt divine Palace.The location of the Thunder world's master.It was simple and crude, with only endless lightning flashing in the sky. This place had also gathered the power of countless lightning, guiding the lightning between heaven and earth to prevent the entire world from being destroyed.But today, a young venerable sovereign hurried into the hall with a happy face and said eagerly,""Thunder Emperor, the Dragon Realm has left!"The Thunder monarch, who was teasing a Thunder Dragon made of Thunder in front of him, turned his head and looked. After a long while, a muffled Thunder-like voice sounded,""He left?""Right!"The young venerable sovereign was extremely excited."There's news from the outside world that the dragon world has participated in the war of the other three regions. Yesterday, the dragon world went to tianfang. The four seventh-grade dragon clans controlled the dragon world. The Dragon Lord met with the other eighth-grade venerable sovereigns. It seems that they are going to join forces to suppress neo martial!""New martial ..."Thunderlord was a little surprised and also a little emotional.He knew about neo martial, but he had never seen its powerhouses. However, he knew how difficult it was to deal with a rank-8 world.If the Thunder World wasn't located in the Thunder region, it would have long been broken through by the Dragon Lord.However, this new martial first fought with Red Moon, then with Chi Yang, and now Yunxiao and Dragon World had joined forces to conquer new martial ...Sometimes, even the Thunder monarch was a little envious.They were both Level Seven Worlds, but they were also surrounded by enemies. However, the Crimson Moon world had been destroyed, and their Thunder World could only struggle on whilst at death's door."Neo martial ... Unfortunately, the humans of the three regions don't understand that the dragon world is a big problem!"The Thunder Emperor sighed. The experts of the three regions didn't understand the Dragon field at all.The Dragon Lord was the real big problem!Now, in order to encircle and suppress new martial, he even joined forces with Dragon World. How stupid was that?It was more like joining forces to deal with the Dragon field!It was a pity that he couldn't go out. Even if he did, he would probably be treated as a joke if he told those eighth level venerable sovereigns. Who would care about the life and death of a rank 7 world?It was a tier 7 world in the dragon world.If you're dead, then you're dead. If you're destroyed, then you're destroyed. Your Thunder World is poor, and your population is extremely small. All these years, you've been sealed by the dragon world, and the venerable sovereigns in the world are all like hungry ghosts ... Who would take the risk to save you when you're so poor?The young venerable sovereign was still overjoyed."Thunder Emperor, now that the Dragon Realm is gone, can we move the world and leave the Dragon Realm?" he asked. After all, the other three regions are dominated by humans. Even if they don't help us, they won't deliberately target us ..."It was too difficult here.The Thunder World had actually wanted to leave many times, but ... How were they supposed to leave?Traveling through the Thunder region was more or less the same. The Thunder Emperor might not have a problem by himself, but if he wanted to bring along a great world and leave, more than half of the tens of billions of humans in the entire realm would die, or even be completely annihilated!If he didn't go through the Thunder region, then he had no other way out.

Chapter 3201 The Big Resentful Seed Is Here (2)
Powerful enemies were everywhere.Not far away was the fire Phoenix realm.If he wanted to leave the Dragon field, he had to cross the Dragon field. Along the way, he would be facing strong enemies. Moreover, it was not easy to teleport worlds. If he really did, he would leave the coverage of the Thunder field and be really courting death.As for moving along the Thunder field, he might be able to teleport out of the Dragon field ... But there were two other major worlds on both sides. If he followed this route, he would definitely encounter them.Thunderlord's thoughts wavered.However, the departure of the dragon world was indeed a rare opportunity.Otherwise ... The Thunder World wouldn't be able to hold on for too long.If the other party didn't leave, the moment there was movement in the Thunder World, an eighth-grade powerhouse could attack at any time."Is the news true?""It's true!""Yes!" The young venerable sovereign said quickly."Our people have gathered information from all sides. It's the same. The Dragon Realm left openly. It's said that once you leave the Dragon field, you'll be received by experts from the three fields ..."Thunderlord fell into deep thought.The Dragon Lord has really left?It was not impossible.After all, there was a huge commotion over at the three regions. To the Dragon Lord, this was an opportunity. As for the Thunder World, it was obviously not as important as the three regions in his eyes.Including the Dragon field chaotic Beast World, there were 11 more. Would they be afraid of him running away?"Is there any movement in the fire Phoenix realm?""Wu! It's still the same. "The lightning Emperor slapped the giant Lightning Dragon in front of him as if it was the Dragon Lord. After a long time, he said,""There's no rush. The dragon world has just left, and it hasn't fallen into war yet. If it returns at any time ... That'll be terrible! Of course, we can make some preparations first and take advantage of the dragon world's departure to gather more great Dao power. Our venerable sovereigns are all weak now. Although they have sufficient lightning power, the chaos lightning tribulation carries a large amount of destructive power. We need a large number of great Dao crystals to neutralize it ..."First, he had to find a way to get some resources back so that all the venerable sovereigns could recover to their peak. This way, it would be good to kill their way out directly or find a way to sneak away. If they encountered trouble, they could fight.After leaving the dragon world, he might be able to relax a little and take advantage of this time to get some great Dao crystals back. Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  "By the way, are those guys from the Outlands ... Willing to trade?"The Thunder monarch asked again. The young venerable sovereign was a little embarrassed, but he still said,""They are willing to ... But our Thunder World ... Has nothing to trade."This was what gave him a headache.If there was a treasure transaction, the Thunder monarch would have arranged for people to find a way to go to the outer area or the fire Phoenix realm."But ... You've used up all your great Dao crystals. A level-seven great Dao universe is actually very powerful at absorbing chaotic power and transforming it into great Dao crystals. However, the surrounding chaotic power has long been sealed. There were no Dao crystals, no small worlds, no mid-tier worlds, no spoils of war, no monarch weapons ...At the level of venerable sovereigns, what could you use to trade with others?The Thunder monarch fell silent. After a long time, he said,""A Dao crystal ...""You can 't!""Thunder monarch, you can't use the Dao accumulation crystal anymore," the young venerable sovereign said hurriedly."It's the comprehension of a level Seven venerable sovereign toward the Dao. If you use it too much and condense it too much, you'll lose your comprehension of the Dao and lose control of the great Dao universe ..."That was a tier 7 exclusive skill!It could be condensed. However, it was equivalent to transferring one's Dao to another person and not teaching them. Teaching wasn't like this, it was directly cutting and transferring. This was probably the only treasure that could be brought out in the Thunder World.The Thunder Emperor could gather the crystals of the Thunder Taoist connotation.A Dao accumulation crystal could be exchanged for hundreds of thousands of great Dao crystals."Let's change first. We'll think of a way to restore everyone's combat strength to its peak!"At this point, the lightning Emperor sighed."The primal Chaos lightning tribulation is actually the best way for us to absorb energy. It contains countless lightning powers. The problem is that it contains destructive power. We can't expel it ... We can only neutralize it! Otherwise, you wouldn't need to beg for help in the lightning territory ..."They were all Thunder-elemental venerable sovereigns and did not need other great Dao crystals. However, the difficulty lay in the fact that the chaos Thunder tribulation was not a pure Thunder-elemental tribulation. If the destructive power was not neutralized, it would definitely explode after a long period of cultivation!Self-destruction!Many people in the Thunder World had self-destructed and died because they did not have a great Dao crystal to neutralize this destructive power."It's a pity ..."The young venerable sovereign sighed. The Thunder region was a good place for peace. It was the best place for experts who cultivated the great Dao of Thunder. It would be perfect if the chaos Thunder tribulation only had pure Thunder elements.If that was the case, perhaps the Thunder World would be able to reach level eight, and not like what it was now. It was clearly sitting on the treasure Mountain, but it was extremely difficult. It was even worse than living in an ordinary small world.Thunderlord didn't say anything more and said,""Pay close attention to the movements of the other major worlds of the chaos alliance! Leaving the Dragon Realm doesn't necessarily mean that you're safe ... Also, you must pay attention in the near future. Only a small portion of those cultivators from the outer domain can enter our Thunder realm, not all of them. Especially after they've reached the intermediate stage, you must be more cautious. The Dragon Lord is more difficult to deal with than others think, so be careful not to let the other party infiltrate our Thunder realm!""Yes, sir!"The young venerable sovereign left quickly.After they left, Thunderlord heaved a sigh of relief. In front of outsiders, he was tough and unyielding. However, he was actually tired after all these years. Sometimes, he really wanted to leave the Thunder World behind and just leave.He could be an itinerant cultivator and be free. So what if he didn't have a great world or a great Dao universe?He could go to the outer area or secretly go to the three major areas alone.

Chapter 3202 The Big Resentful Seed Is Here (3)
However, if he brought along a large world, he would be restricted.Just like red Moon sovereign, because of the existence of the great world, it was difficult for him to leave even if he wanted to. He could only watch as the other rank Sevens were killed. And he was even more difficult than Red Moon master.The Thunder World ... 30 billion humans.This was the first reason. The second reason was that the Thunder World was the last human-ruled macro world in the Dragon field. Once the Thunder World fell ... The human race would no longer have a place in the Dragon field.Is my departure from the dragon world an opportunity or ... A danger? It wasn't that he didn't think that this might be the Dragon Lord's scheme to lure the snake out of its hole.But ... Even if he was, he might have to take the risk.If the seal continued, the Thunder World would not be able to hold on!He had no choice!"Are you waiting for me to go out on my own?"The Thunder monarch muttered. 'Do I still have a choice?He revealed a bitter expression.He had no choice!"If I don't seize this opportunity, there won't be any more. It's too dangerous to travel through the Dragon field. Perhaps ... I should take the macro world and travel through the Thunder field. The premise is that I need countless great Dao crystals to constantly neutralize the destructive power.Countless!The four-sided domain might be taken over by the Dragon Lord sooner or later. I can only take the Thunder World and wander around the Thunder region. Only by walking out and entering the outer region will I have a chance of survival.He then looked outside.All these years, the dragon world must not have given up on infiltrating us. There have been some foreign venerable sovereigns in the Thunder World, but they were all humans ... How many of these people were sent by the dragon world?"I'm still ... Lacking an opportunity!"The Dragon field was not in chaos yet.He could only hope that the demons, the local demons, would make use of this opportunity to stir up some trouble and attract the attention of the chaos Alliance's great world.Only then would he have a chance!……On the other side.In the North of the Dragon field.The five major worlds stood in great numbers like a five-pointed star, covering the entire area. At this moment, in a huge world.A giant beast the size of a Panda revealed its sharp teeth. It was a little fierce, not as cute as Li Hao and the others had imagined. It was only cruel and cold-blooded, its teeth cold."Wait! The chaos alliance would not dare to rashly attack us demons and the five major worlds ... If they wanted to attack, they should first take down the Thunder World! As long as a war breaks out in the Thunder World, the fire Phoenix, the giant elephant, and the mighty tiger families may all be involved. At that time, the dragon world will no longer exist, and we'll have a chance to counterattack with a few less macro worlds!"Below, the venerable sovereigns and even the experts from the other four demon worlds were silent.After a long time, an old bull sighed,""Do we have to counterattack?""Bastard!"As soon as he finished speaking, the Panda was furious."I know that some of you have been bewitched by the dragon world! What demons and chaos beasts were originally one family, bullshit! Chaos beasts are chaos beasts, and demons are demons. Most of the demons were born in the world. In terms of origin, they are more similar to humans. Chaos beasts were born from chaos. The origin of the world and the origin of life are different!"Whether it was the human race or the demon race, they were all born from the same source of the world, while the chaos beasts were truly born from the source of chaos.The two sides were truly different.A portion of the demon race was indeed slowly transformed after chaos beasts entered the world. However, it was only a small portion. Many generations later, they were also born from the origin of the world and not the origin of chaos.The Panda didn't take some of the Dragon Lord's words seriously. Of course, he also knew that there would definitely be people who would take it seriously.The giant panda said angrily,"the Dragon Lord's goal is to be the Overlord of the four regions!" If he really succeeded, other than the chaos race, no one would have a good ending, be it human or demon! I know that some of you have been bewitched, but I'm warning you, even if you want to join the dragon clan, you'd better get out of here quietly. If you dare to attack us during our counterattack, I'll kill you even if you have to destroy your inheritance and your clan! My iron-eating clan has three seventh level venerable sovereigns, and we will fight you to the death!""Cough cough, fellow friend tie, please calm your anger!""Brother bull is just suggesting, not pledging your allegiance to the Dragon race!" Someone from below said. It's just that ... There are many Allied worlds near us. Not only Level Seven, but there are also many middle-and low-level venerable sovereigns. They can also teleport worlds to fight, so they have an advantage over us ... Over the years, they've sealed off our surroundings and extracted the power of Chaos, making it difficult for us to continue. If we really launch a counterattack now ..."Difficult!It was too difficult!When the five great demon worlds joined forces, there were two seventh-rank venerable sovereigns in each of the four great worlds, except for the iron-eater race, which had three seventh-rank venerable sovereigns.There were a total of eight Level Seven venerable sovereigns!Was it a lot?There were many.But ... The Chaos Beast race had even more seventh-rank beasts!Some were newly born in recent years, and some were wandering chaos beings. Even if there were only 12 chaos race great worlds, including the Dragon race, the number of true type 7 realm beings was definitely far more than everyone had expected.Counterattack ... How? Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  If the eight seventh rank venerable sovereigns really retaliated, where would they go after that?"Fellow Daoist iron eater, even if we break through the surrounding defenses ... We have no way out. The three regions are the territory of humans, but there are also some worlds of demons that aren't too strong. With so many experts from our five families, it might be even worse if we go to the three regions!"

Chapter 3203 The Big Resentful Seed Is Here (3)
"As for going to the outer area ... Let's not talk about other things. We can't pass through the lightning territory."Another venerable sovereign sighed."There's still hope for the Thunder World to fight back. We can either go to the three big regions, where we're the human race. Or we can cross the Thunder region and go to the outside world, where the human race is the dominant race ... But what about us?"There was no place to run!The iron eater Thearch wanted to fight back, and everyone wanted to do so as well. However, over the years, some of them had been brainwashed. These words were actually said by the Dragon Lord.Where are you guys going?Where could the demons go?The beasts of primordial chaos were the best. "No matter where you go, you demons will end up like this, or perhaps even worse.Counter what?To whom?The iron eating Emperor's eyes were cold. This was the second clan!Previously, it had been Supreme Emperor bull, but now it was Supreme Emperor Iron Eagle. Both great worlds had the thought of giving up. The demons ... Might really be unable to fight back.The longer the time, the harder it was to counterattack.However, after a moment of silence, he said coldly,""Do you believe that after the Dragon Master takes down all the families, he will make you hand over the great Dao universe immediately? Even if he surrendered, he would still do so! He needed to nurture more rank seven experts of the chaos race. The great Dao universe was the key to their parasitism, or they could integrate into the dragon world and become a rank nine great world! You ... Are you really willing to do this?"At this moment, the monsters were silent.This was also the reason why they were willing to come here to discuss.There was also fear in this aspect.After a long time, the iron eater Thearch said in a deep voice,"no matter what you think, if the Thunder World doesn't make a move, we won't make a move for the time being!" Once a conflict breaks out in the Thunder World ... That will be our chance!""Can the Thunder World move?""The Thunderbolt master also knows the danger ..." A venerable sovereign hesitated."But he knows better that if he doesn't move, he won't have a chance anymore!"The iron eater Thearch sighed as well. 'This is his only chance. Otherwise, if the Dragon Lord gains an advantage in the three regions, or if one or two of the human rank eights die ... He'll have no chance at all! Even if he knows it's a trap, he'll still have to jump in. Now, at least the dragon world isn't here. This is his best chance ... If he doesn't jump in, he'll just wait for death!"If he did, at least he would have a chance.……At another location.Li Hao was also waiting.All three parties were waiting for an opportunity. They hoped that one of them would jump out first and start a fight to create an opportunity for everyone to stir up the quiet Dragon field.As long as someone jumped out first and started a fight, the silence of the Dragon field would be broken, and the opportunity to fish in troubled waters would come.Unfortunately ... They seemed to be waiting for this opportunity. At this moment, Li Hao looked at the worlds outside and sighed. He looked at Kong Ji and said,"there's no movement in the Thunder World, the fire Phoenix World, or the demon race ... It's too difficult to do anything in such a quiet place!"He shook his head.The Dragon Lord is gone, aren't you all going to resist a little?Well, he knew that everyone might be like him. The Thunder World might be waiting for the demon race, and the demon race might be waiting for the thunder World. Of course, no one would wait for him because no one knew that he had come. Even if they knew, they would not take it to heart. He was just a fifth rank venerable sovereign.Not presentable!Kong Ji wasn't in a hurry and was very relaxed. At this moment, he was still in the mood to make tea. The two of them didn't enter the Silver Moon and were just waiting in the level 6 Water World.Kong Ji sipped his tea and laughed,""There's nothing we can do. The chaos race is powerful, and no one wants to be the first. It's too dangerous! Let's wait, they are more anxious than us ...""I can't wait!"Li Hao laughed."We're waiting for the Silvermoon people to arrive. We'll make our move. First, we'll take down the world Lords outside!" After we take them down, I'll have to find a rank 7 world ... And make my move!""What?""You!" Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  Li Hao looked at him."If you want to reach Level Seven, you can't rely on these small and medium-sized worlds. You must have a level Seven world. Only when you reach Level Seven and become a venerable sovereign with six paths and three extremes will we have a chance to conquer the Dragon field if I reach level six!" Otherwise, do you really expect us to conquer the Dragon field with our current strength?""Brother Hao Yue ... Thanks for the trouble!" Kong Ji was very touched.Look, this is a true fellow Daoist.You're only thinking of helping me reach the seventh-rank!"Be quick ...""Any slower, and you'll lose your nest or your neo martial art ..." Li Hao said again."What?"Kong Ji was startled.Li Hao said in a deep voice,"the Dragon Lord is too strong. He should be at the peak of the eighth rank. He's stronger than everyone expected. At this stage, we can either join hands with cloudy sky and red Moon to attack new martial, or ... We can deal with light!" "I think it's more likely to deal with Guangming. Take Guangming down, then go to the chiyang region to encircle and annihilate new martial. This way, we won't have to worry about our rear!"Kong Ji frowned."My father ..."His father was very strong!However, when he thought of the Dragon Master, he frowned again. Moreover, there were two other grade 8 experts. Yunxiao must be eager to fight Guangming first. Yunxiao and Guangming had been fighting for the position of the boss of the tianfang region.If it was red Moon ... She probably wouldn't refuse.Previously, he was still thinking that it had nothing to do with light, but at this moment ... Kong Ji frowned. "It's possible ... But my father isn't stupid. He should be able to sense the danger ... At this time, my father should either stand up and choose the Alliance, or ..."If not, he could only compromise and even sign some great Dao agreements with the three sides in exchange for peace.It was indeed very troublesome!As for whether his father had such a sense of crisis, he should have. Kong Ji believed that his father wasn't that stupid and wouldn't let his guard down.

Chapter 3204 The Big Resentful Seed Is Here (3)
Kong Ji didn't say anything else. There was no point in worrying now.The key was to strengthen himself."Then when are you going to meet the sector Lords outside?""There's no rush. Let the Black Panther pacify them first. Let the Black Panther communicate on its own. We'll wait for the others to arrive first!"The venerable sovereigns of Silvermoon were on their way.It should be soon.As long as he was careful, most of the powerhouses were in their own worlds. There were not many wandering venerable sovereigns in the Dragon field, and most of them were at the venerable sovereign level. Li Hao did not have to worry about them like children.…… It was bustling outside.The Black Panther was a little apprehensive, but Li Hao didn't care. It had to deal with the sector Lords on its own. It hadn't been half a month, but there were already many venerable sovereigns.Almost all of these guys brought their worlds here.This was the good thing about chaos beasts. If they wanted to leave, they could just swallow the world and bring it away, although it would be slower.As for when to devour the world, according to Black Panther, it would have to wait until everyone arrived and share some with them ... Although the sector Lords who had arrived first were not too happy, they could only wait since the rank five venerable sovereign had said so.It was very lively here, but the other places were all quiet, as if a storm was coming.It was extremely quiet!Even in the tianfang region, after the Dragon Master went there, he didn't seem to be in a hurry to go to the chiyang region. Instead, he circled around the tianfang world with the two level eight venerable sovereigns and was not in a hurry to attack new martial.……Time passed day by day as everyone waited.On this day.Li Hao smiled. The silvers had arrived.He instantly disappeared.The first ones were Qian Wuliang and the other powerhouses.They were faster and stronger.They had been looking for a suitable world until Li Hao's notice, and they immediately rushed over. They had been delayed on the way to attract attention, or they would have arrived a long time ago."Lord Marquis!"Seeing Li Hao's sudden appearance, Qian Wuliang was surprised at first, but then he smiled.He looked into the distance and saw countless giant beasts lingering outside the world.He was a little surprised!So many!At a rough glance, there were at least 30 to 40 venerable sovereigns, and they were all huge beasts. Some of them placed the world directly outside. At this moment, there were many experts hovering outside the rank six world.How did he do it?"Did you encounter any trouble on the way?" Li Hao asked with a smile."No, I didn 't,"Qian Wuliang shook his head and said,"but it wasn't so smooth. I only felt it when I got here ... The control of the Dragon field is too strong. There are checkpoints everywhere. We also ran into a team of Dragon Realm patrollers with several venerable sovereigns. Fortunately, we avoided them in advance. Otherwise, we would have been in trouble." There are too many venerable sovereigns in the Dragon field, and they're patrolling everywhere ..."Such a scene had never happened in the other three regions.Patrol?With One World missing, the other party might be able to see everything. It was too dangerous. Li Hao nodded.Now, he was no longer surprised.He said,"wait a moment, the others are about to arrive!" When everyone is here ...""Let's get rid of these guys first!"Li Hao said with a smile.Qian Wuliang was a bit worried."There are a lot of them. There are even some intermediate worlds. Do we have enough people, Lord Marquis?" Once we're discovered ...""The dragon world is gone, don't worry!"At this point, he frowned slightly."I don't know if old Zhao and the others ... Will be able to make it. There was a small problem earlier, causing the river of time to collapse. We've lost contact with everyone."Qian Wuliang felt it, but he didn't know what the problem was.While he was thinking, Li Hao suddenly frowned and looked into the distance.Qian Wuliang also turned around and was stunned.In the distance, there seemed to be a bright moon.Li Hao's expression changed!Qian Wuliang's face also changed color.Who ... Was that?The Queen of the West?'F * ck, there are chaos beasts everywhere. Are you crazy? why are you showing your Silver Moon body here? the moon is so big. Do you think all the experts nearby are blind?'……In the distance.At this moment, director Zhao was sweating and the king of Dali was trembling.艹!Hurry up!They didn't expect that the Queen, who had only been slightly inflated at the beginning, would now swell up madly and rapidly. She couldn't be suppressed anymore and had to return to her Silver Moon state.Even so, the moon was getting bigger and bigger! Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  The light was getting brighter and brighter!If this went on, sooner or later, they would be seen. The key was that the Queen herself could no longer suppress it.He was happy before ... But now, there was only uneasiness, fear, helplessness, and even a little despair.How did this happen?If he didn't solve this problem, he might just explode. The power of faith born in his divine Kingdom wouldn't be enough to offset the rapidly growing chaotic energy.If this continued ... She was really going to explode.Director Zhao's entire body was covered in sweat as he crazily absorbed the energy that she was exuding. He didn't care if it was impure or not. He was a little anxious."Faster ... Faster. This is the territory of the fire Phoenix realm ..."The moon was getting bigger and bigger!If this went on, they would all be finished. Even he wanted to change his route. If this went on, Li Hao would probably be exposed.How could he have known that the Queen would be so arrogant?Now, it was almost the size of a city. Was he really going to transform into a world?Just as he was thinking, a figure suddenly appeared, causing director Zhao to be greatly alarmed. As for the Queen, although she was feeling extremely uncomfortable, she could still sense something and her voice sounded,""I don't think I can control myself ..."

Li Hao took a look and immediately used underhand realm to cover the sky and earth. The Nirvana realm appeared in the blink of an eye and completely covered him. Even the surrounding chaotic force was destroyed.Frowning, Li Hao looked at the Queen. Without saying anything, he reached out and grabbed countless strands of chaotic force!However ... There was still Primal Chaos energy in the surroundings. It seemed to be completely out of control and not suppressed by the power of Nirvana. It surged in directly. Li Hao frowned and said nothing. His eyes flickered as he looked at the moon that the Queen had transformed into!The next moment, he opened his mouth wide!艹!A few days ago, I just told second cat that if there were no venerable sovereigns in the world, they would be fools, idiots, and resentful ... Good Lord, I saw it today.It's still us Silvermoon people!'I ...'He was dumbfounded. After a while, he gritted his teeth and said,""You ... What did you do?""Dao vindication!""You vindicated your Dao ... You ... You fused your Dao with chaos?" Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  "Yeah!"The Queen relaxed a little after he had absorbed a lot of her chaotic force. She said helplessly,"The situation was urgent and the world couldn't be moved, so I fused with the Dao and chaos. This way, I could establish a God Country of faith. With something to rely on, I could infinitely expand the God Country and take everyone away ...""Do you think there's anyone in this world who believes in doctrine?" Li Hao asked after a long while.Of course!Wasn't that nonsense?"Why don't you guess why no one is as smart as you? the Dao melded with chaos and relied on chaos to build the so-called Kingdom of faith ... In fact, it's just opening up a large space or even a world in the Dao of chaos ... How good would that be? I can bring my people everywhere and faith is everywhere. I'm even more powerful than the Beasts of Chaos ..."The Queen was stunned. Yes ... But did anyone else discover this method?Perhaps, I'm the first one to discover it. Isn't that normal?"Li Hao, you were the first to discover time, and I was the first to discover the divine Kingdom of faith. It can be established in the chaos, so why not?"Even though she was thinking about it, she knew that ... There seemed to be ... A problem."Idiot!" Li Hao couldn't help but curse.“……”Director Zhao said hurriedly,"the situation was urgent. We had no other choice. Lord hou, just tell us directly. Are there any disadvantages?"“……”Nonsense!Li Hao rolled his eyes,"she's dead!" It's amazing that the great Dao has merged with the chaos and become one with the chaos. If this continues, all the chaotic force of the chaos will rush into her body. She's a first stage venerable sovereign. Let me think ... She'll probably explode in ten days at most. With a bang, not even her bones will be left. Even the great Dao will explode and become one with the chaos!"“……”Everyone was speechless.At this moment, the Queen's Shadow remained slim and didn't expand as much as the moon. Frowning, she looked at Li Hao."Dao melding with chaos allows me to absorb the power of Chaos. I can open up a pseudo-world in chaos, which is my God Country. I can break away from the restrictions of a world ... There are many benefits ..."Li Hao nodded."That's right. That's why ... You're going to explode!" "Don't I have you?"“……”Li Hao rolled his eyes. You trust me so much?What's the use of me being here?I'm here. Can I suppress it just because I'm here?I can turn back time!"Go back to when you vindicated Dao, but once it really comes to that time ... It's too easy for big problems to arise. For example ... Time reversal, directly going back to the time when the Dragon Lord arrived. Are you afraid?"Did the Dragon Lord go there directly before?""Yes,"Director Zhao quickly replied, but he still explained,""Lingyue was also trying to save someone. At that time, there was no other way. If the Marquis had a way, he would still have to save someone ..."If the Queen wanted to vindicate her Dao, then director Zhao wouldn't care.But ... It was also to save people back then. Saving the human race was also to save them.He had to make this clear to Li Hao."I know."Li Hao nodded, frowning. He looked at the Queen and sensed the omnipresent chaotic force surging toward him. Even the power of Nirvana couldn't suppress it. It seemed that the chaotic force could directly cross the Nirvana realm.,m With this, even if someone were to hide in a place without chaotic force, perhaps ... They would explode from the chaotic force!This was because all worlds were in chaos.This was big trouble!Now, how could he control it?Unless ... He broke his Dao!However, her great Dao was completely integrated into it. Li Hao thought for a moment and said,""Cut off all the great DAOs and only keep the Dao meridians. The Dao meridians and stars are still in the Silver Moon great Dao. Find a way to walk the Silver Moon great Dao. You can't cultivate this Dao anymore!"The Queen was stunned. She glanced at Li Hao. "That's the only way?""Right!""I thought ... To you, all the problems are not problems."Li Hao frowned."I'm not invincible. I'm only at the fifth rank. I just discussed your problem with senior second cat a few days ago. This situation ... Shouldn't have happened. Of course, it was an emergency ... How about this? I'll do my best to help you become a venerable sovereign and give up on this Dao ..."This was also the safest way.At this moment, his life was his top priority.Although the Queen was a jinx, Li Hao had never thought of killing her. They had worked together several times, and Li Hao had never suffered a loss. This time, he was trying to save someone, so he wanted to Save the Queen's life first.This was the safest way.It's just that her strength has been damaged and she has fallen below the Emperor rank. This is nothing. I'll just help her prove her Dao of Silver Moon in the future.

Chapter 3206 The Big Resentful Seed Is Here (3)
The Queen was silent.After struggling so hard, in the end, it was all for nothing. She gave up the path of faith and everything to walk the path of the Silver Moon. Then, she became a venerable sovereign. In the Silver Moon great Dao universe, only her physical body and stars were not weak.Then ... He would become a weak cultivator. The next time Silver Moon reached rank six, he would find a way to become a rank one venerable sovereign, and a rank one venerable sovereign under Silver moon's control.Qian Wuliang, Hong Yitang, and the others could kill him if they wanted.'Is this ... The result I want?'At this moment, the Queen was silent.In Silver Moon, it was one thing to be suppressed by Li Hao, but if she had made such a choice, then Qian Wuliang, Hong Yitang, Black Panther, Heaven's Fate, King Huai, Lin Hongyu ... All of them would have been able to suppress her.From now on ... He would be chained up?"No!""I can do it!" The Queen suddenly said.She looked at Li Hao and said in a cold voice, I have an idea! As long as there are enough people who believe in me, I can use faith to balance and suppress the power of Chaos, and I can quickly strengthen myself. As long as I'm strong enough, I can absorb a large amount of power of chaos and directly fuse with it, even becoming the will of the chaos!""You're crazy!""I'm not crazy!"The Queen shook her head."You can cultivate time. Why can't I cultivate chaos?""You ..."F * ck!Li Hao wanted to curse!This woman was out of her mind."Absorbing faith is only a temporary solution. The stronger you are, the faster you can absorb Primal Chaos energy, do you know that?The more miserable your death is!"At that time, when you reach the second rank, the chaotic force will enter even faster. Unless you quickly reach the third rank, and then even faster, you'll have to quickly reach the fourth rank ...In other words, it didn't mean that you could suppress it just because you were strong.Wrong!"The stronger you are, the faster and crazier you'll be in absorbing the chaotic force. This will require you to continuously advance at a crazy rate until the day you can completely maintain the balance between entering and exiting. That way, you won't explode.  Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  But what kind of strength did that require?Seventh-rank?Level eight?It was still tier 9!This idiot, did he not understand this logic?He was about to continue when the Queen said,""I understand, but I also believe that every great Dao has its own value and meaning! Dao doesn't distinguish between noble or lowly, high or low. Since it can be proven, then it can be achieved!"Li Hao was stunned. After a while, he said in a low voice,""You must court death!"The Queen regained her calm."You said that faith belongs to me. Even if I die, I will absorb faith first!" Isn't this just what you want?" Li Hao stopped talking.He just kept silent.He forcefully suppressed the chaotic force in the surroundings, but the Queen was still madly pouring out chaotic force. He frowned and said nothing more. With a wave of his hand, he enveloped the world and trapped the Queen. He said with a deep voice, "Let's go back first. It's too conspicuous here! Also ... There are still dozens of worlds outside. We'll take them down first. If the hundreds of billions of humans believe in you ... It might be able to last for a while. Don't rush to level up ... Suppress the power of Chaos first!"Damn it, this is so troublesome!He had a headache.Wasn't it good to follow the steps?As for establishing a country of faith ... It was good, but ... It still gave him a splitting headache!None of Silver moon's men were easy to deal with.The teacher too!At this moment, he thought of his teacher again, and Li Hao cursed even more in his heart. He had a sudden idea all day long. He wanted to create a Dao domain first and then vindicate his Dao. What the hell? they were already so old, but they still didn't make him worry less!And this Queen, do you really think you can suppress the chaotic force?If it was that simple, someone else would've done it long ago.And then there was Kong Ji, who insisted on walking the so-called six paths and three extremes. And there was himself, who insisted on drawing the outline of ten thousand paths of time ...If he had known earlier, he might as well have taken a path and headed straight for tier 7!Countless thoughts suddenly rose in Li Hao's mind. He scolded them one by one, and then scolded himself after scolding them. It really made him worry!

Chapter 3207 A Perpetual Motion Machine
Back in the world.Looking at the Queen's increasingly smug face ... Li Hao was helpless.At this moment, second cat had come out to watch the show. After a glance, it suddenly looked at Li Hao ... A big resentful seed!We've just chatted, and now we're seeing the real-life version.He was so lucky!At this moment, the others had also arrived one after another. All of them looked at The Big Moon with curiosity. Now that it had become a fat moon, if one did not look carefully, it did not look like a moon at all. Instead, it looked more like a bloated pancake.After a while, second cat suddenly said,"She seems to have built a divine Kingdom made of faith, directly attached to chaos ..."Li Hao knew what second cat meant.Previously, he was still having a headache over the matter of his territory. Now, wasn't it delivered to his door?But ... To take in countless humans, how big of a territory would they have to build?Such a large territory ... The Queen had to be at least at the fourth rank or above. If she really reached the fourth rank or above ... Good Lord, with the speed at which she absorbed the power of Chaos, she might explode in three to five days!Of course, this method was useful, but the prerequisite for it was that you had to survive.Li Hao fell into deep thought. He glanced at the crowd, thought for a while, and said,""Wait for the others to arrive first. We'll talk when they're all here. Also ... Brother emptiness, help suppress it for the next few days. Senior second cat, help me absorb the chaotic force ..."Second cat wagged its tail and didn't refuse.Li Hao, on the other hand, disappeared into thin air.……In the long river of the great path.Li Hao sat cross-legged in front of the time star. Before this, he had not thought about merging with chaos. He had only told second cat about it casually. He had never thought about it. But now ... Someone had really done it.And it was a Silver Moon person!Since the Queen wasn't willing to give up, he had to solve it. Besides, it would be a good idea if the divine Kingdom of faith she had built could really be completed. It would save him a lot of trouble.The God Country of faith had the meaning of an inner space. It was constructed from faith and directly attached to chaos, not to a world.Only those with faith could enter.There were advantages and disadvantages to this."The problem now is that the power of Chaos is constantly pouring in. The Queen can't handle it at all. There's too much ... As for the others helping to absorb it ... The amount absorbed will be provided by chaos. The energy of chaos is infinite ..."Even if others were to help him absorb the energy, they would only be able to slow it down. It didn't mean that with an expert around, the other party would be fine.He could only control it himself!Suppression, resistance, and even rapid consumption.Endless Primal Chaos energy ...Eh? Li Hao was stunned. He looked at the small realms in the river and suddenly saw some changes."I have many realms. In fact, I also need a lot of chaotic energy, although it's not very pure."However ... When there was a lot of chaotic force, it would be pure power of a great Dao.It's a pity that I'm not the Queen. If I were, I don't know how much chaotic energy I can absorb from my thousands of worlds. The Queen's amount is not enough for me."Yeah!"At this moment, Li Hao's mind wavered. Of course, he was not going to merge with the chaos. If he did, he would be in big trouble once his little realm was filled. This was the way to die.I can think of a way for the Queen to transfer the chaotic force into my little realm. That way, not only will the Queen be able to withstand it, but I'll also be able to absorb some chaotic force.But ... That power had emerged directly through the great Dao in the Queen's body. Even if she were to output it directly, it would not be in time.Many thoughts appeared in his mind."A Dao Meridian!"The next moment, Li Hao seemed to have thought of something. Although the Queen cultivated the Dao of chaos ... She was a Silvermoon person, and her Dao Meridian was still there. Her Dao Meridian was still in the Silvermoon great Dao universe.The Dao Meridian was also her Dao.A natural Dao!The Silvermoon people were born with a Daoist body."If I strengthen her Dao Meridian Star and then transplant the Dao Meridian into my River ... I'll let the Queen convert it herself and transfer the power of the chaos great Dao into the Dao Meridian.p In that case, I can use my little realm to extract the energy from the Dao Meridian Star.But ...Li Hao frowned slightly. But in this way ... The Queen's star of the great path would enter his River of the great path. Now, his River of the great path was temporarily in his River of the great path, which was Lin Hongyu's life and death Star and Zhang an's book of Dao.Of course, if the situation called for it, it was nothing much.But ... What would the Queen think? Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  Also, would faith interfere with the strengthening of the other party's Dao meridian stars?Many thoughts appeared in his mind.In addition, a large amount of chaotic energy had poured in, but it was not pure chaotic energy. To him, it was somewhat mixed. To the little realm, it hoped to absorb some less mixed chaotic energy.How to purify?The speed had to be fast. Otherwise, it would be very difficult to completely digest."The last thing is that the Queen is only at the first rank. That's still fine. If she reaches the fourth rank, the fifth rank ... Or even the seventh rank, my little realm currently only has a thousand. It will be filled one day.When that time came ... What would they do?Many thoughts appeared in his mind. Of course, he could still bear with it for now.Even if he couldn't do it ... He still had the Silver Moon dual Dao universe and more than one Dao Meridian Star. If he really couldn't do it, he could ask the Queen to leave some Dao meridian stars in the Silver Moon dual Dao universe. A fifth-tier universe would also be able to convert a part of it.

Chapter 3208 A Perpetual Motion Machine
This way, he would use two great Dao universes and his thousands of small realms to help the Queen bear the burden.If all parties joined forces, they should be able to suppress it."However ... I still need a mechanism to prevent her Dao meridian stars from exploding. Should I use faith to solidify the stars?"Li Hao kept thinking.Now that he had encountered a problem, he had to find a way to solve it. For now, the Queen's Kingdom of faith might be of great use and could solve many of his worries.Since that was the case ... He didn't have to force the other party to give up on the chaos great Dao.As for what to do in the future ... We'll talk about it in the future.If he were to give birth to more little worlds, or even more worlds!Did he really have to devour the infinite worlds?Perhaps ... The Queen's path could complement his.Li Hao's heart moved!That's right!"In truth, Primal Chaos energy is everywhere in the chaosverse. It's not impossible for you to absorb it. You can absorb it yourself. It's very slow, very messy, and very noisy. Look at the Queen. She doesn't even need to absorb it, but it's coming right to you.This ... Might not be a bad thing.In that case, it would depend on whether he was depleting faster or the Queen was getting stronger and improving faster. If he was strong enough to instantly condense the infinite worlds, no matter how much the Queen absorbed, she would not be depleting as fast as he was, right?This ... Wouldn't that perfect his own illusory myriad worlds?Thinking of this, Li Hao was a little excited.It seemed to be so!"This way, the Queen won't die from overeating ... However, the power of Chaos is still very messy. I have to find a way to quickly purify it and fuse it into the myriad worlds. Otherwise, I'll be the one to explode from overeating the power of Chaos!"He suddenly thought of something. In an instant, a little realm appeared. This little realm was completely transparent.This was the path to heaven!Of course, this was also a farting Dao in everyone's mouth. This great Dao had a purifying effect, an extremely powerful purifying ability. What if the chaotic force was introduced into this world, purified, and then dispersed?However, this little realm might not be able to withstand it."I need to perfect the path of purification ..."As he thought of this, he suddenly looked at the time star and thought,""Time and Stars, the convergence of thousands of DAOs, fluctuate once every 360 seconds. By changing a great Dao as the main Dao, absorbing the power of Chaos and using the Time and Stars as a relay processor, not only can one extract the power of a Dao from the power of Chaos, but ... One can also record the order of the Time and Stars 'fluctuations!"Right!At this moment, Li Hao thought of something and was a little excited. The stars in time were ever-changing.However, he didn't have the time or the mind to record these changes. He could use the chaotic force as a cleansing force. If a time star appeared, it would cause a force to be extracted from the chaotic force. This way, not only could he split the chaotic force, but he could also record the changes of Time and Stars every 360 seconds. "This ... Looks pretty good!""It's ... It's best to place the Dao Meridian Star inside the time star. This way, the chaos energy that seeps into the time star will enter the interior of the time star directly. The time star will be like a huge net. The energy will only seep out from the ripples of the great Dao. This ... Is a natural purification machine!"Li Hao seemed to have realized this for the first time. He suddenly became very excited.He didn't think much about it before.Now that he thought about it carefully, if the Queen's Dao Meridian Star was placed inside, and her Dao Meridian Star was actually a perpetual motion machine that would never tire and provide chaotic power, not only could it provide him with a large amount of great Dao power, but it could also help the time star system and the myriad world to grow stronger ...Thinking of this, Li Hao became excited.As expected, people were forced to come out.He hadn't thought about this before, but now that the Queen had really taken this path, he focused on thinking about it. Thinking about this ... Li Hao was extremely excited. Perhaps I've found a shortcut to rapidly improve.Otherwise, with my speed, I might not be able to reach the seventh rank even if I devour the entire Dragon field!……In an instant.Li Hao walked out of the river.Although they did not think for long, in fact, more than half a day had passed. At this moment, a group of people surrounded the Queen, as if they were watching a show.Everyone was not too nervous.At most, he would shatter his Dao to survive!It's not like there's no other way?It was just that the Queen herself was not willing to accept it. Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  Since they couldn't die, everyone was naturally very curious. At this moment, even the celestial pole members had returned. These few people also had curious looks on their faces, as if they had seen some rare species.A cultivator who constantly produced Primal Chaos energy ... The speed at which he was born was extremely fast, the kind that could stuff himself to death. It was truly a rare sight!The Queen ignored the others and shut herself in.At this moment, it maintained its moon form and did not return to its human form. It just shut itself off and allowed these bastards to observe it.He was so angry that his lungs were about to explode!"Lord Marquis!"It wasn't until Qian Wuliang saw Li Hao and shouted that the others dispersed.As for the Queen ... After a moment of hesitation, she also created a shadow and looked at Li Hao expectantly. Is there a way?If that didn't work, then hurry up and get to work!The stronger the faith, the longer she felt she could hold on. Perhaps ... She could hold on until the end?"I'll give you two choices," Li Hao said directly."First, cut off this path!"

Chapter 3209 A Perpetual Motion Machine
"No!"The Queen refused.Li Hao frowned."Second, you can continue to practice this technique. However, you must listen to me. Do whatever I tell you to do!" Don't ask why, don't question anything! If you can do it, I'll help you think of a way. If you can't ... Cut off the path immediately. Otherwise, you'll have to think of a way yourself!" “……”"I'll do whatever you ask me to do. If you ..."The Queen frowned."If what?" Li Hao said with a cold face.“……”"I'm a woman after all ..."The Queen was speechless."You are the moon!"Li Hao snorted coldly,'you're neither a human nor a ghost, and you call yourself a woman? You don't even know what you are now, and you're still a woman ... You've always turned into the moon, and you're either a God or some random thing. It's hard to say if you're still human!"“……”The Queen was speechless from his scolding. She was a little aggrieved and helpless.I'm not human?You're not human!He gritted his teeth and thought for a while before nodding.""Good! I agree ... But you have to help me solve this problem ..."She didn't trust anyone else, but since Li Hao had said so, he might really have a way.She really couldn't bear to give up her current Dao!Because ... She was really getting stronger every second. To be honest, she couldn't give up on this feeling. Perhaps, this was desire.Li Hao didn't say anything. He looked at Qian Wuliang and Hong Yitang and said quickly,"Now, strengthen all the Dao meridians in the Queen's body. Observe the great Dao universe and locate all the Queen's great Dao stars!""Teacher!"Yuan Shuo, who was watching from the side, felt a little guilty when he heard his disciple call him. Why did he call him?"Teacher, I'll have to trouble you to make a trip here later!""Where to?""Where do you think I'll let you go if you're not a venerable sovereign?"艹!Are you mocking me?Yuan Shuo was speechless!After a while, he seemed to have realized something and frowned slightly."You still want to go in?"Enter the time star!I was almost killed the last time, and now you want me to go in?"Yes, teacher, get ready. Also ... This time, the task will be heavy!"Alright!Yuan Shuo pondered for a moment and looked at the Queen. Could it be that ... Li Hao was going to move the star of the great path into the Star of time?"Everyone else, get ready ... We all have things to do later. Black Panther, continue to interact with the sector Lords outside. Also ... When most people are here, we can refine the rank six world. We can't keep making everyone wait. If we wait any longer, we'll get impatient!"After making some arrangements, Li Hao looked at the Queen.""From now on, you have to guide a part of the chaotic power into the Dao Meridian Star and solidify it with the power of faith to prevent your Dao star from exploding!" "Dao meridian stars ..."The Queen was a little hesitant. Before she could speak, Li Hao shouted,""You can only listen. If you don't want to do it, you have to find a way!"Alright!The Queen was speechless. 'You're so awesome. I can't afford to offend you.'Speaking of which, having so many venerable sovereigns working for him ... It felt pretty good. It felt like he had returned to the time when he was still the Queen of the West in Silver Moon, and he had a large number of strong men working for him.Unfortunately, things had changed with the passage of time!Ever since he was defeated by Li Hao, he hadn't had such fun.At this moment, the Queen's mood was much better.At this time, the Dali King suddenly felt conflicted.""This ... Lingyue absorbed all the power of faith, so ... What do I do?"“……”The surrounding crowd looked at him, somewhat stupefied.Yes, what should I do?Cold mix!"Who asked you to run away before? now the Queen seems to need a lot of power of faith to consolidate her divine Kingdom and herself. Next, she will definitely be the priority. You ... Do as you see fit!Heaven's Fate coughed."There's no use in becoming stronger. Beiwu, I've been lacking someone to do odd jobs. Come and help me with them ..."The Dali King was speechless.If you weren't so strong, if you weren't The Guardian of my Li Dynasty, I would have killed you with one punch!Who's doing odd jobs for you?They only dared to think about it. The current celestial pole was a fourth level venerable sovereign, and they couldn't afford to offend him!"You want to become a God through faith too?" Li Hao laughed."This ... Not really. I just want to borrow the will of the people and become a true king for once!"His goal was different from the other party 's.One was faith, the other was the People's heart.In fact, there was no delay, but now that he had been taken to his God nation, how could he be in power in his God nation?This was the key!Li Hao thought for a while and said,"the divine Kingdom is just an illusory world. It's not a real world ... Of course, believers can enter ... Now, they've all entered the Queen's divine Kingdom ... But there will always be people who don't believe in the Queen. If you're not tired, you can use a world to take away those who can't enter the divine Kingdom. This is an extremely difficult path. You have to integrate the humans who don't believe in gods and lead them to rise so that they can live and work in peace ..."There would always be people who did not believe in gods! Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  It was impossible to believe in all of them. As for the world of rats, there were some, but the situation was urgent, and those people ... Were abandoned.Li Hao didn't ask, but he knew that someone must have been abandoned.However, he didn't say or mention it.How can billions of humans in a world trust you?It won 't!Even if 90% believed it, 10% didn 't. If they didn't believe it, they couldn't enter the divine Kingdom. Then, would these people kill them all just because they didn't believe in the gods?
