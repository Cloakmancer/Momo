,m Zhang an was silent for a moment and did not say anything more.Southern Fist.It wasn't just the southern Fist. Some people had also died.Back then, Li Hao, hou Xiaochen, Tian Jian, Hong Yitang, hei Bao, and the Imperial Guards were the first to enter Yuanping martial Sciences University. But now, they could not see hou Xiaochen.He poured a glass of wine for Li Hao, and he also poured a glass for himself.He raised his glass and drank it without toasting. Then, he looked at Li Hao and said,""You still hold a grudge against me during the battle of boundless city, right?""It's unlikely. "Li Hao shook his head."That's my choice. Why should I blame the chief?" If I have to blame someone, I should blame myself! I blame myself for being too weak, I blame myself for being powerless! Besides, I don't blame anyone, and I don't blame myself ... After this battle, I'll go from passive defense to active attack! After this battle, I, the Silver Moon Martial Master, have awakened! Use the blood of my master and the others to awaken us!"Even now, he did not regret it.Li Hao changed the topic."In the Silver Moon world, there's the red moon Emperor, the God of beginner martial, Zheng Yu, li daoheng, Ying Hongyue, and the Queen of the West. If they're enemies on six sides, I still can't eliminate any of them!""Either I can't kill him, or I don't need to kill him, or I can't kill him ..."Li Hao sighed with emotion, I'm really helpless! For example, Ying Hongyue. If it wasn't for the seal, I would have killed him long ago! I said I wanted him to experience pain, but I'm not willing to let the murderer who killed my family get away with it! The so-called letting him go and suffering the pain ... Is just an excuse for myself. In fact, it's because I'm powerless. I can't kill him. I can't kill him!"Zhang an nodded slightly.Ying Hongyue ...This person had killed Li Hao's parents and his brother. If Li Hao didn't kill Ying Hongyue, it would indeed be difficult to calm down.Li Hao was already very open-minded to be able to calmly talk about Ying Hongyue.He then thought of the human King. If it was the human King ... What big picture? what about the venerable sovereign breaking the seal ... Perhaps he would have killed Ying Hongyue long ago and wouldn't be so patient!Li Hao, on the other hand, was a cruel person with a lot of tolerance."It's almost winter," Li Hao continued."It's also the fourth anniversary of my parents 'death. Four years ago, they had an accident in winter. The car was destroyed and the people died ...""I really want to kill Ying Hongyue on that day and pay my respects to my parents!" Li Hao said calmly."Do you need my help?" Zhang an raised his eyebrows slightly."That's right. Division Chief, you just need to lend me the star River City for a few days. "‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùZhang an knew the purpose of his visit."If I lend it to you, will you be able to keep the seal from breaking?""There's hope! With the eight cities as eight divine weapons, they can control the blood saber and suppress the center. They can kill Ying Hongyue and seize the bloodline of the eight great families. Then, with my Dao, they can suppress the seal and maintain it for a while!""Eight divine weapons?" Zhang an raised his eyebrows."The division Chief doesn't know?""I don't know," "Alright, let's just pretend that the division Chief doesn't know."Li Hao smiled and said,"I'm going to turn the eight cities into eight divine weapons and the foundation of the formation ... I'll strip Ying Hongyue away and completely eliminate her!" "This person is a chess piece for many people. Killing him can change a lot of things, and it can also let me vent the hatred in my heart! "In addition, there are many benefits to killing him. It will completely destroy some people's plans. Everyone thinks that I won't and won't dare to kill him with his existence!""Everyone thinks that I won't kill Ying Hongyue as long as I'm not completely crazy, including Ying Hongyue herself. In fact, she's not afraid that I'll kill her. No matter how hard I shout or how hard Hongyu acts ... Everyone knows that I won't kill him!"Li Hao laughed."As for me, I'm going to do something that ordinary people can't do. If everyone thinks I can't do it, I'll definitely do it!"Zhang an glanced at him. At this moment, a myriad of thoughts were running through his mind.Yes, just like thunder City.Everyone thought that Li Hao wouldn't and couldn't do it, but he did.Just like when he was in the seal, when everyone thought that Li Hao would not deal with venerable sovereigns, he did.The more people did not believe him, the more he would do it.Everyone felt that ... Li Hao now had the capital and wouldn't be so crazy anymore. Did he really have to release the venerable sovereign after killing Ying Hongyue?But what if ... He really killed them?At that time, everything that everyone had invested in Ying Hongyue would completely disappear.It broke everyone's imagination!He had to borrow the star River City!If he didn't lend it, Li Hao would definitely fall out with him.  Best novel online free at ùöó0ùöüùöéùöïùöãùöíùöó  Zhang an was very clear about this, so he didn't say anything. He only said,""How are you going to take down Hurricane city?"Star River City was easy to deal with, but what about Hurricane city?It's easy to deal with the Heavenly King, but how are you going to chase Zheng Yu away?Besides ... A pseudo-Emperor can't walk out so easily. If Zheng Yu really comes out, he'll kill you at the first moment!"Think of a way!"Li Hao said softly, the Queen has taken half of the Silver Moon, this is our chance! The Silver Moon is the core of the Silver Moon world and has a stronger shielding power than the ancient city. If he enters the Silver Moon, he'll be like li daoheng. Even if he's a half-step sovereign, he won't be targeted by the heaven and earth ...""Why did he enter the Silver Moon? Why would the Queen of the West agree to this?"Zhang an still felt that Li Hao was being too idealistic.If the eight major cities combined and could really draw out the blood saber of the blood Emperor, they might be able to suppress the venerable sovereign again. However, Hurricane city was enough to make everyone give up on this idea.It was too difficult!Or rather, this was the only way.He let Zheng Yu enter the Queen's Silver Moon.

Chapter 2361 The Bright Li Hao (3)
Li Hao smiled."It's difficult ... But we can try. If it really doesn't work, there are other ways. For example, we can suppress Zheng Yu into the world barrier. That's one! Second, pull Zheng Yu into my Dao universe ... Of course, this is too dangerous and a little scary! Third, li daoheng's void Dao universe has appeared, and for Zheng Yu to charge in ... There is actually more than one path. "Li Hao smiled faintly."If it doesn't work, I'll pull him into my Dao universe. Zheng Yu will probably be very happy to have such a good opportunity!""Don't mess around!"Zhang an had a headache!This lunatic might really do it.In that case ... There would be a show to watch. A half-Emperor had entered the Dao universe. Wouldn't li Hao be finished?Li Hao's eyes flickered and he laughed.Actually, this method was much simpler.He dared to keep the Dao universe open, and Zheng Yu could still enter ... Do you think Zheng Yu can enter?He would definitely enter!As for the traps and sieges that Li Hao had set up ... Zheng Yu would never consider that. If you could kill him with the help of the Dao universe, you might as well go in directly!If a half-step Emperor didn't even have this much confidence, then he shouldn't even cultivate.Therefore, it would be easy to take over Hurricane city.Li Hao had gone to Hurricane city, opened the great Dao universe passage, and then accidentally let Hurricane city come into contact with the passage ... Even if it was only for a moment, Zheng Yu had to seize the opportunity!At this moment, Li Hao touched his chin.Zhang an, on the other hand, was having a headache. He knew that Li Hao was considering this.He had no choice but to say,"half-step sovereigns are very strong!" There are many saints on both sides, but even if all of them are added together, including you and me ... They can't kill a half-step sovereign. On the other hand, a half-step sovereign is enough to kill all of us!"He sighed,'this is still the half-step sovereign ... The era without origin source! "In the era of origins, a group of Heavenly Kings besieged a venerable sovereign. Even if all of them died, they could not hurt a venerable sovereign at all. Once, in the early stage of the neo martial realm, we tried. Countless experts besieged an Emperor, which was a venerable sovereign, but in the end ... Not even a single hair was cut off!"To Zhang an, this was considered rude, but it was the truth.Li Hao nodded slightly.He touched his chin again.Perhaps ... There was another way!Once again, he drew out that star and turned the back of the star, the illusory side, to his passageway. It would be best if Zheng Yu could Enter the Void Dao universe!Of course, there was another way ... The world of spirit sea!This world was actually attached to the boundary barrier of the void Dao universe. If Zheng Yu thought that this was the truth Dao universe, he could forcefully attack and break the barrier to Enter the Void Dao universe. In short, Li Hao actually had a way.Of course, they were all very risky.The safest way was actually for the Queen to be a good person and take in Zheng Yu. It would be safe and peaceful.He did not reveal these methods to Zhang an.He still had to leave a card up his sleeve.Zhang an would not tell her everything. Li Hao thought for a while and said,"I'll think of a way. I'll take Hurricane city!" Director Zhang, aside from Star River City, there's one more thing that I need your help with. ""Go ahead,""God of beginner martial!"Li Hao said,"they are most likely here for the blood Emperor's blade and the cat that is about to be resurrected. Perhaps they are here to protect it. Perhaps they are here to kill it. I don't care about that!" "Once I take over the eight main cities, the other party might be worried that I'll ruin his plan and target me ... That will be very troublesome for me. Director Zhang is the grandson of the Supreme Lord ... Can I trouble you to be my emissary for once? At the most crucial moment, I'll go to the Li Dynasty to meet him ... I didn't mean to ruin the blood Emperor's plan, so I hope he won't worry about me ruining it, so as to avoid any misunderstandings and conflicts. ""A cat?"Zhang an asked. Read m0re at nOŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  Li Hao nodded."There's a cat sleeping in the knife. The eight main cities, including the array, exist to resurrect this cat!"Zhang an was silent for a while.He didn't know about this before.At this moment, he thought about it for a long time before nodding.""I know.""The chief also knows about this?"Zhang an hesitated for a moment before nodding.""I know! Of course, he didn't know before, but he knew that this cat ... Was not a living thing, nor was it a living creature, but ... It could be! In short, it was quite complicated! The blood Emperor wanted to resurrect the cat, probably because he felt that he owed it. This cat is the projection of the Cang Emperor. He once lived with the blood Emperor's previous incarnation, the projection of Zhan Tiandi, for countless years ... He was a very simple cat. In the end, Zhan Tiandi shot at the heavenly Emperor with his bow and died in battle with this cat ... They died in battle!"He sighed."I didn't expect ... That the blood Emperor would still be busy with this matter. Even the human Kings couldn't resurrect this cat because ... It's not a living being and doesn't have an origin mark. Otherwise, it wouldn't have to go through so much trouble!""A projection?" Li Hao was stunned.Not a living being?Zhang an nodded and said,"yes, it's a projection!" An illusionary realm, an extremely powerful illusionary realm, enveloped the projections of countless experts. It was like a real world that had existed for countless years. They had memories, intelligence, and wisdom ... But it was also like a dream world, in fact ... It didn't exist in the real world! You said there was a cat, and I understood!""Projection ..." Li Hao mumbled,"parallel world ... Spectral world ..."

Chapter 2362 The Bright Li Hao (3 In 1)
Zhang an nodded again.Li Hao, on the other hand, was still mumbling."Even a projection can turn into a living being ... From what you've said, a projection can even shoot a heavenly Emperor with a bow. This means that a projection also has infinite power ... How is that possible?""Why not?" Zhang an asked. As long as you were strong enough, so what if you were a projection? It could also turn illusory into reality! It's just that I didn't manage to do it back then. "Turning illusions into reality?As Li Hao thought this, his expression changed."A projection ... Existing in another space ... Past ... Future ... Time ..."Zhang an frowned. What are you thinking about?Li Hao, on the other hand, was thinking that a projection could be so powerful that it could even turn illusions into reality."If my next self is incomparably powerful ... Can I retrieve a projection of my next self from time and fuse it into my body to strengthen myself?But ... Where did the power come from?Who would provide energy support for this power in the future?The law of energy conservation was true!I won't let you become stronger for no reason!The past, the future ...For a moment, the resurrection of the projection caused countless ripples in his heart.If my projection can come to life, isn't it normal for me to borrow the power of the past and the future?With thousands of thoughts in mind, Li Hao suddenly said,""Chief, according to what you said, Zhan Tiandi has reincarnated as the blood Emperor. How can he still have such great power to shoot the heavenly Emperor with a bow? The celestial Emperor is the strongest opponent in the new martial era. Does that mean that this projection is extremely powerful?""This ... I can't say."Zhang an shook his head,"it's too high of a level. I don't understand it either!" "But my grandfather mentioned it a few times. It should be the power of will. Although Zhan Tiandi has died and reincarnated, he was too strong when he was alive. The power of will still remains! Using the power of will to summon the power of life was actually a kind of overdraft, so he would definitely dissipate completely on that day! Whether or not this arrow was shot, he would have dissipated ..."The power of will! Read m0re at nOŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  Li Hao's heart moved. At this moment, he once again fell into deep thought.As for Zhang an, he didn't understand what Li Hao was thinking. He was just a little strange. I was just saying ... Kid, what are you thinking about?At this moment, Li Hao was thinking about many things. Of course, he had covered it up.After a long while, Li Hao said,"then I won't bother about this. According to what everyone is saying, the blood Emperor is not the kind of person who would secretly steal. He probably only wanted to resurrect that cat. In the end ... Before he could resurrect it, the red moon incident happened, and he had no choice but to leave Silver Moon ... Division Chief, you also think that the blood Emperor would not deliberately stay in Silver Moon, right?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùZhang an was speechless and even wanted to roll his eyes. After a long time, he said,""You're thinking too much. Don't always think of everyone as evil! The blood Emperor's strength was unparalleled. Red Moon Emperor would definitely die in three minutes under his hands! As for Silvermoon's world, if he really wants it, even the venerable sword would not care ... Do you think it's necessary for him to hide here?"What are you thinking in your head?Simply put, these people's levels were too high. If it wasn't for the sake of resurrecting the cat, he wouldn't even bother to set up these arrays.In the end, it was a coincidence that a venerable sovereign was sealed. Otherwise, without this formation and the eight major cities, it would not be easy to seal a venerable sovereign.Li Hao thought for a moment."Do you know who the God of beginner martial is, chief?""It's hard to say,"Zhang an thought for a moment and said,"if someone stayed here for 100000 years to resurrect the cat ... There are three people who are more likely to be here, but ... It's hard to be sure!"He frowned slightly."And among the three of them, the weakest one is infinitely close to the power of a venerable sovereign. The strongest one has long been a venerable sovereign!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao opened his mouth and said,"you ... You mean, this ...""I'm just guessing," Zhang an said, frowning."The most likely possibility is that it's one of the venerable sovereigns who lived with him in that illusionary realm ... He's also Zhan Tiandi's page boy. Of course, that powerful and unparalleled person has already entered the venerable sovereign level before the final battle! Moreover, if he ... Had such power, he would have killed Red Moon sovereign long ago and not let the situation develop like this. "A few figures appeared in his mind, and he said,""Not asking and letting the situation develop, it's a bit like another venerable sovereign ... But ... It's not here! The battle between Hong Yue and new martial arts has broken out. As a venerable sovereign, I don't have time to stay here. ""Who?" Li Hao began to gossip.Zhang an was silent for a moment before shaking his head."I'm just guessing ... It might not be him!""Division Chief, tell me. Let me see if I've heard of this person in neo martial's biography.""The son of Emperor Xi ... He was one of the nine emperors and four Emperors in the origin era. He was an unrivaled expert who advanced to venerable sovereign later on. He had two venerable sovereigns! His personality does match, but ... He shouldn't be here!"Zhang an shook his head and said,"a venerable sovereign. If he was really here and didn't participate in the battle against the Crimson Moon ... He would have been hammered to death by the human Emperor!" The human King can tolerate the weak not to fight, but this man is a true venerable sovereign. If he dares to not fight, it would be strange if we don't beat him to death!"Li Hao laughed,"the human King ... Is so ruthless?.""It's not that I'm ruthless, but I can't bear to see them avoid battle! This venerable sovereign ... He's not very brave, and in terms of character ... It's better to avoid trouble. As long as he can ignore it, he won 't. That's why I said that this God of beginner martial's character is a bit like him! However, the red moon invaded and a venerable sovereign was trapped. He didn't even go to deal with his opponent and was still hiding. If the human King finds out, he can be killed with one strike!"

Chapter 2363 The Bright And Unrestrained Li Hao (3 In 1)
Zhang an laughed."He's also very afraid of the human Emperor, so ... Even if it's really him, it's highly likely that it's just a clone and not the real him, and he doesn't have the power to kill a venerable sovereign. So, after hiding for 100000 years, Zheng Yu and Li daoheng are both related to the venerable sovereign. One is related to the venerable sword, and the other is related to the venerable sovereign of Saturn city. It's understandable that he doesn't care about them!"Zhang an seemed to have guessed something and laughed,""It's probably him! Otherwise, I can't think of anyone else who can stay still for a hundred thousand years! However, it's definitely not his original body ... Even if it's not, he shouldn't be too weak. There's a high probability that he's a half-step sovereign!"Li Hao's eyes flickered.Zhang an shook his head,"I've said it before, this person's personality is ... Weird!" 'It's better to have less trouble. Besides, it's only a clone. Whether it's Li daoheng or Zheng Yu, they're all related to the venerable sovereign. Even if I'm a Supreme venerable, he won't care about us!' Unless ... We finally get rid of these two and find him to join forces to kill Red Moon sovereign. He may intervene because this is an external war, and we are considered to have internal strife!"Li Hao nodded thoughtfully. He couldn't help but say,""He's a venerable sovereign after all ... He ... He's afraid of descendants of venerable sovereigns?""Not fear! He didn't want to care ... He didn't want to care! He can't wait for the world to ignore him, and he also doesn't want to care about the world!"Zhang an sighed,"he and his father are both unparalleled existences!" "However ... No matter which side it is, they don't want to help. They can't wait for the world to forget them. In the new martial era, King Huai ... The master of general Huai's ancestor, and this person, are both known as the world's number one fence-sitter ... King Huai is helpless. He's not strong enough, and this family doesn't want to meddle in other people's business at all."Li Hao nodded and laughed."If it's as you've guessed, Division Chief," he said,"he won't care about us as long as I don't ruin the blood Emperor's revival plan?""That's right. As long as we don't cause him trouble, he won't care about us!"Zhang an was also helpless,"besides, I can't ask for more from this person!" If my main body was here, it would be fine. But now, if it's just a clone, even the human King can't force him to do anything. At most, you can just kill my clone ... What can you do?""What's his name?"Li Hao asked, interested.The son of Emperor Xi?The nine emperors and four thearchs of the new martial world were the peerless powerhouses of the beginner martial world, the origin world, and the new martial world. They had been powerful from the beginning to the end. Here, there was their son who was also a venerable sovereign ... How ancient was this!"I can't say. If it's really him, even if my avatar is here, I can sense it when I mention him. It's not good to say too much. If I say too much, he will think that you're plotting against him. Although he doesn't want to meddle in other people's business, he might strike first and eliminate you, a scourge!""You're the grandson of a Supreme-being ..."Li Hao laughed.According to what you've said, they wouldn't have done anything to you."Yes, but ... You're not!" Zhang an nodded.‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao was speechless!He could not help but laugh!"You said that you wanted me to go on a diplomatic mission to the Li Dynasty ..." Zhang an continued."If it's his clone, then it'll be much easier. As long as you're sure that you won't ruin the blood Emperor's recovery plan, he won't care about you!" "That's good! Did li daoheng and Zheng Yu guess it as well? Otherwise, when I see these two, they don't even care about the other side. ""Probably!"Zhang an said,"I didn't know that there was a cat in the knife. If I had known earlier, I would have probably been able to determine his identity. These two ... Have probably seen the blood knife before. You have to be careful. It's normal for li daoheng to have seen it before, but when has Zheng Yu seen it?""Not long ago, his clone made a trip there," Li Hao said. Best novel online free at ‚ìù0‚ì•‚ìî‚ìõ‚ìë‚ìò‚ìù Zhang an thought for a moment and nodded,"maybe!" "In short, it's probably him. Otherwise, li daoheng and Zheng Yu wouldn't have left him alone. If it's the one we're thinking of, they have the same thoughts as us. As long as we don't spoil his plan, he won't interfere. It's as simple as that." Li Hao sighed."I can't believe there's such a person. He's powerful but doesn't care about anything. He's really ... Free?"Was this considered carefree?Maybe.However, from the looks of it, it was just an avatar. There were still people that the other party was afraid of, such as the human King. Since his main body was here, he didn't dare to ignore it. Now, he had an excuse."Alright, Division Chief. It's decided then. You don't have to worry about anything else. At the critical moment, hand over the star River City to me. Also, don't let that person from the Li Dynasty interfere ... I'll take care of the rest!""You ... Are you really going to do this?""Of course!" Li Hao nodded."AI!"Zhang an sighed."You're improving very quickly. Perhaps you can wait a little longer. For example, when you reach the sixth level of Dao integration, even if you can't defeat a half-step sovereign, you'll still have a chance to resist one or two ... You're only at the fourth level of Dao integration right now, but you're improving very quickly ... Perhaps you'll reach the sixth level of Dao integration in half a year!"However, Li Hao shook his head."I have to be at least at the peak of the sixth level of Dao integration and open about 252 meridians ... I'm lacking a great opportunity right now, so I still need to open about 108 meridians. Even if I open one every three days, it'll still take me a year. Besides ... How can I open one every three days in the current situation?"I've killed everyone I can kill recently, so where's the big opportunity?Zhang an wanted to say something but stopped.It's really heart-wrenching to hear it. What do you mean by one year ... I'll be able to match a half-step sovereign in a year?Really ... F * ck!

Chapter 2364 The Bright Li Hao (3 In 1)
"I agree to the two conditions you mentioned. Is there anything else?"Zhang an didn't bother to say anything more. Li Hao's mind was actually much clearer than anyone else 's. Whoever thought he was taking a risk was in danger.This guy might have a bunch of backup plans!It seemed like a risk, but he was able to turn danger into safety every time!Li Hao was also a gambler, but this guy was not just gambling. He was constantly increasing his chances of success until it reached the highest point. Such a person could not even be considered a gambler.Li Hao suddenly chuckled."There's nothing else, but since you're so enthusiastic, I've thought about it. If I don't say anything, I'll be letting you down. Can I borrow your book of ways for a few days?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùZhang an looked at him without saying a word.Sometimes, Li Hao was a gentleman.Sometimes, he was just shameless to the extreme.The book of Dao!Even his own son didn't dare to mention this casually, as it involved the path of cultivation.Before he could say anything, Li Hao chuckled and said,""Division Chief lent me the book of Dao, so I won't be stingy. I'll lend you my life star to swim in the chaos River that I fused with! You know, you've seen it last time. My Galaxy is the convergence of thousands of DAOs. How strong and important it is ... It may not be as good as the great DAOs of the new martial Supreme emperors, but this is not the book of great DAOs of the Supreme emperors!"If it was a Supreme-being 's, it wouldn't be worth it to exchange it with Li Hao.However, Zhang an was not a Supreme-being, but the grandson of a Supreme-being, and his realm was only at the Heavenly King-to-be realm. He would not lose out at all if he exchanged with Li Hao, and he would only gain more, because he was also cultivating a new Dao.Zhang an glanced at Li Hao and frowned.""Are you that indifferent to your Dao?"He can read it casually?He said in a deep voice,"sharing is actually a kind of open-mindedness. Neo martial arts has always been sharing everyone's martial Dao, but once it involves the core Dao, it still needs to be tested. It can't be shared casually. In addition, you've opened the great Dao universe now ... There are good and bad mixed in. You're actually a little reckless!"Li Hao shared his own Dao universe with Silver Moon. Core figures could enter, and many people could enter as they pleased ... This also resulted in the current Dao universe not being too mysterious.If this went on, be careful, something would happen!"I believe in everyone!" Li Hao smiled.Zhang an gave him a deep look. You ... Trust everyone so much?Li Hao also laughed. I just believe it ... Those who don't believe it, I've already moved them into my spiritual sea.You don't know anyway!I didn't find your star, but if I do, I'll move you in with me. You'll cry then."Division Chief, do you want to change?""Sure!" Zhang an nodded after a moment of silence."Thank you, chief!"Zhang an was speechless. There was no need for that. It was just an equivalent exchange. In fact, he even made a small profit. As Li Hao had said, he was not his grandfather. Although his book of Dao involved many venerable Emperor intents, what he had comprehended was not the true venerable Emperor realm.Zhang an didn't say anything. He reached out his hand and a book of Dao appeared.Li Hao directly accepted it and said,""If the division Chief wants to take a bath, he can come to my Galaxy at any time. Previously, he could still hide a little ... Now, I'm afraid that many people have guessed something, but it doesn't matter! However, just take a look. Director, please don't absorb my power of ten thousand DAOs!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù  Zhang an was speechless."I won 't!"Seeing that Li Hao was about to leave, he asked,"are you ...""Let's go see the Queen!"Li Hao laughed and said,"I haven't been back in months. I'm going to see them. I'll also see Zheng Yu." If I didn't show up, everyone would be worried that I'd do something bad. In that case, I'll show up and visit them!""Oh, right. Director," he added,"if you have time, move the city to the side of Hurricane city. It'll be more convenient!""They still have many other Heavenly Kings!" Zhang an was speechless.It's not like there's no one left!"Chief, are you afraid of them?"Li Hao laughed and said no more. He left in an instant, his voice echoing in the city. "Let's take a walk around Hurricane city with director Zhang. Neo martial Saints, if a Heavenly King appears ... It won't be a problem to kill a few!"Li Hao had already left.After he left, Zhang an appeared and looked in the direction he had left. He frowned. This guy ... Was getting more and more daring.This time, he actually wanted to chase Zheng Yu away.Ying Hongyue ... If he succeeded, Ying Hongyue would really be finished this time.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the North.A bright moon flickered and was about to escape, but Li Hao appeared and blocked her way. The Queen appeared and groaned in her heart!If I had known, I wouldn't have been so ostentatious!Why did Li Hao come to me?This King hasn't provoked him recently!Li Hao's smile was brilliant."Your Majesty, long time no see. I miss you. You haven't given me any benefits for a long time!" Best novel online free at ‚ìù0‚ì•‚ìî‚ìõ‚ìë‚ìò‚ìù ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe Queen remained silent.Li Hao smiled."You Took Advantage of Me when I destroyed the moon goddess 'true body. You owe me a favor. Is that okay?""What do you want to do?" the Queen asked coldly.Li Hao laughed."I don't want to do anything. Just one thing ... Go to Hurricane city and tell Zheng Yu that you're going to accommodate him into the main body and have him move. I want Hurricane city!""What?""I want Hurricane city!""Li Hao, are you crazy?"The Queen was furious!What do you take me for?Li Hao frowned slightly and said,"for your own good!" Li daoheng has the power of a half-step sovereign and he's in the moon god's true body. How can you, an early Heavenly King, fight him? Although Zheng Yu was also a bad person, he and Li daoheng were natural enemies! If you don't have a pseudo-Emperor to protect you, sooner or later you will be swallowed by others until not even your bones are left! Who Do You Think You Are? Your strength is either picked up from the outside or from somewhere else. The moon goddess can enter your body at any time and take your power! Only by having another half-step sovereign can you prevent this from happening. Do you understand?"

Chapter 2365 The Bright Li Hao (3 In 1)
The Queen's expression changed slightly. This was not a lie. In fact, she herself knew the situation. She just felt that ... Everyone might not care about her now. Li Hao said softly,"go and talk to Zheng Yu. Tell him that I said I need Hurricane city!" Tell him to move. Otherwise, it won't be a good thing for Zheng Yu if yueshen takes you away. He knows this too ... We're all smart people, and it's easier for smart people to talk. "The Queen gritted her teeth,"impossible!" It's impossible for me to let Zheng Yu and the others enter ... Do you think I'm an object? This King is ..."Li Hao laughed."The moon itself isn't yours. Do you really think you're the moon god?" Go, persuade him! Convey my opinion, or else ... I will find an opportunity to attack Hurricane city! Tell Zheng Yu to clean his neck and wait for me to deal with him!"The Queen frowned,"you're only in the early Heavenly King stage!" He's a pseudo-Emperor ...""What does it have to do with you?"Li Hao said calmly,"are you going?" If you don't go ... From today onwards, I'll kill you first! I don't have much use for you even if I keep you around. You're not even willing to help me with a small matter!"The Queen was furious!You and I are enemies!What are you saying?Who helped you?She wanted to curse, but seeing Li Hao looking at her coldly, she felt a little guilty. Gritting her teeth, she angrily said,""Even if this Prince is willing, Zheng Yu will definitely not agree! Li Hao, you're just daydreaming!""Just go and give him a choice. I'm not the type of person to force everyone! It's always good to have one more choice!" Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe Queen wanted to refuse, but she also wanted to pretend to agree. Once Li Hao left, she would escape!As he was thinking, Li Hao said gloomily,'don't even think about escaping. Unless you break some of the Dao meridians in your body first ... I'll find you at any time! Have you forgotten that the first time I went to the West, I was looking for you!"The Queen's expression changed!As expected!I knew that it was wrong to open her meridians too quickly. She gritted her teeth and said,""Isn't this your backup plan? Weren't you trying to lure me, li daoheng, and the real moon god into the Dao universe? Why are you telling me this?"Li Hao chuckled."So obvious. Li daoheng isn't an idiot. How could he only realize it now like you?" Zheng Yu could probably see it. Do you think the world doesn't know? If you don't believe me, you can ask Zheng Yu. Does he dare to enter the Dao universe through you? Since that's the case ... Why should I be afraid of others knowing? You're the bait I've set, who would dare to eat you?""Li Hao, don't be too arrogant!" "Do you think I have to cultivate my Dao meridians?" the Queen was furious."It's fine if you don't want to cultivate, just self-destruct!"Li Hao said indifferently,"I'm not stopping you!" After you self-destruct, you may not be able to maintain your Heavenly King Power. In this era ... If you don't even have the Heavenly King Power, then you ... Are really crippled. At least now, you still have a chance to resist!"The Queen gritted her teeth!This was the first time he felt so ... Helpless, lowly, and helpless!'These bastards, who do they think I am?Everyone was controlling themselves!How hateful!Li Hao was even more straightforward, not even trying to hide it. "You're my bait ..." Although everyone knew that, he didn't care."Li Hao!" After a long time, the Queen looked dejected."Li Hao, what do you want from me?"Li Hao was also helpless."Don't overestimate yourself. No one wants you to do anything ... You're just a tool. See if you can find a chance to get rid of it. Who wants to do anything to you?""You ...""Alright, that's all I have to say. Help me settle this as soon as possible!"After saying this, Li Hao disappeared.BOOM!The Queen's punch broke the sky. She was furious and hateful!How hateful!It was a great humiliation!After a long time, he gritted his teeth and flew in the direction of Hurricane city. 'Zheng Yu, let's join forces and kill this bastard!'

2366 Chapter 396
Hurricane city.The Queen still came.He didn't enter the city, but directly conveyed Li Hao's thoughts outside.In the city, Zheng Yu laughed.The Heavenly Kings were furious. They were furious. This was too much! Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé Asking them to give up Hurricane city and live in the Queen's moon ... Wasn't that a joke?"Does Li Hao really think he's a Paragon? Does he think he's a venerable sovereign?"A Heavenly King was furious and shouted,""Does he dare to come to Hurricane city? Lord has allowed him to enter Hurricane city, but does he dare to?"Did he really think that a pseudo-Emperor was retarded?Li Hao actually said this.This wasn't the main point. The main point was ... That idiot Queen actually came. So, you're afraid of Li Hao, but aren't you afraid of the wrath of a pseudo-Emperor?You still dare to let a pseudo-Emperor stay at your house?How bold was this?At the thought of this, even Zheng Yu laughed and looked at the Queen.""You're afraid of Li Hao, so when Li Hao asked you to come, you really came. You ... Aren't afraid of me?"The Queen snorted angrily,"do you think I'm afraid of him?" "But now, you can't come out. He has many helpers in the outside world! Besides, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Why should I be afraid of you? Shouldn't you and I join forces to deal with him?"Zheng Yu chuckled.Aren't you afraid?Aren't you afraid? you came here just like that and persuaded a half-step sovereign to move?"Do you wish for me to stay in the Silver Moon?""As you wish!"The Queen's feelings were complicated. How would I know?Zheng Yu sighed lightly. The so-called "follow me" was actually because the Queen was afraid. In fact, she also felt that Li Hao's words made sense. The moon goddess had li daoheng, while she had nothing. With a half-step sovereign moving in ... At least, it was safer for now.He only looked at the present and not the future.Zheng Yu didn't say anything and just silently looked into the distance. Did he really want Hurricane city, or was he ... Just pointing around?Li Hao might look young, but he was actually very difficult to understand sometimes.He asked the Queen to come ... Not necessarily because he really wanted Hurricane city.Just like last time, when they had gone all out to deal with Ying Hongyue, the result was that Thunder City had been defeated, and even li daoheng had suffered a great loss. This person's brain was very quick!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Just as the Queen and Zheng Yu were arguing.Li Hao continued to wander around the Silver Moon.Seizing the eight main cities was one of his goals, but Li Hao wasn't just aiming at the eight main cities. In addition to these enemies on the surface, there were still some in the dark.For example, heaven's will!Silvermoon's heaven's will had disappeared recently, and the will that the world had given birth to had actually disappeared ... Clearly, this Young heaven's will had matured a lot recently.Li Hao had some suspects, but he didn't know who had obtained the will of heaven.However, a slightly mature heaven's will could deal a fatal blow at a critical moment. Li Hao had used it last time and even destroyed a part of its will. Heaven's will was merciless, and it would definitely take revenge on Li Hao.There was also the rapidly improving Dao sword, Hong Xiu, who was saving everyone in the divine Kingdom, the ninth Prince of Heavenly Star ... These people could all become the target of the Heaven's Will.Silver moon's entire situation seemed to have become clear, but there were still some complicated issues.At this moment, Li Hao was walking in all directions, measuring the world with his feet.How big was this Silver Moon land?Where were the barriers between heaven and earth?What was The World's End like?He had his own thoughts that he would not reveal to anyone.However ... It would be difficult to complete.He had to do it to the best of his ability and set up a monstrous trap to trap everyone!His greatest advantage now was that he could walk freely in the world. Zheng Yu and the others might have a clone outside, but the clone wasn't the main body. Li Hao was well aware that a clone was only a clone, after all, and its reaction speed was inferior to the main body.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶This time, Li Hao took his time and spent seven days. With his strength, one day was enough for him to circle the entire Silver Moon.But this time, he spent seven days to travel all over the Silver Moon land.He had been to all four corners of the world.At this moment, in the North, at the end of the Li Dynasty.Li Hao sat cross-legged in the air, deep in thought.It would be very difficult!It was especially difficult.However, I want to try!He looked at the distant Li Dynasty. There were mountains and wild beasts everywhere. There was also ... An expert who seemed to be a venerable sovereign's clone.Now, Zheng Yu and the others were unable to leave with their true bodies, but this person was free and unfettered. He had been outside the whole time, and the most likely person to ruin his plan was this person.Many thoughts flashed through his mind.After a long time, Li Hao walked in the air.He did not really wait for Zhang an to stop this person.If this person was really as Zhang an said ... Perhaps, they could discuss it.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Dali temple.The God of beginner martial suddenly appeared and looked at the end of the North. He seemed to be a little dissatisfied, feeling that this person had been harassing him. He knew that Li Hao had measured the world before, but he couldn't be bothered to care.Why is it here again?And ... From the looks of it, it was heading straight for him.'Damn it!'He glanced at King Dali, who was still absorbing energy and was about to advance, and was a little impatient. He disappeared in a flash.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the North, at the end of the Li Dynasty.An afterimage appeared.The God of beginner's martial was not polite at all this time. He was extremely cold."Li Hao, you have to understand that I don't care, not that I can 't! Don't push your luck. The Li Dynasty is just a small place, and you want to take it down? If you really want to take it down, I have no objections ... I've been sleeping in the godly Palace area for many years. As long as you don't disturb me, I can't be bothered with you!"

"Senior, you've misunderstood!"Li Hao smiled."I like people like you, senior. If you don't mess with me, I won't mess with you ... I have no intention of harassing you, nor do I have any intention of roping you in. It's fine as long as you maintain the status quo. You've misunderstood me. I'm not here to suppress the Li Dynasty, nor am I here to rope you in.""What are you doing here?" the God of beginner martial was slightly stunned.Li Hao said,"senior, you're too strong. That's one of the reasons!" Second, the saber under the ruins of Star Town City ... Was too powerful! The eight main cities absorb the power of heaven and earth, absorb all the power that is overflowing, and nurture that blade, nurture that cat ...""Are you threatening me?"Li Hao raised his eyebrows and asked,'why do you say that, senior? Why would I threaten senior? Senior, let me finish. Why do you always like to guess by yourself?""You ..."The God of beginner martial was a little annoyed."I have an idea ... But I need your cooperation, senior," Li Hao said softly."Hmph!"Li Hao wasn't angry. He said softly,"I hope that you can suppress that saber for a short time, senior ... Including the eight main cities. It's not to help me. It's just so that I won't ruin your plan. Senior, don't ruin my plan, either.""A plan?"The God of beginner martial was puzzled,'you want me to suppress ... How? If you have something to say, just say it! I'm too lazy to guess or judge, it's too much of a waste of time. Just say it directly, be more straightforward, not straightforward at all!"Li Hao laughed,"then I'll just say it!" I have an idea ... We can set up a great world formation that will cover the entire Silver Moon! However, I'm afraid that I won't be able to cover some of the more powerful existences. It's fine if they're suppressed, but those who aren't ... Might be able to break my formation!""A great formation?"The God of beginner martial laughed. You think you're the blood Emperor? You want to copy him and set up the eight trigrams Formation between the heaven and earth? His formation can trap a venerable sovereign for a hundred thousand years ... If you have that ability, you can just rule the world directly. Why go through so much trouble?" Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé Was Li Hao joking?What a ridiculous little fellow!Li Hao said softly,"senior, where there's a will, there's a way!" Right now, other than senior, I'm perhaps the strongest person ... Who has walked out of this world!"The God of beginner martial was a little confused,'what array do you want to set up? Would you?""I do. Formations are actually very simple. You just need to combine them. Formations are also a type of combat technique! I've learned the battle skills left behind by Yuan Ping, the younger sister of the human King, and the key to it is the method of combined battle skills that Zhan Tiandi spread in the past ..."Li Hao looked at the sky and said softly, in the next few days, I want to take 100 stars into the sky and cover the world with 100 stars! They announced to the outside world that they would summon the great Dao universe and let it merge with the Silver Moon world ...""What?" the God of beginner martial was stunned."You want to summon the universe of the great path?"Are you crazy?Li Hao said softly,"why not?" Besides ... It's just a public announcement. How would I know if it's a success or failure? However, I want to isolate senior and that blade, including that cat that might be coming back to life ... Isolate the place where the venerable sovereign was sealed, isolate Hurricane city, and isolate the moon in the sky! My current plan is to first cover the land without experts and catalyze the evolution of the great Dao ..."The God of beginner martial's heart stirred."That's not right. You said to announce it to the outside world ... In that case, you're not simply summoning the great Dao universe to descend?""Senior, you're wise indeed!" Li Hao smiled.Bullshit! You're just announcing it to the public."My real intention is to lure others to attack my Dao universe ..." Li Hao continued."Then, I'll self-detonate my Dao meridians and destroy my Dao. I'll then use the world to suppress them again!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe God of beginner martial said in a strange tone,"there's no hope of suppressing a half-Emperor to death!" They would not be suppressed to death. The only thing they were afraid of now was that if they came out, the world would not be able to withstand the pressure of so many experts ... It would cause the seal to break and the venerable sovereigns to come out! Do you really think this Silver Moon world can easily crush a half-Emperor?"You're thinking too much?'This kid ... He doesn't have any good intentions!'Li Hao chuckled."Senior, I don't care about that. That's why I'm meeting you now ... I hope you can avoid my formation to avoid any misunderstandings and trouble. What do you think, senior?"The God of beginner martial fell into deep thought, and after a while, he said,""Sure, I can't be bothered to meddle in other people's business! The only thing is ... If you destroy the eight city cores and stop the blood saber from absorbing the blood ... I won't show you any mercy!"Other than this, he did not have any other requests.As for what Li Hao wanted to do, he was too lazy to care or ask.Up to you!You can do whatever you want, just don't disturb me.Li Hao smiled brightly."Alright then. Thank you for your understanding, senior!" If this plan succeeds, I'll be looking forward to senior's guidance in the future ..."Then, Li Hao left.As for the God of beginner martial, he looked on silently and frowned slightly. Summon the great Dao universe and merge with the heaven and earth?That's bullshit!What was this little brat up to?In any case, there was nothing wrong with her having ill intentions!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Just as the God of beginner martial was still suspicious.Some people had received Li Hao's order.At this moment, Lin Hongyu in the stellarsky city, Qian Wuliang who was on a mission outside, and Zhao Shuguang who was handling the affairs of the world ...Some of the new martial Saints also received Li Hao's message.Set up the formation!He didn't know what formation it was.

At this moment, Li Hao could only relay orders.Zhao Shuguang, Wang Ye, and the ninth Division commander were stationed at the Western end of the city. Gan Wuliang, Hong Yitang, and Li Fuhai were in charge of the northern end.The Redwood, Lin Hongyu, and the old turtle were stationed at the end of the South.Vajra wood, general Huai, Dao Jian, and Wang Ye were guarding the eastern end.All the Dao integration cultivators under Li Hao's command were mobilized at this moment. They did not know what Li Hao was going to do. Not only were they mobilized, but the five big cities floating in the great Dao universe were also mobilized.Boundless, Thunderbolt, martial Union, and dingtian city each guarded a different area.Heaven battling city was suspended in the central continent, and in the sky above stellarsky city, it was controlled by dozens of Yao plant troops.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The world was in chaos.The four cities flew across the sky. More than a dozen Saints controlled the ancient city and led an Army of hundreds of thousands to guard the four directions.Such a huge commotion quickly attracted everyone's attention.Not only that, but heaven battling city also hovered in the air. Li Hao personally took charge of heaven battling city and led Silver moon's non-Dao integration stage powerhouses as well as hundreds of thousands of soldiers to suppress the ancient city.Heaven battling city continued to hover in the air until it was 10000 meters above the ground, almost enveloping the entire stellarsky city. Only then did it stop moving.With such a huge commotion, even Zhang an and the others could not help but pay more attention.Li Hao ... What was he doing now?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Countless experts were watching Li Hao from all directions.And Li Hao didn't seem to be hiding anything.On this day, the sky screen was activated again.The entire bright star continent was covered in the sky. Li Hao, who hadn't appeared for months, reappeared in the sky."Everyone, I'm Li Hao!"It was the same opening speech as always. At this moment, the world fell silent. Countless people raised their heads and looked at the sky in front of them. The pedestrians stopped and the cultivators stopped their cultivation.At this moment, Li Hao was calm and gentle as usual.""There are billions of cultivators in the world today. From ancient times until now, even in the neo martial era, there won't be so many cultivators born in a short period of time!""There are over 10 billion people in the world! The Silvermoon world, which is the world we live in, is only a small world. As of now, it is unable to support the cultivation of ten billion people!""We lack energy, resources, and opportunities ... Everyone can cultivate, but heaven and earth can't keep us going ... If this continues, when will we be able to enter the mountains and seas? When can we break the sun and moon?""I have a strong heart for martial arts, and everyone is like a dragon ... After thinking about it, perhaps ... There is only one way! The Dao of creation ... The Dao of fusion!"  Best n0vel online free at n0ŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  "The universe of the great path is boundless. The power of the great path is endless!"Li Hao said slowly,"some people may know that the Dao they are cultivating is a new Dao. It's a new Dao that I call the bright star Dao! A new Dao, there's a new Dao universe ... That's a universe of great DAOs!""I want ... To share this with everyone. I can't let the Dao universe become a Holy Land for me and a few people to cultivate ... And let the ten billion people only absorb a weak and insignificant amount of energy to open their apertures!""Therefore, I want to do what I did in the Silver City and my hometown. I want to summon the universe of the great path and merge with the Silver Moon world. Even if I can't completely merge with it, I want to pour the power of the great path into the world so that the world will be strong and the energy will no longer be lacking!""Dao integration cultivators are now stationed in all directions, with the four main cities as the foundation and heaven battling city as the core ... I want to leave this great Dao in Silver Moon forever ... So that the people of Silver Moon can enjoy the beauty of the Holy Land, just like me!""And this requires everyone's help. Only by working together to summon the great Dao, have the great Dao descend and listen to my command, then ... There's hope for the great Dao universe to merge with the world! This will not only benefit us, but it will also allow our descendants to no longer fight for resources for generations to come ..."The world was silent.Those who didn't understand were at a loss, but those who understood were aghast!What the hell?Summoning the great Dao universe to merge with the Silver Moon?What a joke.How was that possible?Of course, if it were anyone else, they might not have, but Li Hao ... Some well-informed people actually knew that Li Hao had opened the Dao universe of his own accord and let some people in.At this moment, he was actually not satisfied with this!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The experts in the ancient city were also stunned.What?Summoning the great Dao universe and merging it with the Silver Moon?This ... What did this mean?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In Hurricane city.Zheng Yu was also listening quietly and was a little absent-minded. The Heavenly Kings were all dumbfounded as they muttered,""What does that mean ... Merging the great Dao universe into the Silver Moon? How could that be possible? I might as well move the Silver Moon into the Dao universe ..."This might be even simpler!"Yes," Zheng Yu said softly."To move into a great Dao universe, one needs to control the entire Silver Moon. You can summon the great Dao universe and merge it into the Silver Moon ... There's no need to control it! As long as he has control over the great Dao universe or the part he controls, he has a chance of succeeding!"But ...Zheng Yu asked softly,'what's the point? Were there really such selfless Saints? If he could succeed, even if he did not succeed, just by merging the great Dao into the Silver Moon, it was possible to turn the entire Silver Moon into a Holy Land for cultivation. There was even hope of raising the level of the entire Silver Moon! The Silver Moon was originally just a small world. If we can succeed ... The world will recover once more. Not only that ... But the entire Silver Moon world will be strengthened!"

Has Li Hao gone crazy, or has the world gone crazy, or have we gone crazy?We're here ... And we're actually hearing a legend that's been around for ages!Someone was trying to merge the great Dao universe into a small world.Damn it, even Zheng Yu laughed.What kind of magical idea was this?Even the human King didn't think this way!Of course, this was related to the fact that the universe of origin itself had a high degree of fusion with the neo martial world. The current universe of the great path and the Silvermoon world still had a low degree of fusion.He quickly thought ... Was this a trap?Is this a conspiracy?What was Li Hao trying to do?I don't think it's that simple!Of course, the matter itself was not simple, but ... Anyway, it was inexplicably strange.At this moment, Li Hao's voice continued,""Regardless of whether we succeed or not, the Silver Moon will definitely benefit from it. The world will definitely give birth to some energy mineral veins that are more suitable for our cultivation!""And this requires us to work together!""Some people say that the People's hearts are useless in the era of supers! I don't believe it! I believe that if billions of cultivators work together, we can pull the entire Dao universe closer and out of the illusionary space!""The People's hearts are the strongest power! No matter how strong the enemy is, they can't stop the unity of billions of people!"Li Hao's voice became a little high-pitched, which was rare for him. He said excitedly,""If we succeed this time, the Silvermoon world will become a Holy Land for all of us! The barriers between heaven and earth are stronger, and the world is more stable. Even venerable sovereigns can't break my world gate easily! Everyone, are you willing to help me, Li Hao, complete the foundation of this Golden Age?"At this moment, countless humans from all over the world were shouting!"I'm willing!"He was excited and excited.Ten billion people worked together to pull this mysterious great Dao universe into the Silver Moon, strengthening the entire world so that the cultivators no longer lacked energy. There were too many people cultivating now!Anyone would cultivate!It was still fine in the past as they had some energy. Now that the world had recovered and energy was constantly overflowing, it could not support so many people to cultivate!If Li Hao's words were true, and the great DAOs were integrated into the world ... Wouldn't everyone be able to cultivate easily in the future?When he thought of this ... How could he not be excited!Li Hao continued,"then, from today on, everyone, prepare enough food and make all the necessary preparations!" "Cultivators, be prepared to cultivate at any time. Non-cultivators ... Do some daily auxiliary work. If there are children or elderly people who are inconvenient to take care of, you can apply to the local government ... Over the next few days, I will spread out countless life forces to cover the world, enough for the people to eat and eat!""This time, I've used up all my family's wealth and all the resources of the government ... If I fail ... We'll have to tighten our belts and live together in the future!"Li Hao revealed a bright smile.""During this period of time, there might be some bad people, wicked people, and sinners who don't want to see us become stronger, and don't want us to become stronger! They might come to cause destruction or trouble ... But we have to believe that all resistance is just a paper tiger! With me here, with all the powerful martial masters here, with them here, with the Army here ... All of you are just clowns!""The time is three days later. At that time, all cultivators in the world are to pay attention to the sky screen and wait for my orders!""Why don't we do it? if we do it ... We'll do a big one!" Li Hao's voice rose again,"there's nothing that can't be done!" As long as we dare to think about it, we can do it. If we can't do it once, we'll continue! One day, we will all become the rulers of the world! You can control your own destiny!" The world was in an uproar, and their blood was boiling.He could control his own fate!Three days later, he summoned the universe of the great path and descended into the world.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Li Dynasty.The Dali King was dumbfounded and quickly ran to the God of beginner martial arts. The God of beginner martial arts was still thinking. When he saw the Dali King break in, he said unhappily,""Who asked you to come?""No, senior ... What is Li Hao doing?"Li Hao had done it once in the Silver City. A small-scale great path universe had descended, but it was very small.What a big place! Best n0vel online free at n0ŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  That time, it wasn't the true descent of the great path universe. From what he heard, this time, it was for real?To encompass the entire world within it?What was going on?This fellow had advanced to the fourth level of the Dao integration realm and was treating him like a venerable sovereign. Even a venerable sovereign ... Would not dare to have such thoughts.Controlling ten billion people and pulling the great Dao universe ... Why did it sound so strange?The God of beginner martial also frowned and said after a while,""We'll just wait and see!"I still can't tell if it's true or not.In short, this matter was full of suspicions!Li Hao was even more confused."He always does things in public ... But you don't know if that's his true purpose.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.On the Silver Moon.The sword-bearing man frowned slightly, and the moon goddess statue was also extremely puzzled.""Is he joking?"He summoned the great Dao universe!Putting the benefits aside, the dangers were too great. This was opening the great path of the universe to everyone ... Was Li Hao really not afraid?Or do you think that it's fine because everyone can't get out?But ... Your bed universe has been completely exposed. At that time, anyone who sees it, as long as they have the courage, even a half-step Emperor, would have the time to rush in. If you call the bed universe to cover you, it might be able to shield the entire world's suppression.
