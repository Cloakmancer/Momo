Within the lightning territory.Lightning flickered. The Thunder monarch was currently resisting these lightning bolts. Previously, a large number of lightning Giants had gathered. Some had dissipated, some had been killed by the experts, and some had returned to the Thunder region.At this moment, it had turned into an endless dark cloud of lightning tribulation, covering the entire lightning territory.If it wasn't for the fact that the Thunder World was a world of lightning, it might have already been destroyed.As for the Thunder Emperor, after devouring the two major worlds, the entire realm showed signs of advancing to level eight. Otherwise, he might not have been able to withstand the powerful lightning tribulation.At this moment, Li Hao, ermao, Kong Ji, and the two Dao Masters were all frantically devouring and digesting what they had obtained.Li Hao directly absorbed an eighth-level universe.This was also his first time devouring a great Dao universe. Before this, he had only absorbed some power of the Crimson Moon. He had never devoured a great Dao universe.This time, void, ermao, and the others had improved a lot, especially ermao, who had descended into the real world and void had reached rank 7.On the other hand, even though Silvermoon had devoured a world, the two Dao Masters had not been able to reach grade seven.Almost no chance!Li Hao was well aware of this, so he did not expect Silver Moon to easily reach Level Seven. Even though he had absorbed countless great Dao energy, devoured countless Level Seven corpses, and swallowed an entire Level Seven world, it was difficult for him to advance as he had a dual-Dao universe.At this moment, neither of them had reached the peak of rank six.It was clear how difficult it would be for Silver Moon to become a true great world.Although Dao Qi was a little depressed, he started to cultivate honestly and consolidate his Level Seven power. He had lost an eighth-tier great cosmos, but he had taken over an entire Level Seven world.As for the others, the Queen was repairing herself while constantly suppressing the human race in several major worlds. At this moment, most of the human race in these worlds had been squeezed into a world.Li Hao didn't care if he could subdue all of them.The Queen was playing by herself.The Queen was very clear ... That she would be in a lot of trouble.The black Tiger had escaped!This seventh rank venerable sovereign was aware of the situation. In this case, she could cut off the seventh Rank's path, but once the Dragon Lord found out, he would definitely kill Li Hao and the others at all costs.Therefore, the Queen still hoped that she could become stronger.Tier 4, very soon.Her speed of reaching level four even surpassed Li Hao 's, but she still felt that it was very, very slow. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  On the other side, Lin Hongyu was also consolidating her hell of death. There were many corpses in the hell, all of which were venerable sovereigns. Some of them were not killed by her. At this moment, she was also trying to see if she could bring them into hell.As for Yuan Shuo, he was also trying to devour some of the five elements power, hoping to reach rank four as soon as possible. Previously, he had almost reached rank four. With his Dao domain, realm was not a problem. The problem was energy.This time, a large number of venerable sovereigns had died, so energy was not a problem. The fourth rank was just in front of him.Everyone was cultivating. This time, he had gained a lot.There was more than that in the five major worlds. There was still a large amount of world power that had not been absorbed. Black Panther was absorbing it, while the others were mainly absorbing the power of the great Dao universe.After killing 11 Level Seven venerable sovereigns, some of their energy had completely dissipated. However, some of their bodies, corpses, and power of great DAOs had all been preserved.The physical bodies of these Beasts of Chaos were the most powerful weapons.At this moment, Li Hao handed the sword to the firmament sword.Devour!The firmament sword was left with only a small corner. It was a miserable sight. A fifth-rank sovereign weapon could no longer withstand Li Hao's power. At this moment, the firmament sword was also devouring the corpses of the experts.The bones, flesh, and blood of these beasts of primordial chaos were all extremely powerful.Even cultivators could become much stronger after devouring them. However, Li Hao did not give the corpses to the Silver Moon Martial Master. Ever since he started cultivating, he had rarely eaten demon beasts.Even though the flesh and blood of demon beasts were extremely nutritious, Li Hao rarely ate them.In fact, he had never even eaten it.It wasn't that he was afraid of them because they had spirits, but ... Be it chaos beasts or demon beasts, most of them ate people. Li Hao sometimes wanted to try them ... But when he thought of this, he lost his appetite.Killing people, snatching energy, killing demonic beasts, snatching energy, he didn't feel anything.However, the flesh of demon beasts might contain a large amount of human flesh ... Li Hao had no such thoughts.He didn't take the initiative to let others eat it. He didn't stop others from eating it, but he didn't take the initiative to give it to them. At this moment, the firmament sword benefited. They had killed a large number of seventh rank venerable sovereigns this time, including a few complete seventh rank corpses.It was a great opportunity for the firmament sword to devour. Even Taoist chess might not have such an opportunity.……In the sky.The Thunder Emperor was also digesting what he had obtained and resisting the Thunder tribulation at the same time. Beside him, there were less than 20 venerable sovereigns left in the Thunder World. At this moment, they were all surrounding the Thunder Emperor and helping him resist the Thunder tribulation.Of course, he had also gained some benefits. The Thunder Emperor had absorbed two great worlds. The Thunder realm great Dao universe, which had always been poor, was really extremely rich this time!The most important thing was that the Thunder World, which was about to enter the level-eight universe, only had around 20 venerable sovereigns.Which rank eight world didn't have hundreds of venerable sovereigns?At this moment, the number of venerable sovereigns in the Thunder World was pitifully small. In fact, there were even fewer venerable sovereigns than Silvermoon.These venerable sovereigns had also gained a lot.The Thunder monarch could not absorb all of it alone. The other venerable sovereigns had been lacking energy all this while. At this moment, they were all grinning from ear to ear as they absorbed it.

3311 Chapter 538
However, when they saw the group of people below, they were filled with fear, envy, and admiration!The Thunder World had lived in the Dragon field for hundreds of thousands of years. It had been very miserable. It had been sealed and suppressed all this time ... It was so miserable that it didn't seem like a level Seven great world.Thunderlord had never been able to break this restriction.Even this time, he had only wanted to escape and had never thought of counterattacking ...In the end, the Thunder World, which was on the verge of destruction, had been killed by the Silver Moon King's Group. The number of seventh rank venerable sovereigns and hundreds of ordinary venerable sovereigns had been killed!Now, the Thunder World had entered the Thunder region. The entire region even showed signs of advancing to tier 8 ...All of a sudden, these people were a little excited and Worshipful.However, at this moment, there were still some people who felt uneasy. Someone transmitted a message to the Thunder monarch,""Venerable sovereign, will they ... Will they not leave?"Don't tell me you want to take my realm?He was a little worried.If they really wanted to snatch it, even if the Thunder Emperor had entered the eighth level ... To be honest, the venerable sovereigns present were not confident that they could win against this group of people."What are you thinking?"The Thunder monarch transmitted a message."The Silver Moon King has his own world. If he really wanted a Dao universe, so many seventh-tier universes would have given up and let me devour them, and others devour them ... If he wanted it, he could have controlled a universe long ago. Why would he need to seize it now?"He finally understood that the Silver Moon King didn't care about the universe.This person ... Had a big heart!A thousand realms!In fact, when Li Hao's thousand realms and time appeared, he knew that this person might have his own ideas, such as ... Opening a realm by himself. It might not even be an ordinary realm. If Li Hao really succeeded in opening a realm, it would definitely be an extremely terrifying realm! But now, after devouring an eighth-level universe, Li Hao's Qianjie was still Qianjie!However, the Qianjie was actually showing signs of evolving into a mid-tier world. That was more terrifying.Moreover, the thousand worlds, which had been scattered before, were now showing signs of gathering because of the existence of the great path universe. This was the key to Li Hao's later unparalleled strength and his one-hit kill of Tong Bao.This guy, right now he could be considered a true sector Lord of the seventh step.If Grade 7 powerhouses were to be divided, the first grade would be the human King, who could fight with grade 8 powerhouses and even suppress them. Such people were too rare.The second class was the peak seventh-stage Chaos Beast plus the great Dao universe, or the peak seventh-stage Dao master and master as one, an expert guarding the local universe.The third class was chaos beasts from universes without great DAOs or Level Seven itinerant cultivators who advanced with their Dao domains. Level Seven itinerant cultivators were actually very strong. Only those who advanced by themselves could be considered Level Seven itinerant cultivators.The fourth level was the seventh level venerable sovereign in the eighth level universe. Generally, it was only one powerful path, but with the support of a great world, it was still considered okay.The fifth level was the seventh level, which had broken away from the eighth level world. This kind of seventh level venerable sovereign was the worst kind of seventh level in the entire chaos. Li Hao had not encountered one so far. Even when Wu Shan broke away from the eighth level world, he had broken away at the peak of the seventh level. Otherwise, he would be very weak. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  Li Hao, who had devoured an eighth-level universe, was now a seventh-level expert between the second and third levels. He should be on par with the sword venerable, and Kong Ji's advancement was also at this stage.A venerable sovereign with six paths and three extremes was obviously not simple.As for the fire Phoenix, she was actually at the second level. However, the other Primal Chaos sector Lords were slightly weaker. They weren't at the peak of the seventh level and could only be considered at the third level.The Thunder monarch was also thinking about this as he looked at Li Hao and the others. At this moment, Li Hao's side had quite a few tier 7 fighters.After Li Hao, Kong Ji, Dao Qi, er Mao, and the two Dao Masters fused, they were slightly stronger than ordinary rank Sevens. They could be considered five rank seven existences.As for Silvermoon, how long had it been since she had emerged from the primordial chaos?Three years!In three years 'time, a group of people's strength had actually reached this stage. It was simply inconceivable.And now, he, a venerable sovereign who was about to enter level eight ... Should be considered his ally, right?It was said that cloud world's Wu Shan and forest world's forest orchid were also this person's friends.From the looks of it ... In just a few years, even if not counting the new martial artists, a group of top powerhouses had gathered near Silver Moon.At this moment, the Thunder monarch looked out of the Thunder region and sighed.The Dragon Master had gone completely crazy this time, right?After this, he didn't know if they would directly enter the lightning territory and chase after them.If they did, it would be troublesome.……Just as the Thunder monarch was thinking about this ...The world of light.A group of people gathered.A large number of experts appeared.This caused the light Thearch to feel immense pressure.The new martial arts had arrived.Level eight Wu Shan, Level Seven Supreme venerable, yang God, blood Emperor, earth Emperor, sword venerable, Li Zhu, plus Emperor Cang and human King, there were a total of nine advanced venerable sovereigns!Furthermore, there were many powerhouses with extremely powerful auras.From the looks of it ... There was also hope for him to step into Level Seven.At this moment, the light Thearch couldn't say anything. The Supreme-being and the human King conversed for a while before he asked, "We've completely taken down the level 8 crimson sun World. The Yang energy is almost enough to balance the entire neo martial world ... The question now is, should the level 8 power of the Crimson sun World be used to advance the neo martial artists to level 8 or ... To help a group of people advance to Level 7?"This was a problem.Actually, this shouldn't be a problem.He definitely had to prioritize the advancement of his neo martial arts. Right now, neo martial arts was not considered a level eight world, and was actually equivalent to the Thunder World.Just a little more!Therefore, even though Emperor Cang and the human King realm had not officially stepped into the eighth rank, they were already at the critical point.

3312 Chapter 538
With a threat like the Dragon Master, of course, the most important thing was to let the new martial arts advance.However, the Supreme martial artist still asked this question.Li Hao slightly raised his eyebrows and glanced at him.At this time, the Supreme martial artist's question had a deeper meaning."What do you think?" the human King asked."What am I thinking? I'm afraid that even if you absorb all of it, it won't be enough for you to enter the eighth rank!"The Grandmaster was somewhat helpless. What else could he think?"Your inner world is also on the verge of advancement. Once you share it, and big cat has to absorb a part of it ... If you share it equally, will a rank eight great world really be enough for you to advance?"Emperor Cang and the human King were previously able to fight Chi Yang, an outer region level eight venerable sovereign, and two level Seven venerable sovereigns, but they were evenly matched. However, in reality, the two of them were only Level Seven.The two of them wanted to reach level eight, but the Autarchs were worried that the Crimson sun World wasn't enough!As for cloudsky, he had long been sucked dry by Wushan.What he was considering now was whether to let some of the Tier 6 experts advance first, in case these two guys only ate without advancing, and then it would be a big loss. Anyway, at this point, these two were no different from tier 8.The human King curled his lips."You think I eat a lot?"Nonsense, of course!"You've also eaten a lot!"The human King sent a voice transmission."You have so many avatars. Over the years, you've used up all the energy that neo martial gave birth to ... If it wasn't for the dual Dao universe being able to absorb, sun god and the others being self-sufficient, and old Li and the others being independent ... Our neo martial would have starved to death long ago."Neo martial artists were still alright at this point. There were not many who just ate and waited for death. People like Heaven's Fate, because they were weak, actually could not eat much. Even if they just ate and waited for death, they did not eat much.As for the others, most of them still had to support themselves.Thus, over the past thousand years, most of the energy absorbed by the two Dao universes had been absorbed by these few top-notch existences to feed the Supreme Being's 1000 avatars. Otherwise, the Supreme beings rarely went out, so how could they have so much energy to forge 1000 venerable sovereign-level avatars?"Let me use it to advance to the eighth step!"Even though he was making fun of them, the human King still spoke directly,""The Dragon Lord is very strong. Even among peak rank eights, he's a top-notch existence! Currently, no one in the four-sided domain is a match for him!""If I don't reach level 8 ... It'll probably be difficult to count on brother light and brother Wushan!""No." He shook his head and said,"the two of you joining forces ... Might not be able to match the Dragon Lord."Wu Shan didn't say anything, but the light Thearch frowned slightly. He was the master of an eighth-tier great universe!Alright!After thinking about it, he felt a little helpless. 'Probably. I didn't know that the Dragon Lord was so strong either. He killed an outer region level eight with three punches and Yunxiao with two. He's really terrifying.' Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  "The power of the Crimson sun world's universe and the power of the great Dao," the human King continued."When combined, can probably allow a neo martial artist to barely reach level eight ... Even if it's just a little bit worse, with my brother Guangming here, how can he mistreat me?""Of course!" The human King laughed."Light is also an extreme yang world ... If it's just a little worse, I can just do whatever I want and draw some energy. It'll be enough for my neo martial to advance!" “……”The radiance Thearch almost vomited blood!'This ... This ...'He really dared to think!He really dared to think about it!What are you saying? if you're just a little short of advancing, do you want me to sponsor you?The human King continued,"right now, I look like I'm tier 8, but in reality, I'm not. If I don't advance quickly, the Dragon Lord will find trouble with us very soon after he solves some problems! Besides, Silver Moon and I, a new martial artist, are still in cahoots with Li Hao ... The young man is now forced to hide in the Thunder region, and it's not a long-term solution, so we'd better advance as soon as possible!""But now, our new martial arts is considered poor. Guangming still has some reserves. After so many years, it's impossible to not have any ..."At this moment, the human King was much more serious.""Brother light, your son is with Li Hao, and you are with me. It can be said that your world of light is destined to fight the dragon Lord to the death! "Now, if you sponsor some, our new martial arts will be promoted and everyone will be safe ... Don't you think so?""The few overlords of the past, Yunxiao and chiyang are completely gone. Hongyue has become the Dragon Lord's dog. Now, there is only light. There are no losses at all, but luck can't always be there ... Moreover, new martial can move at any time and leave ... If we don't advance, we will have to leave. We have to find a place to hide ..."The light Thearch's eyes flickered. He exhaled and nodded."I understand!"Even though the human King was a little teasing and threatening, he was speaking the truth. At most, he, neo martial, could just run away now.Emperor Cang is here!But could light run?They couldn't escape. Unless they completely left the great Dao universe and abandoned the world, where else could they run to?The radiance Supreme Emperor took a deep breath."Our realm has stored a lot of great Dao crystals over the years. If we take them, we can take out three to five billion. They're all great Dao crystals of the radiance path and can be considered as the Supreme yang power ... Human King, do you think it's enough?"Three to five billion!Was it too little?Not a bit less!The human King touched his chin. Upon seeing this, the light Thearch said,""My light world still has three uninhabited medium-sized worlds and twelve uninhabited small worlds ... If necessary, we can also let neo martial devour them together!"Is that enough?"Let's try!"The human King laughed.Is that enough?With Chi Yang, it was almost enough.The key problem was ... It didn't look like he was rich.His inner world probably had no hope of advancing to the eighth step.

3313 Chapter 538
What a pity!Come to think of it, the four-sided domain did not only have a glutton like new martial, but also silver Moon!That kid Silvermoon had also eaten a whole bunch of worlds.Also, the Dragon Lord's side was full of people who ate people without spitting out their bones. The square region was so small that it wasn't enough for the three families to eat!With the yin-yang world, he should have no problem reaching level eight.The problem was that many sixth rank venerable sovereigns did not have the energy to advance to the seventh rank.Heavenly King Zhen and the others had long reached the standard of the seventh rank ... However, just like venerable the sword, all of them had to eat the seventh rank world. Where would they get so many seventh rank worlds to eat?The human King was also very helpless!Now, the rank Seven Worlds are hiding deeper and deeper. Only those guys from the Dragon field and the Dragon Lord are together. Do you dare to fight them now?The human King was also having a headache.Soon, he stopped thinking about it and said,'big cat, go and swallow the power of the red sun! If it's not enough, I'll eat brother Guangming's as well. "At this point, the human King stroked his chin and smiled,""On our side, let's count it as four rank-8s. As for rank-7s, there are currently four from the light, and six from the neo martial arts, which means ten rank-7s and four rank-8s.""I think there were seven rank-7s on the Dragon Lord's side. Including the original ones, there are 14 rank-7s and two rank-8s ..."In comparison, the difference didn't seem too great.In fact, there were even more level 8 ones here!However, the human King knew that even if he had advanced, there was a high chance that it would be difficult for him and the big cat to match the Dragon Lord even if they joined forces. It would not be a problem for them to hold out for a while.Light and Wushan could definitely deal with Red Moon if they joined forces ... But the Dragon Lord had killed two rank eights before. Perhaps he would take the opportunity to cast another rank eight, and that would be hard to say.At that time, if the gap between the two sides wasn't big, it would be easy for both sides to suffer losses if they fought.At this moment, the Supreme martial artist said,"Li Hao's team was able to ambush and kill so many venerable sovereigns, annihilate the five chaotic worlds, and kill 11 Level Seven venerable sovereigns. They're not weak and can't be underestimated. At this moment, the Dragon Lord is indeed the biggest threat to the four-sided domain ... Should we look for them? if we can join forces ... We won't have to worry about the Dragon Lord!"As for the rank 7 Masters of the four-square region, they didn't even think about joining the Alliance. They were unreliable! There were also many venerable sovereigns in the demon race's five worlds ... But at this moment, the demon race's five worlds did not dare to act rashly. Of course, the Dragon Lord had not dealt with them yet.The Dragon Lord might still be digesting what he had obtained and might also be worried that dealing with the demon race would cause new martial and silver Moon to join forces to attack him. It just so happened that one of these two parties was in the Thunder region while the other was in the sky with the demon race in the middle.When attacking the demons, both sides would be drawn out. That would be a monstrous battle!It might even be the final battle in the four-sided domain!Whoever won would be the final Overlord of the four-sided domain. Of course, it was also possible that the four-sided domain had perished together and suffered too many casualties. Some venerable sovereigns from the outside world might enter. Even if they didn't bring a world, they might be able to break the four-sided domain with enough numbers.When the human King heard the Grandmaster's words, he nodded slightly. This was also true!Silver Moon was nothing in the past, but now, his strength was not to be underestimated.Li Hao could definitely kill a level Seven now. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to deal such a heavy blow to his opponent this time. Guangming's son had probably reached Level Seven as well, and it was said that there was also a level Seven Lightning Mage. And Dao Qi had run away earlier, probably to Li Hao's side ...This way, he was not weak!At this moment, the big cat, who had been squinting, suddenly yawned and said lazily,""Second cat has completely arrived!"The blood Emperor was stunned by his words.He looked at bigcat, who yawned again.""Second cat and I ... Have lost contact."The connection was cut off!It was not to deepen the connection.The two cats from before were still its projection. It was the real one, and the two cats were just illusions.But this time, when it walked out, big cat realized that it had lost contact with second cat.This also meant that ... Second cat had become a real living creature.In the past, the two cats were considered one.Today, they could be considered brothers, but they were no longer as closely connected as before. When second cat recovered, big cat could clearly sense that the other had recovered.This time, he didn't feel that way.He was a little disappointed, but he was also happy for second cat.""I still owe er Mao some dried fish. It's a pity that I haven't met him ... Now that he's gone with the new king of the Silver Moon, I don't know how long it'll be before we meet again."At that moment, the blood Emperor's eyes flickered.""Second cat is resurrected ... Completely resurrected?""Yes." Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ "It's good ..."The blood Emperor suddenly took a deep breath and said,""I want to go to the Thunder region to see second cat and the new king of Silver Moon, Li Hao. On one hand, we can talk about the Alliance. If we can form an alliance, I and silver Moon will have a natural advantage ... There's no need to fight alone!""Second, I want to meet them ..." He said.The blood Emperor looked into the distance and said after a long time,""It's also a true farewell to the Silver Moon world ... Second cat has been resurrected. This means that he has found a new home. I feel much more at ease."Everyone said that he was Zhan's reincarnation.However ... Would he reincarnate?He was just a part of Zhan's will and energy. It was scattered between heaven and earth, and it was gathered into a special power that forged his strength. However, he was not Zhan's reincarnation.

If he was, the human King was, then the entire Silver Moon should be.However ... No matter what, he had received benefits from the battle. Since second cat had resurrected, he had to go and see.At this moment, the Grandmaster stroked his beard and laughed,""That's fine! It's not bad that you're going ... You left heaven battling city there years ago, and it's said that you're working well with Li Hao. Some people in heaven battling city seem to be Silver moon's core forces ... In addition to your relationship with second cat, you and Li Hao ... If we really have to say it, you have some connection ...""Silver Moon is our natural ally. With the Dragon Lord's strength in the four-direction region, it would be best if we could work together!""However, if the Thunder World leaves the Thunder region, you might not be able to find them ...""It's hard to locate Silver Moon now, but ... That Zhang an brat is still there ...""No need!"The blood Emperor shook his head and said,"the spiritual will of the two words" fighting the heavens "that I left behind in the past is still in the Silver Moon, and it still exists to this day!" I want to find him. If I can find him, it'll be fine as long as he doesn't deliberately hide from me. If he really wants to avoid me ... Then he'll disappear!""Then you should absorb the world's energy as soon as possible and step into the 8th rank," he said, looking at the human King."You'll lose face if Silvermoon really surpasses you. "The human King laughed out loud,"old Wang, what are you saying? do you think I'm afraid of being surpassed?" Besides ... So what if this kid really reached the seventh or eighth level? It's just that my inner world hasn't been strengthened to the eighth step ... Otherwise, when I've really reached the eighth step, the Dragon Lord would be nothing!"The blood Emperor laughed. Although he said that, he knew that Fang ping must be under some pressure.Even though neo martial artists were also very young.However, a thousand years later, if he were to be surpassed by a King of the later generation of The Lost World of neo martial artists ... Fang ping would probably want to die."I'll help you take a look and ask about the situation ...""Come on!"The human King chuckled,"as long as that kid doesn't break his old technique, he won't be worthy of my attention!" This is the truth. It's fine if he doesn't ask anything, but if he really wants to surpass me ... Pass on my words to him!"The blood Emperor nodded thoughtfully.He knew what Fang ping meant.Although Fang ping had also inherited the DAOs and paths of many seniors, in the end, under yin and yang, he had still walked out of his own Dao, walked out of his own world Dao.If Li Hao did not go to battle, Fang ping probably would not care too much about the impact, even if he was strong."Alright, then I'll ... Take a detour!"At this moment, monarch Wushan suddenly said,""That ... How about ... I go with you?" he asked. The human King turned his head to look, and monarch Wushan felt a little awkward.He knew that it was all thanks to the help of neo martial arts that he was able to enter level eight this time. However, when he was with this group of people from neo martial, he ... Was actually a little depressed and stressed.Neo martial's human King was unparalleled in his overbearing manner!The Supreme of new martial arts had calculated everything.Even a level eight venerable sovereign would feel some pressure in front of these two. He didn't like this kind of pressure. This kind of pressure ... Was even greater than the pressure he felt when he was working in Yunxiao.On the other hand, Li Hao was not as strong as the human King. On the other hand, Li Hao's personality was different from the human King 's. In comparison, Li Hao was much more indifferent and rarely gave orders.If they got along, they would chat more. If they didn 't, they would chat less or simply go their separate ways.In neo martial arts, one would feel that they were nothing under the shroud of the human King and Supreme martial artist. In Silver Moon ... At the very least, he felt that he was not too weak, too stupid, or too stupid. Even if Li Hao also liked to set things up, there were at least some traces to follow. On the other hand, human Kings and Supremes were like bold and imaginative horses.It was just that ... After all, he had entered level eight with the help of the neo martial artist. Although he had previously resisted a level eight and defeated Chi Yang ... He was still a little embarrassed at the moment.Moreover, the Dragon Lord's side was a huge threat ...Just as he was thinking, the human King chuckled and said,"you're leaving?" Alright, let's go! The Dragon Lord might enter the Thunder region to hunt him down. He has offended you very badly. If you go, you can take care of him!""This ..." Wu Shan was a little embarrassed.He was a little embarrassed.The human King didn't seem to mind. He smiled and said,""It's fine if you go. You're not my neo martial artist, so you don't need to listen to me! Besides, Silvermoon is not my enemy. If you want to go to the Dragon Lord's side, I'll just cut you to death with a single strike. Since you're not going there ... It's up to you!"Wu Shan took a deep breath and cupped his fists. "Don't worry, human King. I won't do anything to neo martial artist ... Today, Wushan can enter the eighth stage thanks to the help of neo martial artist! If new martial arts had any requests, Wushan would definitely agree! It's just that ... The new martial artists are strong, the Supreme martial artist's plan is flawless, and his combat strength is unparalleled. He's not lacking me. Silver Moon might be in a more difficult position now, so I ... Will take my leave!" p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Even if he had left, this side was not weak.When the human King and the others entered the eighth rank, there was still light. In addition, a Supreme martial artist should not be underestimated. Wushan felt that even if he was at the eighth rank, he might not necessarily be stronger than a neo martial Supreme!With such strength, he would not collapse even if he was not around.Silver Moon might need him more.At this time, the Grandmaster also laughed."Daoist Wushan, you don't have to be so polite. We're just helping each other. There are very few cultivators who can be acknowledged by both the human King and the Silver Moon King. If you see the Silver Moon King, please convey some of my thoughts ... If he has left the outer region, you can go and take a look at the Twin universes ... There's a high chance that we won't leave right now, because the world of light is not suitable for moving at the moment ..."

He had always had an idea about twin universes.But now, the new martial artists could leave at any time. However, once they left, unless the light Thearch abandoned the world, they could only stay here and be beaten!If he had the confidence and time, he could go and take a look at Li Hao.Two eighth-tier universes!If Li Hao and the others had not killed a large number of rank seven venerable sovereigns, he would not have mentioned it. Even if one rank eight and two rank seven venerable sovereigns had died, there should still be more rank seven and one rank eight.It would be very difficult to take it down!However, with Wu Shan, the blood Emperor, and Li Hao's original power, they might be able to conquer an eighth-tier universe!That would be rich!Monarch Wushan was stunned. Was this ... Appropriate?Grandmaster smiled and said,"it's fine, it's just a small token of my appreciation. But whether he can take it down or not, it's up to him!" Also, my grandson will be there, so I need him to take care of him!"With that, a jade pendant flew towards Wu Shan."This jade pendant can locate that level eight venerable sovereign's position, but it might not be the location of the level eight universe."Wu Shan nodded and accepted the jade pendant. He was also impressed. It was unbelievable that this person had locked onto the level eight venerable sovereign!After a while, Wu Shan and the blood Emperor did not say anything. They quickly entered the void and disappeared from the world of light. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  ……At the same time.In the Dragon field.The seven great worlds surrounded the primordial chaos.In the dragon world, 14 seventh rank venerable sovereigns were seated in two rows.Red Moon sovereign was a rank eight sovereign after all. At this moment, she also sat down below the Dragon Master. On the other side was Feng Yan, who was at the peak of rank six. At this moment, Feng Yan was somewhat dazed.The Dragon Lord's expression was cold and solemn, somewhat imposing.The Dragon Master did not say anything more. He looked at the crowd and surveyed the surroundings before slowly saying,""This time, the responsibility lies with me. I was too greedy!"Yes, he was greedy.If he had not been greedy and knew that two seventh rank venerable sovereigns had died, he would have come out long ago instead of waiting to kill Yun Xiao and the others because he was greedy!"Dragon Lord, it's US ..." The Dragon Lord raised his hand and interrupted the black Tiger's words. He said indifferently,""If it's my fault, then it's my fault! When longxuan died, I sensed it. At that time, I was confident that I could walk out of tianfang. However, considering the attraction of a rank 8 four-way domain to me, I chose to give up and leave ... That's why we're in this situation today!"The Dragon Lord didn't give the crowd a chance to speak. He looked at them and said,""The death of the firephoenix and the others is both a disaster and a motivation for our race! Black Tiger, Qingqiu, you have done a good job by preserving your strength ... Under the enemy's scheme, even when they might have used the power of time, I am already very satisfied that you were able to preserve a large number of experts ..."Flowing time!Everyone was startled. They did not say anything about Shi Guang because they could not really tell.How did the Dragon Lord know?The red moon master was also shocked. The Dragon Master said calmly,""I've made a few mistakes. Now that I think about it, the Phoenix and the Black Dog were Li Hao, weren't they?"He looked at Feng Yan, who was a little dazed, but still nodded and gritted his teeth.""It's him!"The Dragon Master sighed."Actually, I sensed something unusual that day. I thought it was caused by faith. I only understood today ... That shouldn't be faith. According to what you said, I guess ... It's highly likely to be the legendary time!""The person I met that day should be Li Hao!"It was a pity.Of course, he only thought about it. If he missed it, he missed it."As for the cultivator you mentioned who could cut off the Dao of chaos, I have some understanding of him. He was the human cultivator of faith who escaped that day ... This is also my third mistake. I was in a hurry to go to Tian Fang and didn't pursue him!"He actually had a few chances, but he had missed them all. He could have killed Li Hao, and he could have killed the Queen ... However, neo martial was the only one in his heart at the time, and he had underestimated Silver Moon, resulting in the current situation.He didn't continue talking about this and said,""I killed Yun Xiao, an eighth-rank venerable sovereign from the outside world, and two seventh-rank venerable sovereigns ..."He looked at the crowd,'I'm already at the peak of level 8. It's almost impossible to count on them to let me enter level 9! Feng Yan, I hope you can reach rank seven and add another rank seven venerable sovereign to the chaos clan!""As for the power of two rank eight venerable sovereigns ..."He looked at the crowd and finally at Thearch Black Tiger.""Black Tiger, among all the powerhouses, you and Qingqiu both have a chance of entering the 8th tier ..."At this moment, Black Tiger Imperial venerable's eyes were red."Dragon Master, I'm a sinner ... I ...""No, you're a hero!"The Dragon Master was solemn."You should have died there. I know you. However, you were entrusted by the fire Phoenix to bring back Feng Yan. You gave up the honor of dying on the battlefield and became a deserter. You watched as your cultivation partner self-destructed to buy you more time ... I know you must be very upset!"The black Tiger emperor trembled a little but said nothing.The Dragon Lord understands me!"So ... What I want is your grief, despair, anger, and crazy faith! "You have to take revenge for those chaos race experts who died in battle. You have to take revenge for your Dao partner. Two eighth-rank powerhouses aren't really suitable for you ... It'll actually be very difficult for you to reach the eighth rank ... But I believe that you'll use this anger and madness to break through to the eighth rank! You'll become the second rank eight venerable sovereign of our chaos race!"The black Tiger Imperial venerable stood up instantly. At this moment, he had transformed into his human form. He was covered in black clothes and there were dark clouds above his head. At this moment, he was extremely solemn as he bowed deeply. "I'll definitely live up to your expectations. This time, I'll definitely reach level 8. The next day, I'll behead Li Hao and offer him as a sacrifice to the chaos race for the heroes who died in battle!"

"Alright!"The Dragon Lord nodded. This was a good thing, very good!With this conviction, he would definitely succeed!He then looked at the six world overlords,"this time, everyone has worked hard ... However, I still have a request!."Everyone was solemn, and the green Hill Fox no longer showed off her flirtatiousness."Dragon Lord, please give me your orders!"The Dragon Lord was silent for a moment.After a long time, he spoke slowly,"I want all of you to give up the grade 7 world. Choose the six most outstanding peak Grade 6 experts of the chaos race. Devour the six worlds and try ... To vindicate Grade 7!"His eyes were cold."Everyone, can you all enter my Dragon Realm and give up your own power, the great path universe, and the world?"Red Moon master was shocked!F * ck! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  You dare to say this?To a level Seven venerable sovereign, the world and the universe of the great path were like a perpetual motion machine for energy. With this, they did not need to rely on others, they did not need to be subservient to others, and they did not need to worry about not being able to cultivate strong people ...This was the representative of a Force's leader!Without the great path universe and world, no matter how strong you were, you were just an itinerant cultivator.In the next moment, the six venerable sovereigns shouted in unison,""As the king commands!"The red moon took a deep breath.This Dragon Lord was ... Terrifying.One had to know that when he wanted to subdue a peak Tier 6 Senlan, she had to resist ...This ... It was infuriating to compare people!He also thought that if he really succeeded this time, another six Level 7s would be born. If Feng Yan became a level 7, there would be seven more Level 7s. All of a sudden, his previous losses would be almost made up. If the black Tiger could enter the eighth rank, and he joined them ... This ...Although 11 seventh level venerable sovereigns had died before, if they were really played by the Dragon Lord, they might not be any weaker than before!This guy was truly terrifying.He had told them to give up on the seventh-tier universe, and they had really given up!No one would have thought of this, right? As for the Dragon Master, he revealed a smile at this moment. Following that, his eyes turned cold and sharp."Whether it's neo martial or Silver Moon, they're all very difficult to deal with. However, the five iron-eating worlds also dared to resist. Originally, on account that they were all from the chaos race and the demon race was considered half ... I barely gave them a way out. I didn't expect them to not cherish it!""It seems that after not making a move for so many years, these demons really think that I can't kill them!"At this moment, he looked off into the distance. Over there, the five realms were surrounding him. At this moment, he didn't dare to leave. He just waited there, hoping to become a third party and not be destroyed by the Dragon Lord.Eight rank seven venerable sovereigns!And the five universes.This was not a small amount."Don't worry ... Hongyue, recover your full strength as soon as possible. Black Tiger, when you reach level 8 ... It will be the end of the five worlds!"The black Tiger Imperator instantly became extremely solemn."Black Tiger will definitely reach grade 8 soon!"Revenge!This time, he had to reach level eight and kill all the demons of the five realms. He also had to tear the Silver Moon King into pieces!"Hongyue ... Please put in some effort. Please persuade some human major worlds ..."The Dragon Master chuckled."Neo martial has killed countless venerable sovereigns, and so has Silver Moon. It's the same for the neo martial artist Silver Moon. I didn't kill so many rank-7s in the square region. I only killed three guys from the outer regions and Yunxiao ... Whether I'm more dangerous, or neo martial and silver Moon are more dangerous, they can decide for themselves!""Even if they don't help me, I can't let neo martial win me over!"There were at least 20 to 30 free human worlds in the four-sided domain, and that was what they knew. There might be more.Even if these great worlds did not help him, they could not be roped in by people like Fang ping and Li Hao.It wasn't convenient for him to show up, but Hong Yue ... Could.This fellow was also a veteran rank eight venerable sovereign. Like the light venerable sovereign, he was one of the only two overlords in the three regions.Red Moon sovereign was also afraid that staying here would be too stressful. At this moment, he immediately said,""I definitely won't let you down ..."He had already signed the great Dao agreement and the ninth-grade lightning tribulation was waiting on him. He did not dare to take the risk and run away."Then, I'll leave everything to brother Hongyue!" The Dragon Lord laughed."I don't dare, I don't dare ..."Both sides exchanged pleasantries for a while before Hong Yue left. The Dragon Master watched her leave in silence. After a long time, he snorted. This guy was a double-edged sword. If he didn't need him, he would have killed him long ago!He cast his gaze toward the Thunder region in the distance. The power of time is interesting, but how much can you master?[PS: in the eighth round of nucleic acid, I've run out of cigarettes, vegetables, and coffee. Poor Eagle, I'm too weak to write.

Chapter 3317 Lightning Territory (1)
Three days later, Thunder region.Lightning flickered, and the Thunder monarch was undergoing tribulation in the sky.The Tribulation did not belong to the lightning Lord.However, he was also transforming these few days towards level eight. He had cultivated the power of Thunder, and now it was just the right time to fill in the Thunder Power in the region. As for the power of destruction, he had enough power of the great path to neutralize it.The lightning tribulation gradually receded.The Thunder Emperor landed on the ground, and the aura on his body changed. At this moment, he let out a long breath and expelled the destructive power."Congratulations, Thunderlord!"The Thunder monarch raised his head and revealed a smile. He looked at the group of people in front of him ... And laughed."I have to thank the Silver Moon King for his praise. I never thought that this day would come!"Everyone was carrying a sedan chair of flowers.Since the other party was polite, he naturally had to be polite as well.Li Hao didn't continue. He raised his head and looked at the sky."This Thunder region truly lives up to its reputation. If an ordinary region were to stay here for a few days, it would have been destroyed long ago. Only the Thunder World can still hold on ... No wonder the square region doesn't have much contact with the outside world."In the past few days, Thunderbolts had gathered, and there was even an eighth-grade Thunderbolt. Fortunately, the Thunder Emperor had officially entered the eighth-grade and was overseeing the Thunder World, so he was finally able to resist it.In this situation ... There were not many people who would dare to bring a world into the Thunder region.The Thunder Emperor nodded."This is still considered a peaceful period. Previously, because of the primal Chaos lightning tribulation, a lot of the primal Chaos lightning tribulation's power was drawn away. Otherwise, this lightning tribulation would be even more powerful. At its peak, let alone a level eight, even a level nine might not be able to pass.""There are many chaotic lightning pillars nearby," he said."They are the key to the lightning territory. They are even more powerful. A large amount of destructive power is filled in them. The structure of the entire lightning territory is formed by these lightning pillars.""Primal Chaos lightning pillar?""Right!"Li Hao was surprised. He didn't know about this. He nodded slightly.The group of people were all in a good mood at this moment. They were not nervous because they had hidden in the Thunder region. It was better for the Thunder to be stronger. Otherwise, the Dragon Lord would have killed his way in.At this moment, the state of emptiness was stable and the chess pieces were full of energy. This time, second cat landed on the ground. Its four short legs caught the Black Panther's attention.The two Dao Masters were not bad. Although they had yet to reach Level Seven, they had already advanced one level on the path of level six.The Black Panther was also close to the sixth step, but it was still slightly lacking. The main reason was that too much of its World Energy had dissipated. The Thunder World had also devoured quite a bit after advancing.As for Yuan Shuo, he also took the opportunity to step into the 4th rank.Today, Yuan Shuo, Lin Hongyu, the Queen, and a few others had all stepped into the 4th rank. Nan Quan, director Zhou, and a few others were also advancing towards the 4th rank.Almost everyone had an improvement.Not only that, but Silvermoon had also given birth to a few new venerable sovereigns. The world had entered the sixth rank, and there were more spots. Now, even some of the younger generation had begun to advance to venerable sovereigns.On the whole, their strength had increased by a large margin.But for Li Hao, the amount of debt he owed was not small.Er Mao and Kong Ji were both dealt with.  Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  However, on the Dao chess side, he owed more and more. Now, he owed an eighth-tier universe and he owed the human King a seventh-tier universe, but he had not returned it. He had thought that he might be able to get another seventh-tier world ... In the end, he had not expected that he would let the Thunderbolt master devour the two worlds.At that time, the situation was urgent. If the Dragon Lord had not returned and the lightning Lord had reached level eight ... Li Hao was prepared to annihilate all the level-seven chaotic creatures.Unfortunately, he was one step too late.Otherwise, he would have six more worlds.At that time, he would not be lacking in money.As for Li Hao himself, he was still at the sixth step. The Qianjie had appeared without any additional boundaries, but it was completely different from before.The useless firmament sword ... After swallowing so many seventh-rank corpses, it had only advanced to the sixth rank. Li Hao was very disappointed.This guy was too useless.There were so many seventh-grade corpses, and even though the power of DAOs had been lost, you should at least become a seventh-grade sovereign weapon for me to see.In the end, he was only at the sixth step.It was really disheartening!Li Hao didn't continue talking about this. He looked at the Thunderbolt master and asked,""Lightning Emperor, how long will it take to cross the lightning territory?""Under normal circumstances, it'll take fifteen minutes at most if we're fast enough and don't encounter too much danger ... But once we encounter danger, it'll be hard to say. We might even be completely trapped and killed by the lightning domain!"The Thunderbolt master continued,"also, this is only within the Thunder region. If you want to leave, you'll have to pass through some Thunder pillars. In fact, it's also very dangerous. Back then, I wanted to go out and leave with the Thunder World ... In the end, the Thunder pillars erupted and almost destroyed the Thunder World. Therefore, I could only give up and return to the square region."Sighing, the Thunderbolt master felt a little emotional.Of course, that was in the past.And now, he had entered the eighth step!"Fellow Daoist Hao Yue, have you condensed the Dao of destruction?" the Thunderbolt master couldn't help but ask.Li Hao nodded.The Thunderbolt master was a little puzzled."Actually, there are also experts in the Thunder World who have tried to condense the Dao of destruction. However, their resistance to the primal Chaos lightning tribulation was not as strong as imagined. Why does it seem that fellow Daoist is completely unscathed when facing the seventh-grade lightning tribulation?"This was what he was puzzled about.He had to admit that Li Hao was very strong.However ... During the previous tribulations, no one had noticed that Li Hao had been holding off the Thunder tribulation giant the entire time. Second cat had helped the others devour the giant, but not Li Hao.However, the lightning tribulation of the seventh step didn't seem to affect Li Hao much.Why? The reason for the power of destruction?It can't be, right?Li Hao smiled and explained,"it's not just destructive power. It's a type of tribulation power ... There are at least eight thousand chaos lightning tribulations. I think that's the minimum. I've only detected a portion of it, but it's enough for me to absorb a large amount of chaos lightning tribulation power ..."

Chapter 3318 Lightning Territory (2)
"The lightning Lord has also reached level eight," he explained."You should know that the chaos lightning tribulation doesn't only have destruction and lightning!"Hearing this, the Thunderbolt master was stunned. After a long while, he nodded thoughtfully. "That's true. I've thought about it before, but ... I can't split them apart. I only have the lightning element and destruction element ..."Li Hao nodded."It's very difficult to split. I can't split it either."The Thunderbolt master was puzzled. If you can't split it, how are you going to resolve the power within?At this moment, Li Hao was sitting cross-legged on the ground. He did not care if the ground was clean or dirty. The people around him were also interested and sat down one after another. The Thunderbolt master was still not used to it. Seeing that the others had sat down, he stood up and quickly sat down as well."Recently, I've been trying to capture the power of the chaos lightning tribulation and then disintegrate it through time ..." Li Hao explained."When the level Seven lightning tribulation hit me, you didn't notice that I used the star of time. Time is the convergence of thousands of DAOs!""I used time to dismantle the lightning tribulation ... Although it's not too detailed, it's still acceptable. That's why the lightning tribulation's damage to me was limited at that time because I dismantled a part of the power of tribulation!"Although Li Hao hadn't gone out yet, he had some thoughts. He continued,""The lightning territory should have been set up by a powerful being. It should be a stage nine expert, the master of tianfang, or the Dao master of calamity ... The chaos lightning tribulation here might not be the lightning tribulation of order from the chaos. It might have been man-made.""Calamity Dao master?"Thunderlord was stunned. Who?Li Hao explained,"it's just a guess. I mean, I was wondering why the chaos lightning tribulation could gather here. You also said that a large number of lightning pillars exist here, giving birth to the chaos lightning tribulation. So, I think the lightning pillar should be Dao GE!""What?"The Thunderbolt master was at a loss and did not understand."What?" Dao chess was slightly stunned."You're saying ... The Thunder region is also a monarch weapon similar to the Dao chess? each pillar represents a great Dao and forms the power of calamity?""Yes." Li Hao nodded."I'm just speculating based on what the Thunderbolt master said. Why is the chaos lightning tribulation here?" It's impossible for there to always be an existence that challenges The Order of Chaos here, right? "There are two possibilities. First, this place can give birth to Primal Chaos lightning tribulations by itself, which is caused by these lightning pillars. Lightning pillars are actually a great Dao in the Dao net. There are at least 8000 lightning pillars in the entire lightning territory!" "Secondly, there is a peerless expert here. He might even be an expert in the Dao of time or the Dao of two extremes. He has been displaying his Dao domain to attract the chaos lightning tribulation. The possibility is not very high because no one has entered this place and it usually doesn't erupt."Li Hao speculated,'therefore, I'm guessing that this lightning territory is also a place for enlightenment! The square domain is a place of enlightenment for the Dao of calamity. Perhaps another Dao master of the Dao of calamity appeared, or perhaps the master of Tian Fang also knew the Dao of calamity and set up a lightning domain here ... Of course, 8000 is just my guess. I think there might be more than 9000 ... The Dao of space has 9999 great DAOs. In my opinion, this Dao of calamity might not be much worse than the Dao of space. "The Thunderbolt master was a little shaken."You mean to say that this lightning territory is actually a place for people to comprehend the primal Chaos lightning tribulation. Every lightning pillar is a line in the Dao domain network?"As an eighth level venerable sovereign, although he had just advanced, he still had some understanding of the great Dao. Those who did not have any understanding would not be able to become an eighth level venerable sovereign. Best novel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ nσνEℓnєXт  At this moment, he was shocked. He looked at Li Hao suspiciously. You've never been out. Is your conclusion accurate?Li Hao nodded."Otherwise, a Lightning zone wouldn't have appeared out of thin air. What I'm more curious about now is why the square zone is surrounded. Is it because of master tianfang?" Or is there some other reason?""And ..."Li Hao thought for a moment and continued,'the tianfang realm is going to be revived ... Then, is the existence of this lightning territory to protect tianfang? In order to prevent experts from entering, the Thunder region was created. Otherwise, the heaven region would have been torn down by countless experts from the outer regions ..."There were many experts in the four-sided domain, but there were even more experts in the outer domain.Before this, two level eights had come from the outer area. It was impossible for all the experts from the outer area to come. Clearly, there might even be level nine experts from the outer area.Then why didn't he come to the four-sided domain?It might be related to the Thunder region.Li Hao looked outside and said,"I'm interested. I'll go out and investigate. I've been cultivating calamity sword principle recently, but I can only say that it's Destruction Sword principle, not calamity sword principle. If it's as I've speculated, it'll be difficult for the chaos lightning tribulation to hurt me in the future!"He was also annoyed.It's so annoying to flirt with me.If you can comprehend the Dao of tribulation and strike me, I'll just absorb it and it'll be over.I'm also very annoyed by being teased every day.The Thunderbolt master could not help but say,"but now, the Dragon Lord might bring experts into the Thunder region ..."Aren't we going to consider running?You still have the mood to stay here?He actually wanted to go to the outer region."The four-sided domain has trapped him for too many years. He's tired of it. He's been living too miserably here. When I get out, I'll be a good man again. No one knows my sad past. They only know that I'm an eighth level venerable sovereign!"

Chapter 3319 Lightning Territory (3)
He wanted to be a respected expert.In the Dragon field, he had lost too much face and was suppressed every day.Li Hao made a judgment and said,"it won't be that fast. I'm not very familiar with the Dragon Lord, but this person must have planned before taking action. He's an Overlord and a hero. You can tell from the experts under his command." At this stage, if nothing goes wrong, he will first pacify the experts under him. Even if he wants to fight ... He will not attack me first, but the demons!""Demon race?"The Thunderbolt master couldn't help but say,"we've killed so many of his subordinates. The fire Phoenix was even one of his Dao companions ... Do you think he'll attack the demons first and not us?""It must be the demon race!"Li Hao concluded,"on my side, you've devoured two big worlds, so you might have reached rank-8. He should already know that. As for me, I've used time. With his power, he didn't guess it before, but he did this time. In addition, neo martial arts is eyeing us covetously ... I don't know the situation of Yunxiao and the others, but they shouldn't be a big problem anymore ... Then us and neo martial arts are the biggest trouble!"Of course, he had to eliminate the less threatening ones first. At the same time, he could strengthen his own forces. Although there were eight rank seven venerable sovereigns in the five realms of the monster race ... To be honest, if the Dragon Lord came, some of the strong monsters might surrender. Only the three great experts of the iron-eating world were determined to resist.He could tell from the chaos beasts that he had been chasing earlier that some of them were not very willing to pursue him. They had only wanted to delay him for a while, but they had been forced by the iron eater Thearch. Otherwise, they would not have resisted.Therefore, the eight seventh rank venerable sovereigns of the monster race were actually the easiest to break through.If it was me, I would also fight the demons first!Thunderlord was deep in thought and nodded."So, you mean ... We should go out and take a look first. If we can comprehend the chaos lightning tribulation ... We'll think of a way out?"Li Hao nodded."That's what I'm thinking ... Of course, if the Thunderbolt master wants to go out, or if you feel that it's dangerous to stay here for too long, you can take the Thunder World out first.""How could that be!"The Thunder monarch immediately said,"we are now considered as one ... Besides, I entered level eight all thanks to you. How could I leave alone?"Li Hao smiled."Thunderlord, you're too polite. We're both taking what we need. You don't owe me anything. This time, we're just cooperating. I've always hoped that the fellow Daoists who cooperate with me will gain something ... And not nothing.""Of course, it'll be even better if the lightning Emperor doesn't leave," he said."I'm actually not very proficient in the lightning element. It's one of the most important DAOs in the primal Chaos tribulation lightning ... With the help of the lightning Lord, it'll be easier for me to approach the lightning pillar and comprehend the power of the primal Chaos tribulation lightning ... Otherwise, there'll be some trouble.""Duty-bound!" The Thunderbolt master immediately spoke. This was just a small matter.Since the other party wanted to comprehend the power of the Tribulation lightning, he could only accompany him.At this moment, he was a little sad.At such a critical moment, Li Hao still went to seek enlightenment. He didn't know if Li Hao was confident or arrogant, or ... In his eyes, enlightenment was necessary for cultivation. Killing and seizing realms were just a process.Who knows?At this moment, Li Hao looked at the two Dao Masters.""You two, come with me ..."The two of them were slightly stunned. Are we going too?Li Hao explained,"let's dig out the potential of the Silver Moon great Dao. The Silver Moon is an intersection of the Dao of virtual and the Dao of reality. However, neither of the two DAOs is too special. In fact, they do exist. The real Dao is based on the Dao of sword, while the virtual Dao is based on emotions ... However, they are not as obvious as yin and yang ...""I don't know if you guys remember, but when the power of the Crimson Moon invaded the Silver Moon universe, it triggered a great Dao lightning ..." Li Hao added after some thought. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Everyone nodded. Of course they remembered.However ... Qian Wuliang said in a low voice,"my Lord, that is the result of the universe rejecting the DAOs from the outside ...""That's right. Regardless of whether it's repelled or not, does this mean that the Dao of lightning actually occupies an important part in the great Dao universe and my Silvermoon Dao? it's also a kind of punishment power ... But why don't I have a powerful lightning cultivator?"Silver moon's Dao was all-encompassing, and there were all sorts of great DAOs.However, not many people cultivated the way of lightning.Actually, there was ... Back then, Ying Hongyue had actually cultivated the Dao of lightning. After Ying Hongyue was killed, almost no one in the entire Silver Moon cultivated the Dao of lightning anymore.Li Hao continued."The Dao of Silver Moon has always been inferior to the new martial art, Yin Yang. Emperor Cang and the human King can borrow each other's strength, but they can also separate from each other. It's very easy to merge them, and it's also very easy to separate them ... However, the two of you are not as good as them in merging or in separating.""Silver moon's Dao is currently lacking a core ..."Li Hao pondered for a moment and continued,"the Black Panther has inherited a part of the demon subduer's abilities ... Demon subduers also have the power of the lightning element. Their single horn can release lightning. They are extremely powerful! Right now, I have some ideas. I want to completely merge the world and the two DAOs into a dual Dao ring world! As for the Silvermoon world, I hope that Black Panther can cultivate the power of tribulation lightning. With this as the core, he can fuse the two Dao universes into a Trinity!""Qian Wuliang is in charge of the spiritual world, senior uncle Hong is in charge of the elemental world, and black Panther is in charge of the order ... The Thunder tribulation is a kind of order. The power of tribulation actually brings order instead of tribulation!"
