        o silver Moon martial masters erupted, the battle situation changed.
         The powerful Martial Master once again proved that the Martial Master was the master of this land!
         However, martial masters also seemed to have some flaws and drawbacks. Or rather, because there was no road, these powerhouses who opened up the path all had problems.
         He locked down his strength and didn't dare to release it easily.
         Usually, he would either lay low or show his weakness to others.
         It wasn't that he didn't want to risk his life, but that he couldn 't. If he did, it would mean that all his years of hard work would be destroyed.
         At this moment, the southern Fist and the earth overturning sword quickly rushed toward Li Hao.
         They were not afraid that the four demons would escape, nor were they afraid that they would wait for the two of them to completely break their superpower lock ... When that time came, even if their futures were ruined, their combat strength would skyrocket. At that moment, perhaps the four demons would die an easier death.
         At this moment, the four great demons actually understood that suppressing these two people was the best way.
         Don't force the two to unseal their combat strength.
          Otherwise, it would only result in both sides suffering.
         They even hoped that the weak Martial Master in the distance could help these two suppress their explosive strength. Otherwise ... A battle was inevitable!
         ……
         The southern Fist was even more anxious than the earth overturning sword.
         Hong Yitang's five internal organs were only severely damaged, but he was different. He was not injured, but he was about to become a super. This was not the result he wanted, so he was even faster than Hong Yitang!
         In the blink of an eye, he was in front of Li Hao.
         His anger had reached its peak and he was about to become a superpower. Nan Quan shouted,""How? Can you do it? If you can't ... I'll beat those four bastards to death!"
         He was going crazy!
         For so many years, in order to walk this path, in order to strengthen his qi and blood, the price he had paid, the hardships he had paid, no one could understand.
         Only they themselves knew how many obstacles there were on this road.
         Along the way, he had overcome many obstacles and narrowly escaped death many times.
         There was no way ahead!
         That kind of despair forced them to go their separate ways to find their final destination on this martial path. And now ... He was going to become a super.
         Nan Quan's body was covered in blood, and his eyes were filled with desire and urgency.
         Could the Super Lock that was about to break completely recover?
         As for the blood God ... It was only a sunguang-level Blood God. It was useless and could not restore his superpower lock.
         At this moment, Li Hao also felt a wave of heat!
         It was the power of fire energy.
         He could even feel Nan Quan's heart shattering. If he were to convert his power ... He might not necessarily succeed. His heart might not be able to take it and explode.
         He knew that these people's internal organs weren't strong.
          The southern Fist and Hong Yitang were actually trying to scare people. If this continued, they might explode with even stronger strength, or maybe ... They would die from their internal organs exploding.  It was a 50 - 50 chance, but if he gambled on the four great demons, he might die.
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He quickly activated the five birds breathing technique. A sword energy entered his body and then passed on to Nan Quan. A powerful force swept over, almost making Li Hao vomit blood!
         Li Hao was dumbstruck by the vigorous qi and blood!
         This blood Qi ... Was too powerful!
         Was this the power to beat up a top-tier great demon?
         Three blood changes?
         My ass!
         He suspected that Nanquan had done it more than 10 times. What a terrifying guy.
         "Junior Master he, try to absorb it into your heart. Is the superpower lock broken?"
         "No..."
         Nan Quan didn't say much and quickly absorbed the energy. He didn't know what kind of energy it was, so he didn't care. He would try to absorb it first. The sword energy quickly entered his body. The next moment, Nan Quan's eyes lit up, but they quickly dimmed. "It's useful ... It's like trying to put out a cart of firewood with a cup of water!"
         A cup of water on a burning cart of firewood!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao's expression changed slightly. He had just absorbed an origin god weapon, which was when the sword energy was at its peak. He had actually input quite a bit, but he wasn't too stingy.
         However, the southern Fist actually said that it was like a cup of water on a burning cart of firewood!
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He quickly extracted the sword energy and poured it into Nan Quan's body. Nan Quan absorbed it crazily and compressed it into his heart. He knew how to strengthen the Super Lock without Li Hao's guidance.
         However, after a while, flames appeared on his body again. Nan Quan was so anxious that he was sweating profusely."No... That's too little ..."
         Li Hao was stupefied.
         It was too little.
         He had already tried his best to transfer a large amount of sword energy into the other party's body. He was even more generous than his own teacher. This could only mean that the Super Lock of the southern Fist was too powerful!
          Li Hao didn't say anything. He just took out eight divine power stones from his storage ring.
         Then, he took out the storage rings one by one and found the divine power stones.
         As he searched, he continued to type into Southern Fist's keyboard.
         ? The sword energy of an origin god weapon was still a lot.
         A large amount of sword energy surged into Nan Quan's body, gradually suppressing his anger. Although there were still sparks, he could barely keep his condition from getting worse.
         Li Hao didn't even blink. At this moment, the 16 three suns had provided him with a large number of divine power stones. He estimated that there were at least 100 of them, which was the most divine power stones Li Hao had ever seen.
         He crushed all the divine power stones in an instant.
         In the blink of an eye, he was wrapped in the energy of the divine power stones. Nan Quan's expression changed slightly. Even for him, this amount of divine power stones was not a small number. Li Hao, this kid ...
         At this moment, his feelings were very complicated, but he didn't say anything.
         After a while, Hong Yitang arrived. He kept coughing blood, but he wasn't in a hurry to stop Nan Quan. Nan Quan's condition was more serious than his. He only had internal injuries, but Nan Quan was about to become a superpower. Naturally, he would let Nan Quan Do it first.
        
         He quickly looked through the storage rings. There were quite a lot of divine power stones in the storage rings of two sunguang and a powerhouse at the peak of the three-sun realm.
         This was especially so for the Samsara King and Banshan, who were both wealthy.
         Tsunami, on the other hand, was very poor.
         The Samsara King and Banshan were both leaders of their respective regions. At this moment, Hong Yitang had actually found close to 200 divine power stones. As for tsunami ... He only had around 30 divine power stones on his entire body.
         Pauper!
         p Xuguang was actually so poor!  Hong Yitang threw the divine power Stone and the wind chime on the ground.
         He didn't stop and instantly rushed towards the broken mountain in the distance.
         "Roar!"
         The four demon beasts followed closely behind and landed on the ground. Hong Yitang coughed continuously as blood flowed from the corner of his mouth. He held a long black sword and looked at the few demons."The divine power stones ... All of them! Also, in this Valley ... That Lotus ... I want half ..."
          At this moment, he saw the Golden Lotus. It was no longer green, but golden.
         He revealed a smile,"I've already said that I'm just passing by, but I have to fight!" Now, both sides have suffered great losses ... You've paid the price of the divine power stones and half of this lotus flower, and we ... If we can't stop the deterioration, then ... What the consequences will be ... Cough cough ... You know very well!"
         In fact, the four demons were also very sullen.
         "At this point, everyone has suffered heavy losses and it's not beneficial to anyone, but ... Who knew you were so powerful? if I had known, I wouldn't have killed them.
         At this moment, he thought of that person again.
         Martial Master ...
         Were all Silver moon's martial masters this terrifying?
         "I can give you the divine power Stone ... If it's enough to restore your seal, then ..." The Golden Eagle's psyche fluctuated.
         It wanted to ask if it could refuse the Golden Lotus.
         This was too important!
         Hong Yitang smiled and didn't say anything. He just looked at the four demons.
         The ferocious Tiger's eyes flashed with ferocity.
         The giant ape glanced at Nan Quan in the distance and was also eager to make a move.
         Hong Yitang chuckled and didn't say anything. He pointed his sword at the Golden Eagle."Now, immediately! Don't think that it's a good thing for you to drag this on. If you drag this on ... With such a huge commotion, perhaps ... A surprise will be waiting for you! There were countless monsters in the Cang Mountain, but how many of them dared to enter the Silver Moon land? Do you want to try it today?"
         As soon as he said this, the Golden Condor's huge eyes flashed with a sharp light. It no longer said anything and flew down.
         A claw grabbed the Golden Lotus that had already bloomed.
         There were eight petals, but there were only six Golden Lotus seeds.
         The Golden Eagle flew up, and four petals and three Golden Lotus seeds flew towards him. The fluctuation rose again."This isn't a treasure that can strengthen one's qi and blood. It might not be of any use to you ... If it's useless ... We hope that we can exchange it for other treasures in the future!"  The Golden Condor felt that they had no use for this thing. It was too wasteful.
         This wasn't a treasure that could strengthen one's qi and blood or physical body. This was the heavenly Golden Lotus, a special type of treasure that specialized in enhancing one's mind and spirit. It was a treasure that could awaken one's intelligence.
         "Cough cough ..."
         Hong Yitang laughed. He looked at the treasure in his hand and said,""How can it be useless? Do you think I'm that bumpkin from the southern Fist? Wasn't this ... Something that could strengthen one's divine intent? There were records of Golden Lotus petals in the ancient books, but he had never heard of lotus seeds. Was it this thing? It has eight petals, but according to the ancient records, it lives in a very special sea ..."
         He glanced at the small lake below and smiled.""This Lake is not ordinary! Under normal circumstances, this treasure shouldn't be growing here ... But it has nothing to do with me. Since that's the case, today's battle is over!"
         The Golden Condor and the other demons were silent.
         Seeing Hong Yitang fly away, the Tiger suddenly said,""Is that devil still alive?"
         "Of course!"
         Hong Yitang laughed."Although he's been locked up for decades and has fallen behind, I believe that he'll soar to the top soon. Although he's too arrogant, I have to say that he's extremely talented. Soon ... You might meet him!"
         The eyes of the greater demons changed.
         He was still alive!
         Among the thirty-six people, that person was the strongest. Today, one of the seven crippled swords he spoke of, one of the two North and South breaking fists, both displayed incomparably powerful strength and were extremely terrifying!
         Then ... What about the devil?
         The swordsman said that the person had fallen behind, but even if he did, he would still catch up.
         Also, of the 36 Silver Moon experts, only two were so strong. How many more of them were there in the Silver Moon land?
         "Are you the strongest among the thirty-six?"
         The Golden Eagle suddenly asked.
          Hong Yitang laughed."I don't know. You can go and try and ask. I only know that sky sword and BA Dao are quite powerful. The southern Fist is probably not as good as them, and I don't know where the northern fist is. The Golden spear is probably not as good as mine ... As for the rest, you can go and ask one by one."
         “……”
         Silence.
         Sky sword, Overlord blade ...
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At this moment, even the greater demons were silent.
         Didn't they say that the martial masters in the land of Silver Moon were completely silent?
         Was this their so-called silence?
         "Oh, I forgot to mention, there's one person who's definitely extremely strong!"
         "Ying Hongyue is the master of the water energy Sunglow ..."
         Hong Yitang suddenly laughed."You guys can go and play with him. That guy, let me think, if he had been preparing all this time, now ... He would probably punch you guys one by one."
        
         The four demons fell silent again.
         Ying Hongyue!
         "That guy is very, very strong ... However, he might be waiting for the right time. He might be the same as me now, but he is definitely stronger than me. I may be lacking something, but he may not!"
         Hong Yitang laughed and left.
         Among the 36 heroes, the strongest one was probably Ying Hongyue. He didn't lack clones of the blood God, so he might have fixed some of his flaws long ago.
         ……
         In the distance.
         Li Hao continued to absorb the sword energy, and the flame on Nan Quan's body gradually extinguished. However, it was still a little off. Li Hao continued to let the sword energy spread. After a while, Li Hao withdrew his hand.
         "That's all?"Nan Quan was anxious.
         "Yes."
          Li Hao nodded."Uncle-master he's Super Lock is almost ready. Uncle-master Hong's internal organs are almost shattered. Let's heal uncle-master Hong first."
         "I ..."
         Nanquan wanted to say something but stopped. He could control the superpower lock now, but ... It was so fragile. He wanted to absorb more.
         However, seeing that Hong Yitang had returned, he could only shut his mouth.
         Forget it, this guy is about to die. If I ask for more, I might be struck to death by him.
         At this moment, he was quite satisfied, but ... He was still a little confused and shocked. What exactly was Li Hao's energy?
         It could actually be fused with the superpower lock and repaired quickly.
         He was too strong!
         The fact that Yuan Shuo was able to recover from his injuries, break through the thousand-warrior tier, and enter the spirit accumulation stage so quickly must have something to do with this special energy.
         Just as he was thinking about this, Hong Yitang returned. He glanced at Nan Quan and coughed."What are you thinking about?"
         "No, I didn 't,"
         "You have a crooked idea?"
         "How is that possible?"
         "Are you looking down on my character?" Nan Quan was furious.
         "You have a personality?"
         Hong Yitang laughed,'where did you get your personality from? You're already a slave to the royal family, and you still have character?"
         Nan Quan snorted,"cut the crap!" You're better than me?"
         "Of course, at least I'm not a slave to the royal family!"
         "Hmph!"
         "Hmph, that's the truth,"
          Hong Yitang coughed for a while and looked at Li Hao, his eyes flickering.""Why did you suddenly think of helping us? Why don't you let us fight the four monsters to the end and pick up a pile of treasures and the corpses of several experts? if we kill the four monsters, we might all die, and then all the treasures will be yours!"  Once that happened, Li Hao could be said to have reached the sky in a single bound.
         The corpses of two extremely powerful martial masters, four extremely powerful monsters, a complete Golden Lotus, origin divine weapons, divine power stones ...
         The probability was not small.
         If it really exploded, Hong Yitang might not be able to control it.
         Li Hao glanced at him, thought for a moment, and said,""Emotions."
         "Emotions?"
         The two of them were slightly stunned. What emotions?
         "My teacher's emotions."
         Li Hao's face was calm."My teacher told me one day that he had no hope of becoming a universe master in this lifetime. His heart was damaged, so he decided to retire in the Silver City. If he couldn 't, he would unleash his power one last time and kill those attacking Crimson Moon supers."
         Li Hao laughed,"at that time, my teacher had an emotion ... Perhaps ... Despair?" Or was he unwilling? I originally wanted to continue hiding and even watch the show, but at that time, you and senior Southern Fist both revealed those emotions ... So ... I spoke up. "
         Hong Yitang was silent.
         Nan Quan's expression also changed, but he didn't say anything.
         Was he in despair?
         He was in despair.
         The moment he broke his superpower lock, he was in extreme despair. He felt that his life was over. Even if he became a superpower master, he was still unwilling to accept it.
         At that moment, Li Hao's words were a life-saving straw and a beacon of light for her.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com After a while, Hong Yitang said,'your methods ... Are not ordinary! The eight great families ... Amazing!"
         Li Hao laughed and didn't say anything. He didn't say anything either. He kept silent and continued to channel sword energy into Hong Yitang.
         Hong Yitang was like a bottomless pit. No matter how much sword energy he inserted, it would disappear. He didn't show any signs of it. No matter how much sword energy he inserted, Hong Yitang could instantly absorb it.
          On the ground, the divine power stones were broken one by one.
         The four great demons had just delivered the divine energy stones. There were not many. In total, there were only about five to six hundred of them ... Well, it was not a lot. At least, to Hong Yitang, it was not worthy of their status.
         Including the ones from the three major organizations, there were about 900 divine power stones in total. They were breaking continuously.
         A huge amount of energy surged into Hong Yitang's body.
         When there were only about a hundred divine power stones left, Hong Yitang stood up. Li Hao looked at him and Hong Yitang smiled.""It's almost done. You can keep the rest of the divine energy stones."
         After he finished speaking, he threw another storage ring over."There are a few miscellaneous items in there, all of which belong to the Samsara King and the others. In addition, I'll give you a petal and a lotus seed as a reward. Also ... Don't consume them rashly. Only consume them when you've fused the five Forces. Otherwise, one of the forces will become incomparably powerful and lose its balance!"
         Li Hao put away the rest of the divine power stones, which were more than a hundred.
         There was still a lot of sword energy left in the small sword. It had probably recovered by absorbing the sword energy from the origin god weapon.
         This meant that the two of them had used up about 800 divine power stones to heal their injuries. In reality, they probably did not use that much. The southern Fist and the earth overturning sword should be more consolidated than before.
         Li Hao put away the divine power Stone. Hong Yitang pointed at the wind chimes with his chin."You can take this too!"
        
         Li Hao put away the wind chimes.
         He stood up and looked at the two of them silently. His eyes were calm and he had one hand behind his back. No one knew what he was thinking.
         Nan Quan looked at Hong Yitang. Hong Yitang laughed and exhaled.""Go on your way. Nanquan and I will cultivate here for a day and chat with the four demon brothers."
         Southern Fist pouted and didn't say anything.
         Li Hao glanced at the two of them and left silently.
         Hong Yitang watched him leave and said,""Don't forget, there are still some corpses. We can collect some mysterious energy too ... They're not of much use to us, but you should be able to use them."
         Although a lot of it had dissipated, this time, two sunguang and 17 three suns had died. The mysterious energy was a huge number.
         A three Sun Expert could at least provide thousands of cubes of mysterious energy.
         Sunglow was also known as the nine suns, which meant that the mysterious energy in his body was at least three times more than the three suns. Even the weakest Sunglow could easily extract four to five thousand cubic meters of mysterious energy.
         The stronger ones could even extract up to ten thousand cubes.
          For a rising light to cultivate from a Starlight master to rising light, the amount of mysterious energy consumed was more than this. It was more than ten times.
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He shuttled back and forth quickly, extracting some mysterious energy and obtaining a large number of storage rings.
         A moment later, Li Hao left.
         ……
         There were only two people left.
         In the distance, the four great demons were all in the valley of the broken mountain. They looked over but did not make any movements. They were only looking at the two of them to see if they had suppressed it. Seeing that the two of them no longer burst out with the same aura as before, the four great demons were actually relieved.
         He had finally suppressed it!
         "Hong, you're not going to wait for me to leave before you go look for him, are you?" Nan Quan suddenly spoke.
         Hong Yitang ignored him.
         "It's that small sword, right?"Nan Quan glanced at him and asked.
         Hong Yitang still didn't speak.
         "You're a swordsman. If you get it, perhaps ... You'll be invincible!"
         Hong Yitang laughed,"really?" If I give you a pair of boxing gloves, will you be invincible?"
         "Is it only weapons that are invincible? And not a person?"
         Hong Yitang looked at him,'in this world, did weapons or people come first? Could it be that weapons were not made by humans? The ancient people were able to forge them, but the people of today can only use their weapons to dominate the world?"
         Southern Fist didn't say anything.
         Hong Yitang looked in the direction where Li Hao had disappeared.""He Yong, do you think ... At that moment, he was ready to attack us? Tell me, is there something wrong with his brain sometimes? he's a little stupid ... To actually dare to save the two of us ... Do you dare to believe that he's yuan Shuo's disciple?"
         That moment was perhaps the most dangerous moment of Li Hao's life.
         It had surpassed any time!
         With two top-tier powerhouses right in front of him, he was already prepared to draw his sword and fight ... It was ridiculous that he was still saving them just a second ago.
         The three martial masters were actually very clear in their hearts.  This was a gamble of life.
         They were betting on Li Hao's life.
         The funny thing was that this life-gambling person had come to his door.
         Nan Quan was a little annoyed,'I didn't have such thoughts. If someone has to, it should be you!' I'm not as strong as you. If you're tempted, you might even attack me!"
         Hong Yitang glanced at him and said,"I don't need it. Besides ... The swords of the eight great families, without their bloodline, can we use them?" Now that you know about this, you can bring some divine energy stones and go to him for help ... If you kill the chicken to get the eggs and you can't use it anymore, will you cry?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Nan Quan's eyes flickered.
         Hong Yitang laughed."That's why I'm not tempted. It's because I have intelligence. As for you ... You might be lacking some intelligence."
         "If you dare to mock me again, I'll kill you with one punch!" Nan Quan was a little manic as he said angrily.
         "I don 't."
         “……”
         If he didn't believe it, then Southern Fist had nothing to say, because he really couldn't be killed.
         "Forget it, I won't beat you to death. Give me a petal of a flower and a lotus seed!" He said quickly.
         "On what basis?"
         Hong Yitang laughed,"tell me, why?" Can you survive on your own? I have a chance ... What right do you have to ask me for it?"
         "You ..."
         "You want two lotus seeds and a three-petal Lotus," Nan Quan said angrily."That's too much ... I'll eat some for you, can't I?"
         "No!"
         Southern Fist was so depressed that he vomited blood. He was really unlucky this time.
         Fortunately, the superpower lock on his heart did not break. In fact, it had become stronger. This could be considered a blessing in disguise.
         "I'm already giving you face by not causing you any trouble when you came to my place!" Hong Yitang continued.
          Nanquan was cursing.
         Even if I didn't run to your place, you would still be in trouble.
         He let out a breath and glanced at the four great demons in the distance. He said in a deep voice,""Are these guys the strongest in the grey Mountain?"
         "I don't know. This is just one of the nine mountains and 18 heavens. One mountain. Perhaps ... There are even stronger ones in the future!"
         "So the Li Dynasty was destroyed?"
         Nan Quan frowned."I don't think so. The Li Dynasty's martial masters are also very strong, not much weaker than the Silver Moon Martial Master. Those barbarians are still very strong. Back then, they fought with the Silver Moon Martial Master in the Cang mountains, and their blood flowed like a river ... Maybe they are still waiting for the opportunity to kill their way into the Silver Moon."
         "Who cares."
         Hong Yitang laughed."What does it have to do with us? I've seen some people from the Li Dynasty, but ... Don't worry about it. We haven't settled our own family matters yet."
         Nan Quan nodded slightly.
         He then looked in the direction that Li Hao had left in and thought, if this guy goes out this time ... He'll be in big trouble! In order to kill him, so many people from the three major organizations have died. Even though we don't know now, we will know sooner or later. "
        
         Hong Yitang laughed and glanced at the few great demons in the distance.""What does it have to do with him? Wasn't it the work of these great demons? The three great organizations also don't dare to rashly come and find trouble with them ... We know about the dangers of the Cang mountains, and Ying Hongyue and the others also know about it!"
         Nanquan nodded."I just didn't expect these guys to improve so quickly. The royal family actually has some records, but in the records, the powerful characters are in the center. Who knew that the outer regions were so strange!"
         The two of them didn't mention Li Hao again.
         As for what they were thinking, perhaps only the two of them knew.
         At the last moment, only they themselves knew whether they had the intention to kill.
         A Martial Master, a powerful Martial Master, had restraint.
         Regardless of whether they wanted to kill him or not, the two of them restrained themselves at this moment.
         Martial masters were brutal, brutal, and cold-blooded, but a true martial arts Grandmaster was a little more capable of restraining the desires in their hearts.
         Yuan Shuo, Hong Yitang, Nan Quan, and even hou Xiaochen ...
         These masters of martial arts killed without batting an eye, but sometimes, they would show some gentleness.
          At that moment, Li Hao had saved them.
         He gave them hope ... No matter how much desire they had, they were suppressed.
         At this moment, the two martial arts powerhouses were squatting on the ground and barbecuing the tail of the snake that had been cut off. They were hungry and began to barbeque it on the spot.
         In the distance, the giant snake looked at its broken tail. A fierce look appeared in its eyes, but it quickly disappeared.
         These two people ... It could not afford to provoke them.
         As for why the two of them didn't leave, they both knew that they were waiting for the person to leave.
         At this moment, the giant ape suddenly sent out a mental message."That weakling ... Did you see how he left?"
         The Golden Eagle didn't say anything.
         In fact, it had noticed something.
         As for the Tiger, it looked into the distance and sent out a mental wave.""He ... He's that person's disciple!"
         The giant ape suddenly transmitted its voice,"as expected, it was you two back then!."
         “……”
         The two giant beasts did not speak.
         He was also too lazy to say anything more. So what if it was us?
         What's wrong?
         "As expected, that person didn't die. Earlier, that person also comprehended some Special Forces, but ... It seems to be different from that person."
         "That's normal. According to what they say, one person has one path. Martial arts are ever-changing. Those who learn from me live, and those who follow me die. Martial arts have to walk out on its own."
         The few great demons fell into silence.
         The giant snake wanted to say something several times but stopped.
         There were four petals and three golden lotuses left.
         Split or not?
         Now, the petals could be divided equally, and the Golden Lotus was missing one ... It felt that there was a high probability ... That it would be missing its one.  These guys didn't even mention it. It was obvious that they wanted to wait for him to accept this fact, then take the initiative to say that they didn't want the Golden Lotus anymore, and then maybe give it to him ...
         p The giant snake was a little dejected.  Sure enough, these guys were on the same side. They hadn't been beaten by that person, so they were a little out of place.
         ……
         At the same time.
         Li Hao was covered in sweat. Without a word, he quickly fled.
         His body was soaked in sweat.
         At that moment, he was about to draw his sword. Even if he had asked for it, he did not regret it, but he was a little solemn.
         However ... At the last moment, the two of them did not make a move.
         He didn't know if it was because he was concerned about the life-saving grace or because he was worried about an uneven distribution of the spoils, but at least he had escaped death.
         Not only did he manage to escape, but he also gained a lot.
         He had witnessed a large-scale battle.
         He had seen a top-notch martial arts master attack. It was not an illusion, nor was it separated by a layer. He had seen it with his own eyes.
         He had also obtained many treasures ...
         In the storage ring given by Hong Yitang, there was a Golden Lotus seed and a golden petal. They were all treasures.
         Apart from that, he had also obtained more than 100 divine power stones, which was actually about the same as what he had obtained from picking up the corpses. In addition, there was also a large amount of mysterious energy. 17 three suns and two sunguang provided Li Hao with about 30000 cubic meters of mysterious energy this time.
         His storage ring was running out of energy.
         In addition, they had brought many storage rings with them. Li Hao didn't count them, but even if each of them brought a few hundred cubic meters, they had at least ten thousand cubic meters.
         With the remaining energy from before, Li Hao roughly estimated that the amount of mysterious energy he had now was at least 50000 cubic meters!
         It was an extremely huge number, or even more than that. Because flying mid mountain and Yama's reincarnation King were both local leaders, it was impossible for them to only bring a few hundred cubic meters of reserves. That would be underestimating the three major organizations.
         Only tsunami was probably poor.
          "These people all died here ... The three major organizations are probably going crazy."
         Li Hao sighed in his heart. The three families probably couldn't bear the loss of so many people at once. However, it was none of his business. The more people died, the better. In addition, he could keep wind chimes as a reserve. One day, when his sword energy was used up and his divine power Stone was gone, he could use them to save his life.
         This time, he would have another upgrade.
         The power of the water might be of some help after seeing the tsunami.
         The key was not the water force, but the sword force!
         Hong Yitang's sword!
         The only pity was that he didn't experience it for himself. It was a pity. Otherwise, if he didn't die under his sword, he might have a special understanding of the power of the current generation's number one swordsman.
         As for Heavenly Sword ... Li Hao didn't think about it. Who knew how strong Heavenly Sword was? he might not be as strong as Hong Yitang.
         A moment later, he returned to his previous location.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At this moment, Liu Long was standing guard outside. Seeing that Li Hao had returned, he heaved a sigh of relief and said worriedly,""I thought you had a fight with the others. Just now, the entire Cang Mountain was silent, and then there was the sound of fighting ... Did the three major organizations have a conflict with those big demons?"
        
         "En!"
         "What's the result?"
         At this moment, everyone looked at Li Hao worriedly. The battle was over?
         And the result?
         Li Hao exhaled and said, the three great organizations were completely annihilated! 17 of the three suns and two of the sunguang clan died. Banshan, the reincarnation King, and one of the Crimson Moon's water element Sunglow are also dead ..."
         In an instant, everyone's eyes widened and their faces turned pale!
         All dead?
         It was too terrifying!
         Liu Long also swallowed his saliva,"all dead?" Then ... Then what about those great demons?"
         "I'm fine. "
          "This is too terrifying!"
         "It's a good thing they didn't notice us, otherwise ..."Liu Long said with relief.
         "Let's go then," he said."By the way, just now ... Just now, there seemed to be a sword aura. I thought you made a move. Wasn't it you?" Could it be that there are also powerful martial masters among the experts of the three great organizations?"
         It was actually quite far away from the battle, but Hong Yitang's sword intent still managed to reach him.
         Li Hao glanced at Hong Qing. Although he couldn't see Hong Qing's expression because his face was covered by his black cloak, there was still some admiration in his eyes. Li Hao was speechless. After a while, he said,""It wasn't me, it was another swordsman ... But he was also killed!"
         Since Hong Yitang didn't say anything, Li Hao couldn't be bothered to reveal anything to his daughter.
         "It's a pity ... He's just an expert from the three major organizations. It's good that he's dead. This swordsman must be very strong. When the sword intent spread over, even everyone's weapons trembled!"
         Hong Qing also hurriedly said,"yes, he's so powerful!" My sword kept shaking. It was too terrifying. Fortunately, he died. Otherwise, I feel like my sword would fly away if this continued!"
         Fortunately, he was dead ...
         You can tell your father about this in the future.
         Li Hao suddenly laughed,"yes, it's good that he's dead!" Hong Qing, the next time you see your father, tell him that a powerful swordsman has appeared, and he might know him. "
         "Oh!"
         Hong Qing was at a loss. Should he tell his father?
         So what if they knew each other?
          They were all dead.  "Let's go. The battle has just ended, and the great demons are trembling ... We'll continue with our original plan!"
         To the East, to the Hengduan Canyon.
         As for retreating now, forget it. Not to mention the four great demons, it would be awkward if they met Hong Yitang and the others on the way.
         After this battle, Li Hao felt that there wouldn't be any more powerful existences ahead.
         p They were only walking on the edge of the first mountain. Li Hao would have to give up if there were more powerful people besides these four.  The group of people quickly moved forward.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, was looking at the Golden Lotus seed and lotus flower in his storage ring.
         In addition, the small sword had also become longer, and it was much easier to use now.
         In his mind, the previous battle resurfaced. It wasn't just the battle between Hong Yitang and the others, but also the battle between several great demons. In fact, Li Hao had also been observing the battle. The Golden Eagle, the Tiger, and the giant ape could all correspond to the five birds technique.
         This time, Li Hao had finally witnessed the true power of a ferocious bird!
         "However ... It seems like these few are related to my teacher. Could it be that my teacher was observing them back then?"
         Li Hao thought to himself.
         If that was the case, should he prepare a coffin for his teacher when he came to the Cang mountains?
          He had too many enemies!
         Also, I'm a little outdated among the 36 heroes back then.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao felt that even if his teacher's Five Forces were completely combined, he wouldn't be able to match up to Hong Yitang. As for the southern Fist, it was hard to say. The southern Fist couldn't break the superpower lock, so its strength was limited. It seemed to be at the mid-stage of Sunglow.
         A teacher who had fused three forces was almost invincible among the three yang forces. If he fused Five Forces ... Even if the southern Fist's Super Lock was not broken, he might not be a match for him. Moreover, it was not impossible for his teacher to break it.
         "The southern Fist can be pursued, but the earth overturning sword ... Is difficult to pursue!"
         If he wanted to catch up to Hong Yitang, he might need to enter the realm after the spirit accumulation.
         Thoughts flashed through Li Hao's mind. At this moment, he also understood why these powerful martial masters were all pretending to be scared. If they fought with their lives, they would only end up cutting off their own paths. It seemed that most of hou Xiaochen and the others were the same.
         "The five internal organs are not strong, and the Super Lock is weak. These are all problems. In light cases, the Super Lock will break, and in serious cases, the five internal organs will be crushed ..."
         He shook his head and stopped thinking about it. He was still far from that level. If he really reached it ... It wouldn't affect him much. Do you believe that I can strengthen my five internal organs to the level of a super?
         I'll scare you to death!
        
         Li Hao's group quickly left, not daring to stay any longer.
         As for absorbing the mysterious energy, he was not in a hurry. It was already September 21st, only seven days away from the next opening of the remains.
         ……
         At the same time.
         Hengduan Canyon.
         As the time for the opening of the ancient domain drew closer, even though they didn't know if they would be able to successfully open it this time, the transverse Canyon was already packed with people.
         The three great organizations and the Silver Moon officials were only secondary.
         Most of them were actually powerhouses from the 19 northern provinces, as well as some powerhouses who had specially come from the central region.
         The entrance of the remains was now sealed off by a group of night patrols and the military.
         Even though the forces left behind weren't too strong, they didn't cause any trouble. Hou Xiaochen was still here, and as long as he didn't leave, he wouldn't die. At this moment, not many people dared to cause trouble.
          At this moment, many people were observing.
         Suddenly, the rumbling sounds continued!
         The next moment, a group of people ran over, all wearing devil masks.
         The Crimson Moon!
         There were quite a few of them, and there were even a few three suns leading them.
         However, at this moment, he was fleeing in a sorry state.
         The supers who were wandering around the canyon quickly avoided them. When they saw the red moon, although many of them did something in secret, the three major organizations were still extremely powerful on the surface, and no one dared to provoke them.
         At this moment, seeing the arrival of a group of Crimson Moon experts, they did not dare to block the way.
         Just as he was thinking, a group of people suddenly rushed over from behind. Many of them were wearing black armor, and one of them was an old man in his fifties. He was not wearing black armor, and he held a long spear in his hand, which he shot forward!
         The long spear let out a whistling sound!
         BOOM!
         With a loud bang, the red moon superpower that was running away turned around to counterattack. Their powers exploded but they were instantly pierced by the long spear. With a loud bang, an early stage of the three suns was pierced by the long spear and nailed to the ground. He kept spitting out blood!
         One of the other three suns roared,""Golden spear! You've already surpassed the three suns, and you're attacking us. Aren't you afraid that I, Hong Yue, will completely fall out with you and kill you?"
         Soldiers against soldiers, generals against generals.
         This was the rule, the unspoken rule.
         Otherwise, if there were powerhouses in each of them, the killing would be too chaotic, and too many would die.
         Many people's expressions changed when they heard the name of the Golden spear.
         The head of the three Spears of the Silver Moon!
         He was currently the strongest Martial Master on the surface, an existence that surpassed the three yang realm. He was probably the strongest person in the current martial arts world.
         Apart from Hong Yitang and Nan Quan, sky sword had turned into a superpower. Apart from some old acquaintances who knew that BA Dao was still alive, everyone else thought that he was dead. Yuan Shuo had only killed peak three suns and had yet to fight with Xu Guang.
         In today's world, only the Golden spear and LAN Yue had fought once yesterday. At the moment of the confrontation, both sides had retreated, but they had retreated from Xu Guang's hands unscathed. At this moment, the Golden spear had been recognized as the number one in the martial arts world.
         As for Yuan Shuo, he hadn't fought with Xu Guang yet, so he couldn't determine his strength.
          Jin Jin, Yuan Shuo, Li Hao ...  Currently, these three martial masters were famous in the entire star dynasty.
         He had surpassed the ordinary Qian warrior and had truly entered the next stage of the Martial Master realm.
         Hearing that the Golden spear was chasing after these people, some people felt relieved.
         No wonder the three suns joined hands and ran so quickly.
         Moreover, Jin Jin had brought the Wei Wu Army with him.
         "Who said I've surpassed the three suns?" Jin Jin said in a cold voice. Besides ... If we're talking about breaking the rules, you're the ones who are more shameless! Tell me, where did tsunami, Banshan, and the others go?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Who broke the rules first?
         Since that was the case, what was the point of talking about rules!
         Jin Jin roared,"kill!"
         "Kill!"
         Behind them, a group of martial masters quickly rushed forward, each of them wearing black armor and looking extremely powerful. These martial masters were even more powerful than demon hunt squads, with many of them having broken through the hundred great circle. Each of them was like a hot knife through butter, following the Golden spear as it broke through the three suns, pursuing and killing the Scarlet Moon super.
         Among them, Wang Qing, the disciple of killing blade, and Kong Jie's daughter, Kong Youyun, had even fought with the three suns!
         This was the Golden Spear's personal guards. There were not many of them, only about 80 people, not even enough to form a 100-man team.
         However, his combat strength was extremely powerful.
         Of these 80 people, 20 of them had already broken through the 100th level, while the rest were all in the late stage. Moreover, they were all wearing black armor, and were even more elite than Li Hao's demon hunt squad.
         Under their joint attack, even the three suns would have to retreat.
         BOOM!
         A series of explosions rang out.
         Just as the three suns were fighting a bloody battle, a Thunderbolt exploded in the distance and exploded next to the Golden spear.
         The Golden spear roared and stabbed forward!
         BOOM!
          There was another loud noise, and a bolt of lightning instantly exploded. In the distance, Zi Yue stepped on the air and came over with an ugly expression.""Golden spear, the ruins are about to open. Do you really have to do this?"
         "You ... You have no right to say this!" Jin Jin said coldly. Your mother is almost here. I also want to see how strong black Widow is now!"
         Ziyue's expression turned ugly.
         Black Widow!
         ? "My mother is really here," she snorted coldly."You won't be able to take three of her attacks!"
         The second-in-command of the red moon was definitely powerful.
         Not able to withstand three attacks ... Perhaps it wasn't a lie.
         However, with the arrival of the purple Moon, the peak of the three suns, and the Thunder God's armor, their strength could not be underestimated.
         With a wave of Jin Jin gun's hand, the Wei Wu Army quickly gathered and stopped fighting.
         The remaining power of the red moon also quickly gathered towards the purple Moon. Not only that, behind the purple Moon, many three suns experts appeared one after another. In the blink of an eye, there were a total of six three suns experts. In addition to the few who survived, there were a total of 10 three suns experts.
        
         At this moment, Ziyue finally heaved a sigh of relief.
         These martial masters ... Were too terrifying!
         Golden spear, the head of the three Spears in the past, had now walked a long way on the path of martial masters. He was extremely powerful. Without the three suns, in addition to his powerful personal guards, he was far from comparable to the night patrolmen.
         Apart from hou Xiaochen, the other Nightwatchers didn't give them too much pressure.
         However, on the Wei Wu Army's side, they had moved out these few days and killed until everyone was terrified.
         At this moment, the name of the Silver Moon Martial Master once again spread out.
         Even though there were very few experts among the martial masters, they had shown the supers how powerful the martial masters were when they formed an Army.
         Without the three suns, each team of a hundred people could not be matched.
         However, the three suns were not cabbages that could be found everywhere.
         Red Moon had gathered experts from 19 provinces, but only 30 three suns experts had been gathered. But at this moment, many three suns experts had died. Li Hao alone had killed three.
          Even the three suns in the central region did not die as quickly as this place.
         Recently, the three northern provinces were still in turmoil. However, the three northern provinces had been in turmoil for several days, and only two three suns had died. It was as if their fathers had died, and the other side had been in turmoil for a long time.
         On the day the Silver Moon ... The Wei Wu Army went out to battle, one of the three suns had died. Yesterday, the Golden spear had killed another.
         In such a short time, two of the Wei Wu Army's three suns had died.
         At this moment, the guy who was stabbed on the ground looked like he was not going to live.
         Zi Yue frowned, feeling a little irritated.
         It was not a good choice to start a war with Silver Moon.
         The three suns died in batches!
         Li Hao had killed three, the Golden spear had killed three, Yuan Shuo had killed three, hou Xiaochen had killed Xu Guang, and four of the three suns had gone missing ...
         In just one month, the Crimson Moon in the Silver Moon had buried 13 three suns and one sunguang!
         Both Purple Moon and blue Moon could not bear such a loss.
         Yesterday, LAN Yue had taken action personally. She had wanted to ambush Jin gun, but she was caught off guard by him. LAN Yue was at the middle stage of the rising light realm, not the early stage. Even so, she could not do anything to Jin gun for a while!
         Of course, the Golden spear could not do anything to him, and it was slightly inferior.
         However, martial masters were powerful. At the level of Jin gun, even LAN Yue could not easily finish him off.
         This was not the key point.
         The key was that LAN Yue did not come today. It was not that she had run away, but that she had been targeted by a woman and was now in trouble. That woman ... When Zi Yue thought of her, her expression changed slightly.
         Yu Luosha!
         Yu Luosha had finally made her move. The moment she made her move, it shocked everyone and forced LAN Yue to flee in a sorry state. At this moment, LAN Yue still didn't know if she could successfully escape.
         Silver Moon ... Was getting more and more dangerous!
         Just as she was thinking, a loud boom was heard.
         In the next moment, many figures descended.
         LAN Yue's hair was disheveled, and he was no longer as calm as before. He looked a little gloomy, but he was not injured, because a cloaked man and an extremely majestic man with a square face landed beside him at the same time.  "King Pingdeng!"
         "Elder Fei Tian?"
         Around them, someone exclaimed in a low voice. The Big Shot was here!
         However, it didn't seem to go too smoothly.
         The next moment, a cold figure floated down. Her face was pale and her eyes were filled with killing intent. She looked at Jin gun and nodded slightly. Then, she looked at the three people opposite her and said coldly,""A bunch of trash!"
         “……”
         The three experts didn't say anything.
         The king of equality frowned slightly, LAN Yue's expression darkened, and elder Fei Tian's expression was unreadable under the cloak.
         Yu Luosha!
         At this moment, he looked at Yu Luosha and then at the Golden spear ...
         Some people had already recognized them.
         In the distance, behind a huge rock, an old Martial Master was somewhat excited.""I knew it. This night patrolman, chief Yu, is not simple ... It's her!"
         "Master, who is it?"
         Some young martial masters were curious.
         "Jade rakkhasa!"
         "Ah? One of the thirty-six heroes?"
         "Right!"
         The old Martial Master said excitedly,"it must be her!" Only these people could terrorize and sweep the world! Back then, the Silver Moon Martial Master was famous throughout the world. When they first rose up, they were beaten up by Silver Moon martial masters so badly that they didn't even dare to step into the Silver Moon ... It wasn't until the martial masters reached the Qian warrior stage that their path was cut off, and these supers stepped into the three suns rising light that the martial masters declined ... But now, they've found their way!"
         "Cough cough ... Master ... That ... Yu Luosha seems to be a super ..."
         "So what if I'm super? That's still a Martial Master!"
         The old man was furious. He glared at his disciple angrily.
          Who said she was a superhuman?
         She was a Martial Master!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Even though ... The other party had already turned into a superpower, he did not want to admit it. He was also unwilling to admit that a Martial Master was inferior to a superpower.
         The disciples didn't say anything. If the teacher said so, then so be it.
         Moreover, the other party was indeed a top-notch Martial Master back then, a famous existence on the hero list.
         ……
         People were discussing from all directions.
         At this moment, on the cliff of another Canyon, there were also a few people standing. One of them was very young, and the ends of his hair were stained with white frost. He stood in front of the crowd and looked in that direction. His voice carried a calm and unspeakable sense of pride, "That's the Jade Rakshasa?"
         "Yes, it's her!"
         Behind the young man, an old man said in a low voice,""Jin Jin and Yu Luo Sha have both joined the night patrollers. Including Yuan Shuo who left not long ago, the founder of swords gate, earth overturning sword, the southern Fist who went to silver North, the Jade light sword who went with Yuan Shuo, the heavenly Sword from the central continent, and the frenzied sword who served the military ... The famous martial masters in Silver Moon are still active in the dynasty!"
        
         Who said that Silver Moon martial forest was gone?
         It was still there!
         It was just that they had changed their way of doing it. Each had their own path and their own destination.
         There were 36 heroes, and many more were still active.
         The man nodded slightly and said softly,"have you forgotten? there are still 36 heroes on Red moon's side." Orange moon, Black Widow. Ying Hongyue ..."
         The old man nodded in agreement.""Yes, there are also 36 heroes in the seventh month of the Crimson Moon ..."
         "This Jade rakkhasa is one of them, so why is it Ying Hongyue 's?" the man asked curiously.
         "I'm not too sure, but it's possible ... That hou Xiaochen really is a sick ghost. I heard that he let her go and didn't kill her ..."
         The man nodded again and sighed.""Silver Moon, you're indeed a genius! No wonder, no wonder everyone wants to come to Silver Moon, but they seem to be waiting for something. We'll be the sentries first and see what happens ..."
         After saying that, the man smiled."It's also a good opportunity to watch the fun. Let's go to the Ruins of Heaven battling city to take a look. If possible, maybe ... There are even powerful origin God weapons to take."
          "Young master, try to dispel this idea!"
         "It's said that hou Xiaochen will personally enter!"The old man said in a deep voice. If he's sick, he could've been a top martial Master a long time ago. Even a Martial Master wouldn't be too weak after becoming a super, let alone a top martial Master like him. Just look at the Golden spear and Jade Rakshasa under his command. If hou Xiaochen isn't at the peak of the rising light Stage, he's probably even stronger ..."
         "Just because he killed the red-haired guy with one shot?"
         The man frowned."That spear can't express anything. Even if he's in the late stages of the sunguang dynasty and has a heaven-grade origin divine weapon, he might still be killed by that spear even if he's caught off guard!"
         It was only natural that hou Xiaochen was powerful.
         However, he was still not sure which level he was at.
         "The redhead can't be unprepared, so ... Don't underestimate hou Xiaochen," the old man shook his head.
         "I'm not looking down on him. I just feel that the three major organizations won't let him go once he's in. Besides ... It might not be just the three major organizations."
         "There are many who want hou Xiaochen dead," the man laughed.
         The old man did not say anything more.
         This was the truth.
         Hou Xiaochen was a thorny character.
         Even among the night patrollers, there were people who wanted him dead.
         If he went to the remains, he would probably face more than just the experts from the three major organizations.
         The man didn't say anything else, but asked curiously,""Oh right, it's said that the disciple of old demon five birds killed six three suns two days ago and fled to the Cang Mountain in the North of silver. Is there any news?"
          "No, I didn 't,"  The old man shook his head."The Cang mountains is not a safe place. There are some records in the family that it is very dangerous. There are many great demons there, and there are even existences that are beyond the level of suguang. It is extremely terrifying!"
         "It's a pity. Don't die in the Cang mountains. It seems that there are very few young geniuses in the path of martial masters."
         The man laughed,"there are a few young Martial Master geniuses in the central region, but ... They're just so-so. This man can kill many three suns. He must have some real ability." As expected of the last disciple of old demon five birds, the leader of the thirty-six heroes back then ..."
         The old man didn't answer.
         It was only natural that he had real ability.
         However, the young man's tone was somewhat condescending, and he didn't want to say anything. Perhaps this man was very strong, even stronger than Hu Qingfeng, The Night Watcher from the central region.
         However ... One should not underestimate any Martial Master.
         If Yuan Shuo's disciple were to advance to the next level, he would be a Sunglow-tier super as well, and he wouldn't be any weaker than the young man before him. If he were to look down on him, it would only cause him to lower his guard.
         On this side, they were talking.
         In the distance, someone suddenly waved at them. It was a simple and elegant young woman who was also chatting with some people on the cliff.
         Seeing the woman wave her hand, the young man nodded slightly and transmitted his voice to the old man,""Madam Bai sure has a wide circle of friends. Isn't her husband in Silver Moon? How did this woman get involved with the Liu family again?"
         The Liu family of heavenstar was quite famous.
         The Liu family had another name, God of Fortune.
         Of the nine divisions, the Financial Secretary was the old man from the Liu family, and he was exceptionally terrifying. However, the people who had come to Silver Moon were probably only a few of the Liu family's branch members. Although they were worth paying attention to, they were not the Liu family's direct bloodline, so the man did not care too much.
          "This woman isn't as simple as she looks," the old man replied."Although she's not one of the 36 heroes, she's still a famous Silver Moon Martial Master. She's married to a member of the Bai family, and her husband is now the Vice commander of the Tiger wing Army. She's from another branch of the Bai family, and she's on good terms with the military law Department in stellarsky city. It's said that she's also involved with the royal family ... She's not as simple as she looks."
         The man nodded slightly.
         ……
         On the other side, the heart-jabbing beauty, Madam Bai, was also chatting with a few young people. When she saw the young man with frosty hair in the distance, she waved her hand and greeted him. Then, she whispered,""Why has this person come to Silver Moon?"
         Beside her, a very young man glanced over. His eyes seemed to be filled with disdain and some jealousy. He said perfunctorily,""Maybe it's because he was suppressed by those people in the central region, so he came here to catch his breath."
         Beside the man, a younger woman, or rather, a girl, asked curiously,""Brother, who is it?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The girl didn't seem to know that person.
         The man didn't want to say it, but seeing his sister's curious face, he still vaguely said,""Xu Feng,"
         Xu Feng.
         The girl thought for a moment and was a little confused. After a moment, she seemed to have thought of something and suddenly said excitedly,""Is it ... Is it the frost swordsman, Xu Feng, who is on the God tier Masters Ranking list?"
        
         "What God tier master ranking?"
         "It's just an unofficial ranking," the young man said with some dissatisfaction."It's just a list made by a few dabblers. You think it's real?"
         "Brother, are you jealous?" the girl giggled.
         "I'm jealous of him?"
         The girl giggled and said,"he's one of the dragons and phoenixes among the 99 people on the list!" The God tier Masters Ranking list only records 99 top-tier powerhouses under the age of 30. On average, there is only one person in a large province. Although Xu Feng's ranking is low, I think he was 97th a few days ago, but ... He's still very powerful!"
         Or rather, he was super powerful!
         It was very strong!
         Even though the list was only for those under 30 years old, there were still many strong people at 30 years old. After all, superpowers had only appeared for 20 years.
         The girl was still a little excited.
         Beside him, Madam Bai smiled but did not say anything.
          The God tier list ... It was similar to the hero list. It was not an official list, but a list made by some people. Some people were low-key, while others were ostentatious. It was impossible to cover everything.
         It was not even as famous as the hero list back then. At least, the Silver Moon 36 heroes were acknowledged by the entire martial arts world.
         The God tier Masters Ranking was popular in the central continent, and none of the four provinces would admit it. They had never fought in the central continent, so how could they admit that the young people in the central continent were stronger than them?
         It might be more appropriate to call it the young god tier Masters Ranking list in the central continent.
         In front of them, Xu Feng, an ice-elemental god tier master in the middle stage of the rising light realm, was only ranked 97th. It could be seen that the list still had some credibility.
         Even someone like Hu Qingfeng had not made it to the list.
         Madam Bai was deep in thought when suddenly, a loud boom came from above, interrupting everyone's thoughts.
         Everyone looked up.
         In the distance, Yu Luosha struck out with her palm. With a loud boom, the power of lightning exploded, forcing LAN Yue and the others to retreat.
         Lightning element expert!
         Of course, Yu Luosha's power of lightning seemed to be a little special. It was a little dark-purple, and when it exploded, it was extremely powerful.
         This thunderous sound made everyone's attention focus on that side again.
         ……
         Above the canyon.
         Chief Steward Yu's expression was cold as usual.
         He struck out with his palm and no longer attacked. He only had an indifferent expression."LAN Yue, Hong Yue, how many people are you hiding? just come out! The elders Guild, it can't be just a tsunami, that's from the three northern provinces ... Since they're prepared to deal with the Minister, do you think you're worthy of it?"
         Are you worthy?
         These words made LAN Yue's blood boil, and there was a hint of anger in her eyes.
         Yu Luosha looked around indifferently and said slowly,""Is it Blue Moon? Or green Moon? Since you're here, why don't you come out and meet me? Blue Moon and purple Moon are only the second and third generation ... They're good for dealing with young people, but I'm no longer young. "
         At this moment, laughter came from the distance.  "Sister Ziyue, we're still young. Why are we old?" he asked with a hint of resentment.
         Ziyue was stunned at first, but then she realized that he was not talking about her.
         He was talking about Yu Luosha!
         This first generation Purple Moon!
         Yu Luosha revealed a smile. At this moment, her cold face actually revealed a smile, which made people feel a little uncomfortable.
         "Ziyue is indeed young, but I'm old. I thought it would be qingyue, but I didn't expect it to be you, lü Yue ..."
         The next moment, a figure suddenly appeared in front of LAN Yue and the others.
         She had a voluptuous figure and wore a long green dress. Her long green hair fluttered in the wind, and she had a bright smile on her face, making her look particularly moving.
         The green Moon of the Crimson Moon!
         Of course, Jin Jin was frowning at the moment. After a while, he said coldly,""It's you ... The green peacock!"
         He frowned and said,"green peacock, are you fit to be the green Moon?" I've always wondered how Ying Hongyue was ranked, and how Yu Luosha was Zi Yue. When I found out that Black Widow was Cheng Yue, I felt that Ying Hongyue was a little shameless. Those who had an affair with him were ranked higher. Now I understand, and it's true. You, green peacock, are not even as good as heart-piercing beauty, so how are you worthy of being ranked higher than Yu Luosha?"
         Jin Jin, who was a man of few words, spoke a lot at this moment, and he was somewhat dissatisfied.
         As soon as he said this, not only lü Yue's expression changed, even Madam Bai in the distance was speechless.
         Why are you bringing me along?
         However, the green Moon was the green peacock ... She really didn't know.
         The Golden spear was indeed knowledgeable.
         The green peacock had some reputation, but as Jin gun had said, she was not as good as the heart-jabbing tsundere back then.
         Lu Yue looked at the Golden spear coldly. Her smile was no longer there, and she said icily,"Golden spear, the times have changed!"
         The Golden Spear's blood Qi soared!
          "No matter how you change, it's not your turn to lecture me, you Peacock!" Since Ying Hongyue came here personally, I'm going to scold him for being shameless to his face. What the hell is this? he slept with thousands of people and was ridden by tens of thousands of people, yet he's ranked above Yu Luosha? He forgot that he's also one of the thirty-six people. How could he have the right to humiliate Yu Luosha!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com “……”
         At that moment, Yu Luosha was speechless. This old man ... Enough!
         In fact, she didn't really care about it.
         This old man, on the other hand, was quite concerned.
         Fortunately, she was too lazy to say anything to him. Otherwise, she would have started scolding him.
         What Jin Jin was angry about was that Ying Hongyue actually placed Yu Luosha, one of the thirty-six heroes, in the last place in July, while the green peacock, who wasn't very famous back then, was actually ranked in front.
         Black Widow was one of the 36 heroes.
         However, Jin Jin was not satisfied with this person. This person was tarnishing the reputation of the 36 heroes.
         "Did water enter Ying Hongyue's brain from sleeping with a woman? I'll cut off his head that's covered in water sooner or later!" He was bristling with anger.
