After an unknown period of time, the chaotic power of myriad DAOs in the domain of fire covered the sky like a huge net. However, there was still a part that Li Hao hadn't woken up.His comprehension of the ten thousand DAOs was still a little lacking.At this moment, it was only a simplified version of the net of ten thousand DAOs."Not bad!"Li Hao was quite satisfied with his results. He smiled. This could be considered a Foundation. As for the remaining power of chaos, he needed more comprehension and more understanding of mantras. He would slowly weave them in later.The current fire element region was definitely not the final version.It was only the first-generation version!Even so, Li Hao was already very satisfied.This small domain wasn't too big. At a glance, it only had a radius of a thousand meters, but it was enough.For the first time, it didn't matter how big or small it was. It was enough to prove that his idea could be done.Li Hao stuffed a large number of great Dao crystals into the river. At the moment, the river was not powerful enough, and it was not reliable to absorb chaos. The power of Chaos was still too chaotic, and Li Hao had not completely sorted out it.The first little realm, even though it was simple and crude, it was considered complete.This made Li Hao somewhat happy. In a small world, the power of fire was dominant. In the future, if this place could really become a large world, it would be a fire World. If it could give birth to living beings ... It would be even more amazing, and it would become a real world.At this moment, Li Hao was somewhat immersed in his fantasy.If my Dao can become a realm.Then ... I am chaos!The river I control will transform into a chaosverse.Suddenly, he was slightly shocked.Then, would chaos ... Be the same?He didn't dare to think, he couldn't think!Li Hao shook his head and stopped thinking about it. He looked at the little world he had created and smiled again. It was still messy, but so what?After his first success, Li Hao began to try again.The stars were all turned into divine text, which then turned into small realms again. The small realms were connected to the river, and the power of the great Dao in the river was consumed at a crazy rate.The great Dao crystals that Li Hao had obtained previously were also being consumed at a crazy rate.The little realms were like tumors on the river. At this moment, because they were not perfect, they looked a little ugly. Er Mao had been looking at them the whole time and it was a little awkward.It was so ugly!The originally straight and long river was now so ugly that it looked like pustules were bulging everywhere.Not only was er Mao watching, but the three sword spirits were also watching.However, they didn't quite understand what was going on. Even so, they still felt that it was very impressive. They all watched it seriously, and no one disturbed Li Hao.   Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ There were big and small worlds.The bigger ones only had a radius of a thousand meters.The small one ... Was just enough to fit three to five people, not even as big as a toilet.The size of a realm represented Li Hao's level of understanding of the Dao. The larger it was, the deeper his understanding was. The smaller it was, the more shallow his understanding was.Second cat gradually began to understand the situation.The huge eyes were filled with emotions.Li Hao's path would be very difficult if he really wanted to go down this path. He needed to seriously comprehend the myriad DAOs and transform them into the myriad worlds. He could no longer be vague and only needed to focus on a few DAOs.That way, the difference between his infinite worlds would be extremely huge.Some would not even form a boundary.With life and death, Nirvana's revival, and time, Li Hao still wanted to go on like this ... Ermao didn't know if Li Hao wanted to become stronger, or if he was enjoying the process of becoming stronger. In this case, even if he reached the sixth rank, it would be very difficult for him to reach the seventh. Level Seven might require the true gathering of the myriad worlds.This time, Li Hao kept opening realms and trying to show small realms. He didn't care about the consumption. His strength didn't increase, but the consumption of resources was extremely crazy.The tens of millions of Dao crystals that he had obtained previously were quickly used up.There were still more Dao accumulation crystals.However, the Dao accumulation crystal didn't contain much energy. It was more about comprehension.After the transformation, the river was extremely ugly.On both sides, or in other words, in all directions, there were bags of all sizes, flashing with all kinds of different energy.And the river itself was no longer flowing as smoothly as before.It was because there was a break here and a part of the power of 10000 DAOs flowed into the little realm.Even the river seemed to have dried up.Seeing that Li Hao had stopped, second cat floated in front of him and looked down at the river. It said helplessly,""After your transformation, it's too ugly. The river is intermittent. Each small realm absorbs different amounts of energy and the power of great DAOs. The river is almost cut off."Li Hao nodded.The river was about to run dry, but it was mainly because he was too weak. He couldn't absorb the endless power of chaos into the river to satisfy the needs of the small realms.If he was stronger, this problem would not be difficult to solve.It was an incomparably wide river, and the power of ten thousand DAOs was extremely dense. Was there a need to worry about these realm domains absorbing energy?He didn't need to worry at all!Li Hao said,"right now, it's only because the Dao of the small realm isn't perfect yet. Once I perfect it, each small realm will be able to directly extract the power of Chaos and change its arrangement. Then, there won't be any problems!" Now, because each little realm has its own focal point, the energy it draws is different. That's why this phenomenon has occurred. "

Chapter 2861 The Embryonic Form Of The Myriad Realms (1)_6
Over 300 stars had all turned into little realms.The only difference was the size.Two cat looked up at the sky. There was still a star, a fusion of life and death and Nirvana. Li Hao's boundary had not yet been formed."Then will this also transform into a world?"  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ "No... This one should be cultivated as a primary realm. It just needs to be fused with the river. If time is cultivated in the future, this planet will be the time planet. It will be fused with the river and rule over it!""Has your strength increased?""No, I didn 't,"Li Hao shook his head, and second cat was speechless.It consumed a lot of energy.Tens of millions of great Dao crystals, which were equivalent to the energy of several small worlds, had been devoured by Li Hao in one go, but this guy had made no progress at all ... Even a rich kid couldn't stand such a reckless move!Li Hao laughed."Strength is only secondary. More importantly, with this, I have a clearer idea of my own path!" Spending some resources to perfect one's own Dao path is the real reward!"After saying that, Li Hao suddenly smiled. The next moment, the firmament sword, which had been nurtured in the river, suddenly floated out.Li Hao looked at the firmament sword."I've incorporated the winding river into the firmament sword. From now on, I won't show the winding river to anyone, in case they see through it!" Firmament sword, are you willing to bear the weight of my long river of Dao?"The firmament sword trembled and revealed a faint spiritual light.He was willing to do so, but the firmament sword was only a second-stage sovereign weapon, while Li Hao's River was a fourth-stage venerable sovereign's River of Dao.It probably couldn't contain it.Li Hao let out a breath."It's hard for you to contain it. I know ... I only have some Taoist connotation crystals right now, and they are mainly made of the Crimson Moon Power. If you absorb these Taoist connotation crystals, you should be able to improve a lot and barely contain it ... But ..."He was slightly hesitant.This way, there might be some problems.What was the power of the Crimson Moon?The power of desire!If the firmament sword absorbed too much of the Crimson Moon's Taoist connotation, perhaps ... It would develop some bad thoughts. Human desires were terrifying, and if a sword developed desires, it would be equally terrifying.It might even devour its master!However, he did not have anything better on him now. Furthermore, if the firmament sword could absorb a large amount of the Crimson Moon's power, it might be of some help to him in the future when he integrated into the entire Crimson Moon universe.It was even possible ... To use a sword and sneak into the world of the Crimson Moon.After some consideration, Li Hao said,""Then I'll let you absorb the Crimson Moon Dao accumulation crystal! This Dao accumulation crystal contained a large amount of desire ... Of course, humans and living beings all had desires! It'll also be of great help to your spirituality!"The seven emotions and six desires were all necessary for living beings.The firmament sword hadn't officially become a spiritual sovereign weapon like the Dao chess. Absorbing some power of desire would help it improve its spirituality.As for the future, he might be devoured by desire ... Li Hao pondered for a moment. He would think about the future in the future.If he handled it well, it would not be a big problem.Besides, a sword is just a sword, after all. The master is the key. It's fine as long as I don't get swallowed by desire.In the next moment, the vast amount of Crimson Moon Dao accumulation crystals that he had obtained earlier were all devoured by the firmament sword. This kind of consumption was considered a huge sum.The Dao accumulation crystal of a rank seven venerable sovereign was a Supreme treasure outside.In fact, Li Hao didn't have many resources.However, he had fed it to a sword.A level 2 Emperor weapon ... Was not of much help to Li Hao. What he needed was not a Grade 2 Emperor weapon.If the firmament sword could be upgraded to a third-tier sovereign weapon, it would be comparable to a fourth-tier sovereign weapon after carrying the river. In that case, Li Hao would become a fourth-tier venerable sovereign with a sovereign weapon. There was still a huge gap.Almost all the venerable sovereigns he had met did not have sovereign weapons.At this moment, the firmament sword absorbed the Taoist connotation crystal. The sword became stronger and more spiritual. Although it couldn't directly manifest like the item spirit of the Dao chess, it had a closer connection with Li Hao.The power of desire had both good and bad.As long as it could resist the invasion of desire, it would be a great opportunity for the firmament sword!After an unknown period of time, the firmament sword suddenly burst out with a brilliant light!The power of the red moon spread out.Li Hao's eyes flickered. In the next moment, the firmament sword suddenly merged with Li Hao's River of Dao. It grew and expanded crazily, and gradually, the entire River was absorbed into the sword!The sword and the Dao River began to merge!In the river, the sword seals, sword trees, and sword stones were all a little depressed. The river they carried was already too much for them to bear. That was why Li Hao chose to let the firmament sword carry it.Otherwise, they would be too powerful for the firmament sword to bear.After a while, the firmament sword shook violently.From the original huge sword, it instantly shrank.Soon, a normal longsword fell into Li Hao's hand. For a moment, Li Hao felt as if he had become one with the sword.The firmament sword, which now had some spirituality, seemed to be more compatible with him than before.The original aura of the great Dao on Li Hao's body had also completely dissipated.At this moment, he seemed to have turned into an ordinary person.Holding the sword, the river was integrated into it. The power of 10000 DAOs was transmitted from the hilt to Li Hao's body. At this time, the dissipation of the power was much less, and it was more concentrated.As the sword moved, the small cave suddenly trembled. Li Hao had almost destroyed it!Li Hao hurriedly put away his sword, a hint of joy in his eyes.His cultivation level had not increased.His strength was also not much different from before.However, the power was more concentrated. This was one of the reasons. Secondly, the firmament sword had become more powerful. Compared to before, his explosive power should be much stronger. Furthermore, with the underhand technique, his concealment ability had also become much stronger.With this sort of sorting, he had achieved his goal.Although the consumption was huge ... This place was filled with treasures. Why would he care about this?"Next, I'll build more small worlds and perfect more Daoist mantras ... This way, I might be able to reach the peak of rank six very soon. I'll comprehend life, death, Nirvana, and resurrection. Rank six won't be too difficult!"Li Hao let out a breath. He had finally completed the initial fusion of his own powers. This path might still be long, but he would make it.He laughed and walked out of the cave in an instant.He concealed a portion of his aura and flew toward the forest great world.But this simple sorting and opening of the boundary had taken him more than a month. In the chaos, Li Hao realized that time was not worth much.It had been almost two years since he last opened a Stargate.After two years, he had only advanced from a first level venerable sovereign to a fourth level venerable sovereign.

Chapter 2862 Poverty Makes Me Rise (1)
With the long sword in hand, the great Dao was contained within.The embryonic form of the myriad worlds appeared. Of course, it would be an exaggeration to say that Li Hao had only created several hundred embryonic forms of worlds. He was still far from the so-called myriad worlds.Moreover, it was only a prototype.It was not a real world!The small ones were only three to five square meters, and the big ones were only thousands of acres in size. If such a world were to be told to others, the venerable sovereigns would laugh their heads off.Of course, if the hundreds of embryonic worlds were all presented and merged into one ... No venerable sovereigns would mock Li Hao.For venerable sovereigns, even if it was not a world, it was at least hundreds of domains.In the eyes of ordinary venerable sovereigns, domain was exclusive to the seventh rank.Moreover, Li Hao was still very young.Even though two years had passed in the chaos, he was only 24 years old now. There was still a long way to go before he turned 25.……The forest great world.As a major world, its territory was very large. Under normal circumstances, the major world was called the bed universe. It covered a large area and would exceed the local world. It would also cover the area outside the local world.This was the domain range of the realm Lord and Dao Lord.Just like red Moon master, he could descend into the area covered by the bed universe at any time. Although he didn't dare to descend last time, it didn't mean that he couldn 't.The coverage area of a universe called bed was often the key to measuring the strength of a great cosmos absolute being.The more powerful a world was, the more it would expand and cover, displaying its authority.As for the forest great world, you couldn't feel any aura from outside the world.This meant that the other party had not expanded the universe of the great path, or even could not expand it. It could only contain a world inside. This also meant that the other party might not be able to expand it, or the universe of the great path might not be stable, so it had to shrink its scope.Every realm had a realm gate.Some realm gates would be closed, while some would not ... There was almost no such thing as a closed realm in a large world. A closed realm was also a sign of weakness. Under normal circumstances, the Lord of a large world was not afraid of anyone. Even if an eighth-rank venerable sovereign dared to enter a seventh-rank large world, he would have to give up his home ground advantage and might be defeated.The forest world also had a realm gate.But at this moment, the realm gate was tightly shut.No one was allowed to enter!However, near the realm gate, some cracks seemed to have appeared. It seemed that it could not be completely suppressed, causing small cracks to appear in the entire realm. At least, people could enter.There were venerable sovereigns of the Senlan great world standing guard near these cracks.It was a macro world after all, so there were quite a few venerable sovereigns. Although they were not as powerful as those in level eight macro worlds, which had more than 100 venerable sovereigns, Senlan still had 20 to 30 venerable sovereigns.Among them, there were seven to eight middle-stage venerable sovereigns. To any medium-level world, this was a force that they could not compete with. It was only slightly weaker in the great world.At that moment, in the cracks of the wall of the world, almost all venerable sovereigns were present to prevent enemies from sneaking in.However ... There were a few cracks that were somewhat special.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ The expert in charge didn't seem to be monarch Sen LAN. He seemed to be from the outside world ... Or even from Hong Yue!Hong Yue's powerhouse of the seventh step had indeed been severely injured.However, as a great world with more than 100 venerable sovereigns, there were many middle-stage venerable sovereigns, even more than the entire forest world. One could imagine the difference between great worlds.These rifts, which were guarded by outsiders, became the passages for some people to come and go.……Within the forest great world.On one side, there was a broken Dao universe with flowing Dao rivers and twinkling stars. Most of the Dao universes were like this. However, at this moment, the stars in this universe were shaking, and it was turbulent.The Dao River was also roaring madly, as if it would extinguish at any moment.A dignified venerable sovereign in a yellow robe was sitting in the river of the path, suppressing the world. His face was slightly pale, and his eyes were cold and fierce.He knew everything that had happened to Senlan recently.However, he was unable to fight back.As the weakest existence in the great world, they had given birth to a Dao master and a world Lord respectively. This caused the two sides to be unwilling to unite and fight each other as equals. This also caused the forces of the great world to be divided into two.In the end, Dao master Sen LAN was unwilling to accept this. He felt that the neo martial artists had just risen and were suppressed by the Crimson Moon. He actually had the idea of hunting the neo martial human King and obtaining the power of the neo martial so that he could advance to the seventh rank. Then, he could defeat the realm Lord when he returned and complete the world unity.However...That idiot was easily killed in the primal Chaos. Now that he was dead, the Senlan realm Lord couldn't be happier. More importantly, that guy was dead, but the great Dao was in turmoil.It wasn't much to begin with. Given some time, he could complete the unification of the world's great Dao and even step into Level Seven in one go!However ... Chaos was a meddlesome presence!One of the reasons was that tianfang's incident had killed several of the Crimson Moon's seventh rank-7s, and the Crimson Moon's power was not as strong as before.Second, Red Moon had been cooperating with many parties, but now, Red Moon had suffered heavy losses. In order to make up for its losses, it might try to rope in other macro worlds to cooperate with them, but it was coveting Sen LAN.Hong Yue's intention was obvious.They didn't say or do anything. They just used the excuse that Senlan's defense wasn't strong enough, so they sent a few middle-stage venerable sovereigns to help you suppress some world rifts out of good intentions.If you accept it, you'll fall into the trap.If you don't accept it ... These venerable sovereigns on the surface might become venerable sovereigns in the dark. The key was that without the deterrence of the Crimson Moon, Senlan might be attacked by the chaos Rangers.

Chapter 2863 Poverty Makes Me Rise (2)
The so-called Ranger ... Everyone knew in their hearts whether or not he was."He's forcing me!"At this moment, while suppressing the DAOs of the heavens and earth, the Senlan realm Lord spoke coldly,""That person has suffered great losses, and now he's almost completely revealed his power! We only have two paths. First, we take the initiative to join them and rely on them, integrating into the world and the Dao universe. He might give me a chance to enter Level Seven. ""Second, they still want some face. They won't take the initiative to make things difficult so as not to make others feel sad. However, they will instigate and even control the so-called Chaos to attack Senlan and force me to compromise! At that time, if we don't compromise, Senlan won't be able to leave!"Around him, there were seven or eight venerable sovereigns, some of whom were middle-rank and some of whom were low-rank. They were all his trusted subordinates.There was also a portion that was suppressing the rift, and another portion that was suppressing the chaos in the world.Some of them were the confidants of the previous Dao master, but they were now marginalized.And these confidants of the Daoist realmlord were also the key to Hong Yue's invasion. These guys were afraid that the forest orchid realm Lord would purge the opposition, so they took the initiative to contact Hong Yue.The Senlan realm Lord looked at the other venerable sovereigns beside him."Do you all wish to integrate into the type 8 world?"Among the venerable sovereigns, one of them replied in a deep voice,""Of course I'm not!"Even though he said that, the realmlord knew that there would definitely be people who were willing.Here, he was also a subordinate.Wasn't it the same after merging with the Crimson Moon?The red moon was still a rank eight world. This time, they had suffered a great loss. Three rank Sevens had died, and they needed manpower. Although the red moon seemed to have suffered a great loss, the rank eight master of the red moon was still there. To the venerable sovereigns, the overall strength of the red moon world was not too terrible.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ As a result, this was the opportunity to merge with the Crimson Moon.The ones who were truly unwilling were probably the realm Lord and a few venerable sovereigns who were unwilling to let their world be annexed. The rest were mostly indifferent.The forest orchid realm Lord continued to suppress the great Dao as he spoke,""I don't care if you really think so or just patronizing me, it doesn't matter! I just want to say that if I can stabilize the forest great Dao, I can take the opportunity to enter rank-7. Once I enter rank-7, the great Dao will be stable and the world will become one. Everyone present will definitely rise! Those at the fourth step can advance to the fifth step, and those at the fifth step have the chance to advance to the sixth step!"He looked around and said slowly,"at that time, I'll be a seventh level venerable sovereign, and you'll all be stronger. Even if you really want to integrate into the red moon ... Should you integrate now as a defeated Army or do you want to integrate when the morale is high and the soldiers are strong?""Hong Yue lost three rank seven venerable sovereigns! "If you merge with me when I'm advancing to the seventh step, I won't take the seventh step spot. On the contrary, if you merge with me, you'll strengthen Hong Yue because of my seventh step strength. Hong Yue, in addition to me, has to give me a seventh step spot! That way, we can attract more powerhouses and make up for our losses!"These words were not like fishing for the moon in the water. That was the truth.If Sen LAN merged with them, she would only be able to give sector Lord Sen LAN a spot at the stage 7 realm. There was a limit to the number of Stage 7 experts in a stage 8 world, so there was no way she could get a second one.However, once Senlan fused with her seventh step power ... At that time, it would be a strong Alliance, and they would have to pay an even greater price.The forest orchid sector Lord continued,"even if I broke through to the 7th stage, I still won 't. If I really do, I'll definitely be a 7th stage expert!" Even now, it was still the same. But I hope Senlan will be better!"He looked at the crowd and said in a gentler voice,""You're all venerable sovereigns who have lived for countless years. You should know this! Now, bowing and scraping to Hongyue can't be exchanged for any status or wealth. On the contrary, I, Sen LAN, can only get more benefits if I show a bit of fierceness!""Hongyue doesn't dare to invade Senlan, because ... There are Yueming, tianlan, and cangjiang worlds nearby. If you destroy Senlan today, what about tomorrow? Who would still dare to cooperate? The Crimson Moon ended their own lives in the chaos, and no one dared to work with them anymore. ""Therefore, we must face this crisis together. We must defeat the stragglers and kill them. We must use the power of their great DAOs to make up for our losses! We can even kill some Red Moon sovereign and let them know that Senlan is not to be trifled with!""Surrendering on one's knees and defeating the opponent while standing, only to surrender in the end because there's no way to turn the situation around ... These two are different! In the primordial chaos, only when you hurt your opponents will they respect you!"The venerable sovereigns were all thinking.They weren't stupid, they knew what the realmlord meant.The sector Lord was right ... But there was one thing, if they really reached Level Seven, would the sector Lord still be willing to surrender to Red Moon?That might not be the case!Of course, if they could really enter a level Seven great world, they might not be willing to integrate into Crimson Moon. Crimson moon's competition was too strong, and outsiders were outsiders, after all.After thinking about it carefully, perhaps protecting Senlan was indeed more in line with everyone's interests.Soon, the venerable sovereigns spoke again,""Realmlord is right!" The forest orchid sector Lord didn't say much.Some things were better when they were said.He was just like the others,"why should I surrender when I've really reached the seventh step?"However, if they really surrendered when they reached the seventh step ... Of course, it would meet his expectations, and red Moon would pay an even greater price. In short, it would definitely not be a loss to keep Senlan and reach the seventh step.

Chapter 2864 Poverty Makes Me Rise (3)
He only hoped that the venerable sovereigns in front of him would have more fighting spirit.They didn't collapse when they heard that Red Moon had a crush on them.Then Senlan really couldn't hold on.He still had to spend a lot of energy to suppress and merge the great DAOs. Whether he could kill the venerable sovereigns in the outside world depended on these people."Whether it's the Crimson Moon or the wandering sea, there's nothing to be afraid of!""The strongest among them is only at the sixth step. There will definitely be no seventh step cultivators! "As for the seventh-rank, he can either go to tianfang or suppress the local forces. There's only one seventh-rank cultivator left in Hongyue. Do you think he'll dare to take the risk to come to Senlan? Tier 6 is strong ... But don't forget, this is our home!""It's not like we can't suppress it at the critical moment!"His words were reasonable and the venerable sovereigns nodded in agreement again."Everyone, I'm in trouble now. I still need to suppress the great Dao, so ... I'll leave my safety in your hands!"This was his true goal.The venerable sovereigns were also very solemn. "I'll definitely do my best to fight for Senlan!"The forest orchid sector Lord nodded and didn't say anything more.Whether or not it was as they said, it would depend on the situation."Besides, if these guys don't listen to me and choose to join the red moon ... I, a level Seven, won't be able to run away. You people, think carefully. Even if you reach the red moon, you'll only be middle and low level venerable sovereigns. You'll see them all the time. When that time comes ... You'll bear the consequences!""You guys can leave first. I'll suppress this place!""Yes, sir!"The venerable sovereigns left quickly. The current great path universe was much better than before.When the path master had died, it had been truly chaotic.After all, he had survived the most dangerous moment. This was one of the reasons why he was so confident. If this had happened when the new martial artist Ren Wang had just killed the Dao master, he would have been in a difficult position."But right now, I'm in the right place. Those itinerant cultivators also want a share of the loot. Why don't they look at themselves in the mirror!……The forest world was in turmoil.Outside the forest world.Li Hao pondered for a while, but he was not in a hurry to enter. He was observing and waiting.After observing for a while, he did not hide his whereabouts. Soon, someone came directly across the void. It must be a venerable sovereign.The expert surrounded Li Hao for a while before he carefully approached.""Fellow Daoist, do you want to enter the forest orchid world?"Li Hao understood.As expected!He had guessed that the turmoil in Senlan was caused by someone secretly plotting something. 90% of it was the Crimson Moon world, and 10% was the surrounding macro worlds. It seemed like it was just as he had thought."Not bad!"Li Hao nodded and looked at the man. He was a venerable sovereign, but he looked a little shifty.p After taking a closer look ... Good Lord, isn't this just a mouse?A mouse could also become an Emperor? Well, even a cat could become a seventh rank venerable sovereign, so what if a mouse became a monarch?This universe was really rich in species. It seemed that there was a rat world where rats were Kings!Li Hao didn't waste any words. He directly said,""I want to enter. Does fellow Daoist have a way?""Of course!"The rat spirit also smiled slyly and pinched his fingers.""But ...""How many Dao crystals?"The rat spirit seemed to have understood the situation. He glanced at Li Hao again, and his eyes seemed to be shining. He smiled slyly and said,""It's not expensive, not expensive at all. 1000 great Dao crystals.""Rob?"Li Hao looked at the rat spirit and said.1,000. A first level venerable sovereign would take three years to form.It wasn't robbery, but it wasn't cheap."Fellow Daoist's words are wrong! A mere 1000 great Dao crystals ... Everyone knows what they're after in the forest orchid world. If they're lucky, they can become a great Dao universe or a great world!""Do you think I'm someone who can seize a great world?"Li Hao looked at it and chuckled."I'm here to join in the fun and see if there's any soup. I can take some cheap stuff, but it's life-threatening. 100 pills. I'll go and take a look."The rat spirit shook his head, as if he was in a difficult position.Li Hao, however, was in no hurry.All of you can't wait for the other side to be in a mess, with one more venerable sovereign and more trouble.If you don't want to charge me, I should just go in.It was normal for them to be so calculative. It was not easy for itinerant cultivators to earn money. Even venerable sovereigns were struggling to make ends meet. Those who were particularly generous were either experts or people from various forces.A true wandering cultivator was extremely stingy.Although Li Hao did not wander the chaos like the unaffiliated cultivators, he had traveled with them before. Ming Hao, who was a level four venerable sovereign, was extremely stingy all the way. He was afraid that his power of great DAOs would leak out and be taken advantage of when he cultivated.Which true wandering cultivator wasn't like this?As for venerable the sword and the others, Li Hao didn't say much. They were all experienced. People like Kong Ji were not like unaffiliated cultivators. Venerable the sword ... Was even more unaffiliated than unaffiliated cultivators. Li Hao didn't need to worry about him at all.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ "Fellow Daoist, one hundred pills is too little. You have to know that we are also taking a risk ..." The rat spirit was in a difficult position." 1000 is fine too!"Li Hao sent a message."However, you must give me the complete information on the forest world. All the information on venerable sovereigns, including the strength and origins of the venerable sovereigns who came earlier ..."The rat spirit cursed in his heart!You're dreaming!Where did this acrid rogue cultivator come from?I'll give you 1000 Dao crystals. Do you think your Dao crystals are more fragrant than others?"Fellow Daoist, we can't collect this either ...""Then 100 pills it is!"

 Li Hao dawdled, and the rat spirit cursed again.This guy was really stingy.I think I'm stingy enough, but I met someone even stingier.However, the higher-ups had ordered that the venerable sovereigns who came here ... Were all sent to Senlan. The more venerable sovereigns there were, the faster the friction would be, and the more trouble Senlan would have!You can enter without paying.Of course, it was just a token of appreciation. The income was also the side income of the venerable sovereigns.Chaos only talked about benefits. Without benefits, no one could do anything.“500!”“100!”"Fellow Daoist, please add a little more. Can't you even waste a year in the great world? 300!""Alright!" Li Hao nodded after some thought.The rat spirit heaved a sigh of relief. What bad luck. It was really a headache to meet a stingy rogue cultivator.Just as he was about to take the money, Li Hao said, I'll pay you when we get in!The rat spirit was speechless and didn't say anything.As a venerable sovereign, he wouldn't go so far as to agree and go back on his words about the hundreds of Dao crystals.He led Li Hao around the boundary wall of the Senlan great world. After a long while, they stopped. Li Hao looked in one direction and saw a crack in the boundary wall.The rat spirit smiled slyly."Fellow Daoist, you can see it. It wasn't easy for us to circle the entire macro world and fight with another group before we managed to seize this crack ..."Li Hao nodded and didn't say anything.They were all smart people. Who were they trying to fool? why did they have to find an excuse? if it wasn't the Crimson Moon's powerhouses who were secretly supporting him, it was the powerhouses from the surrounding macro worlds.There were also two venerable sovereigns guarding the crack.Including this rat spirit, there were a total of three venerable sovereigns. Although they were all low-level venerable sovereigns, it was still a luxurious arrangement!Soon, Li Hao arrived at the crack.The remaining two venerable sovereigns also quickly walked out of the crack and glanced at the rat spirit. The rat spirit seemed to have sent a message to them, and the two venerable sovereigns sized Li Hao up. It was difficult to judge his strength, but he seemed to be a low-level cultivator.Carrying a sword on one's back ... A true sword principle expert couldn't see the sword. For venerable sovereigns, those who were equipped with weapons were either very strong or ... Very weak.Top venerable sovereigns, such as the human King, carried a blade. Everyone knew that this blade was powerful and could not be provoked.However, the weapons that low-level venerable sovereigns were equipped with were usually low-level sovereign weapons or they were not used to fighting with Daoist skills. A weak sovereign weapon was sometimes a burden and limited the use of Daoist skills.Very, very strong ... That did not exist.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ He didn't have the aura of the great path universe. After a while, a dog-headed venerable sovereign looked at Li Hao with a smile.""Fellow Daoist, how should I address you?""You still want to check his family background?""That's not it! It's just that I can see that fellow Daoist is also wandering in the chaos. If we are fated in the future, although the chaos is large, we may have the opportunity to meet again and perhaps cooperate ..."Li Hao nodded."That's right. I'm from the world of myriad DAOs. You can call me myriad DAOs ..."The venerable sovereigns didn't change their expressions, but they were cursing in their hearts.Myriad Dao Emperor?His tone wasn't small!Of course, it was normal.The venerable sovereigns in small worlds were inexperienced. When they first came out of their worlds, they thought they were the boss of chaos. The venerable sovereigns they met were all called different names, let alone the myriad Dao sovereign.The lower the level of the world, the more arrogant it was.Wargod, undying, unparalleled ...These venerable sovereigns had all kinds of names. Some of them were indeed invincible in small worlds, but they only understood after coming out that they had no say in this chaos."Fellow Daoist Wan!"The dog-headed venerable sovereign gave a perfunctory smile and said nothing more.He pointed at the crack behind him and said,"this is the crack to enter the Senlan world. After you enter, you'd better keep a low profile and be careful. After all, the Senlan world is a great world and there are many venerable sovereigns here. There are seven or eight of them who are at the middle stage ... They are all existences that we can't afford to offend!"Li Hao nodded."Thank you for your guidance!"Without saying much, he stepped into the crack and took out 300 great Dao crystals. He counted them one by one before handing them to the rat spirit.Then, he stepped into the world aperture and entered the forest orchid world.After he left, the rat spirit couldn't help but ridicule,""This guy is really ... Stingy to the extreme! It's only 300 great Dao crystals. On any other day, you want to enter a great world with such a small price?"The dog-headed man ignored him. The last venerable sovereign beside him imprinted Li Hao's appearance, aura, Daoist name, and strength on a bronze mirror.In any case, it wasn't level one. If it was level one, the aura wouldn't be so stable.The information on the bronze mirror quickly disappeared.At this time, the third venerable sovereign said in a deep voice,""Alright, it's not important to earn some extra money! Send in as many venerable sovereigns as you encounter, and we'll get benefits for every venerable sovereign we send in!"The other two nodded."You two, how long do you think it'll take for Senlan to become chaotic?" the rat spirit carefully transmitted his voice.The battle between the macro worlds was extremely dangerous for them.The dog-headed person transmitted a message."It won't be too long. The Crimson Moon will definitely want to settle this quickly and take down Senlan to recover their strength. Will the Crimson Moon not care about tianfang?" The neo martial human King, Yunxiao, and Guangming have all gone. Now, it's said that the tianfang great Dao universe is about to officially recover. The neo martial human King is still at the seventh-rank, but he has already killed many of their seventh-rank venerable sovereigns. If he reaches the eighth-rank ... Do you think Hongyue won't be afraid?"

As soon as he said this, the last one shouted,""Be careful with your words, this place is not far from the Crimson Moon!"The dog-headed man didn't say anything.In any case, it judged that chaos would erupt soon.It wouldn't be too long.Would Red Moon Lord dare to leave if he did not quickly take down Senlan, make up for his losses, and take in a tier 7?If he didn't dare to leave, he would leave Tian Fang alone?That was impossible!It probably wouldn't take long for a battle between venerable sovereigns to break out in Senlan. This time, no one knew how many venerable sovereigns would die.The dog-headed man sighed and transmitted his voice,""Recently, the four regions have been in chaos! How many venerable sovereigns had died? The battle between new martial arts and Crimson Moon lasted for more than fifty years. How many worlds have they destroyed? with the death of a rank-7, there are as many as five rank-7!"He shook his head helplessly.Seventh-rank!He was an invincible existence.However, in a short two years, five tier 7 experts had died. It was terrifying to the extreme.The rat spirit also sighed with emotion,'that's right, even more of the remaining ones died! "In addition, we have to be careful. It's said that neo martial was the one who killed the awakening God venerable sovereign at the edge of the Crimson Moon, not far from here! That new martial is not to be trifled with. Now that Red Moon has suffered a great loss, I'm afraid they'll come directly. ""It's unlikely. The neo martial world's human King is in Tian Fang.""Aren't you afraid that he'll come back?""He doesn't know the way ...""Are you an idiot or is he an idiot? You really believed it?" The rat spirit felt that the dog-headed man was an idiot."He really doesn't know the way. He's killing one person at a time, but he doesn't come to the Crimson Moon? Crimson Moon is a level 8 world with the largest range of influence, but he just doesn't come here. He just goes to kill the other world Lords related to Crimson Moon. Do you believe that?"The dog-headed man didn't say anything. He just shook his head.It didn't matter whether he believed it or not.The important thing was that neo martial said so, and the neo martial human King himself said so. What could he say?A few low-level venerable sovereigns could only gossip. As for whether the new martial artists dared to come directly ... There were several great worlds nearby, which were at least safer than the chaos.Once Senlan fell into chaos, they would run away and watch the show in other worlds. Who would risk their lives here?……It was as if heaven and earth had been split open.As soon as Li Hao appeared, powerful consciousnesses locked onto him.Many people!The appearance of a venerable sovereign would also attract the attention of many people.In an instant, Li Hao sensed the auras of at least 30 venerable sovereigns.There were too many!Although Senlan was huge, much bigger than the Silver Moon, and couldn't see the end of it, and his perception couldn't cover the entire world, he could still sense 30 venerable sovereigns within the range of his perception, which was really terrifying.Senlan wasn't Tian Fang.This was a world with an owner.However, Li Hao sensed that there were some fluctuations in the great Dao universe. It seemed that the sector Lord might not have the time to care about them. Of course, there was a possibility that the other party had set a trap.He wanted to catch all of these wandering cultivators in one fell swoop and make up for his losses. The chaos was cruel.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ If he was not careful, it was normal for him to be killed and filled up the great Dao universe.Li Hao didn't sense the auras of the sword Saint and the other two. He didn't know where the other two at the sixth step were hiding. However, Li Hao sensed the location of Qian Wuliang and the other two.He heaved a sigh of relief.It was still alright.Since he was here, there shouldn't be a problem. What he was afraid of was that he couldn't sense anything here. He might have been captured by the red moon. Now that he could sense it here, it was a good thing.The entire forest world was filled with a chaotic aura.Some of the venerable sovereigns concealed their auras, while some didn't conceal their auras at all. It felt as if they were provoking and looking for trouble.Li Hao didn't even look at the auras of the venerable sovereigns approaching him and quickly fled.He flew toward the direction of Qian Wuliang and the others.It was much easier and easier to travel through the void in a major world than in the primordial chaos.…… "Li Hao is here!"At this moment, in a luxurious courtyard in a city, Lin Hongyu suddenly spoke.As venerable sovereigns, it was no secret that they had entered this place.It was not a secret, so there was no need to make himself suffer.In this huge city, it was too easy to buy a big house. Countless cultivators would fight to sell a great Dao crystal.Hearing Lin Hongyu's words, the few of them were overjoyed.Even King Huai and Heaven's Fate heaved a sigh of relief.Li Hao was here!He was here, but where was venerable the sword?If venerable the sword was here ... This was a group of fierce people who could kill a seventh rank. They suddenly felt confident. Recently, this place was in turmoil. The aura of venerable sovereigns was everywhere. Although there were many venerable sovereigns here, they were also a little afraid.After all, they were only initial-stage venerable sovereigns.Moreover, he was under the eyes of the red moon."It's good news that the Silver Moon King has arrived,"King Huai said with a flattering smile." We have hope now. "Qian Wuliang glanced at him secretly but didn't say anything.He was helpless against this old senior who kept snatching his job, so he couldn't say anything.However, he thought that when Li Hao arrived, he would have to flatter him first since he was the one who had been following Silvermoon elder all this time.Lin Hongyu could only sense it for a moment.A moment later, a figure appeared in the courtyard.The venerable sovereigns 'eyes flickered as they quickly walked out of the courtyard.There were many venerable sovereigns gathered here.On Silver moon's side, there were seven venerable sovereigns including Qian Wuliang, Hong Yitang, Black Panther, Lin Hongyu, and the three who had come to seek refuge with them. In addition to the celestial pole's doppelganger, celestial pole himself, and King Huai, there were ten of them.Li Hao was stunned.

Chapter 2867 Poverty Makes Me Rise (1)
He glanced at the two Heaven's Fate experts. Although their appearances and auras had changed to avoid suspicion ..."Seniors ... What ... Is this for?" Li Hao was a little confused.The celestial pole and King Huai had both merged into the river of the path, so why did they not merge?At this moment, why did he still have to create a clone?Are you bored?Or could it be that the celestial pole clone had thoughts of rebelling?He did not understand.Did something happen to his clone?The celestial pole clone rolled his eyes and said unhappily,""Why? There's no reason, but I'm just curious. Since ancient times, have you ever thought that there's someone who's not willing to take control of themselves, but let their avatar take control of themselves?"Li Hao was startled. What did he mean?"He wants me to be the leader!" The celestial pole clone said.“……”Li Hao was stunned for a moment, then looked at Empyrean terminus's original body.Empyrean terminus's original body had a relaxed expression as he chuckled,"Now that I've fused with Silver Moon, I don't know much about him. In neo martial ... I'm mainly in charge of bringing up the rear and don't really enter the chaos. When I saw my avatar training in Silver Moon for a hundred thousand years, I thought that it would be more convenient for me to do things if my avatar's consciousness was in control. Who would have thought that he wouldn't be willing!"“……”The surrounding people were all speechless and didn't speak.These two people ... No, this one was really a weirdo!Even Li Hao was dazed for a moment.He understood!The clone asked the main body to absorb it, but the main body refused and insisted on letting the clone's consciousness take control. The two ... No, the main body was in a deadlock and was unwilling to merge.'F * ck, did I hear it wrong or are you serious?'I know that heaven's extreme laziness, but ... It's not that bad, right?Even though he would still be one person after the fusion.However, if his clone was the one in charge, he would definitely have a different attitude toward Silver Moon since he had been with the latter for a hundred thousand years.If the main body was the leader, he would definitely be closer to neo martial if he stayed there. This was inevitable.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ Li Hao had never thought of letting Heaven's Fate's clone take control of it. Subconsciously, he thought that his main body would take back his clone.In the end ... What was going on!At this moment, even King Huai felt a little embarrassed. Just as he was about to say something, Qian Wuliang saw this and quickly said with a smile,"Lord Marquis, you've just arrived and must be tired. Why don't you go in and rest for a while and have a cup of tea? By the way, isn't it a bit inappropriate for Lord Marquis to come and meet up with us?"“……”King Huai glanced at Qian Wuliang, smiled, and didn't say anything. As a veteran expert who was very flexible, he had to be careful with his words in front of this unfamiliar Silver Moon King. He didn't want to start a conflict with the old man as soon as he arrived, so he remained very quiet and didn't say a word.Qian Wuliang, who was a bit interested at the beginning, soon turned stiff.This guy was really difficult to deal with!He had great patience and wasn't panicking at all.Li Hao didn't care about this and nodded slightly.""Let's go in first. I'm just a low-level venerable sovereign. Of course, there was a team. It was very normal! It's normal for teams to gather. Otherwise, would a group of low-rank venerable sovereigns dare to come in and get a share?""You're wise, Marquis!"Qian Wuliang laughed hurriedly.Li Hao ignored him and glanced at the others. Qian Wuliang and Hong Yitang were still at Level 2, and even Empyrean terminus himself had reached Level 2.Two Dao Masters were the limit.Two neo martial experts had merged into the Dao River, and these two Dao Masters had not entered the third stage. It could be seen that the difficulty of advancing the Dao universe was still very high.But now, a group of second stage venerable sovereigns had appeared.Only Lin Hongyu and Yi were only first level venerable sovereigns.After entering the main hall of the courtyard, Li Hao took the main seat. Heaven's Fate and King Huai didn't want to sit on the remaining two main seats at all, so they were pushed to the other side.After all, he was a senior of neo martial arts, so it was necessary to be polite."Seniors, I've suffered quite a bit of loss from merging with the river of the path. It's a pity."Li Hao sighed with emotion. He had actually fused with a stage three Heaven's Fate. It was actually a good thing that his clone had not fused with it. Even if he did, there was no hope of advancing."It's nothing," Empyrean terminus's true body laughed carefreely."There's not much difference to us if it's a level two or level three." "How's the sword Saint?"he asked."It's pretty good!"Tian Ji nodded. That was good.It seemed that old Li had not suffered any injuries.In the next moment, Li Hao said telepathically,""We only have one goal for this trip, and that is to get rid of Senlan! He didn't give the Crimson Moon a chance to recover or grow stronger! Block the surveillance of the Crimson Moon world, this is what we have to do. "After saying that, Li Hao cut to the chase and said,""Investigate the location of all the rifts, seize control of the rifts, and seal them! We won't allow outsiders to enter and exit at will, and we'll monitor them as we please!""We have more people, and that's the advantage. We can split up and move. There's also an advantage for everyone to merge into the Dao River ... We can use our strength in one place and use the Dao River to cover and seal the crack!"As soon as he said this, Heaven's Fate and King Huai looked at each other and secretly complained.As expected, this kind of person was born to be the seed of chaos.Good Lord, as soon as he came, he began to arrange tasks. He didn't say anything unnecessary. In any case, he went straight to the great world and seized it!He's so F * cking cruel!"On our side, other than me, there are 10 venerable sovereigns, including senior heaven pole's clone!""Even if there are many venerable sovereigns here, 10 of them are at the second level. It's not a weak force!"

"I'm not sure about venerable sword's arrangement, but the crack is a simple task. We'll take it first. Otherwise ... We might have to fight with middle-stage venerable sovereigns. Between celestial pole and senior Huai King, which one do you choose to complete?"When the two heard this, they groaned again.Good fellow, he has figured us out.Of course, we don't want to fight with a middle-stage venerable sovereign!Since that was the case, sealing the crack was naturally his first choice. Although this guy didn't talk much, he went straight to the core as soon as he came.The two of them looked at each other, and Heaven's Fate was a little depressed."Of course it's to seal the crack!""That's good!"Li Hao nodded and smiled.After saying that, he continued,"then let's split up. By the way, King Huai and Qian Wuliang should go and rope in some itinerant cultivators. The chaos Wanderer. Low-level ones will do!" We have a lot of people, and we're all venerable sovereigns, so we're not nameless people. If we don't make some noise here, others will think that we're planning something bigger!""For the people you've roped in, think about how you should say it and how you should lie to them!""Black Panther, go get close to some chaos beasts. They're a race after all ..."As soon as Li Hao arrived, he quickly assigned everyone.Get ready to work!He didn't want to waste too much time in Senlan, as it was meaningless. He wanted to get straight to the point. He wanted to take down Senlan, escape from Senlan, and continue to harm the next world. He needed too much energy now.The embryonic form of the world had been formed, and Li Hao was only lacking energy.Countless amounts of energy!A great path universe, a great world, obviously had extremely sufficient energy. Hong Yue needed to consider the perception of the outside world, but he didn't need to. Even if the perception was bad, it was the impression of the new martial artists to the outside world, and it had nothing to do with him.Everyone saw that he was swift and decisive, so they didn't say much and could only accept their orders.After everyone else had received their missions, Li Hao finally looked at Lin Hongyu.""Go into seclusion for a while and don't participate in this. Recently, I have some enlightenment about life and death. You can enter my long river and comprehend it!"Lin Hongyu was stunned for a moment, then she nodded slightly. She understood that she was too weak.She didn't say much. Since that was the case, she just had to become stronger.Soon, a group of venerable sovereigns left the courtyard and went to work. The actions of the venerable sovereigns here also attracted the attention of many people. There were already many venerable sovereigns here, and today, with the arrival of a sword-carrying man, the venerable sovereigns were dispatched in the blink of an eye. Obviously, many people had also judged that the leader of these people had arrived!Before this, they were all first and second level venerable sovereigns. Obviously, this new one might be a third level venerable sovereign.For a time, this force also became the target of attention of all parties in the forest orchid.When had such a low-ranked wandering cultivator group appeared in the primordial chaos?Li Hao, on the other hand, was sitting in the hall with a peace of mind, waiting for the people who might come.Red Moon?Senlan?A powerful rogue cultivator? Anyway, there will definitely be people who will come to rope us in. A group of low-level venerable sovereigns are still venerable sovereigns. It's impossible for them to remain indifferent when such a force has emerged.As for venerable the sword and empty silence, Li Hao didn't know where they were or what they were preparing for. But if they were ready, they would come to find him.Senlan, eat it!"Even ... I want to sneak into the Crimson Moon and eat it, but not now. There are changes in tianfang. The level 8 master has left. This is an opportunity. At this moment, Li Hao's ambition seems to have grown a lot.The main reason was ... He was too poor.For a moment, he was filled with emotions.Being poor was indeed the driving force of struggle.In order to create the infinite worlds, he was too short of resources. He didn't realize this before and thought that he didn't lack money. He killed many venerable sovereigns and I was a rich man, but in the end, I hit rock bottom. I'm poor, haha!No wonder venerable the sword and the others were so motivated. They might not be poorer than me.The power of ten thousand worlds ... How many macro worlds do I have to destroy to gather it?  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ Li Hao thought to himself and sighed with emotion.

2869 Chapter 473
Li Hao didn't care about how venerable the sword and the others were preparing.At this moment, he was making arrangements according to his heart, even including the existence of the Forgotten Sword venerable and the others. This way, he could achieve his goal without the sword venerable and the others.He had only worked with venerable the sword once. Without venerable the sword, he would still be where he was today.He couldn't rely too much on the other party just because he was strong.If that was the case ... It wouldn't be easy for him to survive after he left.Not only did he have to become stronger, but he also had to strengthen the Silver Moon people. The current batch of Silver Moon venerable emperors was his capital. The two Dao Masters were the key to making these people catch up quickly. The Dao universe still had to become stronger.Many thoughts appeared in his mind.Li Hao closed his eyes and began to wait.……At the same time.The forest world.All around, the venerable sovereigns were waiting for an opportunity.The existence of Li Hao's group was no secret.There were quite a few people.There were many venerable sovereigns.Although there were no powerful venerable sovereigns, with so many venerable sovereigns, they could turn the situation around.However, at this moment, most of the cultivators were still waiting and watching.It was not until the sky was getting dark that a venerable sovereign entered the courtyard where Li Hao was.……"Venerable sovereign of myriad DAOs, I'm sorry for the sudden visit!"In the courtyard, a powerful existence descended.Tier 4!Middle-stage venerable sovereigns weren't considered weak anywhere.​ Li Hao opened his eyes and sensed something.He was not a rogue cultivator!The first to arrive was actually a cultivator from the forest world.The cultivators of this world only needed to sense the aura of the great Dao, and they were somewhat in harmony with the world. However, people like Li Hao were somewhat rejected when they entered other worlds.This was the advantage of being native."I've failed to welcome you!"Li Hao walked out of the courtyard and saw a Senlan Supreme Emperor standing opposite him. He looked young, and one could no longer judge a Supreme Emperor by his appearance. His age was not young, and he was smiling, but his eyes were filled with doubt.Venerable sovereigns were low-level venerable sovereigns, so it was normal that no one knew them.However, a team of independent cultivators with more than 10 venerable sovereigns ... It was sometimes difficult for a medium-sized world to produce so many venerable sovereigns at once, except for a great world. However, venerable sovereigns of great worlds all had the origin aura of their great worlds.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ Obviously, this group of people was not.Where did it come from?It was as if he had appeared out of thin air.Yi, Chan Xiu, and the others were not considered newcomers. They had traveled in the chaos before, but now that the three of them had integrated into the new Dao universe, appearance was secondary to venerable sovereigns. After integrating into the new Dao universe, their auras had changed.Even his daosource aura had changed, so it was naturally difficult to recognize him.At this level, no one would be able to judge who you were based on your appearance. Unless you were a top-notch existence in the chaos, no one would dare to impersonate you."Greetings, Dao friend Wan. My name is Ji Hao, and I come from the native land of Shenglan."Ji Hao.Li Hao nodded slightly and smiled.""Senior Ji Hao, please don't laugh at us. It is impolite of us to enter the forest orchid so rashly. However, we have heard that the forest orchid world has a beautiful environment and a special cultivation technique. We are looking forward to it, so we have come to take a look ..."This kind of farting excuse was useless whether he said it or not, but he still had to put on a show.You can't say that we're here because we saw your Dao master die and the great world is in turmoil, so we're here to get a share of the loot, right?Even though this was the truth, and everyone knew it.Ji Hao chuckled and nodded."Sen Lan's environment is indeed not bad. My world Overlord is using the all encompassing phenomena technique. He is indeed quite famous in the primal Chaos. It is worth a visit."After saying that, he followed Li Hao inside and said with a smile,""Our realm was able to give birth to a great Dao universe with the power of a sixth-tier great Dao. The boundless nature technique is a Dao origin technique that can go straight to the seventh-tier. Although cultivators of the Senlan realm are not as powerful as some well-known great worlds, among the middle and low-stage venerable sovereigns, our combat power is still one of the best ..."A level six world gave birth to a level Seven Dao universe.It was correct to say that they were the weakest in the great world.However, if the Dao techniques of this world were not powerful, then it would be a mistake. Other than a special place like the Silver Moon, the birth of a great Dao universe generally meant that a peak sixth level venerable sovereign had been born.In fact, the Silver Moon was also related to the venerable sword.Wasn't the sword Saint strong?Very strong!He had a deep understanding of the Dao, which was why the embryonic form of the Silvermoon great Dao universe was born.It was obvious that the sector Lord and the Dao Lord of the great world had a deep understanding of the great Dao.The relationship between a realm Lord and a Dao Lord was a little complicated once they were separated.One side controlled the great Dao universe, while the other controlled the world. The two sides actually relied on each other.For example, Black Panther and the two Dao Masters. Black Panther's Dao was actually not in the Dao universe, but in the Silver Moon world. When the Silver Moon world was strong, Black Panther would be strong. When the Dao universe was strong, the world would be strong. When the world was strong, the Dao universe would be strong too ...It was a process of mutual achievement.Both sides had limited each other, but they would also help each other.Whether it was the Dao Lord or the realm Lord who had contributed to the birth of the Dao universe was not certain. They might all have contributed.These words were also filled with deep meaning.Outsiders all thought that a sixth-stage venerable sovereign, who had given birth to a great Dao universe, was the weakest in a great world. However, this also meant that the realm Lord's combat power was unparalleled among sixth-stage venerable sovereigns. If the realm Lord had not died, with the two of them working together, even a seventh-stage venerable in Senlan would have to bear hatred!
