The core of the world.All the big shots gathered once again.As time passed, Li Hao obtained many more treasures last time. There were all kinds of Blood God clones, saintly way ones, Heavenly King-level ones, a large number of immortal-level ones, and 99 Heavenly King-level heavenly fragrance fruits ...These treasures had helped many experts to step into higher levels.Today, in the past three months, there had been a few more Dao integration cultivators. Zhao Shuguang and Qian Wuliang had both obtained the Heavenly King-level Blood God clones and reached the Dao integration realm one after another a month after Li Hao left.The one who was slightly later than the two wasn't the Silver Moon Martial Master but director Wang.Wang Ye, the director of the neo martial era and the first neo martial cultivator to convert to a new Dao, finally welcomed his own harvest. In this era, he stepped into the level of Dao integration and was comparable to a Sage.For this, director Wang was so excited that he couldn't control himself. He went to find a division commander and fought hundreds of rounds, but in the end, he was shaved bald and didn't come out for a few days.Three months after Li Hao's departure, the fourth Dao integration expert was born.Some of them were out of everyone's expectations. They were not sky sword and domineering blade, who everyone had high hopes for.p The fourth Dao integration expert was Dao Jian, who had been known as the number one genius in the past, but had kept a low profile since.Who was Dao Jian?In the past, there were countless transcendents in the central continent. Dao Jian was the number one genius in the night Watcher system, as well as the number one genius in the entire Heavenly Star!Dao Jian was very low-key. Big eyes, long spear, and battle blade were with him. The four of them were the top geniuses in the entire central continent at that time. Strictly speaking, Dao Jian was the first person to cultivate super abilities and advance to divine power.He wasn't a Martial Master and he didn't have a martial Dao Foundation. He was the first to reach the divine power level. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Divine abilities. The mountains and seas of today.Later, when Yao si joined the star military governor's office, these geniuses were suppressed by Li Hao. The Silver Moon Martial Master dominated the world, and the only one who was doing well among these pure supers was ... Qian Wuliang!Qian Wuliang was also a pure super!However, Li Hao didn't forget these people. Even Hu Qingfeng, who only knew how to flatter others and was almost killed in white moon City, was now a cultivator at the seventh level of the sun Moon realm.As for Dao sword, he had caught up from behind and actually surpassed Tian Jian and the others, stepping into the Dao integration level in one fell swoop! He was the seventh Dao integration stage super mighty figure under the command of Lin Hongyu, the earth-covered sword, Black Panther, Zhao Shuguang, gan Wuliang, and Wang Ye.The governor's office.On the main seat.Lin Hongyu looked at Dao Jian in silence. A gentleman was like jade ... Perhaps it was referring to people like Dao Jian, who were always so calm and composed. Li Hao actually felt the same way, but sometimes, Li Hao gave people a feeling of madness. Coupled with his ordinary background, he still had a wild temperament.As for the Taoist sword, it really had the elegant style of a gentleman like jade.He had always been like this. Back then, big eyes and the others didn't like Li Hao, but Dao Jian had always been gentlemanly and never competed with Li Hao."If Minister Yao was still here ... He would be very happy to see your achievements today!"Lin Hongyu said slowly,"when Minister Yao was alive, even though I didn't have much contact with him, I could feel his concern and concern for you!" The Marquis once said that the young men who were willing to go to SuperPower City with him are all future pillars!""Dao sword, you reaching the Dao integration stage ... I have to say that it's unexpected, but it's only natural!"Lin Hongyu complimented him with a look of admiration. She nodded and said,""You've been to the Dao universe. Do you think ... The Dao universe will benefit you greatly?""It's very big,"Dao Jian's voice was neither too loud nor too soft, it was just right as he said softly,""The key lies in Lord Marquis. To cultivate the Dao and not limit it, this kind of breadth of mind is rarely seen in the world! If the Dao universe hadn't been opened for us to enter and leave freely, I wouldn't have been able to advance to the Dao integration realm!"Lin Hongyu laughed and said,"that's true. In this world, there's only one person like the Marquis who opened up the great Dao universe ... Since ancient times! Even in the new martial era, the universe of origin is not open to the outside world. Those who are capable can enter by themselves, and those who are not ... Who would specially open a channel for you?"She smiled and continued,'now that you've reached the Dao integration stage, your combat power is no weaker than ours! Dao sword, after the daomerge, it's hard to cultivate the great Dao. I'll give you some missions, how about it?""As you command, commander!"Lin Hongyu nodded and said,"it's like this. The Heaven's Will is hidden now. It's difficult to detect it!" Before the Marquis went into seclusion, he once said that the will of heaven favors talented youths ... You are extremely talented, and you have cultivated your new Dao to an extremely powerful level. I want you to find out where the will of heaven is hiding, or who the will of heaven favors. This task is difficult for most people, so I hope you can give it a try. What do you think?"Dao Jian thought for a while and nodded,"sure, I have no objections!" However, I can be considered to have some talent. If the heavens ... Find me, what should I do?"Lin Hongyu smiled and said,"just accept it!" The Marquis was not afraid that someone on his side would be favored by the will of the heavens. As long as you did not hide anything, it would not be a problem even if your cultivation progressed at a tremendous pace! As long as we know, we will have a way to deal with it! Lord Marquis and the will of the heavens have won once, so he will win a second time!"

"Then I have no objections."Dao Jian agreed.Lin Hongyu nodded."Actually, I asked you to take it because I wanted you to lure heaven's will ... Of course, heaven's will is everywhere. This place is still safe. After we get out, there's no need to mention it again!" In short, the Heaven's Will is a threat. If it doesn't ... Then it's not a threat!"Dao Jian nodded again and didn't say much."That's it then ... Dao Jian, you can go first. Also, I'll give you a list of people who will be closely monitored!""Understood."Dao Jian didn't say much. He got up, bowed slightly, and left. After he left, some people in the hall looked at Lin Hongyu. Qian Wuliang's eyes flickered as he said,""Governor, Dao sword has improved so fast ... Do you think ..."Lin Hongyu laughed,"Dao sword is open and honest. It's within reason to improve quickly!" If he had concealed it, it would have been difficult for us to know that he had reached the Dao integration stage. Now that he's advancing so quickly, isn't he deliberately raising our suspicions? There's no need to be suspicious!"When these words came out, everyone didn't say anything else.Lin Hongyu continued,"the most important thing now is not heaven's will. The most important thing is that Ying Hongyue hasn't died yet ... Of course, it's hard for him to die either! The other one is the Queen of the West, the current heavenly deity, who has appeared in the West and is trying to gather the faith. She is extremely powerful. Previously, martial uncle Hong and I fought her once, but we were no match for her!""Of course, she's afraid of the Marquis, so she doesn't dare to be too ostentatious ... But we can't give her the chance to gather faith again. I want to join forces with all the neo martial Saints and expel her ... Expel her into the Li Dynasty. What do you all think?"“……”Everyone was speechless. It was the Li Dynasty again. Was he really not afraid of the Li Dynasty's wrath?However, since she had already said so, no one could refute her, so they didn't say anything.Lin Hongyu smiled and said,"then I'll negotiate with the new martial arts seniors ..."After arranging these things, he finally said,""Those who have reached the Dao integration stage, stay behind. The rest ... Can go do your own things!"Soon, the others left one after another.After everyone had left and there were only a few Dao integration experts left, Lin Hongyu said,""The Marquis is in secluded meditation, and we are in charge of all matters under heaven, no matter how big or small. It's all thanks to the Marquis 'hard work that you've all been able to reach the Dao integration stage. He's fought so hard for so many benefits for you that you're where you are today ...""We can't count on Lord Marquis to handle all matters, big or small. We ... Now have some strength, so it's time to do something."Everyone looked at her. What was she doing?Now that Hurricane city, the venerable sovereigns, and Li daoheng were not coming out, other than the half-crippled Ying Hongyue, the Li Dynasty, and the Queen who was causing trouble, there seemed to be nothing worth doing."Lord Marquis said that li Dao Heng is difficult to deal with, and Zheng Yu is difficult to deal with ... He also said that he hopes that we can keep up with his pace and not fall behind. He can not always count on Lord Marquis to lead us, as that will only make us a burden to him. No one wants this to happen!" n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Lin Hongyu chuckled and said,"I want to ... Kill Ying Hongyue!" It's very difficult to kill him in the true sense of the word, but there's still hope ... Even if I can't kill him, I'm going to seize the power of the Crimson Moon in his body, the more the better. I'm going to summon the lightning of the great Dao, the more the better! Only then will there be hope for continuous advancement!""The Marquis didn't mention it because he was worried that we wouldn't be able to defeat him ... But are you all really willing to let him live freely?"The few of them looked at each other. After a long time, Hong Yitang said,""I don't have any objections, but ...""He won't really die ... The red moon sovereign won't let him die, Zheng Yu won 't, and Li daoheng won't ... But we have to kill him with the intention of killing him! Perhaps we can lure out some unknown backup plans!"No one said anything more and nodded."It's decided then," Lin Hongyu continued."The Crimson Moon Power in his body will be the best resource for us to advance!""Everyone, go back and prepare ... This time, we must have the mentality of killing him. We must finish him off completely!" Everyone nodded and left.Qian Wuliang was about to leave when Lin Hongyu said to him,""You have another task, which is to monitor Dao sword. Dao sword has improved too fast. Of course, if there is a problem, you won't be able to see anything! In addition...Lord Marquis is benevolent and righteous. If there are some things that are inconvenient to do, we will do it for you! You don't have to take part in this hunt for Ying Hongyue. First, you have to keep an eye on Dao sword. Second, you have to communicate with the Saints of new martial arts and force the Queen into the Li Dynasty! Third, have the raincloud Army and the great desolate Army station themselves around the Cang mountains and be ready for battle at any time! "Fourth, while Lord Marquis isn't here, quickly integrate the powerful armies of the ancient cities into the military ... You go and speak. I represent Lord Marquis, and it's not convenient for me to speak!"Qian Wuliang felt helpless.He really ... Didn't treat people as people!"With this, I've even offended neo martial arts, Li Dynasty, Dao sword, shuiyun, Dahuang ...He really wasn't afraid of death!"After this ... You'll get a lot of benefits! Oh, right ..."Qian Wuliang's teeth ached!Wait, is there anything else?"If you're free, make a few more trips to Yuanping martial arts university ... The current Galaxy city. Bring Jiang Yingli and the others along and say that you're going to visit teachers and classmates ... Think of a way to win over the students of Yuanping martial arts university, including the other Saints ... Don't play any tricks. In short, I hope that these few people will become Saints under the command of the Heavenly Star military governor's office before the return of the Marquis!""This ...""What about director Zhang ..." Qian Wuliang had a headache."He doesn't care about these things. Don't worry!"You make it sound so simple!Qian Wuliang felt that although he could see through people's hearts, this woman was black-hearted and had no heart at all.Li Hao was quite generous and didn't care about these things.This one, on the other hand ... Wished that everyone in the world could only listen to Li Hao."Understood, I will do it, but after all, I'm only one person ...""I'll try my best!"Well, Qian Wuliang couldn't refuse it, so he had to accept it. He felt that he would be killed by this couple sooner or later. This Lin Hongyu...Was even more evil than Li Hao!Soon, Qian Wuliang also left.Lin Hongyu, on the other hand, frowned.Was there a problem with this Dao sword?But ... It was so open and aboveboard, could it be that it was dark under the light?The more open he was, the less suspicious he would be?She could only suppress all these and let Qian Wuliang keep an eye on them. Of course, she had to keep an eye on Qian Wuliang as well. Li Hao didn't care, but she had to. Who knew if these people were his pawns?Rubbing his temples, he looked at the sky and then to the North. When ... Would Li Hao come back?It had been three months, and the world had changed a lot.As for himself, he felt that he was not following his heart. He felt that the enemy's eyes were everywhere without Li Hao.

2342 Chapter 392
Sword city.p Li Hao was obliterated again.This time, he did not reincarnate for a long time. Even if his sword intent was absorbed, it did not recover.The sword tree trembled.At this moment, the three experts had recovered a lot because they had absorbed the sword intent. However, they were extremely terrified at this moment.Even though Li Hao had said that this was a clone ...However, if he lost his clone, would Li Hao become weaker?Also, was this really a clone?Their intelligence was relatively low, but they died once every three days, and each time they died, a River would appear and reverse time. Was Li Hao really a clone?If the clone had such an ability, wouldn't the main body really be undying?Why did he take so long to return this time?The three saints were extremely nervous.He did not say a word.The atmosphere was extremely tense.Li Hao ... Is dead?Just as they were feeling extremely uneasy, the sword tree suddenly became excited. There had never been a moment like this.It was like flowing water!In the void, there seemed to be the sound of water. A chaotic River appeared from the void and a figure appeared. He was weak but tall. It was so complicated and contradictory.The river flowed over, and Li Hao's figure appeared."How long has it been?" he asked in a calm and weak voice."It's been a long time ..."The sword tree was excited. Li Hao's figure appeared and he said softly,""I mean, the exact time."" 30 seconds!"Li Hao nodded slightly and said softly, 30 seconds is the limit! In just a moment, I might be completely obliterated. This is the limit of reversing the Dao body!"That day, the venerable sovereign had killed him with one palm and escaped to sword city. It seemed to have taken a long time, but in fact, it had only been about 10 seconds. That was the longest time.Today ... Li Hao tried again, with the limit as the limit.30 seconds later, he returned.However, 30 seconds could consume up to 10000 years of lifespan!The longer it took, the greater the price he had to pay."Why did you take so long to return this time?" sword tree asked anxiously.That attitude ... Was like a wife waiting for her husband's return ... Of course, Li Hao had no interest in a tree, and the sword tree was obviously not like that. It was more like a pet waiting for its owner's return.Li Hao smiled."Let's see how long we can hold on for. Then we can return. 30 seconds. That's already beyond my imagination."A battle between powerhouses could change rapidly!Being able to fake death for 30 seconds might change a lot of things. Of course, the premise was that the other party didn't destroy everything about you. Otherwise, you would really be dead.It wasn't safe to fake his death. Jianshu didn't say anything else, but said anxiously,""Did you gain any enlightenment this time?"This was the 31st time Li Hao had faked his death. At first, he would only need to use it once every three days. Now, he would only need two days to absorb enough sword intent to kill Li Hao and complete a full outburst of sword intent.He had to be killed!Otherwise, if he could heavily injure Li Hao but not kill him, the effect wouldn't be as effective.Li Hao, did you gain anything from the 31 deaths?They didn't know about the sword tree.They only knew that Li Hao seemed to have aged a lot. They probably knew that this was a cost of his lifespan. After 31 times, Li Hao might have already used up tens of thousands of years of his lifespan.No matter how strong an existence was, they would also die of old age.Even the universe would be destroyed one day.It might seem fine now, but on the day of his death, he might feel that it was unwise to waste so much of his lifespan today.Li Hao nodded slightly."I have some insights. The longevity sword intent is truly unparalleled!"Li Hao exclaimed,"everything I've learned can be seen in this!" The Shadowless Sword, Azure light sword, Willow Wood sword that I've learned ... I can see the shadow of all sword intents! A genius! Revered sword is so knowledgeable that it's unimaginable. He's truly able to merge 10000 DAOs into one sword ... He's able to self-weave and assemble 10000 DAOs. The sword of revered sword is the best in the world!"The sword tree was helpless.We don't need you to say this, just tell us directly, what did you comprehend?Have you improved or not?We want to know this!We know better than you how powerful the sword Saint is.What a headache! n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Li Hao laughed again."I'm more or less enlightened, not in terms of strength, but in knowledge and understanding of Tao. It's not just in terms of realm. Do you understand?""I don't understand!"Jian Shu was a little depressed,"we want to know if you've improved." You ... Have you entered the Heavenly King stage?""No, I didn 't,"“……”The three of them were on the verge of breaking down. You've already been killed 31 times, and you still haven't made any progress?You're already a top-tier Saint!Li Hao continued,"I'm a cultivator of the new Dao. If I want to become a Heavenly King, I have to open at least 144 meridians and form four cycles. Now, I've only opened 122 meridians. I'm still 22 meridians away from 144 meridians. Even if I open 22 meridians, I still have to complete one cycle. Thus, I'm still a distance away from the Heavenly King level."“……”The three of them were extremely dejected.Li Hao laughed and said,"realm isn't the only thing. The future will only be easier if you can straighten out your path!" I've already comprehended the distribution of the 188 sword intents in the longevity sword intent ... Of course, I haven't completely comprehended them yet. This is an improvement. "Jian Shu didn't want to hear this and said,""Can you kill a mid Heavenly King now?""I don't know,"Li Hao laughed."You can only see the truth on the battlefield. Empty talk is useless!"At this point, he said softly,"cultivation is divided into two types. What I'm cultivating now is actually the truth Dao. It's the Dao Meridian! As for sword essence ... It is actually considered Phantom path!"

2343 Chapter 392
Li Hao didn't care whether they understood or not. He mumbled,""Illusory and real ... The harmony of yin and yang! Sword essence or other concepts were Phantom path! Perhaps I need to open another place to accommodate these Phantom DAOs ... I won't enter The Phantom Dao universe and will temporarily store them in my body. When The Phantom Dao universe opens, I will use 10000 sword intents to directly attack The Phantom Dao universe ... And fight to the death!""That li daoheng must have opened the true Dao. Perhaps ... He has never entered the true Dao universe. One day, he will gather tens of thousands of stars and destroy my Galaxy ..."His words were complicated and they didn't understand.Li Hao didn't care.Actually, it was simple. Sword intent could be considered as Phantom Dao, the Dao of mind. It was just that he did not dare to enter The Phantom Dao universe or use sword intent to form stars.Similarly, the Dao meridians in one's body were considered the truth Dao. Li daoheng might have condensed many truth Dao meridians, but he did not dare to enter the truth Dao universe. Everyone had their own thoughts. They would wait until they could break through in one fell swoop and condense 10000 stars in a day!"In the past, the brain could contain the gate of the neo martial Sanjiao, so the brain is the most complicated ... Open the brain, open the sea of the brain, accommodate the sword intent, act as a temporary residence, and create a temporary void Dao universe ... With the reality Dao universe as the model ...""Li Hao, what are you trying to say?" Jian Shu was extremely troubled.I don't understand what you're saying. You're a Saint, why do you have to pretend to be a venerable sovereign?Seeing this, Li Hao smiled and explained,""What I mean is that I can't enter another universe right now ... The universe of the mind! "Therefore, I want to create a fake universe in my head! It'll temporarily be used as a storage place for all kinds of sword intent ... To prevent it from clashing with other Dao meridians if it's kept in the body!""To put it simply, I want to open a spiritual universe that can accommodate 10000 swords and my luminous moon sword! The Dao Meridian strengthens my body, and the Dao sword strengthens my spirit. One day, when the two DAOs merge into one, I will definitely be able to reach the heavens in one step!"Dao sword ...Slightly dazed, Li Hao didn't pay much attention to it. Instead, he thought of the sword of the world, but the sword he was talking about was the sword intent of the great path.He said a few simple words and then frowned."Of course, it's easier said than done! How to open the spiritual universe? It's really a complicated question ... Sigh!""Li Hao," Shi men said unhappily."Just tell me directly. Will you become stronger by doing this?""Of course!"​ "Oh, that's good!"The stone agreed. If you don't want to become stronger, why do you have to do all this?Jian Shu had gained some understanding of the new Dao recently and couldn't help but ask,""You have a deep understanding of the truth Dao. Why don't you focus on opening your Dao meridians? if you hadn't been distracted, you might have become a fourth-level Dao integration Heavenly King-level expert!"You're cultivating this one moment and that the next. What are you doing?Li Hao laughed,"no!" It's not that I'm not focused. If I just open my meridians, I might be able to do it quickly. However, I don't know the reason behind it. There aren't many benefits if I open my meridians quickly. Furthermore ... If I open too many meridians, it will cause the Dao universe to become more and more stable. The heaven and earth will also become more and more stable! If I step into the Heavenly King stage ... Not to mention the half-step sovereign, perhaps even some late Heavenly Kings and peak Heavenly Kings would be able to walk out. It would be very troublesome!""Now, I'm cultivating both the virtual and the real. I might be able to reach the half-step sovereign realm one day ... At that time, I'll definitely be able to kill my enemies!" He chatted a little with these few people and found that this place was relatively safe.In addition, these few people were actually very pure.They had little experience, and they had few thoughts. They were very pure, very pure cultivators, or rather, pure mascots. In fact, the relationship between them and venerable sword was not like that of Li Hao and the Black Panther, but Li Hao and the decorations in his house, which he didn't care much about now.The sword Saint had never expected them to become strong.He would not deliberately instill any ideas into them. These few people were considered blank papers.Therefore, he wasn't afraid of them overthinking things when he told them something.As expected, Jian Shu no longer cared about this and hurriedly said,""It's been a few months. Do you still want to die?""No... There is no meaning in dying continuously. Furthermore, I have comprehended many sword intents, but I am unable to condense them. Or rather, I lack a spiritual universe to store all of these ... I have to solve this problem. Otherwise, I can only take the risk and try to Enter the Void Dao universe!"Condensing a great star was a form of stabilization of one's realm. One could choose not to condense a great path star, but that would make it difficult for one to become infinitely powerful. There would be a stagnation.Since he did not dare to Enter the Void Dao universe ... He would create a fake one and use it first!"Void Dao, spirit Dao, force Dao, intent Dao!" Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ "It's too difficult to distinguish them one by one .... I might as well create a sea! The ocean holds all rivers, and the ocean covers everything, just like the ten thousand galaxies ... First chaotic, then clear ..."Li Hao sat down cross-legged and muttered to himself.The three saints were like curious babies, and they sat down beside him.The stone turned into a brawny man, who looked very honest.The large seal turned into a square-faced middle-aged man who looked very dignified.The sword tree was still enchanting, appearing extremely plump.The three saints of today had recovered a lot over the past few days. They were much more solid than before, and their bodies were clearer.The three of them listened in silence and looked at Li Hao curiously.Li Hao continued."Neo martial artists have a Sanjiao gate. The Sanjiao gate can contain countless forces. It acts as a channel that leads directly to the universe of origin ... It's mixed between the universe of origin and the real space. It's equivalent to the world barrier of the universe of origin, right?"

2344 Chapter 392
The three of them looked at each other and shook their heads.He didn't know!We're only in charge of cultivation, not in-depth research. We'll cultivate as everyone else does."Thus, I want to create an ocean, a spiritual ocean, and attach it to the barrier between me and the void Dao universe. I can attack the void Dao universe at any time, and I can even use the magnificence of the great Dao universe to stabilize my spiritual ocean!""It's just that ... I still don't have enough understanding of the void Dao universe, so it's not good to attach a barrier. Unless li daoheng tears the void Dao universe apart in front of me and let me take a look and observe it ..." Li Hao said softly.The sword tree gasped,'you're not thinking of luring him out, are you? He was very powerful! You'll die!"Don't mess around!Li Hao smiled and said,"why not try?" It's just that ... It's indeed very dangerous!""However, if I succeed, I should be able to create it and complete my own sword of a hundred paths! With a hundred swords, I can't say that I can fight a half-step sovereign, but I, Li Hao, can fight any Heavenly King!"“……”Why are you so outstanding? Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ ​ Why don't you just cultivate step by step?"How do we lure that guy out?"As Li Hao thought, he suddenly smiled and said,"I have an idea!" If I were to break the eight trigrams seal, he would definitely appear to stop me! Otherwise, if I release the venerable sovereign, he will be angry! Now, I think he can only tear apart the void Dao universe ... Of course, when he appears, he will definitely attack me ... But he does not dare to stay for long. If he does, the venerable sovereign will lock onto the location of his void Dao universe and he will have a headache!""Fight venerable sovereigns?"The three of them were stunned. Again?Li Hao shook his head and said,'not to fight the venerable sovereign, but to release him! Break the seal! Beat li daoheng up! Li daoheng will definitely stop me, and I need to use this opportunity to deepen my understanding of the void Dao universe!""The venerable sovereign Hong Yue is the key to our game ... Simply put, this venerable sovereign is our chess piece ... Although it sounds arrogant, it's the truth!"Li Hao's smile was bright. Only by using strong people as chess pieces would it be fun to play.Using the weak to fight the strong!The strong playing chess with the weak ... How boring.Fighting the strong with the weak, on the line between life and death, this was a martial artist!"Let's go over there and take a look ... Even if I'm killed by him, it doesn't matter as long as he doesn't obliterate my power of time. I'll definitely be able to survive within 30 seconds! He won't dare to stay here for 30 seconds ... That's enough time for the venerable sovereign to lock onto him!""Then ... What if it's obliterated?" Jian Shu asked uneasily.Aren't you dead?Li Hao smiled."It's fine. He won't be able to do it so easily ... Unless his sword intent is comparable to that of the venerable sword. Otherwise ... If he wants to kill me, he'll have to wait until his real body comes out!"The few of them were uneasy, but at this moment, they were helpless! ……At the venerable sovereign's seal.Red Moon sovereign frowned and was a little unhappy. The sword city ... Was coming again.Red Moon sovereign's voice resounded through the universe with a hint of coldness."Li Hao, you're still alive?"In the distance, Li Hao appeared and nodded slightly.""Thank you for your help, venerable sovereign, for eliminating li daoheng's lifeless sword! Today, Li Hao came here for another purpose. He wants to lure li daoheng out and have the venerable sovereign kill him for me. What do you think?""You want to use me to kill him?" Red Moon sovereign was indifferent."No, it's for mutual benefit. I'm asking the venerable sovereign, who do you fear the most now, me, Zheng Yu, li daoheng, or the venerable sovereign?"Red Moon Emperor remained silent."I'm the weakest," Li Hao continued."Don't look down on me just because I control the great Dao universe. In fact, the great Dao universe I control is only a part of it. Venerable sovereigns saw it before. Li daoheng has truly controlled the core! Li daoheng wants to kill me and take away the part I control ... I also want to kill him and take away the part he has!""Red Moon sovereign, you may be powerful, but at this moment, you have restrictions. The restrictions between me and him are even smaller!"Red Moon sovereign looked at Li Hao coldly. Li Hao said calmly,"My plan is to destroy the seal and lure him into the trap. He will definitely come to kill me! If they don't come, I'll bet everything and release the Thearch from the seal! If he really doesn't come, there's no harm in venerable sovereign ...""You can't break the seal!""Do you really think you can break the seal?" venerable Emperor Red Moon asked calmly. This seal was set up by a top venerable sovereign, not a sword venerable. Your starry sky sword ... Even sword city can only suppress it a little and can't really destroy it!"Li Hao nodded. The next moment, two words appeared above his head, and a special wave spread out.Zhan Tian!BOOM!The eight trigrams Formation trembled slightly and red Moon sovereign's expression changed.Li Hao said softly,"this array was set up by the blood Emperor!" The two words above my head came from heaven battling city and were personally written by the blood Emperor. I will use these two words as the core to shake the seal! The great power of a venerable sovereign, the seal is shaking, it will definitely be able to break one or two!""How dare you!" The red moon sovereign's eyes flickered.It was really, really big!Li Hao was still calm."It's not that I'm bold. If I were confident in killing a venerable sovereign or li daoheng, why would I take the risk?" Adventurers were a group of gamblers who had lost so much that their eyes were red! If I had billions of wealth, why would I need to gamble? Do you still care about losing a little more when your eyes are red?"Red Moon sovereign laughed.Interesting!He realized that this person's appearance was not a bad thing for him. In fact, the seal had loosened a lot recently.In fact, every time Li Hao fought with others ... He was actually helping him.

This included dealing with Ying Hongyue. Although he would have to use a lot of the Hongyue's power, it also allowed him to have more control over Ying Hongyue.And now, in order to deal with li daoheng, this person was even taking the initiative to help her break the seal!They were really ... A bunch of reckless people!Red Moon sovereign chuckled and said,"if you're not afraid, do whatever you want!" If li daoheng really comes to stop me, just as you said, he's helping me break the seal. I'll deal with him and keep you alive! If you die, Won't You Be delaying me from breaking the seal? Of course, for safety's sake ... I suggest that you break the seal and not the outer area. Otherwise, if he appears from the outer area, it will be difficult for me to break the seal. If you are killed ... I can't protect you!"Break the seal!Third saint's expression changed drastically upon hearing this. He couldn 't!That was really like lighting a lantern in the toilet. He was looking for death! Li Hao laughed."You must be joking, venerable sovereign. The emperor's aura is so powerful that I wouldn't dare to offend it. Let's just stay on the outside. If li daoheng really appears, venerable sovereign can try to see if you can send out a little bit of your power. With your power, a little bit of it is enough to put the other party in a difficult position!"Red Moon sovereign stopped trying to persuade him.It was normal that Li Hao didn't want to come in, but if he did ... That would be abnormal. He would be extremely bold.As for Li Hao, he took a deep breath and suddenly transformed into a giant. He appeared in the universe and grabbed sword city. The huge starry sky sword was much larger than him.Li Hao grinned and said,"venerable sovereign, I'll use the real starry sky sword with the word" heaven battling "to attack the seal!" With li daoheng's appearance, venerable sovereigns don't even need to do anything. All they need to do is lock onto the cosmic coordinates of his appearance ... This person definitely won't dare to stay for long ... I, Li Hao, also want to test the power of a half-step sovereign and see how it is!""Good courage!"The venerable sovereign's expression changed slightly. He was really bold!If Li Hao could survive a long battle, he would definitely be a powerful figure.A mere Saint realm expert dared to fight a half-step sovereign.Of course, more importantly, this man had dared to provoke him before, but he was killed by him and resurrected. He glanced at Li Hao a few more times and vaguely sensed some special power.Perhaps ... Li Hao was relying on this special power.What kind of power was this?Resurrection!It was not easy to be resurrected after being killed by a venerable sovereign.Li Hao seemed to have seen through his thoughts. He didn't hide it and said with a smile,""Why can I come back to life, venerable sovereign? It's just that ... I've connected my life to the great Dao, weaving the river of chaos with thousands of DAOs, and using the life stars as the core. As long as the great Dao is not destroyed, I won't die. With the life and death Stars as the Dao heart, I've died and come back to life. That's it!"Life and death?The river of chaos?"Li Hao, why are you telling me this?" the venerable sovereign asked, slightly moved.Li Hao laughed and said,"venerable sovereign, you're a great man. Is there any use in hiding it?" Since that was the case ... It was better to be Frank! In case the venerable sovereigns were suspicious. Besides ... I'm in charge of the great Dao universe. If a venerable sovereign wants to kill me, he has to lock onto the position of my great Dao universe. As long as I don't open it ... How can a venerable sovereign lock onto it?"The venerable sovereign smiled but said nothing.You all always like to underestimate a venerable sovereign.Li Hao didn't say anything more. Holding his longsword, he looked up at the starry sky and laughed."Then I'll start. I really hope ... Li daoheng can fight me!" As soon as he finished speaking, his long sword exploded and a monstrous sword essence appeared. He slashed at a corner of the eight trigrams!BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated throughout the universe!At this moment, the eight trigrams array shook violently.The corner that Li Hao had cut was the corner that corresponded to the Hong family. Suddenly, a muffled groan was heard, followed by a cry of pain. It was actually Ying Hongyue's voice. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  At a corner of the eight trigrams, there was a shadow that represented the ancestor of the Hong family, one of the eight great families. At this moment, it suddenly turned into Ying Hongyue and instantly appeared. She saw the heaven-shaking sword!In the next moment, they saw Li Hao, the 30000-meter-tall giant, roaring in disbelief, anger, despair,""Li Hao, you're breaking the seal?"This was crazy!He had really gone completely crazy!He was going to release the venerable sovereigns!Wasn't this crazy?Li Hao's voice was like thunder,'whoever doesn't let me live well, I won't let him live well! Ying Hongyue, pray that you can survive. I want you to live a life worse than a dog 's!"BOOM!The big sword slashed down!……At this moment, in the Silvermoon world.Silver City.The invisible seal in the sky suddenly appeared, along with Hurricane city. Not only that, but Star River City also appeared, as well as the Queen, who was currently escaping ...All the experts raised their heads and looked at the sky.A corner of the eight trigrams Formation was being destroyed by a huge sword. A giant ten thousand feet tall seemed to be floating in the air.At this moment, Zheng Yu suddenly appeared in the sky above Hurricane city. He looked up at the sky and muttered,""You have a wife and a martial uncle who has always supported you. They are all alive ... Do you still want to seek death?"I originally thought that you wouldn't seek death anymore!Now, it seems that you've really gone crazy!Star River City.Zhang an's expression was grave. Li Hao had gone into the seal. This was nothing. He was destroying the seal and the formation left by the blood Emperor. He was going to release the venerable sovereign!This was definitely not a test. This was real destruction!Once Li Hao cut off one of its corners ... It would be a big problem!He suddenly looked at Zheng Yu in the distance with a grave expression.""Zheng Yu, you have to stop him! If it wasn't for your Zheng family killing his master, he wouldn't be like this!"

Zheng Yu smiled bitterly.How can you blame this on the Zheng family?My second brother and father were both killed by this fellow, and I'm not even as angry as he is. He's just a master, not your biological father!Where could he go to reason?Besides, you're the one who initiated the attack on boundless city."How can I stop it? He's on the inside of the seal, not the outside. If he's on the outside, I can still try ...""Go!" Zhang an shouted,"you shall drive Hurricane city and enter the seal!"“……”Go to hell!Zheng Yu couldn't be bothered with him. Are you crazy or am I crazy?Driving Hurricane city into the seal, and then ... Being chased by venerable sovereigns?"You've entered the half-step sovereign realm, but you don't even dare to fight against a sealing venerable sovereign?"“……”Who are you trying to provoke?Zheng Yu ignored him and just looked on silently. He was muttering in his heart, why should I stop him?There would naturally be people who would think of ways to stop it!If no one really stopped him, and the seal was really broken ... Then ... Li daoheng would also appear, right?At this moment, in the distance, a man went crazy and screamed.He was no longer as elegant as he used to be!Ying Hongyue clutched her head and continuously coughed out blood. She furiously roared,"Li Hao!"He screamed in pain!The power of the eight meridians in his body and the power of the Crimson Moon appeared. They surged madly, and not far away, the flying sword immortal appeared once again. It instantly grabbed Ying Hongyue and fled with her!Behind him, Lin Hongyu and the others were still chasing after him. At this moment, their expressions changed slightly.The flying sword immortal's voice was cold and sharp,"stop chasing!" Li Hao was destroying the great array that sealed the venerable sovereigns! Now that we're being attacked from both the inside and the outside, the seal is bound to break. Is this the result you want to see?"She looked in the direction of Hurricane city and shouted,""Is there really no one who can stop these people? If Lin Hongyu and the others really killed us ... Would you guys be fine? This group of people have been led astray by Li Hao and have gone crazy!"No one stopped him.Or rather, there was no way to stop him. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Seeing this, the flying sword immortal had no choice but to escape towards the Queen. The Queen's expression changed slightly as she cursed silently!What are you doing here?​ Although her strength had increased greatly recently, a group of neo martial Saints had been hunting her down recently, and her life had not been good. Now, seeing Li Hao destroying the seal from within ... She was also frightened.When he saw the two of them rushing towards him, he didn't say a word and instantly fled!A bright moon floated in the sky, and the Queen's voice rang out,""Lin Hongyu, don't go too far. I'm not afraid of you. I have the power of a Heavenly King. If we really fight, you won't be able to gain any advantage!"Behind them, Saints appeared one after another. No one spoke as they waited for the next order. Lin Hongyu raised her head and looked at the giant that appeared in the sky. She chuckled when she saw him slashing the seal with his sword."If husband wants to break the seal, he must have full confidence! Let's help my husband and kill Ying Hongyue. We'll attack from the inside and break the seal. Everyone ... Follow me and exterminate the weeds and roots!"As soon as he finished speaking, the Saints flew away one by one!BOOM!The battle broke out again, and the sky and earth cracked. Ying Hongyue, who was in the flying sword immortal's hand, had a chaotic aura. At this moment, her eyes were filled with hatred and despair!Li Hao!'Are you ... Really going to risk everything?'At this moment, deep down in his heart, he was truly in despair. Li Hao ... Is this the result you wanted?He made me look like a stray dog with nowhere to run!"Li Hao!""What can you do even if you kill me?" Ying Hongyue let out a mournful and angry roar."Do you really think ... That by killing me, you'll be able to take revenge?"He roared at the sky, as if he was angry at the injustice of fate!He had paid too much for success.So many that Li Hao couldn't even imagine it!But now ... It seemed like everything had turned into nothing.Behind him, Lin Hongyu slashed through the air and said coldly,""A cunning rabbit has Three Burrows. Ying Hongyue, no need to put on an act! The flying sword immortal is still the flying sword immortal. You haven't revealed everything yet ... Do you really think we'll believe you? Whether you act pitiful or cry, husband once said that only when one of you and the flying sword immortal dies or become one will you be at the end of your path. Do you really think you're the smartest in the world?"It was a heart-killing!Lin Hongyu chuckled."Your eight meridians have merged into one. My husband has only broken through the gate of one Meridian, but you're already in such a miserable state ... There's nothing strange about the flying sword immortal. I'm curious. Which corner does the flying sword immortal correspond to?" Why don't you let us experience it?"With that, several Saints charged out instantly!Ying Hongyue's expression was unsightly. She turned to look at everyone, and her gaze became even colder. She looked up at the sky again, gritted her teeth, and instantly grabbed the flying sword immortal to escape. This time, she was the one who grabbed the flying sword immortal!As expected!Lin Hongyu did not even look at the seal in the sky. She shouted,""Continue the pursuit! Even if Ying Hongyue died, she wouldn't be able to break the seal. That flying sword immortal was definitely the key to his success! Zheng Yu is very clear about this. It's very likely that this flying sword immortal represents a corner of the Zheng family ..."In the distance, Zheng Yu turned his head, smiled, and said softly,""You really ... Like to push everything onto me!"BOOM!At this moment, the seal trembled violently. With a crisp sound, it seemed to be completely broken!Both Hurricane city and Star River City were shaking violently.Zheng Yu still didn't ask and just watched.Zhang an's face also became more and more solemn. The others were all trembling with fear. Was the venerable sovereign about to appear?What was this good?……Within the seal.Li Hao didn't say anything. He slashed again and again. The seal trembled violently. The shadow that belonged to the Hong family was also trembling violently, as if it would break at any moment.

2347 Chapter 392
The other illusory figures had wanted to come over, but as the two words "heaven battling" on the sword body burst with light, they seemed to be unable to make a judgment. After all, this was only a formation, not a living person.Not far away, under the Stargate, a ray of light flashed in the venerable sovereign's eyes. An extremely weak Crimson Moon Power began to permeate in all directions.At this moment, a ripple was actually set off in his heart.No one stopped him!"Today...I might really be able to break out of the seal."He didn't expect this!Li daoheng, Zheng Yu, and the others didn't stop him, and Li Hao was actually going to break the seal.Crack ...A crack had appeared on the eight trigrams Formation. The venerable sovereign had hoped that li daoheng would show up so that he could give him a hard time. However, he did not want that guy to show up anymore.You guys fight!Do not come out!Li Hao must have set a trap for you.Do not come out! "Give me a little more time and I'll definitely be able to break out of the seal. The Stargate above my head flickered with Starlight. It seemed to have sensed something as it frantically overflowed with the power of Starlight, hoping to suppress the venerable sovereign!However ... As the seal loosened, it seemed to be a little powerless.Li Hao continued!BOOM!The Hong family's illusory image was directly broken by this sword!Red Moon sovereign, even a venerable sovereign, had his heart in his throat at this moment!Soon ...Kachaa!The void shattered.At this moment, the void cracked open, and a man with a long sword on his back appeared. He looked at Li Hao coldly and struck out with his sword. He did not say anything, only remained silent!The man with the sword on his back walked out!He slashed his sword at Li Hao!Li Hao laughed,"I thought you really dared!" You wouldn't dare! Li daoheng, you've disappointed me!"BOOM!Holding the starry sky sword, Li Hao slashed at the sky and roared,""Red Moon sovereign, what are you waiting for?"On the other side, Red Moon sovereign cursed in secret!It's here!That damned guy!Without saying anything, he raised his hand and punched the air. The sword-carrying man turned around and swung his sword, which then collided with Li Hao's starry sky sword!BOOM!Boundless killing intent covered Li Hao, and the huge shock wave shattered Li Hao's arm.The sword-carrying man's voice was cold,"Li Hao, are you done?" If you're done, then end this farce! We can't let this person go now. Wait for a few more days. There's no need for you to let him go. There will be people among us who will kill him! Don't always use this piece of trash as a life and death struggle!"The red moon sovereign's expression changed instantly!At this moment, he felt humiliated!It was obvious that li daoheng and Li Hao were only his tools!A punch was thrown!This punch had even extended beyond the seal. This punch caused the world to collapse and the universe to be destroyed!The man with the sword turned around and slashed the world with his sword!The firmament split open, and countless stars fell!The long sword and the huge fist collided. BOOM!A loud sound reverberated. The giant fist was shattered and the long sword was broken. The man with the sword on his back coughed out blood, but his expression was still cold. A long sword appeared in his hand again, and he attacked with it. BOOM! This sword pierced through heaven and earth!In an instant, Li Hao, who had pinned the giant in the air, exploded with unparalleled killing intent. With a loud boom, the giant exploded!The man with the sword looked at Li Hao, who had exploded, and frowned.As if he had felt a special power, a long sword appeared in his hand again. Behind him, a huge fist appeared again. His expression changed slightly, and he turned around to strike again!BOOM!The unparalleled power collided again and swept in all directions. The long sword was shattered and the giant fist disappeared.He looked up at the torn void and frowned slightly.I can't stay for long!If they stayed here for too long and the venerable sovereign locked onto their location, the seal would be completely useless. He looked at the place where Li Hao had exploded and said coldly,""You'll burn yourself if you play with fire! Good luck!"Obviously, he also knew that Li Hao wasn't dead!He even understood that Li Hao was trying to force him to appear.But ... Could he not appear?Li Hao was really about to break the seal.He instantly burrowed into the great path universe. At the same time, a streak of sword light burst out from the great path universe. With a loud boom, the power of the Crimson Moon, which was originally extremely hidden, was instantly shattered!Red Moon sovereign's expression did not change. He just watched silently as the great path universe disappeared.He laughed with a little regret.However, they soon calmed down. Looking at where Li Hao had exploded outside the seal, they saw a longsword still floating in the air, while Li Hao had disappeared.After watching for a while, he suddenly heard the sound of flowing water.A moment later, an extremely weak Li Hao appeared in the air. The next moment, he grinned and slashed with his sword. BOOM!The void exploded!The power of the red moon exploded instantly!Red Moon Thearch raised his eyebrows slightly. At this moment, Li Hao opened the great Dao universe. At this moment, thousands of Thunderbolts struck out and wiped out the power of the red moon nearby in the blink of an eye.Red Moon sovereign's face changed slightly and he opened his mouth to speak.Li Hao held the sword city in his hand and flew away. His voice was a little weak."Venerable sovereign, our opponent is li daoheng...Don't plot against me. I'm so weak. Take pity on me. I'll come to you next time!"He instantly entered the void and disappeared!Red Moon sovereign frowned slightly but did not say anything.He didn't lose anything anyway.It's just that ... Whether it's Li daoheng or Li Hao, they're both worthless. After using me, they're afraid that I'll escape.But ...He revealed a smile but didn't say anything. The seal had weakened a lot again!It seemed that the day he would go out was not far away.After a few more times ... They wouldn't need to do anything else, and he would be able to break out of the seal by force.……At the same time.Lin Hongyu stopped in her tracks. She paused for a moment and suddenly said,""Retreat! Let Ying Hongyue recover some of her strength and use the bloodline of the eight great families to consume Hongyue's power. Otherwise, the venerable sovereigns will invade him!"Everyone was stunned. Was this a joke?  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  After chasing for half a day, why did they have to retreat?However, since Lin Hongyu had said so, no one said anything. In front, Ying Hongyue instantly felt that the other party had stopped. She gritted her teeth and said,"Li Hao!"He instantly sat down cross-legged, and the eight bloodlines above his head trembled. The power of the Crimson Moon was destroyed by him. He gritted his teeth. Damn Li Hao, what do you think I am?Are you using me as a tool?Do you really think that you and Li daoheng are the real chess players in the world?How detestable!

Chapter 2348 The Firmament Sword, The Spirit Sea
In the depths of the starry sky.Li Hao sat cross-legged and looked at the three saints. They were still a little scared. It was really exciting to fight with venerable sovereigns and half-step sovereigns every day!Including Li Hao, there were only four Saints.However, their opponents were venerable sovereigns and half-sovereigns!Li Hao didn't care about them. He said softly,""Li daoheng's void Dao universe is similar to the truth Dao universe. They are both illusory and real, but they are not too far apart from each other.""This person should also be plotting against our truth Dao universe, hoping to grasp both reality and illusion!""I don't know what he's planning, but now, I have to make a plan or two!"Previously, when li daoheng appeared to stop Li Hao, Li Hao had also touched some things. He did not enter the Void Dao universe and only needed to attach to the surface."With my strength, I might not be able to open up my spirit sea successfully ... I really need the help of the three seniors this time.""Speak!""Kill him!" Jian Shu's voice was solemn."We can do anything to kill li daoheng and get rid of this bastard!" As the Guardians of the Li family, the massacre of the Li family was an unconquerable hurdle for them. They were willing to pay any price to kill li daoheng!Li Hao said softly, I need three seniors to help me suppress the sea! The stone was the foundation of the sea, the tree was the wall, and the seal was the sky! Only three of you have the foundation of ten thousand DAOs and ten thousand swords!"He looked at the three of them and said seriously,"there are many powerful cultivators in the world. Humans are useless, and demons are difficult to deal with. There are only a few who can contain the sword will of longevity. You can be said to be the chosen ones!" It's perfect for me to open my spirit sea!""We can't miss out on any one of them!""Senior stone is the foundation of the spirit sea! Senior sword tree, you are rooted in the barrier of the void Dao universe and connected my mind sea and the void Dao universe. If you can withstand the longevity sword intent, you can also withstand my bright moon sword intent! As for senior sword seal, he was the seal that suppressed sword city and was supported by Supreme Sword and Supreme martial artist. At this moment, he is stabilizing the spirit sea and is the outer shell of the spirit sea. It is unbreakable ..."He looked at the three of them. These three were the most suitable and only suitable foundation items to open his spirit sea.The sword tree was silent."Will I die?" he asked after a moment."I won 't!"The sword tree exhaled,'then why do you have that expression? He looks like he's about to die?"It thought the three of us were dead.Not afraid of death!But if they wanted to live, to live and see li daoheng get killed! Otherwise, he would not be satisfied even if he died.Since he wasn't going to die, why was Li Hao so serious?  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  Li Hao said in a deep voice,"although you won't die, I can't invade the void Dao universe. The three of you can't leave. Once you leave, the ocean will collapse!""What's the big deal?"Sword tree didn't mind,"it's just a change of place to be a prisoner!" In sword city, weren't they also prisoners for the past one hundred thousand years? Besides ... It might be better. Now that sword city has been proven to be the starry sky sword, we should move to another place ... There's not much difference!"Li Hao had been too serious just now.It continued,"the reason why we're willing to help you ... Is not because you're a descendant of the Li family. In fact, you're not. Instead, it's because ... You've actually made li daoheng suffer a few times. Just based on this, even if the three of us really die, it doesn't matter!"Li Hao, on the other hand, was silent for a while.After a while, he said,"the three of you have spirits. You are living beings. You are also seniors of sword city. You didn't hate me, didn't kill me, and didn't offend me ... You even took the initiative to help me. Today, I ask the three of you to help me. You said that I'm going to build a spirit sea, but in reality, I'm going to build a cage to imprison the three seniors!"Jian Shu was about to speak, but Li Hao raised his hand."Don't say you're willing. I'm not trying to stop you. Since I suggested it, I hope you can help me. I'm not a pretentious person. Since I've asked, I'm sure you won't refuse!"He revealed a smile."I'm saying this to tell the three of you that I, Li Hao, have some things that I shouldn't do. If I succeed this time, I will definitely take down the void Dao universe. Not only that, if I take down the void Dao universe ... The three of you will form your own small world. If I take down the Silver Moon, I will definitely split a portion of my world's power for the three of you to help you form your own small world!""No need ..."The three of them didn't take it seriously, but Li Hao said solemnly,""It's just my idea, but it doesn't mean it'll be realized, because ... I might die before that day comes. I just want to say that if it's possible, I'll definitely carry it out! I'm not trying to appease the three seniors, but I'm comforting myself!"He smiled and said,'Silver Moon Martial Master, you must cultivate your Dao and heart. There's no need for the three seniors to say anything, it's just an illusion, it's not like it's really done!"The three of them didn't say anything else.That's right!Even if he said it, it didn't work out. If it really did ... He would think about it again.Li Hao seemed to have convinced himself. He smiled and said,"Since that's the case ... I won't be polite! With three top-notch Saints to solidify my sword intent, I dare say that even the three Heavenly Kings are not as suitable as the three seniors!"A tree, a stone, and a seal!More importantly, all three of them could withstand the longevity sword intent. How overbearing was the longevity sword intent?If they could withstand the longevity sword intent, then Li Hao would be able to withstand the sword of a thousand or ten thousand DAOs, let alone the sword of a hundred DAOs. Even if he did not seize the void Dao universe, Li Hao would not have to worry about his sword intent being too strong or his body not being strong enough.This was the best foundation to stabilize one's spirit sea.

Chapter 2349 The Firmament Sword, The Spirit Sea
In this trip to sword city, the existence of these three people was more important than the entire sword city."I ... I still want to ask, if ... If this spirit Sea World is successful, what ... What will you do?" the stone was very happy."The peak of two saints!" Li Hao smiled.What was the use?The three of them were slightly disappointed.Li Hao smiled,'if my spirit sea is formed, although my Phantom path is still a divine path, I can form a hundred sword fingers in a day! Once the hundred swords are formed, my attack will be unparalleled! I'm too arrogant to say that I can fight a half-step sovereign. I, Li Hao, have nothing to fear from anyone below the half-step sovereign realm!"Really?The three of them were in disbelief.One hundred swords could defeat a Heavenly King?At this moment, the three of them were in disbelief, but Li Hao's face was filled with determination. 'If I can form the sword of a hundred DAOs, my body will definitely have 144 Dao meridians and I'll be at the peak of the third level of Dao integration. I won't be weaker than an ordinary Heavenly King.'A hundred swords can't even defeat a Heavenly King ... Do you think it's a joke that I, Li Hao, have been provoking venerable sovereigns and half-step sovereigns?I've died dozens of times, and every time, I've truly died.After paying such a huge price and using the three saints as a Foundation, if I succeed, I'll definitely be able to sweep away the Heavenly King!At this moment, the three experts were extremely excited."Then we ... Are worth it!"Third Saint was overjoyed!At this moment, he didn't feel that there was anything wrong with it. Even if he really died, it would be worth it.Li Hao also smiled."Then let's begin. The process will be a little painful, but ... You three seniors can withstand the longevity sword intent without dying, and you can even absorb it. If you succeed, you may be able to absorb my bright moon sword intent. Your future ... Will be extremely bright!"As soon as he finished speaking, he held the small starry sky sword in his hand. It was not the real starry sky sword.At this moment, the starry sky sword in his hand suddenly turned into a long river that circled the world. Li Hao looked at the three of them."Stone as the foundation! Senior Shitou, I want to ... Cut you and build the foundation of the ocean. I want to get rid of some impurities and wash you with time. Can you ... Withstand it?""I'm a stone that has turned into a spirit, and I've experienced all kinds of heaven and earth's forces. Just come!"Li Hao didn't say anything more. At this moment, the river wrapped around him, and sword intent emerged.  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  The river Washed over the world!A huge rock instantly fell into the river. At first, it was nothing, but gradually, the outer layer of impurities of the huge rock was washed away, revealing a crystal clear core.It hurt!He was in so much pain that he wished he was dead!Even though the rock was naturally strong and had unparalleled defense, even after being sharpened by the starry sky sword, it still couldn't bear it. Suddenly, a scream came from the rock,""It hurts!"The water of the long river was washing away madly!Jian Shu was stunned and hurriedly shouted,"aren't you ashamed?" Don't roar!""Ah!" The painful cry rose again."It really hurts ... It's like ten thousand arrows piercing through my heart! Sword tree, sword seal ... It hurts!"It was too painful!Li Hao's face was calm, but his eyes were shining. If I can't bear it, I might have a mental breakdown and turn into stone ... Since it's already started, I don't want to give up, and neither do you seniors ... In that case, I can only bear it! If senior fails ... Then senior sword tree and senior sword seal probably won't be able to succeed either, so just give up!""I ... Can!"​ The huge rock roared in pain again."It's just pain. I've been through so much. I'm just a rock. The venerable sword gave me life and strength. I can withstand the longevity sword intent. How can I not tolerate your sword, Li Hao?""You think ... You are more talented than venerable the sword?""Do you think ... You can match up to the sword Saint?"The stone howled in pain!At this moment, the huge rock was washed away by the river and even began to change shape. It was like a piece of rock that had been smashed flat by someone!Li Hao kept washing the stones and said in a deep voice,""I want to cleanse senior into a Foundation. In other words ... Senior, you have to endure until your form is like flowing water, covering the foundation of the long river! This ... Is only the beginning!""Ah!"The sound of pain was heard again. It was unclear whether it was because of the extreme pain or because of Li Hao's words. This was only the beginning, and it needed to be washed away until it became a pancake.Yes, the stone understood.He had to make himself into the shape of a pancake!"Does it hurt that much?"The sword tree couldn't help but ask when it heard its miserable cry. Li Hao opened his mouth and said,""Senior, you can stretch out your roots and touch ..."Let's try.The sword tree extended a branch towards the river. The next moment, a shrill cry resounded through the world."Argh! It hurts!"Seeing this, the sword seal was a little surprised and hesitant. It carefully touched the water of the long river. The next moment, it suddenly wanted to scream, but it quickly suppressed it and said in a muffled voice,"I really ... Really ... Have no patience! It's ... It's just a bit of pain. We've endured the sword will of the sword Saint for a thousand years and we can still bear it ... This is really ..."He didn't say anything else, it really hurt!Shi TOU was so miserable!Can we ... Hold on?It was just a little bit, but it was so painful.At this moment, the entire void was reverberating with screams of pain. It was so painful that they wished they were dead. Stone and the stone clan were in so much pain. One could only imagine how unbearable it was.Li Hao frowned slightly. This time, the main purpose was to cleanse himself.He didn't know exactly how painful it was.Was it really ... So unbearable?His heart skipped a beat. The next moment, he rose into the air and fell into the river. In an instant, he felt a piercing pain in his body. Li Hao grunted.
