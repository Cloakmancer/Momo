In addition to the people in Star Town City, there might be nine saints and one Heavenly King!If they could all be finished off in one battle ... To heavenstar, it would be an unparalleled victory.Lord Marquis, can you smoothly deal with them?These three people might know the one in star suppression city. Once they were exposed, a chain reaction would be triggered. At this moment, even Qian Wuliang felt that it was too risky.The Marquis gambled that the three of them did not dare to reveal their Qi at full force so that Yu Hai would not be able to recognize them.The Marquis was still betting that Yu Hai wouldn't dare to be too flamboyant. Perhaps...He was also afraid that others would recognize his true identity.If one side dared to reveal their aura and identity, they would be in big trouble.A million-strong Army creating chaos was not bad, but it could only interfere from a distance. Once the distance was too close, their aura would be exposed and could not be concealed.Qian Wuliang suppressed his throbbing heart and shouted again,""You want to kill me? How could it be that simple! You bunch of sneaky rats, heaven battling city is just nearby, I'd like to see how you can kill me!" As soon as he finished speaking, he rose into the air and headed straight for the edge of the chaos!The three saints looked at each other and then at senior leopard. Senior leopard's eyes were cold and sharp."This person ... I'll leave him to you. Can't the three of you deal with a new-era Martial Master?"The three of them laughed at his words."If that's the case ... Then let's just watch. This person can't escape!"With that, the three of them disappeared at the same time, chasing towards the edge!Upon seeing this, senior leopard followed them silently. However, he did not move forward and waited for them to attack.In the distance, the battle seemed to have broken out. Senior leopard took a look ... He could vaguely see that the five wild beasts were already fighting with people, but ... The number of enemies did not seem to be as many as expected.……BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated throughout the world.At this moment, the five great seniors of the wild beast clan were all surprised!There was only one expert!The ones who had revealed themselves earlier were only clones. At this moment, they were hiding in the back, and their enemy was only one!Was he at the peak of the Saint realm?At this moment, Yu Hai's aura was indeed only at the peak of the Saint realm, but he was still extremely powerful. He fought five great desolate beasts alone without a word and fought as soon as they met!Boom! Boom! Boom!The five desolate beasts could not care less. This person was very strong!He didn't expect that Li Hao had managed to get an expert at the peak of the Saint realm to join him.This was unexpected!Yu Hai's eyes were also filled with excitement. Of course, he was also a little displeased. The old turtle's clones were all present, so it wasn't convenient for him to unleash his full power. Unless ... His clones were killed!Of course, there was no need to kill them all. Wouldn't it be good to leave Wu Peng's clone as a witness?One man and five beasts exchanged blows in an instant. In the void, the aura of chaos exploded and covered the sky! A great battle had erupted!The five great desolate beasts were also extremely ferocious. This person had to die. Fortunately, he was alone, which was a good thing!As for where the Saints from heaven battling city had gone ... They guessed that they might be waiting for an opportunity to plot against the Saints of the mortal world ... That would be the best. What they needed to do was to kill this person!Otherwise, if several heaven battling city's powerhouses really came, they would be in trouble."Quickly kill this person! If Li Hao had directly put the experts of heaven battling city together with him, we would have suffered a loss instead ... But now ... It's our turn!"A few desolate beasts transmitted their voices and were a little excited.It was a good thing!Li Hao was too stupid!BOOM!The sky was torn apart, and the world was shattered. Yu Hai was fighting one against five. Although he was a little defeated and kept retreating, he wasn't defeated directly. This shocked the old turtle and the others.A Heavenly King!Yu Hai was definitely a Heavenly King.And he was not a weak Heavenly King. Otherwise, he would not be able to fight five people at the same time with only the battle power of the peak of the Saint plane.If this person went all out, he should be much stronger than he was now.The hearts of the old turtle and the others were lifted, but they quickly relaxed again.If Li Hao hadn't made any plans ... And attacked directly, he might have been unlucky this time. But now, there were five more dire beasts. Even if the other party couldn't do anything to Yu Hai, they would be able to consume a lot of their energy.Wu Peng was also watching. In fact, Li Hao was the only one watching.At this moment, Li Hao, who had already entered the wasteland with his main body, was also secretly shocked. This guy was really strong. Yu Hai ... Was definitely an old Heavenly King! n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  From the looks of it, Yu Hai was prepared to kill their clones.Otherwise, he might have been able to guess the other party's identity after analyzing it.At this moment, he was running after the Saints.The battlefield was extremely chaotic. A great battle broke out, and the shouts of killing filled the sky!At this moment, Li Hao was running around in the chaotic crowd. He was not the only one. Many people were doing the same.In front of them, Qian Wuliang had already stopped. He was hoping that Li Hao would show up and kill these guys, or he would be scared to death.More importantly, he was only at the middle stage of the sun Moon tier, and his actual combat strength was only at the undying level. Not to mention four, even one of them could easily kill him. If four of them really attacked with all their might, he would be sent to hell in one move.As for the few Saints, they were extremely wary and prepared.In their minds, Li Hao wouldn't die for no reason. He might have made preparations and had a plan.They sensed the fluctuations in the surroundings to see if there were any experts hiding, if there was a main city, if heaven battling city was nearby, and if Zhang an had come here.

Therefore, he didn't go all out and prepare to kill.On the other hand, senior leopard was very impulsive. He wanted to just slap the other party to death. However, he thought that it would be good to leave this fellow to these people to deal with. He was too lazy to intervene and just watched from the side without interfering.……At this moment, Li Hao was fighting a few soldiers of the star Army, but he had been observing them.He wanted to wait!He was waiting for an opportunity. He was waiting for Yu Hai's battle to reach its peak. Only at that time would the heavenly secrets be in chaos and have no time to care about anything else. Only then would he make a move and annihilate the Saints here!Four Saints ... The old turtle, the sea-suppressing envoy, general Huai, the ninth Division commander, myself, and many monster plants. Can they be dealt with quickly?He definitely could!At this moment, the desolate King, who was at the front line, was working together to deal with director Zhao. He was extremely anxious. There was time for an outbreak, but Li Hao had not made his move. There was no movement at all. There were only the auras of experts fighting in the distance. If this continued ... It would not last long!Li Hao, do you have a way?9 Saints!Once his vitality was exhausted and chaos dissipated, would Li Hao still stand a chance?The great desolate King was also anxious!In his anxiety, he was also annoyed. They had clearly agreed to cooperate. Did this Zhao Shuguang know anything about this? why was he so vicious?Each move was fatal!Are you really going to take the opportunity to kill me?……Everyone was waiting for the right moment.At this moment, all he lacked was an opportunity.On the vast battlefield, the experts had their own plans. Only the troops on both sides were unaware of these and were fighting each other.The weak could only be pawns in this place.The powerhouses from all sides were playing chess to see who was better!……Further away. Hurricane city.At this moment, Hurricane city was very far away from the wasteland. Because of the expansion of the wasteland and Li Hao's teleportation of the surrounding cities, Hurricane city could not get too close.In the city, red dust kept frowning. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  At this moment, he actually had a sky screen in his hand that displayed the scene of the battlefield. However, it was very dark and he couldn't see clearly."Zhenxing city ...""This person is fighting one against five ... Heavenly King?"He frowned. The people of heaven battling city didn't come, and heaven battling city didn't come either. Li Hao was on the battlefield, so where did the people of heaven battling city go?He knew that Li Hao had a plan.However, it was still unclear where his hidden trump card was.As for his trump cards, they were none other than those few fellows from heaven battling city."Li Hao ... Do you know Wu Peng?" Suddenly, he thought.If he didn't know and brought Wu Peng along, it wouldn't matter even if he had some plans.If Li Hao's side lost one Saint, they would have one more ... That would mean two saints, and they could turn the tide of the battle in an instant.At this moment, he suddenly raised his eyebrows."A main city is approaching ... Hurricane city, leave this place!"In an instant, Hurricane city escaped.He could sense that a major city's fluctuation was approaching. Was it heaven battling city?On Li Hao's side, he also controlled boundless city.However, boundless city didn't have any experts. Driving the ancient city to come here would consume a lot of energy, so it didn't have much meaning. It could only be heaven battling city.So ... Heaven battling city was about to enter the battlefield!The guys from heaven battling city had actually joined Li Hao's side and were actually willing to fight for Li Hao.……At the same time.In the sky above the chaos, the firmament seemed to split open.Suddenly, the tortoiseshell on Yu Hai's body began to glow and tremble. Yu Hai's heart stirred. Heaven battling city ... Was going to enter the battlefield and participate in the battle?A moment later, he had already sensed it. In the distance, a faint fluctuation spread over. It was the fluctuation caused by the huge ancient city shuttling between heaven and earth. Only an expert of his level could sense it from a long distance.Heaven battling city ... Was about to join the battlefield!At this moment, the clones behind him seemed to be excited as well. Wu Peng even shouted,""Senior, hold on ..."This seemed to be a signal!The next moment, Yu Hai suddenly burst out with a powerful aura. With a fierce roar, he punched out. With a loud bang, a Saint path desolate beast was sent flying. A majestic power swept through the world!BOOM!A huge force instantly spread out. Yu Hai shouted,""Be careful, I can't suppress them ..." He warned.BOOM!The old turtle's clone was instantly blown apart, and a majestic force swept out. The others also hurriedly retreated, but there were still people who were blown apart. Only Wu Peng, who was wearing armor, managed to block the aftermath.Yu Hai's eyes flashed with joy when he saw this.In the next moment, an even more powerful force erupted as he punched out. The other four desolate beasts could still suppress him, but with this punch, Ma Zun was sent flying with a bang, his blood splattering in all directions!How could this be?The desolate beasts were shocked!As for Yu Hai, a cold light flashed in his eyes. He looked back and saw Wu Peng nod at him in tacit understanding. He knew ... He had succeeded!"Heaven battling city ... We're almost there!" He chuckled.After he finished speaking, a weapon appeared in his hand. It was extremely powerful, and there was even a faint blood-colored flash. It was a saber. In an instant, the saber slashed towards a desolate beast!He wanted to deal with some desolate beasts before he arrived at heaven battling city. Only then would he have the time and energy to deal with those few guys from heaven battling city.The heavens are helping me!On the other side, there seemed to be more desolate beasts, but their auras were scattered and scattered, covering the sky. Over there, heaven battling city should be the first to appear ... Which would give him a huge opportunity.

2112 Chapter 356
"Die!"Yu Hai let out a fierce cry and slashed out with his saber. The sky shattered, and the desolate beasts were shocked."Heavenly King ..."BOOM!The long blade fell and the blood-red long blade instantly cut through the slower venerated ox. With one strike, venerated ox was cut in half. The long blade was strange as it crazily devoured his opponent's broken body."Be careful ... This person is the Heavenly King ..."The desolate beasts were shocked, but how could Yu Hai give them the chance to send a message? with a sneer, a wave of Qi activity enveloped the surroundings. It was too late to send a message!A few desolate beasts were extremely uneasy. They hurriedly wanted to retreat from the chaotic aura. However, at this moment, a White Horse passed by below. Princess ni rode the White Horse and directly charged into the distance ... They wanted to retreat from the chaos, but the chaos was still spreading!The desolate beasts were shocked. Damn it!How could the will of Chaos Rush so far away? wherever the White Horse went, there was chaos, and it was difficult for them to retreat."Stop!"Ma Zun roared as he shouted at Princess ni in the distance. Idiot, what are you doing rushing so far?Below them, Princess ni was riding on her White Horse, forcing her way forward without looking back!This is my father's order, just charge forward!He didn't care who tried to stop him.At this moment, Princess Yue felt strange as well. She had encountered several Silver Moon Warriors along the way, but ... No one seemed to have seen her. They just let her charge forward!There was even a large number of elite troops behind her, charging with her all the way, no one cared.Heavenstar ... What's wrong?Father, what's wrong?What's the point of me charging forward?……At this moment, Qian Wuliang was terrified.Li Hao looked into the distance and smiled.Yu Hai couldn't help it.The next moment, he appeared and slashed at a black-armored man. These people had been on guard all along. When they felt the chaos behind them, they felt more at ease.It's here! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  I knew it. How could Li Hao face them alone? it's just that ... The people behind them seem to be new Dao realm experts too?Was he also a swordsman of the new Dao?The new Dao sect actually had a second Saint-level expert other than Li Hao?This was the key to their shock!In front of him, Qian Wuliang's eyes lit up. Seeing this, he shouted,""All of you, die! We've arrived at heaven battling city!"In the distance, the earth trembled as an ancient city seemed to charge straight towards this place.At this moment, senior leopard sneered. All of a sudden, chaos retreated from the edge with a cold look."Are these people fools?" If your heaven battling city wants to enter this place, you have to enter the primal Chaos first. I've evacuated the primal Chaos, so how are you going to enter?As a Paragon, he could still do this. There was no chaos will here.All of a sudden, even Qian Wuliang was pushed out of the chaos.Senior leopard's plan was simple ... He would first kill this guy who had attacked from behind, then spread the chaos and kill one more Sage ... As for these guys, none of them would be able to escape!One of the black-armored men laughed. "You're wise, senior leopard!"The chaos is under our control.Surprise attacks were all jokes.Li Hao's thinking was too simple.At this moment, the real Li Hao slashed his sword. However, he did not launch a sneak attack. Instead, he slashed the sky and the earth. It was as if the sky and the earth were split open, and a passage appeared.He couldn't even be bothered to pay attention to these people. Who didn't know that they could control chaos?Only a fool would think that way!At this moment, a few figures appeared in the passage. The old turtle and the other Saints appeared almost instantly.Without any words, the old turtle, Li Hao, the ninth master, li Fuhai, and general Huai, five Saints, attacked at the same time. This time, they were aiming at senior leopard!This desolate beast could control chaos, so he had to kill it first.Five Saints!They had thought that the other party was in the ancient city. However, when he suddenly appeared beside them and was still some distance away from them, their expressions changed greatly!How could this be?Why would he appear here?It had already isolated the ancient city!How did these people suddenly appear?However, he didn't have time to think about it. In the next moment, a loud sound reverberated through the world!BOOM!An extremely huge leopard was instantly sliced into pieces. The three black-Armored Saints 'expressions changed.The sound of the explosion reverberated through the sky!Li Hao destroyed everything in his opponent's attack. The other Saints also used their own techniques to block the sky and seal the earth. Supreme leopard was killed on the spot before he could even scream."What are you doing here?" the three saints "expressions changed. It was impossible!Then what was that energy wave from the ancient city just now?Also, this person seemed to be Li Hao, so who was the one they were confronting just now?And ... Over there, who was fighting the five great desolate beasts?Where did so many strong people come from?In an instant, countless doubts flooded his mind. Li Hao's eyes flashed with killing intent as he shouted,""Kill!"BOOM!All of them attacked at the same time. In an instant, the eight Saint path Masters fought together, and the sky and earth cracked!In the distance, Qian Wuliang was running away as fast as he could. He was at the middle stage of Sun Moon realm, and he would be killed instantly if the shockwaves spread.At this moment, on the battlefield, on both sides, an intense battle was happening.Including the dead senior leopard, there were 14 Sage-level Masters and one Heavenly King in the battle.The blood and Qi of a million people exploded, and chaos spread out, turning the world dark.Battle cries resounded through the clouds!Li Hao, who had been planning for many days, began to collect the fruits of his victory.……At this moment, in Hurricane city, Hong Chen's expression changed slightly. The sky in front of him shattered, but at the last moment, he still saw something.Red dust's expression changed."Humph!" He suddenly snorted."So that's how it is ... Li Hao ... Has actually mastered the great Dao universe ..."He had known that Li Hao could enter the Dao universe, but at this moment, Li Hao had actually hidden himself in the Dao universe. So that was the case!In that case, the city that they had just passed, even heaven battling city, had no powerhouses?Also, the expert who fought the five wild beasts ... He could somewhat guess who he was.He had some guesses before, but he was unable to confirm them.Now, he was certain."Who will win and who will lose is still unknown!"Hong Chen's face was cold. At this moment, Hurricane city disappeared quickly and headed straight for the great wilderness. Perhaps he could still make it in time to participate in this.Li Hao, a temporary victory is not a final victory!At this moment, Hurricane city was in turmoil.There was a loud boom!Red dust's expression changed. He looked up and saw a book covering the entire city."Zhang an!"Red dust's expression turned cold."You still dare to come?""Heaven and earth can't restrict me, but they can restrict you. If you're not willing, just come out!" Zhang an's voice was heard softly. ["You think I don't dare to?""Do you dare?"Zhang an chuckled, and his voice reverberated throughout the entire city."Although I only have pseudo-Saint force now ... It's a pity that you can't come out! Going to the great wilderness ... It's better not to!""You're forcing me to start a massacre in the other main cities!"Zhang an sighed again."If you really want to do this, I can't do anything about it. Even if you don't kill them, Li Hao will kill them all one day. If you kill some of the people who stayed behind and Li Hao destroys the city ... I won't be bothered anymore.""You ...""Zheng Yu, the second recovery won't work. Even if you have the power of a half-step sovereign, it's useless. Just wait for the second recovery!""Hmph!""Hmph!" Red dust snorted coldly."A second revival, a second revival again!" He had planned for so many years, but the second revival was foiled time and time again. Damn you!Unfortunately ... This time, you, Zhang an, have miscalculated.I might not be able to make it in time. Li Hao and the others have already made their move.It doesn't make much of a difference whether I go or not. Li Hao and his gang even know how to shrink the aura of chaos!The real key ... Is not me.Zhang an, since you've chosen to pester me here ... I'll just do as you wish.Red dust suddenly laughed.Otherwise, if Zhang an had gone there earlier, he might have been able to recognize the man in star suppression city. However, he was not there, so those people might not be able to recognize him. That would be interesting."Zhang an, I'll play with you then!"BOOM!The ancient city trembled, and a hurricane swept through the sky. Outside the ancient city, Zhang an kept attacking to suppress the hurricane.He raised his eyebrows slightly. Zheng Yu was not in a hurry again? He turned his head and looked into the distance ... Could he succeed in this battle?He wasn't sure.However, he couldn't care about that at this moment.

2113 Chapter 357
(I've written too much, so I've written more than 16000.)The great wilderness.A few Saints had killed senior leopard.In the next moment, the few of them bellowed again. A long sword pierced through the sky and earth. In the next second, another long sword came.The ninth Division commander!Two sword cultivators, sword cultivators were good at attacking.Among the experts, there was one who was also skilled in the way of attack. It was li Fuhai, whose original form was a water buffalo. At this moment, his golden body burst forth instantly. The sharp horn on his head struck out directly like a Holy demon.General Huai's branches pierced through the sky and the earth, and the turtle guard turned into a huge seal that pressed down. His original form was a turtle shell, but at this moment, it turned into a huge seal again. This reminded Li Hao of the time when he mistook the city Lord seal and the black turtle seal for his original form.Clearly, this person wasn't really bad at attacking, he was just being modest.Li Hao, on the other hand, had condensed the will of the heavens and was blessed by it.Not only that, at this moment, there seemed to be tens of thousands of people worshipping Him from all directions."Unparalleled demonic sword!"Li Hao drew a sword. At this moment, the bright star sector was turned upside down. A ring-shaped River seemed to tremble and merged into the huge sword. Through the channel stabilized by Li Hao, countless Dao laws merged into it.Five experts against three saints.On the other side, the three saints 'expressions changed drastically as well. In the next moment, they all let out a roar as their qi and blood pierced through the heavens and earth. The great Dao appeared. Even though the great Dao of origins had already been isolated, there was still some power of origins that penetrated through at this moment. Their auras instantly rose a little.With a burst of qi and blood, he no longer cared about his origin and his identity being exposed. He even used the art of bloody blade and turned into three blood-red sabers, slashing at Li Hao at the same time!Of the five experts, Li Hao was the one who brought them the greatest danger.How could the three of them dare to hesitate!"Kill!"Li Hao's shout resounded through the heavens and the earth. On the other side, an expert was also fighting. At this moment, Yu Hai, who was on the opposite side, also vaguely sensed that something was wrong. His expression changed slightly, and he also let out a fierce shout. A blood-red long saber slashed Ma Zun to death!Both sides were fighting madly!At this moment, both sides seemed to be fighting for time to end the battle early and head to the other side.BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated throughout the world.Over there, a huge horse crumbled and a monkey-like desolate beast roared in the sky. It turned into a huge Chaos Monkey and its eyes were bloodshot. It roared,""You're not on the same side ..."BOOM!With an explosive sound, Yu Haili slashed out. Yu Haili didn't care and cut Supreme monkey into two. Together with Supreme MA and Supreme ox, the three great desolate beast Venerables were killed on the spot.The remaining two great desolate beasts were incomparably terrified and shocked.This person was the Heavenly King!Moreover, he was not at the level of a newly-advanced Heavenly King. At this moment, Yu Hai frowned slightly and looked behind him. Wu Peng's clone was still there, but Wu Peng was also shocked. He looked into the distance as if he had seen something and muttered,""How did they get here?"Yu Hai frowned slightly. Could it be that ... Li Hao had discovered something?So, he was excluding Wu Peng?Wu Peng quickly said in a deep voice,"I can't leave my avatar alive. They might be suspicious of me. Quickly deal with these desolate beasts. I will destroy my avatar and let my main body know. I will see if my main body is alone in heaven battling city. If it is ... I will drive heaven battling city here!"Yu Hai's heart stirred.On the other side, the old turtle and the others seemed to have come, but they didn't sense Wu Peng. Was Wu Peng really in heaven battling city?Right at this moment, Wu Peng's clone shattered. His orange battle armor rose into the air and shot straight into the void.Yu Hai wanted to slash down with his saber, but after thinking about it, he gave up.Perhaps, the other party's armor could return and contact the main body.Wu Peng's main body should still be alive, right?If he had died, his clone would have shattered long ago. However, his clone was still there. This meant that even if the other party had guessed it, he had not really killed Wu Peng's clone. This clone of Wu Peng had already been here for many days.Yu Hai didn't have time to think. Seeing that the two desolate beasts were about to escape, he sneered and swung his saber!Li Hao, are you trying to use these desolate beasts to delay me or even kill me?He was too simple-minded!The Heavenly King's power is more powerful than you think. Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  Moreover, these wild beasts were extremely brutal. They did not know any combat techniques or combat techniques. They could only charge around. How could such wild beasts kill a Heavenly King?BOOM!The two wild beasts roared crazily, their voices shaking the world and devouring the chaos around them. They wanted to expel the chaos and interfere with the sea.At this moment, the chaotic presence in the sky was already turbulent.The deaths of a few desolate beasts had already affected the entire great desolate region.……At this moment, Li Hao's group had already exchanged blows. The sword fell!BOOM!The void was torn apart, and the sky was shattered. Li Hao shattered the three experts 'killing moves with one strike, then staggered and took several steps back. At this moment, the ninth master's sword pierced through the chest of a Saint. In the next moment, the Golden Horn of power over the ocean collided with the Saint. With a loud bang, the injured Saint was smashed into pieces and exploded in the air.The illusionary figure appeared with a cold and sharp look. He gritted his teeth and said,""We'll die together!"BOOM!The sound of an explosion resounded through the heavens and earth.Neo martial artists would almost always self-destruct at the last moment of every battle. This was also the key to the invincibility of neo martial artists. Even if they stood to the end, they would still have the opportunity to counterattack. Self-destruction had become a common occurrence.

2114 Chapter 357
But at this moment, the seal transformed into a shield. With a boom, the sound of self-destruction reverberated through the world.However, the huge energy only caused the shield to make a 'bang' sound. The two saints beside the opponent, on the other hand, were continuously spitting out blood from the explosion. They cursed inwardly. This idiot, the Black Tortoise shield of the Wang clan was here. You self-destructed and didn't hurt the enemy, but you caused them to suffer heavy injuries!At this moment, how could the two of them not know that they were in deep trouble today?However, the two of them looked into the distance. At this time, as the Army's qi and blood burst reached the later stage, the chaotic heaven's secrets were not as good as before. They saw the elegant demeanor of the blade that cut down a wild beast.It was him!The two of them were slightly moved. No wonder the five great desolate beasts were unable to take down the other party, and were instead killed until they had to abandon their armor!There was still a chance.Delay for a while!Just as he was thinking about this, he suddenly felt a pain in his chest. Li Hao, who had been retreating a moment ago, had suddenly appeared behind one of them and stabbed his sword into his body. His eyes were extremely calm. The sword pierced through the body of the other party, and the powerful force caused the other party to explode!The other person's expression changed drastically and he said in disbelief,""You ... What are you doing here?"Li Hao was clearly behind the shield!He was defending against the self-destructive force.At this moment, Li Hao didn't say anything. He only looked up at the sky. The Heaven's Will stirred in all directions. As some desolate beasts died, the great wilderness began to shake. The Heaven's Will swept in all directions. The entire chaotic region appeared extremely chaotic.Why am I here?'The heavens said that I can appear here if I travel through the void. I'm here.'He turned his head and looked into the distance. He looked at the illusionary shadow and saw that person kill a desolate beast with one strike. His expression changed slightly. This Yu Hai was really strong. He had already killed four great desolate beasts. It was unbelievable!It was too fast!The two sides moved almost at the same time, but in the sea, one person's power instantly killed four great desolate beasts.Li Hao's side had five people, but they had only killed three saints so far."Kill!"A loud roar resounded through the world.The next moment, the five experts attacked at the same time. The last one looked at the old turtle and said,""I'm ..."BOOM!The ninth Division commander's sword pierced through the void, and the killing intent of his sword shook the sky.I know who you are!The moment the three of them exploded, they recognized them.But ... What could he do?,m All of you should die!The ninth Division commander's sword intent was actually sharper than Li Hao 's. This attack was even more powerful than the previous one. He gathered the strength in his body and, with a shout, his sword was out!The world seemed to be torn apart!BOOM!The space shattered, and the sword turned into thousands of swords that charged at the Saint. The saint's expression changed drastically, and he punched with all his might. At this moment, Li Hao, who had just disappeared, suddenly reappeared and attacked with his sword!At the same time, he stomped on the ground with his four hooves like a barbaric bull. Boom boom boom! The entire battlefield shook, and everyone on the battlefield was staggering!The Saint was the first to bear the brunt of the impact. He was shaken by the heaven and earth and became dizzy.  Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  When general Huai saw this, he also instantly used countless tree branches to pierce through.In an instant, the sky fell and the earth cracked.Bang! Bang!With a loud sound, the last Saint's body was covered in countless wounds. In the blink of an eye, he was torn into pieces and turned into dust. At this moment, even his spiritual energy was destroyed.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly floated in the air and grabbed. The void shook, and three great DAOs appeared, as if three people were floating in the air.At this moment, other than the old turtle sighing in his heart, the ninth Division commander, Li Hao, and Li Fuhai ... Didn't care at all. They didn't have any regrets.Several experts quickly rose into the air and instantly entered the three great Dao of origins.BOOM!The three great Dao collapsed at the same time, and the last screams of the three people came from the void.The great Dao was broken!This also meant that the three of them were completely dead. In this world, unless the new martial artists returned and the human King paid the price to revive them, these three people would no longer exist.At the same time, in the distance, Yu Hai's Last Blade fell. With a crack, the last wild beast was killed on the spot.Yu Hai gasped for breath.His face was covered in blood.In order to quickly kill the five Saint beasts, he had also paid a price. However, compared to killing five Saint path desolate beasts, this price was not worth mentioning.Both sides used their fastest speed to kill their opponents.In the blink of an eye, a total of nine Saint path Masters had died.At this moment, Yu Hai was frowning slightly.Why ... Was chaos still there?According to his thinking, after killing the desolate beast, the chaos should have subsided or even completely disappeared. It should have been enveloped by heaven's will and activated for a second time.But why ... Was chaos still here?Could it be because there were still other desolate beasts?Other than the divine path desolate beasts, there were many other desolate beasts that were currently engaged in a fierce battle with the Silver Moon expert.Could it be because these desolate beasts were still alive?So, the chaos had not dissipated?Just as he was about to make a move, the void trembled.In the blink of an eye, a few experts appeared.Li Hao smiled."Congratulations, senior. You've entered the Heavenly King level, right?"Yu Hai's eyes flickered. He smiled and nodded."I became a Heavenly King by chance ..."With that, he looked at the wild beasts behind him. At this moment, there were also countless casualties.With the death of a few Saint path wild beasts, these wild beasts became anxious. In the blink of an eye, many more died.At this moment, Li Hao turned around and shouted,""Great desolate King, help heavenstar to eliminate all the desolate beasts!"On the other side, the great desolate King was extremely shocked.

He knew that he was taking a gamble, but he didn't expect that the six Saint beasts would die too quickly, too quickly, too quickly. Even the three saints of the red dust World were ... Killed in an instant.Of course, he actually knew that Li Hao and the expert who killed the desolate beasts might not be in cahoots.Perhaps, from the very beginning, Li Hao had never thought much of these desolate beasts and Saints.At this moment, he didn't dare to say anything more. He roared,""Great desolate Army, we are all humans, not desolate beast puppets. Join forces with heavenstar and kill the desolate beasts!"The millions of Grand desolate Army soldiers were all a little distracted.Both sides were engaged in a fierce battle and had suffered many casualties. The great desolate Army had lost at least 100000 men, while the star Army had also suffered tens of thousands of casualties. In the end ... They turned around and wanted to help each other kill the desolate beasts?What a joke!Even though it was the great desolate Queen's order, at this moment, there were soldiers who didn't understand. They were angry, roared, and even ignored it as they continued to kill the star Army!Damn it! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The king had betrayed the vast wilderness!At this moment, the disobedient soldiers, who were still killing, suddenly had their eyes turn red. In the next moment, they went crazy and launched a suicide attack on the desolate beasts nearby.BOOM!One by one, the soldiers were killed by the wild beasts, but they also left bloody marks on the wild beasts.In the distance, Qian Wuliang's strange aura was spreading out and filling the sky.A large number of great desolate Army soldiers turned into mad demons and started to attack the desolate beasts.The great desolate Army was made up of cavalry. At this moment, those mounts went berserk and exploded with a loud bang. The explosions caused the weak desolate beasts to fall into the sea of war and be killed on the spot in the blink of an eye!The great barren King's expression changed as he looked at Qian Wuliang. Just as he was about to speak, a majestic aura pressed down on him. Director Zhao looked at him and said softly,""General Qian Wuliang is helping the great King to eliminate the rebels ... Great desolation King, you have to gain and lose. That is the way to survive!"Weakening the four countries was almost a consensus.Qian Wuliang had killed many elites in the Li Dynasty. When he came back, no one said anything except for one thought ... Well done!And now, although Da Huang and Li Hao were cooperating and had a tacit understanding, they were still in the same boat.However, among the million cavalrymen of the vast wilderness, there were still many who were unruly.Since that was the case ... These people should just die Here!The great desolate King's expression changed slightly. In just a short while, at least tens of thousands of soldiers had died. In addition to the previous losses, the great desolate Army only had about 800000 soldiers left. However, he also knew that if he did not obey ... The great desolate Army might be gone.The great desolation King was extremely furious, but he could only suppress it at this moment. He forced a smile and did not say anything else. He turned around and charged towards a desolate beast. He was extremely fierce. This old man who usually did not have the strength to tie up a chicken was now as barbaric as a desolate beast.BOOM!One punch after another, in the blink of an eye, he killed an immortal desolate beast!The Grand desolate Army was still launching suicide attacks.Corpses were everywhere!……At this moment, Yu Hai didn't stop him. He didn't make a move either. He just watched silently.He was also waiting.By the time these desolate beasts died, the chaos would have completely dissipated. At that time, the heaven and earth would instantly recover. This was because the great wilderness had occupied a lot of the heaven and earth. Once the chaos turned into heaven and earth, the space would probably be stabilized. He was waiting!Li Hao and the others were also waiting.The few of them spread out in all directions, surrounding the other party. Above their heads, the void trembled.The five experts were all very serious.This person was too strong.Even after killing five Saints, his aura was still as powerful as ever. At this moment, the old turtle and the others had already guessed who he was, but they found it hard to believe.This person ... Was here?Then who was Hong Chen?They were all a little confused, but they were all very serious.This was a veteran Heavenly King!Desolate beasts were killed one after another, and their screams resounded through the heavens and earth. Large amounts of desolate beast corpses turned the entire battlefield into a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood.There were corpses everywhere!The Heaven's Will swept in all directions, as if it was cheering and jubilating. It was also expelling the chaos, and the aura of chaos was dissipating.A faint smile appeared on Yu Hai's face.Once the second recovery began, it would be even easier.At that time, Zheng Yu would have to show up.……At this moment, in Hurricane city. Zhang an frowned slightly and turned his head again to look into the distance. The darkness of the vast wilderness was turning into light, and the chaos seemed to be dissipating. The world seemed to be more stable. Li Hao ... Didn't think of this?In the city, red dust was frowning slightly. He didn't have much hope.He did know some things.Chaos would not dissipate so easily.On the other hand, the heaven and earth seemed to have returned to the state before endless city absorbed the heaven and earth energy. Just as he was thinking about it, suddenly, a huge suction force came from all directions. Endless city began to absorb again.However, if the chaos were to dissipate completely, no matter how much the endless city absorbed it, it would be useless. The only thing that would happen was that the energy would decrease, but the heaven and earth would become stable. By then, even if there was no energy, they would be able to walk out.……Yu Hai also sensed it, but he didn't care.So what if he absorbed a little energy?When the last desolate beast was killed, Yu Hai waited in silence ... Soon, his expression turned strange. He looked at Li Hao and the others and suddenly said,""Li Hao, it seems that you're not worried that the second recovery will begin soon?"Li Hao nodded."Don't worry. You might not know this, senior. Chaos doesn't dissipate easily ...""It has something to do with the human race of the great wilderness. Is it their presence of chaos?"

Seeing that he was eager to try, Li Hao smiled and shook his head.""No, it's because of the will of chaos. The will of chaos is still there, Just Like heaven's will, so it will not dissipate.""I see!"Yu Hai nodded his head and said regretfully,"in that case ... That White Horse ... I was wondering why the desolate beasts were so impatient. They stared at that girl and wanted her to return. So it was because ... That White Horse was the will of chaos, right?"This person's eyes were also very sharp."Senior, you have a good eye!" Li Hao nodded.Yu Hai sighed. So that was the case.No wonder!In that case, killing desolate beasts would be in vain.However, it wasn't too late to know now."After killing these people, we'll go and kill the White Horse. The second recovery will naturally begin. This world will still belong to us.At that moment, the chaotic aura around them began to dissipate.Li Hao continuously extracted the chaotic presence nearby. Gradually, an empty space was formed nearby. Yu Hai's expression changed slightly. He looked at Li Hao in surprise. "I'm telling you, you weren't in a hurry and were just waiting here. You can actually absorb the aura of chaos ..."Once the chaos aura dissipated, he would either have to retreat to the ruins or kill a few people before that.Li Hao smiled and said,"senior ... Go back!" When the chaos completely vanishes, senior will probably shake the world. Once the seal is broken, we'll all be finished. ""Go back?"Yu Hai laughed."Do you believe me at a time like this? Didn't you plan so much just to kill me? Now you're willing to let me go back? Li Hao, at such a young age, you have many ideas, but everything ... Ultimately depends on strength!"At this moment, they had completely shed all pretenses of cordiality.The old turtle sighed."I didn't expect you to be Zheng Hongyuan. I'm curious. The current leader of the rebel army, Hong Chen ... Who is he? Could it be ... Your third son, Zheng Yu? If that's the case ... Your Zheng family is really full of talents!"Zheng Hongyuan! p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Previously, everyone had thought that Hong Chen was the real patriarch of the Zheng family. However, it turned out that he was not.He had been planning something in Star Town City.As for the other party, he was already a Heavenly King in his early years.But now, everyone knew that Hong Chen was also a Heavenly King, and a top Heavenly King at that. This meant that the Zheng family had more than one Heavenly King, but two."What's the point of caring about these things now?"Yu Hai laughed.He looked at Li Hao, and then at the fading chaotic area."You know I'm a Heavenly King, yet you still dare to stay here and refuse to leave. Could it be that ... You're worried that I'll kill the others here in an instant?"  He waved his hand and pointed at the soldiers, smiling.""Or ... You still want to kill me? you haven't given up yet?"Li Hao didn't speak. At this moment, the sky suddenly split open, and he instantly rushed into the sky. He calmly said,""Senior, if you don't want to be compressed back to the ruins, why don't you come up and have a chat?"Yu Hai's expression changed slightly. He looked at the sky for a long time before he exclaimed,""I see ... I see! The Dao universe, you came in from the Dao universe ... Incredible!"It was unbelievable!No wonder!He looked at Li Hao, and Li Hao looked back at him. With a calm expression, he said,""If you win, not only will you be able to get rid of future trouble, but you will also be able to seize the great Dao universe. In that case, there is nothing to fear even from the red moon sovereign! Even if there's something left at the boundary point, senior may not be able to take it away easily. Perhaps the eight great families can only take it away if they join forces. But senior, you're already a Heavenly King. If you seize the great path universe, you might really be able to deal with the red moon sovereign!"Yu Hai looked at him warily.Li Hao, however, remained calm."Be it neo martial arts or Silver Moon, they're still one. After all is said and done, Crimson Moon is the outsider and the threat!" The existence of a venerable sovereign is a threat to everyone. If we win, we'll find a way to deal with him. If you win, you'll have a new Dao universe and the new Dao won't be destroyed. Sooner or later, you'll be able to deal with him ...""Are you serious?""If I die in battle, everything will be true!" Li Hao smiled.Yu Hai, or Zheng Hongyuan, was in disbelief.But Li Hao seemed to be very serious.Could he enter the great Dao universe?If he didn't go in and continued to delay, these people would really enter and leave. He could only return to the ruins and wait for another opportunity.However, now that his identity had been exposed, it might be even more troublesome the next time.All sorts of thoughts appeared in his mind.He looked at the starry sky ... Should he go in?After a moment of hesitation, the others took off and seemed to have fallen into another universe. Li Hao's voice sounded again."If senior doesn't come, the next time we appear, perhaps ... It will be the time of senior's death! In this battle, we've killed nine saints and gained a great deal. We haven't had time to digest the fruits of our labor yet, but once we do ... Senior ... Probably won't have another chance!""It seems like you really want to kill me ..."Zheng Hongyuan laughed and weighed the pros and cons in his heart. The next moment, he made a decision. He would go to the Dao universe!Once they won, not only would they be able to kill these threats, but they would also be able to occupy the great Dao universe.He could not resist such temptation.Hadn't they been planning to take over the Silvermoon world?However, the Silvermoon world was not even as good as the great Dao universe.The opportunity was right in front of him. A treasure that was more precious than what he had planned for a hundred thousand years was right in front of him. Even though he knew the danger, why didn't he try? why didn't he try?

2117 Chapter 357
In an instant, Zheng Hongyuan broke through the void and stepped into the passage.The six of them were like good friends who hadn't seen each other for many years. They strolled into the great path universe and didn't stay near the passage or fight.Everything could be discussed inside.The expressions of the Silver Moon martial masters all changed.Could Li Hao and the others ... Win?Director Zhao and the others also wanted to go in, but Li Hao didn't bring them along.It was obvious that they were not prepared to bring them to the battle.Director Zhao's expression changed, and he hollered,""Clean up the battlefield and gather everything. Great desolation King, restrain your great desolation tribe, disarm them, and wait for further arrangements!"The great desolate King's expression changed.However, when he saw the killing intent in the eyes of the Silver Moon martial masters around him, he frowned and chose to compromise."Put down your weapons!" He shouted.The great desolate Army was slightly at a loss.But at this moment ... They all felt a little uneasy.This was especially so when the large number of great desolate Army soldiers had gone mad and suffered heavy casualties. Now, the remaining great desolate Army was probably only left with 700000 people. Under such circumstances, their King had surrendered. How could they still have the heart to resist?Soon, the sound of weapons falling to the ground reverberated through the world.Countless weapons were abandoned. One by one, the cavalrymen alighted from their mounts. They were a little anxious as they waited for arrangements.In the distance, the boundless city appeared. Lin Hongyu and the others welcomed Princess Yue into the city. They were all smiling, but Princess Yue's expression kept changing.These few people had put it nicely and invited her into the ancient city as a guest. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  But ... After she was invited in, she quickly separated from the White Horse.The elite soldiers following behind her were also surrounded by tens of thousands of armored soldiers. This made Princess ni feel uneasy. She felt like she had just escaped from a Tiger's Den and was now in a Wolf's Den. Furthermore, this group of people felt even more terrifying than wild beasts!Lin Hongyu, on the other hand, was like a big sister next door, smiling brightly."Princess Yue, don't worry. After the Marquis has killed the enemy, the great desolate King will have contributed greatly in this battle. The Marquis is impartial and will definitely reward him. The great wilderness will no longer have to live a bitter life and will be able to enter the prosperous central region and become a part of Heavenly Star ..."Princess Yue's expression changed slightly, but she didn't say anything.To the central region ...To the wasteland, which was used to the border wilderness, once they entered the central region, the advantage of cavalry would be gone ... Moreover, by then, it would be hard to say if there would be any more cavalry.However, he really couldn't care about this at this moment.Lin Hongyu's voice resounded through the air,""Everyone, quickly enter the city! In case of an enemy attack ... Withdraw from the great wastelands and wait for Lord Marquis's orders!"In an instant, a large number of troops began to gather at borderless city. A huge ancient city appeared in the sky.This was also the first time in 100000 years that a main city had officially appeared in the world. Whether it was Hurricane city or heaven battling city, they had never been revealed to the public.The Army quickly regrouped, while the great desolate Army, with some uneasiness and fear, quickly headed towards the ancient city under the lead of the great desolate Queen and a few civil and military officials.Lin Hongyu and the others did not have their eyes on them.The vast wilderness was nothing more than a scabies disease!The key was still the Heavenly King! If they could kill the Heavenly King this time, it would be a great victory.If he couldn't ... Even if he destroyed the great wilderness and killed a few Saints from the mortal world, it wouldn't matter. It would just be a small matter and not a decisive factor.Just as everyone was thinking about all this, a large city suddenly appeared in the distance.It was just a flash, as if it was observing something. Soon, the big city disappeared."Hurricane city!" Lin Hongyu's expression changed.At this moment, the heaven and earth were more stable than before. Even though the red dust might not be able to walk out, it should be able to do so. After all, a lot of the chaotic Qi had dissipated in the great wilderness.He had to be more careful.Lin Hongyu wanted to track them down, but she gave up in the end. If the Marquis won, these people would not be able to escape, but if he lost ... It would be useless even if she managed to track them down.Everyone was worried.However, he didn't say it out loud.……At the same time.In the bright star sector.Zheng Hongyuan looked around and suddenly laughed."Little friend, you're not very honest. Is the great Dao universe so dark? It's like everything is nothing ..."Li Hao didn't say anything.However, the ninth Master's Voice suddenly sounded, with a hint of coldness,""Zheng Hongyuan, I want to ask you something. Whether it's the Li family or neo martial arts, have they been harsh to your Zheng family? Others may feel that it's unfair to betray you, but your Zheng family is one of the eight great families, and you're a Heavenly King. Why would you betray us?""Li Daozong, what reason do you need?" Zheng Hongyuan smiled. In fact ... Wasn't the extraordinary world the same reason? The human King and the others have blocked our path, not giving us a path forward, it's that simple! It's fine if they don't have the ability to become venerable sovereigns, but the human King has cut off the hope of Heavenly Kings becoming venerable sovereigns. The world is divided into three parts, the human king and emperor Cang occupy one part, the world's venerable sovereigns occupy one part, and the remaining billions of common people occupy one part ... We can't allow new people to rise!""The predecessors have occupied the road ahead, but what can we do? Since we have become Heavenly Kings, we want to become venerable sovereigns ... But venerable swordsman has a small world, but he doesn't want to refine it, and he doesn't want to give it to anyone else. Don't you think it's unfair?"Zheng Hongyuan didn't try to defend himself and laughed."Is it wrong to do so in order to become stronger? "After cultivating your entire life to this level, you'll be stuck at this level for the rest of your life. Do you think ... Everyone would be happy to see that? You know there's a path ahead, but you've cut it off ..."

2118 Chapter 357
It was just that simple.There wasn't much of a reason.Everyone knew that the world was divided into three parts. In the post-neo martial era, it was almost impossible to become a venerable sovereign!For some people, cutting off the path ahead was a blood feud!What other reason did he need?As soon as these words came out, several strong men fell silent. They were only Saints and had not reached the level of Heavenly Kings, so they could not understand that feeling. Perhaps when they became Heavenly Kings and were about to enter the level of venerable sovereigns, they might have the same idea.In the later stage of the new martial era, it seemed that there were indeed some drawbacks ... It seemed that some people's path forward had been cut off.At this moment, li Fuhai suddenly said,""Zheng Hongyuan, stop finding excuses! You're just afraid of death! If they don't know, how can you not know? The human King once ordered that once someone advances to venerable sovereign, they can advance as long as they pass the test ...""That's just to give you a little hope ..."Zheng Hongyuan suddenly laughed.Li Fuhai sneered."You only think that you can't pass the test. This also means that you don't have the ability of a venerable sovereign!"Zheng Hongyuan wasn't in a hurry to attack. He shook his head."No, no, no, you don't understand! Someone had tried it before, and the result was ... It vanished like smoke! The human King actually used the good fortune Jade Disk to cooperate with the God forger's lightning tribulation to test the common people ... What a joke! In the early stage of the new martial arts, even in the early stage of the martial arts world, there was no venerable sovereign's tribulation. In the era of the human King, after the human King and the others became venerable sovereigns, the result was that they created a world-destroying venerable sovereign's tribulation ... Isn't this deliberately killing those who pose a threat?"Li Fuhai said coldly,"that's because the human King thinks that those who come after have not experienced the battle of new martial arts. They don't have enough will and have not suffered enough. It's already a blessing for them to become Heavenly Kings smoothly. If they want to become venerable sovereigns, they naturally have to take the test ... Are we going to let them become venerable sovereigns smoothly?" Then neo martial arts would have been in complete chaos!"Those who came later still had a chance.It would be fine as long as he survived the Great Tribulation!Even if those venerable sovereigns in the early stage of the new martial arts came again, everyone could pass it. It was not deliberately targeted, but in the late stage of the new martial arts, everyone's progress was too fast, and there was no strong enemy by their side, so their realm was superficial.The current sages, even if they hadn't severed their source, were still inferior to those who had participated in the early stage of the neo martial arts war. They were not on the same level!Therefore, the venerable sovereign's tribulation was a test for all the strong people in the post-neo martial era.Zheng Hongyuan, who was in front of him, had obviously heard the news after he became a Heavenly King. He felt that there was no hope of surviving the Great Tribulation, so he had chosen another path. Perhaps he thought that this way, his chances were greater!Li Fuhai suddenly laughed and said shamelessly,""You're just finding excuses for your incompetence! "You thought that you wouldn't pass the Tribulation and would only die, so you chose to betray and collude with Hong Yue ... In the end, even if you colluded with Hong Yue, you didn't expect that the Stargate would be completely sealed and the origin would be cut off directly, causing you to be sealed for many years and unable to leave ..."I didn't expect that the recovery methods I prepared in advance would be destroyed again and again. It's been 100000 years. You're useless. Do you think you're worthy of controlling the great path universe, the Silvermoon world, and becoming a venerable sovereign?"Li Fuhai's words were extremely vicious.It looked simple and honest, but when it spoke, it was not simple and honest at all.  Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ At this moment, he even mocked,"have you found anything from your investigation?" Have you adapted to this place? You're not making a move because you're adapting to the environment, so why are we not making a move?"Zheng Hongyuan's expression changed slightly.The reason why he hadn't made a move was indeed to Scout his surroundings and adapt to the environment. Thus, he wasn't in a hurry. He was more than willing to chat with these people for a while.Then, why were Li Hao and the others not making a move? were they also waiting for something?At this moment, the void trembled. In an instant, a large array covered the entire area.Dozens of monster plants appeared in all directions, and the formation appeared.Tens of thousands of heaven-battling Army soldiers surrounded the area under the leadership of an orange-armored warrior. In the distance, the orange-armored warrior's aura was a little weak, and his voice reverberated,""Reporting to the two guards, the Yao plant Army and heaven battling Army have already sealed off the surroundings. Zheng Hongyuan will not be able to escape even if he has wings!"Zheng Hongyuan's eyes flickered. Wu Peng? Was this person Wu Peng?At this moment, he was not too sure.At the same time, Li Hao's figure also appeared. He raised his head to look. Zheng Hongyuan couldn't see it, but Li Hao could see even deeper. The formation wasn't meant to kill Zheng Hongyuan!This was the great defensive formation!Its purpose was to block the power of Thunder from the outside. Yes, the great Dao Thunder.Li Hao was going to gather the Thunderbolts of the great path!Zheng Hongyuan's body was filled with the power of the Crimson Moon. It seemed that he had been in contact with the people of the Crimson Moon universe and had been invaded. However, no lightning had descended yet because Li Hao had kept them outside.The bolts of lightning were not lethal to the Heavenly King.However, if they were to block it and release it at the critical moment ... Perhaps there would be a qualitative change. Perhaps, a single bolt of lightning would be enough to severely injure the other party!Zheng Hongyuan thought that Li Hao was using a formation to trap and kill him ... But he had misunderstood Li Hao. Li Hao knew that the chances were not high.A group of monster plants without the leadership of a Saint, plus tens of thousands of heaven-battling troops, to deal with a Heavenly King ... It was impossible. Moreover, if they really participated in the war, they would definitely suffer heavy losses.Although he was not willing to let the Silvermoon people die and did not care about the neo martial artists 'deaths, he would definitely not deliberately let them die.

2119 Chapter 357
These monster plants, as well as the tens of thousands of heaven-battling Army soldiers, were all preparing for the release of the formation.As for Wu Peng, who had transformed into the armor ... It was actually not of much use. It was just a preparation to destroy the formation and draw out the Thunder. If Zheng Hongyuan believed it, it would be a surprise. If he did not believe it, it did not matter. At most, the effect would be a little worse.Zheng Hongyuan sighed,"so you were waiting for me here?" It seems that even heaven battling city has entered this place. Heaven battling Army, monster plants ... Formations ... Are they trying to trap and kill me? Are these all your trump cards?"He was smiling!After waiting for a long time, it turned out that this was all the Trump cards of Li Hao's side.Not bad!Dozens of monster plants, tens of thousands of heaven-battling troops, and a few Saints were indeed very powerful. It seemed that at the current stage, these guys could only bring out this much power.It was even beyond his imagination!But ... It wasn't enough.The next moment, he smiled."You guys ... Don't understand what a Heavenly King is ...""Bah, idiot. Without the origin, you're just a slightly stronger Saint. I've seen a bunch of venerable sovereigns. Who Do You Think You Are to mock?"Li Fuhai suddenly spat. He couldn't stand it!Who did he think was ignorant?Other than Li Hao, who hadn't seen a few experts?My grandfather is a venerable sovereign, my ancestor is a venerable sovereign, and my ancestor's friend, Emperor Nan, is a venerable sovereign. Moreover, he is an extremely powerful existence among the venerable sovereigns. Who is ignorant?It's fine to say this to others, but to me, who are you looking down on?Zheng Hongyuan's face darkened. In an instant, he disappeared.You talk too much!The water buffalo clan had taken the advantage of speculation. Their water power and strength were extraordinary. Two ordinary old bulls had become venerable sovereigns. The heavens had no eyes!His Zheng family, on the other hand, was full of talents. Whether it was him, his eldest son, or his third son, they were all extremely talented.In the end, the human King wanted to create a venerable sovereign tribulation and cut off their hopes of becoming a venerable sovereign.Now, when he heard li Fuhai's shameless words, he was furious.In an instant, a loud boom resounded through the world!BOOM!Li Fuhai also instantly transformed into a Golden Bull, incomparably strong. With a boom, his four hooves broke through the void!At the same time, from all directions, the pressure of the formation pressed down on the other party. However, to the Heavenly King ... It was better than nothing. He did not care too much and could not be bothered with these monster plants.Meanwhile, Li Hao and the others also attacked instantly. Their two big swords swept across the world!The two sides exchanged blows in an instant. Zheng Hongyuan laughed the moment they exchanged blows.If that's the only way ... Not only can I get rid of these obstacles today, but this great Dao universe and heaven battling city will also become my!Bang! Bang!A long whip appeared and was swung. It cut through the void and shattered the ninth master's sword will. The Zheng family's nine-section whip was also famous in the world. At this moment, Zheng Hongyuan no longer hid anything.A powerful aura was instantly revealed as he disappeared from his spot. His first move was like a Thunderbolt. He reached out his hand and the void shattered. A thick branch was caught in his hand and crushed into pieces with a crack. General Huai let out a muffled groan. The few of them were slightly shocked.This person had already walked quite a bit on the path of Heavenly Kings, and he was not the kind who had just entered the Heavenly King realm.Even though he had been a little weak when he had fought with the five divine beasts, he was still so powerful when he encountered them. The five divine beasts did not cause much damage or energy consumption to the other party.It was unbelievable!"Hahaha!"Zheng Hongyuan laughed out loud. He had finally released all the grievances he had held back for so many years!"Do you think that five wild beasts can kill me? Killing five desolate beasts only used one-fifth of my strength ... The rest is more than enough to kill you all!"One-fifth!The old turtle was a little shocked."You ... You've reached the late Heavenly King stage?" Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  Otherwise, how could he be so powerful?Without the support of the natural source, killing five Saints would consume so little energy. Didn't that mean that it would take dozens of Saints to kill him?"Hahaha!"Zheng Hongyuan didn't respond. He punched out, and the void trembled. Li Hao, who had been hiding in the dark, was forced out by the punch. He raised his eyebrows. It was indeed powerful!The six experts continued to exchange blows.They intersected with each other!The old turtle was in charge of defense, and the other four were in charge of offense.
