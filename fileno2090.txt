In the great wilderness.At this moment, the great wilderness was in a state of chaos. Some desolate beasts that had never appeared before had appeared in all directions. They had even appeared in the front lines of the Army, threatening the great wilderness Army to expand toward the eastern continent. These dire beasts were extremely powerful, and the Grand desolate Army did not dare to resist.At the front line, Princess ni was wearing a golden robe and riding on a White Horse. Her eyes were filled with anger and uneasiness.Desolate beasts had never participated in the internal affairs of the vast wilderness.But now, the wild beasts had appeared of their own accord and even driven away the great desolate Army to expand their territory. The eastern continent, on the other hand, was heavenstar's territory, and heavenstar's Li Hao had just defeated the other three countries not long ago.Under such circumstances, choosing to attack heavenstar now was an extremely unsafe choice.On the other side, tens of thousands of heaven battling Army soldiers and tens of thousands of star Army soldiers from other armies were standing.The Silver Moon experts all had powerful auras.The two sides had already had a brief collision. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Even though the great desolate Army had not been completely defeated with the help of the desolate beasts, their overall strength was inferior to the other party. In this short exchange, in addition to the fact that they had been targeted by the Heaven's Will the moment they left the great desolate Army, they had lost at least ten thousand soldiers in just a few exchanges.This was a world of difference compared to the rumors of the other party being unable to withstand a single blow in a confrontation with the Li Dynasty!That day, they had seen the soldiers of heavenstar soar into the sky with many Qian fighters, but when they really fought, they realized that the soldiers of heavenstar were more terrifying than they had imagined, and the killing intent of their generals was even more terrifying!Moreover, the number of soldiers in the Heavenly Star Army was still increasing.More and more people joined in.At present, heavenstar only had a little more than a million troops, and they were all elites. Heavenstar, which had a population of ten billion, only had a million troops. This ratio was too small, but it was also because of this that those who remained were all elites from various places.Princess Yue thought of what her father had said that day. There were some things that she didn't understand before, but now she understood.The desolate beasts ... Were not willing to continue lying dormant.However, his father wanted to retreat.Among them, there were other powers. The great wilderness was a weakling among them and had no way of resisting. At this moment, there were hundreds of desolate beasts mixed in the Army, and these desolate beasts, perhaps ... Were all experts at the sun Moon realm.It was extremely terrifying!In the vast great wilderness, there were very few that had truly stepped into the sun Moon realm. How could they be a match for these desolate beasts?He couldn't resist!Not only that, the desolate beasts did not care about the deaths of the elite great desolate Army soldiers. Instead, they allowed these soldiers to die. Every soldier that died would give off some aura of chaos, adding bricks and tiles to the expansion of their chaos! The star Army on the other side was also ruthless. Even though they had seen that killing the great desolate Army would cause the chaos to continue expanding, the generals were still ruthless and merciless. There were even silver Moon experts who personally participated in the slaughter.Just like that, the two sides silently clashed several times, and Da Huang was always the one at a disadvantage."Ma Zun!"At this moment, Princess ni rode her White Horse and returned to the back. Behind her, there was a Black Horse that looked like a human. It wasn't standing or sitting, but its front hooves were like arms as it freely ate some food.Hearing Princess NI's voice, the wild beast clan expert glanced at her from the corner of his eye,"why are you back instead of commanding the battle at the front line?""Ma Zun, the Heavenly Star Army is too strong. Their generals are also extremely strong. That Silver Moon Administration Director Zhao Shuguang is even stronger. Even the other desolate beast seniors are no match for him ... I hope that Ma Zun can take action personally ..." Princess ni said in a deep voice.The horse looked out of the chaos.Zhao Shuguang.It had seen that he was indeed very strong. He had even killed a desolate beast before. According to the ranking system of Li Hao and the others, he was about to reach the seventh level of the sun Moon realm. Such combat power had already surpassed some peak undying fighters. Even if he was not invincible, ordinary undying fighters would find it difficult to defeat him.More importantly, Silver Moon had a lot of sun and moon combat power!At this moment, there were still some people at Silvermoon's peak who had not appeared.It was very powerful, but it was not in the chaos. Once it left the chaos, the Heaven's Will would target it. Even if it had the battle strength of a Saint, it might not be able to take down this person outside the chaos."It's ... Not difficult to take down the other party!"Ma Zun said indifferently,"continue to expand. As long as the primal Chaos reaches, these people won't be able to withstand a single blow!" I can't rashly go out because the chaos can't cover it and the Heaven's Will is targeting me. Instead, I'll be greatly suppressed ... So, it's up to you to deal with the other party. "Princess Yue's eyes were filled with anger.How to deal with it?To use human lives to fill in?These powerful desolate beasts didn't go out, but once they attacked, they had to leave the chaotic region. Only when many people died would the chaotic aura spread. These desolate beasts were expanding their territory. In this way ... They were actually using human lives to exchange for territory.Could the millions of elites of the vast wilderness withstand such a torment?Princess Yue took a deep breath and said,""If Ma Zun can't make it out ... Please let me see my father. My father is strong enough to make it out of the great wastelands. If my father is willing to fight personally, the morale of the troops will definitely be boosted ...""Your father is currently in closed-door cultivation and can't rashly come out."Princess Yue quickly suppressed the anger and resentment in her heart. She knew that her father must have been imprisoned or even killed by the other party ... He might still be alive, but she could no longer see her father.Not only that, even the civil and military officials could no longer be seen. The great wilderness 'imperial court now had a divine desolate beast personally overseeing it!

"Understood ... I'll be going to the front line!"Princess Yue did not say anything more. She quickly rode her White Horse and rushed to the front line, passing through the crowd. Soon, tens of thousands of elites followed behind. It was the most elite army of the great wilderness, and they were all protecting the princess. They were all very powerful and even equipped with some neo martial armors.Behind him, Ma Zun only took a glance before continuing to eat. Beside him, a black-armored warrior who had been silent the entire time suddenly spoke,""Ma Zun, I'm afraid that the father and daughter of the great desolation King will not be satisfied with this decision. Why don't we eliminate them completely? Imprison or kill this Princess ni ..."Ma Zun said indifferently,"kill her, and the great desolate Army will be handed over to you?" The great wilderness ... It's not just our great wilderness, it also belongs to these people. Without them, how can the great wilderness continue to expand?"It didn't have a good tone with the one beside it.This person was from Hurricane city.It wasn't Hong Chen, but a very powerful Saint. The other party was at the edge of the great wilderness. The moment the two sides came into contact, he directly entered this place from Hurricane city. It was clear how bold he was.However, Da Huang quickly cut off his connection with the other party.The wild beasts were not stupid. They were worried that once the two sides were connected, more powerful cultivators would come out of Hurricane city. So, when the other side had a Saint enter, they quickly cut off the chaos covering the nearby area."Do you guys think that Li Hao might personally come to the great wilderness ... Does he have the courage?" Ma Zun continued."Of course!"Black armor nodded."This person is quite bold. The enemy has already taken over boundless city. The enemy is not weak. Several Saints in boundless city have been killed ... Of course, there may be other factors, but the enemy has the ability to kill Saints. This is inevitable! Lord Hong Chen asked me to tell you not to underestimate Li Hao ... The best way is to let the great wilderness and Hurricane city border each other. More experts from the city will enter this place and help the great wilderness kill Li Hao!"Ma Zun did not say anything.At that time, he wouldn't be able to just kill Li Hao.Killing the great wilderness's Saint, subverting the great wilderness, and forcefully reviving it a second time ... Wouldn't that be no loss to you?If he could kill Li Hao and overturn the vast wilderness, he would be killing two birds with one stone.The desolate beast had stood for many years, so how could it not know the thoughts of these people?Cooperating with these people was like asking a Tiger for its skin.However, if they didn't cooperate ... The great wilderness would expand, and Li Hao's side wasn't weak. Although there were several Sacred Beasts in the great wilderness, they might not be able to take them down easily. They might suffer great losses, which was also what the few divine desolate beasts were worried about."I haven't seen Li Hao ... These days.""Maybe he's in seclusion, maybe he's planning something, maybe ... He's already in the great wilderness!""Impossible!"Ma Zun shook his head and said indifferently,"the people of the great wilderness all have the aura of desolate beasts and chaos. Outsiders, such as you, will be able to sense a thing or two the moment they enter. If Li Hao comes, we will be the first to notice!" Beside him, the Saint also nodded.The other party's perception was indeed very sharp.Otherwise, when the two sides bordered each other, there wouldn't be just a Saint like him. There would be more. However, the moment the two sides came into contact, the desolate beasts sensed it and quickly cut off the connection between the chaos and Hurricane city.Hurricane city could be moved, but it was useless. If you moved it in, the other party would cut off the chaotic aura nearby, and you would instead fall into the encirclement of the vast wilderness. You would also be unable to leave the ancient city, which would be troublesome.The desolate beasts controlled the great desolate land.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ The reason why he was allowed to enter was because a Saint couldn't topple the great wilderness. There were truly quite a number of Sage Dao desolate beasts in the great wilderness, a total of six. Furthermore ... This was only what he saw.Would there be more?Who knows?The Saint from the ancient city thought that it would be best if he could take the opportunity to kill Li Hao, but if he couldn't ... He had to find a way to deal with the great wilderness and restore the world once and for all.The great wilderness had invaded the heavens and earth. If they destroyed the great wilderness, not only would it revive a second time, it might even make the Heaven's Will favor them and give them more convenience. After all, the great wilderness was a malignant tumor of the heavens and earth.……The two sides were still in a confrontation.At this moment, Li Hao had already arrived. He looked at the dense Army of the Grand desolate Army. Their bodies were filled with the aura of the Grand desolate and the aura of chaos. He was a little timid, but he was still forced to charge forward again and again.Every time someone died in battle, there would be some chaotic Qi permeating into the void. Soon, desolate beasts would rush out and fill the sky with even more chaotic Qi. The territory of the great wilderness was slowly expanding.If no one stopped them, they might soon occupy the entire Eastern continent."Lord Marquis!"At this moment, a few experts had arrived.Director Zhao's aura became more and more powerful. Li Hao glanced at him. Perhaps very soon, this person would officially step into the seventh level of the sun Moon realm. It might be in the next moment.At the seven stages of the sun Moon realm, at least 28 meridians had been opened. Director Zhao should have opened 27 meridians, and the 28th should only be one or two acupuncture points away, right?Sword of Light and the others had also arrived, and they were much stronger than before.The light sword wasn't part of the group of 10 previously, but now, it also had the power of the fourth level of the sun Moon tier.As for the 10-man team, the ones who had been forcefully promoted by the earth glory's Saint, hou Xiaochen, Yuan Shuo, and Kong Jie had all died in battle. The rest were already at the 4th or even 5th stage of the sun Moon tier.

Chapter 2092 Conspiracy (3)
Silvermoon's side was much stronger than when they were dealing with boundless city.At this moment, Lin Hongyu and the others hadn't arrived yet, and Li Hao didn't ask them to come either. Instead, he asked them to continue pushing forward the reform.At this moment, Li Hao saw the female general in the Golden robe and white Horse.He knew who that person was.She was the daughter of the great desolate King and was said to be a valiant general.The other party was surrounded by over ten thousand elites of the vast wilderness, and they weren't any weaker than the Demon Hunter Army.Li Hao looked back. The great wilderness was a little dark, and he couldn't see clearly. It wasn't because the sky was dark, but because the aura of chaos in the great wilderness made it impossible to see."Has the great desolate King appeared?""No, I didn 't,"Director Zhao shook his head."Up until now, other than this Princess ni, we haven't even seen a single decent upper echelon of the vast wilderness ..."  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ After saying that, he said,"if I'm not wrong, he might have been imprisoned or even killed by a dire beast!" After all, we still need the help of the Grand desolate Army. However, the other party is likely to be imprisoned. ""The desolate beast has personally appeared in the great desolate Army, and the great desolate Army feels threatened. It should be the desolate beast that has taken over the great desolate."Director Zhao was also a Dragon among men and could already tell,"Lord Marquis, are you trying to contact the great desolate King?"At this point, he shook his head and said,"it's very difficult and very dangerous!" Furthermore, the great desolate King doesn't really have anything to do with the overall situation ... The foundation of the great desolate is these desolate beasts. Even if the great desolate King has some combat strength, he's at most at the fourth or fifth stage of the sun Moon realm, and can't be any stronger. "There was actually no point in contacting the Grand desolate King.He didn't recommend that Li Hao take the risk to enter the vast wilderness and contact the great desolate King.Li Hao, however, had his own thoughts. He said,""Do you think there's anyone from the mortal world in the great wilderness?"The moment he said that, director Zhao hesitated for a moment before nodding his head,""It's possible! Those people will not let the previous revival plan go after it failed. Dealing with the vast wilderness will allow them to quickly revive. Even if they can't solve the problem of the vast wilderness, they want to see us and the vast wilderness suffer together ... This time, the great wilderness's attack might also be fueled by these people. "On the side, BA Dao was a little irascible. He wasn't as cold as before and was only a little restless. He said in a low voice,"Then kill them! Although the great desolation is strong, it's not like we can't put up a fight!"Li Hao glanced at BA Dao and shook his head.""How many people have to die? There are at least five or six saints in the wild beast ... And the mortal world is watching us like a tiger watching its prey. Even if I use all my strength to kill a few Saints, in the end ... We'll both suffer! And now, everything is just beginning ...""Do I have to be patient again?"BA Dao suddenly became a little crazy, and his saber intent spread out."When we destroyed boundless city, Lord Marquis said that there was no need for Silvermoon to lie low and wait for the sun to rise. Are you going to ... Back down?"These people were much more aggressive than before. It was both a good and a bad thing.Li Hao shook his head."Of course not. Times are different now. I've killed a Saint. I'm not afraid of anything!" Why would he be patient and beg for peace again? It's just that ... Too many casualties is not the result I want to see, so don't worry. ""BA Dao, why are you in such a rush when the Marquis makes a decision?" Tian Jian asked with a deep voice.BA Dao was a quiet person in the past.But now, there was no peace.All of them were filled with a violent desire to destroy the world, and they couldn't wait to kill all the enemies.Li Hao was silent for a while."Can you contact Princess Yue?" he asked."I want to enter the vast wilderness. Is there any way?""Lord Marquis ..."Li Hao raised his hand."I'm fine. Even if I enter the vast wilderness, these guys won't be able to deal with me easily!"Li Hao said,"the great desolate King must not be willing to be a puppet and be imprisoned by the desolate beasts at will. He can't bear to see the millions of elite soldiers become the stepping stones for the desolate beasts 'invasion. The meaning of these desolate beasts is obvious. They want to invade the eastern continent with the aura of chaos left behind by these soldiers who died in battle." So ... There's still room for discussion. ""Talk?" Li Hao nodded and smiled,"it's just the vast wilderness, not worth mentioning!" The key lies in the wild beasts, in the mortal world ..."He looked at director Zhao and thought,"I have a rather risky decision ... It will require the cooperation of both armies, as well as the cooperation of everyone here. If we succeed, there will be many benefits. If we fail ... Who cares!"Li Hao smiled."Victory and defeat are common. But if we succeed, there might be unexpected benefits!""Please go ahead, Lord Marquis," director Zhao said hurriedly."I need an Army of a million soldiers to release their auras at the same time and let their roars resound through the heavens and earth, covering the sun! To confuse both sides and make them mistake each other for people from the other side ..."His words were a little vague, but director Zhao could understand.As he thought about it, he roughly knew what Li Hao was thinking. The two armies were engaged in a fierce battle. Their auras exploded, and their blood Qi disturbed the heaven and earth, covering the sky and the sun.Was it for the sake of the world of mortals?To make that person in Star Town City mistake the red dust World as a reinforcement of the wild beasts, and to make the wild beasts and red dust World mistake that person as Li Hao's reinforcement?He judged for a while and said in a deep voice,"it's very risky. They're all top-notch powerhouses!" "Once both sides recognize each other ... It will be a huge problem for us! It's not bad that the blood and energy of a million soldiers burst out and the aura of chaos burst out, disrupting the world ... But once the two sides come into contact ... Or communicate with each other ..."Li Hao shook his head,'it's a gamble if we don't rashly communicate through words! Winning the bet was a great victory! Even if you lose ... There's still a way out. "

This time, it was not a dead end.Heaven battling city had already been teleported to the vicinity of the passage, and they could escape at any time.As for Li Hao, he had previously played dumb with Yu Hai for this reason. However ... This required both sides to cooperate. In the vast wilderness, only when an Army fought, disturbing the heavens and earth, with millions of soldiers 'vitality soaring to the sky, and their shouts shaking the heavens and earth, could everything be disturbed.Otherwise ... Given that they were all top-notch experts, how could they not recognize the other party?If one side exploded, it wouldn't have much effect. It would only work if both sides cooperated.On the other hand, the red dust World was used to acting like ghosts. Li Hao concluded that even if they sent someone, they would hide in the back and not rush to the front line.There was a 99% chance that Hong Chen was not in the great desolate territory.It was definitely a Heavenly King expert. The great desolate beast would not allow a Heavenly King to enter its domain until its brain was completely muddled. This was all Li Hao's deduction. Of course, it was all reasonable and well-founded.Therefore, even if there were Saints on the side of the mortal world, there would not be too many of them. They would definitely not exceed the number of Sage path desolate beasts in the great wilderness.It seemed like he was going alone ... But he could summon several Saints at any time. Perhaps, he could take the opportunity to kill several Saints!All of this required the cooperation of the great desolate King and the great desolate Army.If he succeeded, he might be able to eliminate a large number of Saints and even Yu Hai.Break its claws and teeth!He was also worried that once he killed all the great desolate beasts, would it cause the chaos to shatter and the world to recover a second time ... This also required the great desolate King to provide some support and information.Therefore, he really wanted to meet the great desolate King.As Li Hao thought, director Zhao hesitated. He looked across and said,""Our auras are incompatible with the great wilderness. The moment we enter, we will be discovered by the other party ... Then ... Then right now, we can only fight. Lord Marquis, I will personally meet with this Princess Yue. I'm afraid ... That the other party will turn on us and try to lure Lord Marquis into the great wilderness.""I'm fine. "Li Hao shook his head. Director Zhao suddenly sighed,"You shouldn't have let Qian Wuliang leave. Otherwise, he could be here to judge whether the other party is sincere in cooperating with us."Originally, everyone was very against that guy.But now, he didn't reject Qian Wuliang so much anymore. Sometimes, he really needed Qian Wuliang. "He should be back soon," Li Hao said with a smile."Very soon?"Director Zhao was a little surprised. Ying Hongyue wasn't easy to deal with. Could Qian Wuliang solve the problem on her side quickly?"There's no need to be so overcautious!"Li Hao said,"March and attack. You just need to negotiate. It doesn't matter if you succeed or not!" If it doesn't work ... We'll attack with the Army and create chaos. If it doesn't work, we'll set aside our goals and lower our expectations!""Understood!"Director Zhao nodded."Lord Marquis, then ... Shall we attack?" the Sword of Light quickly said."You're the governor of the East, you're in charge!""Yes!" The light sword was excited and did not say much. It quickly returned to the battlefield. The next moment, the long sword shot into the sky and roared,""Attack!"BOOM!Hundreds of thousands of soldiers were densely packed. Like the sky falling, they pressed toward the millions of soldiers on the opposite side. This was a wasteland, a desert area. The terrain was vast. The chaotic Qi of both sides acted as the dividing line. In an instant, the two armies came into contact.BOOM!The sound of the collision was like a thunderclap, and the battle cries shook the heavens and earth.At this moment, Li Hao watched silently.The Silver Moon Army was getting stronger and stronger.The heaven battling Army and the Demon Hunter Army were like sharp knives, stabbing into the hearts of the other party. There were many great wilderness cavalrymen, and their Warriors were not weak, but they were still forced to retreat in the face of the Silver Moon Army. Desolate beasts quickly joined the battlefield.The Silver Moon martial masters also joined in, and their roars resounded through the sky!On the battlefield, a female general in a golden robe and white armor quickly joined the battle. On the other side, Zhao Shuguang disappeared instantly and pierced through the void. In the blink of an eye, a huge seal pressed down, shattering the sky.Princess Huan only had the power of the sun Moon realm and was barely at the middle stage. How could she fight against director Zhao who was about to enter the late stage? in an instant, she was beaten into a mess. If it wasn't for the fact that her horse was strong and agile, she would have been killed by director Zhao.As Li Hao watched, he suspected that director Zhao didn't want to negotiate but wanted to kill him directly!Very quickly, a few more desolate beasts appeared around director Zhao to help Princess ni.Li Hao, on the other hand, raised his eyebrows after a glance.In his eyes, a golden light flickered.These wild beasts ... It felt like they were not helping the princess, but protecting the White Horse. Could it be that the White Horse had an impressive background?He only looked at it for a while and didn't pay much attention.He continued to observe the great desolation Army, and soon, he reached out his hand, and a weak chaotic aura spread from beneath his feet.Although he said that he was going to discuss with the other party ... Li Hao wouldn't really wait with Great Expectations.He was also thinking of ways to sneak into the vast wilderness.The aura of chaos!He absorbed some of it into his body. He frowned slightly as he felt some rejection."Chaos is also a Dao, and everything is a Dao ... Chaos must also have a great Dao corresponding to it ..." n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Chaos should not be rejected.Otherwise, when new Dao realm experts entered the universe in the future, would they still be rejected by the chaos?Therefore, the Dao of chaos should also have a corresponding Dao Meridian.Li Hao silently sensed and sensed.After a while, his eyes flickered. There was a faint fluctuation in a part of his body.

2094 Chapter 354
Li Hao quickly absorbed some of the chaotic aura. When the rejected chaotic aura touched that part of his body, it instantly disappeared. Li Hao's eyes lit up.As expected!I knew it. Everything has a Dao, and it's impossible for chaos not to be a great Dao.This way, things would be much easier.In an instant, he absorbed even more chaos Qi.At this moment, the two sides were engaged in a fierce battle. A large number of sergeants and even desolate beasts were killed. Chaos spread out, and Li Hao quickly extracted the aura of chaos.……The great wilderness.Ma Zun was currently controlling the spread of the chaos, when suddenly a look of suspicion appeared in his eyes. Many people had died, and a few desolate beasts had died, but in the end...The spread of the chaos did not reach his expectations.Some of them seemed to have disappeared into thin air.It was a little puzzled and a little strange.The aura of chaos could only be absorbed by desolate beasts. As for the humans of the great wilderness, they had been living with them for a long time, so their bodies already contained some desolate beast bloodline. That was why they could absorb it.The others would not be able to absorb it.Since that was the case ... Where did the chaos aura go?Just as it was thinking about this, the Heaven's Will on the other side suddenly trembled, shaking the heavens and earth. It seemed to have understood something as it cursed in its heart. The Heaven's Will was targeting it again. This heaven's will was getting stronger and stronger.It could even destroy some of the chaos.If he waited any longer, the great wilderness might not expand and the Heaven's Will might take the initiative to destroy the chaos. However, he could not wait any longer.……At the same time.Waves of chaotic energy disappeared from Li Hao's body. Soon, a Dao Meridian appeared, and Li Hao smiled.The chaos Dao Meridian!It felt very strong ...He didn't care too much and opened it bit by bit. Soon, his body also exuded a faint chaotic aura.The next moment, Li Hao disappeared into thin air.At this moment, Princess ni was in a tough battle. The few desolate beasts that came to her aid were no match for director Zhao. Two of them were even killed. Director Zhao's strength was extremely terrifying!Princess Yue now understood why her father refused to go to war.Heavenstar was so powerful ... Even the powerful desolate beasts were killed, how could they attack?As for what director Zhao said, she was considering it ... But she was also worried that the other party was just trying to interfere with her. If he really wanted to cooperate, why would he be so cruel?BOOM!With a loud bang, the White Horse was sent flying.Princess Yue, who was on her White Horse, was also spitting out blood. Her face was pale. He was too strong!Behind him, Ma Zun seemed to have sensed it as well. In an instant, a mighty force descended from the heavens and earth, his voice booming: "Retreat!"Boom! Boom! Boom!The Army and desolate beasts retreated into the chaos. Seeing this, director Zhao didn't chase.In the distance, the Sword of Light shouted,""Stop!" Since the other party had retreated into the chaos, there was no need to pursue him.The two sides engaged in battle. Even though their Army was only a third of the enemy 's, they still managed to defeat the great desolate Army.……Princess ni kept spitting out blood and her face turned pale.Behind him, the soldiers quickly arrived, their faces filled with worry.And at this moment, no one cared. There was an extra soldier on a horse beside them. The battle was chaotic, and with director Zhao's lightning-like attack, even the desolate beasts were killed. Who would care about an extra soldier?Li Hao observed Princess Yue for a moment, then quickly shifted his gaze to the White Horse.His injuries recovered quickly.Inside his body, the aura of chaos kept spreading. His serious injury was healed in a short while. Li Hao's eyes flickered. This wild beast was either a descendant of a top expert or special.When he was injured just now, it even made a Saint path desolate beast a little anxious.The divine desolate beast had chosen to retreat not because the great desolate Army had suffered significant losses, but because ... This White Horse had been injured!"Interesting ..." Li Hao thought to himself.He turned his head and saw a Black Horse behind him. The next moment, Li Hao's eyes flickered. There was a man in Black armor beside the horse!His sword eyes were extremely sharp. In an instant, he felt a powerful aura flash by. It was ... A Saint!As expected!The red dust World had already made contact with this side. However, both sides did not seem to have come to an agreement or trust each other. Otherwise, there would not have been only one Saint. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Only one?"Too few, Li Hao thought.He wasn't seeking a Saint.At this moment, heaven battling city was in his territory. The old turtle, the ninth Division commander, li Fuhai, general Huai, and himself, as well as the heaven battling Army and the monster plants ...Even if he couldn't deal with six or seven Saints, three saints shouldn't be a problem.Only one was too little.Of course, there might be dire beasts accompanying them.Thinking of this, Li Hao sent a message through the armor.""Director Zhao, continue to exert pressure on the other party, mainly killing desolate beasts. Once the divine path appears, retreat quickly! We have to suppress the desolate beasts and cause them to suffer heavy losses ... So that we can lure more experts to join the great wilderness!""Understood.""Also ... If Qian Wuliang comes back, tell him to join the battle immediately. Tell him to put on my golden armor and pretend to be me to enter the wasteland!"“……”At this moment, a voice came from the armor,""Lord Marquis, I've just returned,"It was Qian Wuliang!Yes, he had returned.Since he dared to return, it meant that he had completed his mission.Li Hao actually knew that he had returned, but he didn't take the initiative to contact him.

However, what he had just said was also directed at a group of senior executives. It could be considered a public channel."Who did you kill? Yama or flying sword immortal?""Yama! Ying Hongyue took the others and about a thousand elites and escaped from the Li Dynasty ..."Li Hao wasn't surprised.Of the four great leaders, Ying Hongyue couldn't kill them. The heavenly Mountain Master was extremely powerful, probably even more powerful than Yama and flying sword immortal. Qian Wuliang could only kill the other two.The three great organizations and the clear sky Villa had nearly 100000 superpowers before, but now they only took 1000 elites with them ...Li Hao was a bit surprised.So many of them actually died?"How's the Li Dynasty?""The king of Dali is badly injured. One of Jiang Li's white jade bones was broken. Dozens of divine guards, dozens of priests, and tens of thousands of elite soldiers of Dali died ...""The king of Dali didn't kill you?" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "This ... The Marquis is Wuliang's backer, how would the king of the Li Dynasty dare to kill me?"Qian Wuliang, who had just returned, looked humble and embarrassed even though he didn't see Li Hao.The Li Dynasty had suffered significant losses.Many generals had died in the battle, and the king of Dali and the officiant were injured at the same time. The king of Dali did want to kill this bastard Qian Wuliang, because this bastard controlled tens of thousands of soldiers at the critical moment. He was fearless and even self-destructed to delay the movement of the major organizations.Heavy casualties!If the king of Dali wasn't afraid of Li Hao, he would've completely turned hostile. He was so angry that his heart almost exploded.Fortunately, Qian Wuliang said that he was going to leave after killing Yama. If he didn't leave, the king of Dali might really kill him."The Yama is dead ... Not bad!"Li Hao continued to transmit his voice. One of the three great organizations had finally been destroyed. He could tell Liu Yan this news later.Qian Wuliang was indeed a capable man.Li Hao had guessed that the other party would succeed, but he didn't expect it to be so fast.And ... He returned very quickly. This timing was really good. "You've just completed your mission, so I shouldn't have let you take the risk. However, it's difficult for ordinary people to impersonate me now ... Are you willing to take the risk again?""We will obey Lord Marquis's orders!""Then you ... Disguise yourself as me and sneak into the great wilderness carefully. Create some pressure for the great wilderness. I only have one request. I want more experts from the mortal world and desolate beasts to feel some pressure ... Also, it's best to let the desolate beasts know that I'm looking for reinforcements, extremely powerful reinforcements ... These are all very difficult, can you do it?""Sure!"Qian Wuliang answered without hesitation, but he was also happy that the previous conflict had finally been resolved.He had made the right move by rushing and offending the king of Dali and Jiang Li.If the Dali King was unhappy ... Then so be it!Weakening the Li Dynasty was also to make heavenstar safer. He was sure that Li Hao wouldn't care. The king of the Li Dynasty had returned with an Army of a million elites, so what if tens of thousands died?The king of Dali did not dare to turn hostile directly."That's it then ... We'll talk about the merit points later. ""I don't dare to claim credit!" Qian Wuliang responded quickly and then said,"Lord Marquis, Ying Hongyue has escaped. She might have gone to the Western divine Kingdom's territory. However, the other party should still have some arrangements in the Li Dynasty that are related to the forbidden Sea ...""I know."Li Hao didn't say anything, and Qian Wuliang didn't say anything either.Soon, they left the star army camp and disappeared.……Not long after, Ma Zun's eyes suddenly flickered as he looked in a certain direction.Beside him, the eyes of the black-armored expert flickered,""Ma Zun, have you found something?""Someone might have sneaked in ... I'll go take a look ..." Ma Zun calmly said.As soon as he finished speaking, he instantly disappeared.Very quickly, Ma Zun arrived at the previous location and disappeared once again. His eyes flickered as he chased after Li Hao.The other party ... Had good means.He seemed to have discovered him. He had chased after him several times, but the other party had shaken him off.No wonder those neo martial arts traitors were so afraid.Soon, black armor caught up and said,""Does Ma Zun need any help?""No need!"Ma Zun was somewhat dissatisfied. These people were like dog skin plaster.It was very troublesome!Seeing this, black armor didn't say anything. Instead of leaving, he followed Li Hao. If he could find Li Hao and kill him ... That would be a great achievement.But after both sides pursued for a while, Ma Zun's expression turned serious.It could sense that someone was constantly escaping, but ... After getting close to the other party a few times, the other party would soon discover it ahead of time and escape like a mudfish.Every time, he would create some trouble.Not only that ... Outside, the sounds of battle could be heard once again.The star Army had once again taken the initiative to attack!Moreover, Ma Zun quickly sensed that an expert had crossed the border. Damn it, creating a diversion, did he sneak in with Li Hao?With a loud boom, he saw a desolate beast being killed. In the next moment, he saw Zhao Shuguang smashing his seal at Princess ni, causing the White Horse to be injured again. Ma Zun's heart trembled.The White Horse could not be finished.This was the will of chaos.All the venerable wild beasts, for some reason, did not want anyone to control it alone. Therefore, this White Horse was the key to the chaos. Moreover, the spread of chaos also needed the will of chaos as the vanguard. Becoming Princess Yue's Mount was also to hide it from people.However, now ... He had become the target of Zhao Shuguang's attack.This was because Princess Yue was the leader of the Army.How troublesome!With a thought, in the next moment, a powerful aura rose in the distance. A wild beast that looked like a monkey rose from behind and headed straight in the direction of Zhao Shuguang and the others.

2096 Chapter 354
At the same time, a person appeared. Director Wang's voice shook the heavens,""A divine desolate beast? Do you really think you are invincible? Don't initiate a battle between Saints, or else ... In a few days, heaven battling city will be activated, and the Saints of the heaven battling Army will rush to the battlefield ... Can a group of barbarians withstand a blow from us, the heaven battling Saints?"The monkey-like desolate beast coldly shouted,"heaven battling city?" After sleeping for so many years and the main city is in ruins, how much combat power does he still have?""What a joke! Ignorant! "The Heavenly Star ore mine has long fallen into the hands of Heavenly Star. As long as the ore is still there, my heaven battling city can naturally move to this place and annihilate you bunch of barbarian people! Just a few divine desolate beasts, did they really think they were invincible? If you take the initiative to retreat, you still have a chance of survival ... Otherwise, the great wilderness will be destroyed, and the desolate beasts will be exterminated!""Heavenstar can destroy boundless city, so it can naturally destroy you all! The grandson of a Supreme Being is coming here soon ... The heavens are watching over us, and the great wilderness has been abandoned by the heavens. Do you want to occupy the heavens and earth? Heaven and earth will not tolerate this!"His voice shook the world.At this moment, Ma Zun didn't say anything, but he was somewhat solemn. Heaven battling city ... Would they really come?If that was the case ... It would be quite troublesome.At this moment, the black-armored man's eyes flickered as he transmitted a message,""There are indeed a few Saints in heaven battling city ... Li Hao seized the big star Mine, defeated the endless city, killed a few Saints, and seized a lot of immortal power and origin power. The Saints might have completely recovered ... I know you Venerables aren't afraid, but if we really fight, we'll definitely suffer heavy losses. Why don't we take advantage of the fact that they don't know of our existence? we ... Can help you get rid of them!"If heaven battling city's Saints recovered, then with the Heavenly Star experts and Li Hao ... It would indeed be difficult to deal with them.At this moment, Ma Zun was also very conflicted.Should I cooperate with these guys?But ... Working with them was also very dangerous.They couldn't let them be too strong, otherwise, the dire beasts would be in trouble. However, it was fine to let some people in."I'll discuss this with the other sovereigns ... However, the wasteland beast race has the ability to suppress the other party. Even if they come ... They won't have more than three saints. Otherwise, you'd better stay in Hurricane city!"Three saints?Black armor's heart moved. It was not impossible.Li Hao might have other tricks up his sleeve. When the two sides really started fighting, three saints would be enough to change many things."Good! However, they have many suns and moons, comparable to an undying. I think the desolate beasts ...""No need to worry!"Alright, black armor didn't say anything more. He actually wanted to get more undying over, but unfortunately, this desolate beast wasn't willing.The next moment, Ma Zun disappeared again, somewhat annoyed.Did Li Hao break in?It might really be him. Otherwise, how could he be so ghostly that he couldn't catch up with him after several attempts?At this time, the front line had no choice but to arrange for a divine path desolate beast to guard the place. When Li Hao barged in, Ma Zun quickly informed him, and soon, another divine path desolate beast appeared.Together with Ma Zun, they chased after Li Hao.……At this moment, Qian Wuliang's face turned grave as well, knowing that he would be killed if he was not careful. There were many saints chasing after him!Li Hao, as expected, still values me. He thought of me first when he was on such a difficult mission. He really thinks highly of me ... I comforted myself. I chose this myself, didn't I?……Not far away, Li Hao was also speechless, thinking,"Qian Wuliang is really capable!"A few Saints chased after him, but he actually managed to escape. He had chosen him to impersonate himself to enter and create chaos in the great wilderness. He had indeed not chosen the wrong person.At this moment, when he looked back, the divine desolate beast that had been guarding the great wilderness Royal Court had disappeared.Also, this White Horse definitely isn't ordinary. Director Zhao attacked this place twice to deal with the White Horse and even attracted a divine path desolate beast."Continue to attack!"As Li Hao's armor transmitted the message, the next moment, another battle broke out. In the chaos, Li Hao quickly disappeared.While the monkey was chasing after director Zhao, he sped towards the direction of the great wilderness imperial court.At this moment, outside the palace, there were three other desolate beasts. They were not weak and had undying power.However, they didn't find Li Hao. Li Hao daringly flashed into the palace.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  The three desolate beasts seemed to have sensed something and looked around. Their attention was attracted by the battle cries in the distance and they were a little irritated. These humans were so annoying. They attacked again and again and ran again and again. Weren't they tired?……At this moment, the great desolate King's aura was dispirited as he sat on his chair in deep thought.Some of the civil and military officials around were also depressed and pessimistic.Just as the Grand desolate King was thinking of all this, Li Hao's voice rang in his ears.""When the great wilderness invades the borders, does the great wilderness King have the ability to cause the million-strong great wilderness Army to instantly erupt, covering the heavens with their blood Qi and chaos covering the heavens and earth ... If you do, do it. If you don 't, forget it! If this is successful, I will leave the great wilderness behind. If I fail, the great wilderness will cease to exist!"The great desolate King's expression did not change.However, he was already extremely shocked.Under such circumstances, Li Hao ... Could actually contact him!He was actually talking in his ear!Heavens!It was unbelievable. There were many Saint path desolate beasts nearby.The next moment, something seemed to appear in his hand."This Is the Army's battle armor. It can recognize its owner by blood. Contact me! You are the only one who can contact me! Communicate with me directly! I have to leave now. If I don 't, I'll lose a great general!"

Chapter 2097 Conspiracy (8)
Li Hao's voice carried a hint of a smile."Also ... That White Horse isn't simple. I hope that the barren King can tell me about the situation. Also ... Your daughter has a good foundation. Finally ... Help me find out how many experts have come from the mortal world side ... As the leader of a side, if she doesn't even have this ability, there's no need to mention anything else."The great desolate King remained unmoved, only admiring Li Hao's courage.At this moment, if he shouted, perhaps ... This person would stay here!How dare he?This was too bold!There were many saints nearby.Of course, he wouldn't shout, but he was still shocked. Why was Li Hao so sure that he would stand on his side?He was the master of the vast wilderness!"Great desolation King, remember, only silver Moon people can control the Silver Moon world. Great desolation is also considered a Silver Moon person ... Be it desolate beast, new martial, or Red Moon, none of them are qualified to control the world! That's it, I'll be leaving first, I'll wait for your good news!"In an instant, as if he felt a breeze, the Grand desolate King knew that Li Hao had left.After a while, he stood up. Outside the tent, a wild beast poked its head in, took a look, and said in a cold tone,""Don't walk around ..."The great desolate King's tone was calm."It's just that my qi and blood aren't flowing smoothly. I'm just walking around, and you're all watching me. What are you worried about?" Furthermore, this King will still say the same thing. Be careful of the red dust World. That person can not work too closely with you. The other party will definitely think of a way to plant experts into the great wilderness ... Once there are more than three saints, it might be a huge crisis! I hope that the Lords will pass on these words to the supremacies! In addition, I'll have to ask my Lord to tell supremacy that the great wilderness 'invasion is too slow. If this continues, it might be a sign of danger. Among the humans of the great wilderness, the aura of chaos in my body is the strongest, and the aura of chaos in my subordinates is the strongest ...""Now that things have come to this, please allow us to participate in the war. The chaos will spread and speed up the annexation of the eastern continent. Otherwise, when will we be able to invade the eastern continent if this continues?" The moment these words came out, the desolate beast was a little stunned. This person was unwilling to go to war before, but now he was willing?If he was willing, that would naturally be the best.He was afraid that ... This guy would run away! The great desolation King replied calmly,"my Lord, there's no need to worry ... The great desolation is my home. I am the master of the great desolation. At this point, we have already started a war with heavenstar. What other path of retreat do we have?""I'll pass on the message to the venerable ..."The dire beast did not say anything else. Perhaps if these people joined the battle, they could indeed speed up the pace of their expansion. But now ... It was indeed too slow.  Best novel online free at ռօʋɛʟɮɨռ  The great desolate King nodded slightly and sat down once again.In his heart, there were thousands of thoughts.Li Hao ... This King will take a gamble!On the side of the mortal world, on the side of the wild beasts, there are many saints. Can you ... Really stop or defeat them?Li Hao quickly noticed the abnormality of the White Horse's situation. This person's eyes were extremely sharp.All kinds of thoughts emerged in his mind, and he suddenly felt a little nervous and excited.Desolate beasts were no match for them, and neo martial artists were no match for them ... These were his inherent thoughts. But now, he was colluding with Li Hao to scheme against these experts. Was it really ... Possible?At this moment, the master of the great wilderness seemed to have returned to the time when he had unified the great wilderness. He was excited, nervous, uneasy ... And a little fearful.……At this moment, Li Hao had already left the wasteland.A moment later, Qian Wuliang showed up, sweating and shivering. Seeing Li Hao, he felt much better. Just now ... He was almost surrounded by the two saints. Fortunately, Li Hao gave him a timely order to retreat.Days like this ... Were really exciting!

2098 Chapter 355
"Prepare to evacuate people from Eastern continent ...""Tell Lin Hongyu to organize the evacuation," Li Hao suddenly said."Lord Marquis!"Everyone was shocked.There were many provinces and a large population of over 2 billion people in the eastern continent, which was no less than that in the central continent. Such a large-scale evacuation ... Was too costly!This ... The key was that they couldn't settle down in a short time.Director Zhao frowned and said in a low voice,""Lord Marquis, if we evacuate the people right now, they'll definitely panic ... Moreover, there are so many people here, and it's not a small number. There's really no way to settle them down, and we don't have enough manpower to organize an evacuation. It's not a million or ten million people ... With transcendent power, it's easy to evacuate ten million people. ""But it's the eastern continent ... With billions of people!"Li Hao, these words made it impossible for everyone to remain calm.There were too many people!"Then evacuate the eastern population of Dingbian province, which is about half of the eastern continent ..." Li Hao said after some thought."That's impossible. "Zhao Shuguang shook his head again."There are still ten provinces and a population of nearly one billion ... Lord Marquis, just the mobilization and relocation alone are huge projects. Even in the era of superhumans, a year's preparation is not considered a lot."A population of one billion, what kind of concept was that?Even if they used warships to transport 50000 people at an extremely fast speed, they would still need to transport 20000 people and 40000 round trips. This would be the most perfect state. In reality, they might need to transport 30000 or more people.No matter how fast the battleship was, it would take at least dozens of minutes for a person to board and disembark the battleship, transport them to different places, and even bring their belongings.Going back and forth twice an hour was already considered fast.A warship could only transport 50 times a day, and they had to do it without rest.Now that they had taken down boundless city and heaven battling city, there were more battleships, dozens of them. In a day, they could only attack two or three thousand times.It would still take 10 days and 10 nights to transport it!Not to mention, the battleships consumed energy. Dozens of battleships working without rest for ten days would burn an astronomical amount of energy.And this was under the condition that everything was going smoothly!If Li Hao had said so earlier, he might have had time. However ... If he had said so earlier, heavenstar and the great wilderness would not have even started a war. If he had evacuated the population and abandoned the eastern continent, then the problem would have been even greater.At this moment, Li Hao was also lost in thought.It was very troublesome!However, if they didn't retreat, the great wilderness would spread, and half of the eastern continent would enter the primal Chaos region. Ordinary people wouldn't be able to hold on and would be covered by the primal Chaos aura, resulting in death. Be more ruthless and just ignore it. There are many people anyway.If they won this battle, not only would they have killed one Saint, the catastrophe of the great wilderness would be resolved. The side of the mortal world would also suffer heavy losses, and there would also be hope of killing Yu Hai.Moreover, not everyone would die. Now that everyone was cultivating martial arts, time was fast enough, so only a few million people would die.However, 18 million ... That didn't sound like much. Heavenstar had too many people, and that was just the population of a large city. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 However ... Li Hao looked at the dense Army of a million soldiers in front of him. At least ten times more would die!He immediately frowned.He had actually considered this before, but he had thought that the enemy might not be able to cover the entire area. Moreover, Li Hao had not planned to use the enemy's power to deal with Yu Hai.At this point, as long as Li Hao didn't interfere, everything would go smoothly.However, it didn't matter ... The consumption would be an astronomical figure, and time would be delayed.At this moment, Li Hao suddenly said,""The presence of chaos won't destroy buildings. If there are enough battleships, one fortress can hold 50000 people, and one billion people can be evacuated ... Forget it, that's too many! What if he rode the ancient city here? "An ancient city can hold 50 million people. This is the permanent population. If we squeeze a little, it won't be a problem to fill up two or three times the population ...""Lord Marquis, are you really going to evacuate the people?"Director Zhao's head was about to explode. Li Hao pondered for a while and said,""If we retreat, the other party will believe that we are retreating. Of course, it is also to protect their lives. If we don't retreat, maybe not many people will die. But if we don't lose too many people, one billion people, at least a million, right?""Well...Just pretend that we didn't realize it...Eastern continent doesn't have too much influence on us ..."Someone said, and Li Hao turned around.This time, it was not Qian Wuliang!Li Hao wasn't surprised by Qian Wuliang's words, but it was the northern fist!Nan Quan had died in battle, Yao si had died in battle to save him, and Bei Quan, this little old man, had recently become much more shady.However, the northern fist's punches had always been Grand and majestic."Today, this magnificent boxer told me...To pretend that he didn't know anything about it. No matter what, the eastern continent is not closely related to us."The main reason was that there were too many people!It was too troublesome to evacuate. Not only would it take a long time, but it was also very easy for problems to arise. The energy consumption might be an astronomical figure. It could even consume all the energy of the ore vein in one go.Li Hao fell into deep thought.If they didn't retreat, they could only stop the great wilderness 'invasion. There were at least six Sage path wild beasts in the great wilderness, while Hong Chen's side had at least two or three sages, a total of eight or nine sages. It was more than that.He didn't have enough Saints on his side.Eliminating one party before eliminating the other was too risky and might even lead to drastic changes.

2099 Chapter 355
Looking at the big picture ... Using a few ordinary people to exchange for many saints was an extremely good deal.Not all of them would die!However, with the invasion of the great wilderness, once the desolate beasts began to slaughter the people in the area invaded by chaos, it would no longer be a matter of tens of millions of people. Perhaps ... They would all be massacred. Once these experts made a move, a city would be destroyed in no time.In fact, it would not affect the overall situation if they all died.They were all weak.As long as they won in the end, with the speed of Human Reproduction, these people who died in battle would soon be replenished. no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  Li Hao looked at the sky, deep in thought.After a long time, he said,"take it one step at a time. There's no rush. The battleship is too small. Use the ancient city. Endless city!" Boundless city is full ... Enough to accommodate hundreds of millions of people ... Don't bring anything else, just bring food and drinks ... At most, 10 days will be enough ...""Lord Marquis!""This ... Is too ... Too troublesome. Besides, it's not that easy to gather people.""Yup!"Many people spoke up. This time, they all felt that the lineup was too big.Moreover, even if boundless city could really accommodate one or two hundred million people, what about the rest?How could there be so many ancient cities to hold people?Director Zhao had no choice but to say,"how about this? Lord Marquis, we can use boundless city. We can move some of the old and weak, women and children, and cultivators. The chaos aura will invade them. They won't die.""What if it's a desolate beast massacre?" Li Hao turned to look at him."This ..."Director Zhao was helpless. Actually, he wanted to say that if that really happened ... Then they would be unlucky.What could he do?It was better than moving a billion people.Since the creation of the world, there had never been such a large-scale migration in the Silvermoon world. No matter how long it took, once the population exceeded one billion, it would be a disaster.Li Hao only dared to say so in the transcendent world.If he had said this in the normal world, people would have thought he was crazy.During the migration, more than half of them might die.At this moment, director Wang sighed,""It's a pity ... If the heavenly dog Emperor was here, he could swallow the entire Eastern continent and store it in his stomach. However ... If there really is such a powerful being here, there would be no need to migrate. "This was a paradox.They were so powerful that they could swallow the entire continent in one gulp. Why would they need to move?At this time, everyone was very helpless and conflicted. Many people looked at Qian Wuliang ..."Go!" They didn't have deep feelings or no feelings for the people on the eastern continent. Now that the plan had come to this step ... They had a great chance. After one battle, they might be able to completely reverse the situation.At this moment, Li Hao was going to migrate people, which was too troublesome.Qian Wuliang didn't say anything.Goodbye!I won't say that!Moreover ... He thought for a moment and said,"migration is actually a good thing. On one hand, we can confuse the enemy and make them feel that we are indeed unable to fight against them and are being devoured by them step by step!" Second, it also tests the governing ability and organizational ability of the others. There might be a time for migration in the future. ""Today, we are only dealing with the great wilderness. In the future, if the traitors come out from the North or the venerable sovereign unseals his seal ... Perhaps, we will need to migrate the entire northern people ... This can also be considered a rehearsal, a rehearsal!"Everyone glared at this guy.Qian Wuliang didn't care and continued,"besides, moving people and protecting the common people is also a way to win over the People's hearts for the terrified people of the eastern continent ... And to make a name for themselves!" He would also let the eastern continent and the other four continents witness heavenstar's power! To be able to migrate one billion people, since ancient times, only I, heavenstar, have separated the heavens and earth!""Of course, there's also a lot of trouble!"Qian Wuliang thought for a while and said,"the boundless city can only accommodate a limited population. Where should we place the rest of the people?" "Even if it's only for 10 days, with so many people, it's too easy for chaos to occur ..."Li Hao pondered for a moment and said,"a new continent is being built in shuiyun. They're preparing to move the population of shuiyun. It's still empty at the moment, but the continent is still being developed. What do you think about gathering the people here first?"Qian Wuliang nodded."I can ... But there are still too many. I can't put them down.""With so many people, it'll be a huge problem no matter where we put them."Li Hao also nodded and looked back.Cities stood there.If the great wilderness was allowed to spread ... It might be a long time before the land would be covered in corpses.In the past, he wouldn't have considered such things.He might not have thought that it would be too late when it happened.But ... This was the light that his teacher and the others had fought for.Regardless, he couldn 't.No matter what, he could get over this, but ... He was letting down the light that his teacher and the others had exchanged their lives for.He did not expect that he would encounter trouble on this matter even though he had finished all the preparations.At this moment, director Wang spoke. He looked at Li Hao and gritted his teeth."If Lord Marquis insists ... I have an idea.""Speak," he said."Don't move them bit by bit, it's too troublesome. Move the entire city! It directly placed the city above the four Seas! In truth, when the Silver Moon first appeared, the four Seas didn't exist. It was only later that the four Seas were created. If Lord Marquis doesn't find it troublesome ... You can fill up the four Seas, and in the future, you can make preparations to merge the various continents!""What?"Li Hao was stunned. Director Wang said again,""Lord Marquis, the might of a Saint! If it was in the past, a Saint could easily teleport a large city! Of course, the Saints of today were not as powerful as they had been in the past. The Saints of today were only comparable to undying ... But as long as there were more people ... It was actually the same! We'll carry the cities and leave ..."
