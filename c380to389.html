        Deathly silence!
        The two people in the arena were only over a hundred, the same level as Yueming.
        At this moment, all the Dark Moon cultivators fell silent. Some of the sunlit cultivators looked at the arena with grave expressions. At this moment, they no longer had the intention to underestimate the battle.
        This was breaking a hundred?
        This was a Martial Master?
        ……
        "Idiot!"
        Hong Yitang cursed in a low voice. Of the two martial masters, one had even grasped force, and the other, even if he hadn 't, wasn't that far off. It was equivalent to two martial masters who had grasped force striking out with all their might, shattering each other's weapons.
        With this attack, even if someone in the early stage of the sun glory realm was present, they might be killed on the spot by the two.
         There was actually Yue Ming who wanted to pick him up!
        If he didn't die, who would?
        The supers of small organizations were just ignorant. Did they think that they could look down on martial masters just because they had become supers?
        Just now, Yuan Shuo and the others had attacked and killed people. They had yet to learn their lesson.
        ……
        In the next moment, everyone's attention was once again focused on the arena.
        The long sword shattered and the long staff broke.
        At this moment, the two of them were also covered in wounds from the impact of each other's inner strength.
        Sun moxian panted heavily, his breathing clearly audible. He threw a punch at Li Hao with his right fist. The force of the earth gathered on his fist. Hong long long, one punch after another, Li Hao was sent flying.
        Li Hao, who had used the ninth refinement force, didn't have time to use the five birds technique. He could only take it head-on. As the two of them clashed, even though Li Hao's five internal organs were strong, he was still hit by the continuous attacks. He kept retreating and blood began to flow from the corner of his mouth.
        This was a Martial Master!
        The bloody and violent punches.
        Sun moxiian was like a tireless madman. He began to rotate his fists. He wanted to suppress Li Hao until he beat him to death!
        The collision of fists, elbows, and even the continuous kicking of both feet had long torn his pants apart, revealing his bloody legs.
        Sun moxiian had suppressed Li Hao, but he had also suffered considerable damage. His five internal organs were not strong enough, and he was unable to withstand the backlash. His internal organs seemed to have ruptured and were bleeding.
        However, he didn't give up, didn't retreat, and didn't throw a punch.
        Take his life while he's down!
        Li Hao's strength was beyond his expectations, but it was also the source of his excitement. His goal was to kill Li Hao!
        Killing Li Hao and interfering with Yuan Shuo might be of some help to the upcoming battle.
        And Li Hao actually had the same thoughts.
        In the Silver Moon martial arts competition, the disciples would go first. If one side could kill the other side's disciple, it would boost the other side's momentum and make the enemy's momentum stronger. Many experts who were on par with each other would always win the disciple battle.
        Killing the opponent's disciple first was often the secret to victory.
        Yuan Shuo didn't mention this, but Liu Long did.
        He was suppressed and attacked!
        Li Hao's eyes, however, were clear.
        His teacher had said that all battles, all moves, were prepared for the final move, to lay the foundation for killing the enemy.
         Therefore, the process was just a process.  Just as his opponent was about to punch again, Li Hao roared and spat out a mouthful of white mist that was like a sword ray!
        Sun moxian subconsciously threw a punch, directly shattering the sword light into pieces.
        And this was not Li Hao's trump card.
        At this moment, he raised his right hand and grinned, revealing the blood in his mouth.
        The ninth refinement force erupted again!
        Stacking layers of inner strength on his right hand, Li Hao recalled that sword attack again. His inner strength transformed into a sword, and his palm split open, with sword Qi vaguely bursting out.
        In the distance, sun Yifei's expression changed.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "I ..."
        He wanted to admit defeat. He felt something different.
        A sword intent!
        He even wanted to personally go out and stop Li Hao ... He moved his feet and wanted to make a move, but in the distance, Yuan Shuo didn't move, as if he had no intention of stopping Li Hao.
        Sun Yifei's steps stopped ... A pained expression appeared on his face.
        His disciple ... Did not admit defeat!
        Yuan Shuo frowned slightly and glanced at him. Very quickly, he did not bother about him anymore.
        Sun Yifei was a good Martial Master and a good teacher ... But he might not be a good master!
        Because he didn't make a move ... Because he hesitated!
        Because of ... The rules!
        The rules of the martial arts world!
        At this moment, sun Yifei looked at his disciple with hope in his eyes. Admit defeat ... As long as you admit defeat ... I won't let you die!
        ……
        At this moment, sun moxian also felt a sense of danger.
        It was very dangerous!
        He seemed to have sensed a sword intent, an exceptionally sharp sword intent, coming from Li Hao's hand.
        Li Hao seemed to be a little hesitant ...
        That's right, Li Hao was also waiting for this moment, waiting for him to admit defeat. Even though he wanted to beat sun moxian to death and shake sun Yifei's heart, when he saw sun moxian's unfamiliar face, he suddenly wavered a little.
         Give him a chance to admit defeat ... Admitting defeat is the same.
        However, sun moxian did not admit defeat.
        Her master had lost once and couldn't calm down for decades. Back then, he had jumped off the bridge!
        "If I admit defeat, perhaps master will be pleased, and I will live on ... But if I lose, perhaps it will be a greater blow than death. If I die, master may become stronger. A heart of grief and indignation may allow master to have more explosive power!
        "Moreover, I've lost to a newbie in the gathering momentum stage ... I still have some motivation to break through the demonic barrier and enter the universe of fighters?
        At this moment, sun moxian revealed a smile.
        The stubbornness of a Martial Master was not something that outsiders could understand.
        In the next moment, an inner strength cudgel appeared above his fists!
        "Stick to the eyebrows!"
        With a furious roar, the cudgel was mixed with the Earth's momentum. It was as if the cudgel had substance. When the cudgel struck down, the explosion resounded in all directions as if the sky was collapsing and the earth was cracking!
       
        Maybe I'll die ... But I haven't lost!
        Master had said that until the last moment, who would know who the real winner was?
        This strike was extremely powerful. It went straight for Li Hao's forehead, intending to kill him with one strike. No matter how strong your sword was, it still depended on who was faster and who could withstand danger better!
        In the distance, sun Yifei was excited!
        His disciple had not admitted defeat, nor had he waited for death ... He was stronger than him!
        Back then, it was also the same scene. He had lost to Yuan Shuo, and his choice was ... To jump off the heavenly bridge, unwilling to die in Yuan Shuo's hands. His disciple was even stronger than him!
        Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, was frowning in worry.
        He did not expect that sun moxian would be able to burst out at this moment and merge his power with his inner strength. This was a sign that he was about to step into the thousand warrior tier.
        The other party had almost stepped into the thousand warrior tier at this critical moment.
        This was something that even sun Yifei couldn't do.
         As for his student ... Could he block this staff?
        Life and death were decided in this instant. Victory and defeat were decided in this instant.
        Yuan Shuo was worried, so he wanted to make a move!
        He was a teacher and also a master. He was both a teacher and a father. A teacher could follow the rules and let his disciples die because of the rules ... But a father couldn 't.
        Even if this attack would make him unable to face sun Yifei in the future, so what?
        Just as he was about to attack, Li Hao roared!
        Using his hand as a sword!
        He slashed out with his sword!
        The staff and the sword caused the air to explode and the surrounding sand and stones to explode. Some of the supers in the distance were also looking serious!
        "Killing of two forces!"
        Li Hao seemed to have comprehended sword force.
        These were two powerhouses who were about to step into the thousand warrior tier, and not the newbies in their eyes. Even the sun glory and three sun powerhouses were focused on them at this moment. They were a little nervous as they watched without blinking.
        BOOM!
        An earth-shattering sound rang out as the sword Qi instantly broke the long staff. Sun moxiian's eyes revealed a hint of confusion.
        How was that possible?
        It was impossible!
        He felt that the staff strike just now was the most powerful one in his life. It was so powerful that he even felt that it was comparable to a thousand-man fighting club.
        But ... It was still cut in half by a sword!
        A bloody gash appeared on his forehead.
        Sun moxian wasn't unwilling. He was just a little puzzled and puzzled. He opened his mouth.
        Li Hao didn't hear any sound, but he still panted and replied,""It's not a sword of the human world!"
        This sword was not a sword of the human world!
        "Thus, you lost to me not because of strength or momentum, but because the world we saw was different. I saw that sword, but you didn 't.
        Sun moxian seemed to have understood something.
         After a long time, he slowly fell down.  He fell to the ground with a bang.
        A trail of blood extended from his head to his lower body.
        Li Hao looked on in silence. At this moment, he was neither excited nor excited.
        This was the Wulin!
        They had no grudges against each other, but because their Masters were enemies, they fought so that their Masters would have the upper hand in the upcoming battle.
        "Mo Xian!"
        "Senior brother!"
        A painful cry came from the side of the field.
        Sun Yifei instantly reappeared. He looked at his disciple who fell to the ground with a pained expression.
        He ... Seemed to be wrong.
        He should have stopped her!
        He looked at Li Hao with killing intent in his eyes, but he quickly suppressed it. The next moment, he looked at Yuan Shuo and gritted his teeth. "I'll kill you!"
        Definitely!
        "I'll be waiting for you!"Yuan Shuo said coldly with a grave expression.
        His student had won!
        This time, after beating his opponent, sun Yifei didn't collapse. Instead, he became even stronger.
        But ... So what?
        Li Hao frowned slightly but didn't say anything.
        Sun Yifei ... Didn't go berserk.
        He looked at sun moxiian, who was on the ground, and did not say anything. He cupped his fists and retreated from the center of the circle with great difficulty.
        It was fine as long as he won!
        His teacher ... Would also win!
        Behind him, a shrill cry of pain sounded.
         Sun Hongxiu hugged the bloodied corpse. Her voice was hoarse as she shouted angrily,""Li Hao! I will kill you, I will!"
        Li Hao didn't turn around.
        A Martial Master should be like this.
        If they couldn't kill them today, they would have to wait for the enemy's revenge tomorrow. Year after year, again and again, until they died in a battle. This was the fate and reincarnation of a Martial Master.
        Today, even if his teacher won, he probably would not kill sun Hongxiu ... Because of the rules!
        Was he pedantic?
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com A little.
        However, Li Hao knew that his teacher was already one of the more unruly martial masters. Compared to him, sun Yifei and the others were more pedantic.
        However, this wasn't a bad thing at times. A Martial Master, if a little more pedantic, might be more worthy of nostalgia.
        Li Hao's mind was filled with endless thoughts. He walked out of the circle and fell to the ground. At this moment, he felt pain all over his body.
       
        He had won.
        In the first battle, everyone had seen the magnificence of the martial artists. It was a good fight, and they felt that the Martial Master was indeed not weak.
        By the second Battle ... No one was in the mood to praise him.
        Only cruelty!
        At this moment, they finally understood what the pugilistic world was and what the martial arts world was!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The Silver Moon martial forest more than twenty years ago was like this.
        People died every day, and people were killed on the way or on the way to revenge.
        Fight for what?
        Fighting for fame and fortune, or rather ... The essence of a Martial Master was to kill.
        The moment martial masters were born, they existed for the sake of killing.
         The power to surpass mortals and explore the limits of the body.
        He would make his own name and surpass his predecessors.
        All of this was the Dao of a Martial Master.
        "Why ... Must you kill one person?"
        This was the thought of some supers. Even though supers were cruel, they were often fighting for benefits and treasures. The martial masters in front of them were fighting for the enmity from decades ago, which had even spread to the next generation.
        At the last moment, someone was shocked.
        Some people looked at Li Hao in disbelief.
        Even Hao lianchuan could not believe it.
        This is Li Hao?
        The little guy who had been in contact with martial arts for a few years?
        He had actually killed a Martial Master who had broken through the 100th level in the competition, and his opponent had even touched the level of a thousand-man warrior.
        He was thinking, what if the person who just went into battle was a super?
        Did the early stage of the sunlit realm kill Li Hao, or was he killed by Li Hao?
        The strength of a Martial Master would be fully displayed the moment they comprehended Shi.
        It was a spiritual suppression!
        If a Martial Master were to step into the universe of warrior energy, no other superpower of the same level would be a match for him. A simple force suppression would weaken 90% of the superpowers.
        Unless they had special abilities, they were all assault-type superpowers and were almost no match for martial masters of the same rank.
        One battle to become famous!
        After this battle, Li Hao's reputation as the inheritor of the five birds would probably resound throughout Silver Moon.
        It had been many years since the Silver Moon martial forest had such a young expert.
        In front.
        Liu Long and the others quickly stepped forward and helped Li Hao up. Seeing that he was covered in blood, Liu Long frowned slightly. Without saying anything, he helped Li Hao out of the circle.
        The atmosphere here ... Was too depressing!
        It was so depressing that even he, a thousand-man warrior, wanted to leave.
        At this moment, everyone in the surrounding area felt a sense of oppression.
        Sun Yifei was like a volcano that was about to erupt.
        At this moment, he handed sun moxian's corpse to sun Hongxiu, his lips trembling slightly.
        "Let's go!"
        Take your senior brother's corpse and go back!
         Back to the central region!  The moment Li Hao killed sun moxian, sun Yifei knew that he might not be able to leave today.
        If Yuan Shuo's disciple had improved so much in just a few years, what about Yuan Shuo?
        He could choose to avoid the battle.
        But ... Was that possible?
        He was the Qi Mei staff King!
        His disciple had already lost his life on the path of revenge for him. How could he leave?
        Could they not fight?
        No, you can 't!
        "Master!"
        The two disciples who had survived cried as they hugged sun moxian's corpse. Their tears could not stop flowing.
        They were still too young.
        If sun moxian was still alive, he might have understood his master's heart, and he would have been able to understand.
        As for sun Hongxiu and her husband, they were too young and had not experienced much. They could not understand.
        Sun Yifei looked at sun Hongxiu and patted her shoulder. He kept staring at her.
        Sun moxian is dead. Now, the inheritance of the eyebrows-abrest stick is in your hands.
        He still had other disciples, but the ones he brought this time were naturally the most talented, the smartest, and the most worthy of training. Even that tenth severing realm was also worth training.
        He didn't wish for these people to die Here and end his inheritance of the eyebrows-abrest stick.
        Sun Hongxiu and the young man both shed tears, but they quickly wiped them away. Sun Hongxiu knelt down and kowtowed.
        After a while, sun Hongxiu was about to leave with the corpse on her back ...
        In the distance, Yuan Shuo suddenly whispered,"sun Yifei, sun moxian, why don't you bury him in Silver Moon?" If he had no family, he would stay in Silver Moon! The Silver Moon martial arts world is the home of martial masters ... It's better to be buried here than to die in battle!"
        Silver Moon martial forest!
        Sun Yifei looked at him for a while, and a smile appeared on his face. Then, he raised his long staff into the sky, and instantly, a huge hole was created on the ground.
        "He doesn't have a family, but I am his family!"
        "That's good too ..." Sun Yifei laughed."Yuan Shuo, what you said makes sense. If you die, I'll use your head as a sacrifice to my disciple!"
        "If you die ... I'll bury you both together!" Yuan Shuo said calmly.
        "Alright!"
        Sun Yifei said with a smile.
        He took a step forward and took sun moxian's body. Under the reluctant eyes of sun Hongxiu and the other woman, he carried sun moxian's body and buried it in the big pit.
         Returning to the central continent ... Without a family, without a master, it was too lonely.
        Why don't you just stay here!
        This place was his master's hometown.
        Be it sun moxian or sun Hongxiu, they were all orphans of war, so their surname was sun.
        The long staff reached the heavens!
        In an instant, countless gravel rolled. In the blink of an eye, the deep pit was buried by gravel, leaving behind a grave.
        Sun Yifei took back his long stick.
        He looked at sun Hongxiu again. When sun Hongxiu and her master looked at them, they hesitated for a moment. Sun Hongxiu turned around and left, pulling her Little Junior Brother and galloping away, leaving this sad place.
        This was a Martial Master!
        Leaving behind the inheritance and waiting for revenge. Sun Yifei never said that he didn't want revenge.
       
        The inheritance of the eyebrow-raising stick was still there, so he would continue to take revenge!
        Until one day, the eyebrows-abrest stick completely disappeared in the martial arts world.
        Otherwise, the eyebrows-abrest stick would definitely come to the Silver Moon to fight the five birds sect again!
        Yuan Shuo, Li Hao, and all the martial masters knew this.
        No one stopped him!
        Martial masters were often like this. They were a group of fierce and brutal guys, but they also seemed to be hypocritical and kind. In a martial arts competition, it was very rare for a family to be exterminated. Even though they knew the benefits of eliminating the roots, very few people would really do it.
        They knew that someone would come for revenge, so they would wait for them to come for revenge. They wouldn't even go to their door before they achieved great success in martial arts.
        They were old and took in disciples one by one. They took in their last disciples to guard the door and wait for their enemies to come and take revenge. They would not go to their enemies 'place and kill them when they still had the strength to fight.
        All of this was because of the rules!
        No one had made such a rule, it was just a rule passed down from generation to generation.
         Yuan Shuo had killed so many people, but most of them were those who had fought with him. As for their disciples, Yuan Shuo rarely attacked them unless they took the initiative to attack.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Therefore, Yuan Shuo actually had many enemies.
        An enemy that could not be killed!
        Until one day, when these people felt that they could no longer take revenge, or when they naturally disappeared from the martial arts world, these grudges would then disappear.
        ……
        Sun Hongxiu and the rest left.
        No one stopped him.
        No one even dared to move.
        At this moment, sun Yifei's fierce eyes scanned around.
        He stared at everyone but Yuan Shuo.
        He was waiting for his disciple to walk further away, or even leave Silver Moon.
        He knew that Yuan Shuo would continue to wait.
        In the distance, whoever he had his eyes on, whether it was the sun glory or the three suns, all felt a chill from the bottom of their hearts. Their eyes ... Were brutal, crazy, and murderous.
        This continued for half an hour.
        And everyone present was suffering as they waited with him for half an hour.
        At this moment, whether it was the three big organizations or the night patrolmen, they all had a tacit understanding. No one wanted to anger sun Yifei, who was a top-tier master at the late stage of the three suns realm.
        As for his two disciples, no one cared too much about their strength, regardless of whether they had a grudge or not.
        Half an hour later, sun Yifei suddenly jumped up into the air. In an instant, he was already more than a hundred meters high. In the blink of an eye, he landed on a broken bridge.
        This was the bridge that he had used to defeat his opponent!
        Below him, Yuan Shuo stomped the ground and shot out like a rocket. In the blink of an eye, he was in the sky and landed on the other side like a bird.
        Jianghu matters were settled.
        Below, everyone's expression changed slightly.
        An ordinary sunlight could easily fly a hundred meters in the air, but the two of them lifted the weight as if it were light. They used the means of martial masters, which was extraordinary.  ……
        Li Hao was very weak at the moment.
        He raised his head to look at the sky.
        A moment later, he suddenly frowned and looked at a spaceship that was blocking his vision. It was the people from Light Island.
        These guys, the Flying Ship is not far from the bridge.
        It wasn't beside the bridge, but about a hundred meters away. It was floating in the air with many people on it.
        Yuan Shuo and the other man faced each other in the air. A battle between martial masters was usually limited to a small area. Even if the two of them expanded the area, they would most likely land on the ground and fight. Therefore, Light Island had not moved and remained there.
        It was also the best place to watch the battle. It had the best view and could see the battle the clearest.
        Li Hao frowned. Beside him, Liu Long also raised his head and glanced at him, his eyes revealing a touch of coldness.
        This was courting death!
        A battle between martial masters did not have a large area of effect. Even if one had superpowers, the area of effect would be limited to a single area. It would not expand indefinitely. Furthermore, the opponent was still in the air. It would be difficult to expand the area to that side unless the two of them were fighting in the air.
        However, be it martial masters or superpowers, as long as they weren't of the flying element, they would almost never fight in the air.
        The earth was their home.
        However, Yuan Shuo and sun Yifei were not ordinary people.
        After a while, Li Hao said softly,"don't worry about it. Some people always feel that they're special and out of the ordinary. The radiant path seems to have been established by a God-tier master blessed by the heavens, right?"
        On the side, Wang Ming nodded.
        The island of light was different from the swords gate. The swords gate was established by Hong Yitang, but the path of light was established by a very talented god tier master. That person entered the glorious sun early on, and not long after, he successfully entered the three suns realm, becoming one of the few forces in Silver Moon that had three suns.
        As for martial masters, Li Hao's battle just now was indeed exciting.
        However, that was only comparable to the early stage of the radiant sun realm, which was too far away from the three suns.
        Some people just had an iron head.
        Moreover, the island master of light Island had always thought that he had extraordinary strength. If he were to suddenly teleport the spaceship, wouldn't he appear to be inferior to others?
        Li Hao knew very well that this area ... Was too small.
         They didn't understand the force of a Martial Master at all!
        Once his teacher's Shi was fully unleashed, what was a hundred meters worth?
        Perhaps the three suns would be fine, but anyone below the three suns, even if they were a sunlit cultivator, would be killed or injured by the impact of the powerful momentum.
        This was purely his own doing.
        He didn't look at them anymore, but looked at his teacher and sun Yifei in the sky. He hoped that sun Yifei would be affected by sun moxiian's death, otherwise, the battle with sun moxiian would be meaningless.
        ……
        In the air.
        On both sides of the broken bridge, the bridge was broken in the middle.
        One person on each side.
        Sun Yifei's eyes were still brutal, but he seemed to have regained some calmness. He looked at Yuan Shuo for a long time before saying, "You've harmed Silver Moon martial forest!"
       
        Yuan Shuo laughed."I guess so. You've learned how to use righteousness to suppress me?"
        Did it count?
        Maybe!
        He hadn't been able to enter the warrior dimension, or rather, he hadn't been able to enter the warrior Dimension 20 years ago. The decline of Silver Moon martial forest had a lot to do with him. If he had been able to enter the warrior dimension back then, there wouldn't have been so many people who had broken through to the 100th level dying. The remaining people who had broken through to the 100th level might have all broken through to the warrior dimension.
        These were martial masters, a very mysterious group of people.
        If Yuan Shuo, who was suppressing Silver Moon, did not break through, everyone would be stuck there.
        However, if Yuan Shuo were to break through, the thousand Warrior Seal would spring up like bamboo shoots after the rain. This was not a matter of one era, but many. Someone had decided the upper limit of the martial arts world!
        When this upper limit was broken, many people would take advantage of the situation and break through one after another to find the next upper limit.
        If the upper limit could not be broken, unless someone killed the guy who created the upper limit ... Otherwise, that era would have that person as the upper limit.
        It was an extremely wonderful state.
         "I'm not pressing on you!"
        Sun Yifei was very calm,"I just feel hatred and regret!" Because of your upper limit, we can't appreciate the beauty of the battle of thousands and can't go further ... I only hate that we couldn't defeat you and pull you down from the throne!"
        "This is my first hatred. My second hatred is that I've become a super and can't use my Martial master's power to fight you!"
        "The third hatred is that I'm not as good as my disciple. Maybe I should have fought to the death back then. Jumping off a cliff ... This is the shame of my life!"
        "Yes!" Yuan Shuo looked at him and nodded."This time, you can fight to the end!"
        "Yuan Shuo, I hope you ... Won't disappoint me!"
        As soon as he finished speaking, a long staff rose up and pointed at Yuan Shuo with one hand,""Come and fight!"
        BOOM!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Before he could even use his move, the monstrous flames burned the heavens and destroyed the earth.
        Fire element!
        Fire was good at attacking.
        Many offensive supers were fire-type, and fire-type also represented popularity.
        As the flames rose, Hao lianchuan's expression changed slightly.
        He was also a fire element superhuman with three suns.
        However, when sun Yifei's flame appeared, he suddenly felt that there was a huge difference between his fire energy and his opponent's ... They were both three yang, but there was such a huge difference, which he couldn't understand.
        Of course, if he were to use it with the fiery phoenix spear, he would be able to display a similar level of power.
        However, although sun Yifei's eyebrows-abrest stick was also made of top-tier materials, it was far from the level of the fire Phoenix spear.
        Opposite him, Yuan Shuo narrowed his eyes.
        The towering flames gathered on the long staff, making it look like a fire Dragon. It was extremely powerful.
        Obviously, sun Yifei's attitude was clear.
        He was going to use the Martial master's methods to defeat and kill Yuan Shuo.
        He was only using the fire superpower as his inner strength.
        At this moment, Yuan Shuo's expression changed. The temperature of the flames was too high for a human body to withstand. At this moment, Yuan Shuo seemed to have transformed into a flaming ape, a monkey, and was reflected in everyone's hearts.
        First, it was the heart fire ape's possession.
        Sun Yifei's eyes instantly lit up!
        At this moment, he seemed to have seen something. He looked at Yuan Shuo with unconcealed joy and revelry of meeting a worthy opponent!  The others might not be able to understand it, but he could.
        Further down, Hong Yitang frowned slightly. He could vaguely understand it, but he still didn't quite understand.
        The ape force of the five birds force!
        However, it was different from what he had seen in the past. That feeling ... Made him feel that his three yang was just so-so at this moment.
        At this moment, Hong Yue, Yama, Fei Tian and the others were all in a slight commotion.
        Without waiting for them to guess ...
        In an instant, everyone saw a shocking scene.
        In midair, a fire ape took the lead to attack. With one hand holding up the sky, it slapped down, and the void seemed to explode!
        The ape art of the five birds Art.
        "Come and fight!"
        Sun Yifei was also overjoyed. He struck out with his staff, and in the blink of an eye, the long staff and the giant palm collided and exploded, sending flames everywhere.
        The two of them instantly shifted positions, rose into the air, and crossed each other.
        Boom! Boom! Boom!
        If Li Hao and sun moxian's confrontation was considered ordinary, then these two really had the means of a demigod. As they fought, the entire sky was reflected red.
        A late-stage three sun realm Martial Master fighting against a spirit accumulation realm Martial Master.
        Yuan Shuo was no longer as calm as he usually was. Like a mad old ape, his eyes were burning with fire as he swung his fists and broke the sky with his long arms.
        With a punch, he grabbed the long staff with one hand, and the long staff burst into flames.
        As soon as the two of them exchanged blows, the flames scattered in all directions.
        Boom! Boom! Boom!
        It was so fast that Li Hao's group couldn't even keep up with it.
        The battle at this level far surpassed their own.
        Other than some of the three suns, they could still see a little more clearly. Even sunlight couldn't clearly see how the two were fighting. He could only see that the heart fire ape was extremely violent, punching out one punch after another. Sometimes, it would punch out dozens of times, but in the eyes of others, it was only one punch.
        As for the eyebrow-length staff, it was rolling up and down, full of beauty.
        At this moment, the two of them suddenly changed their direction. They stepped on the air and quickly left their original place.
        A hundred meters?
         To them, what was a hundred meters?
        It was only the distance of one step!
        ……
        In the air.
        There were close to a hundred people on the spaceship that Light Island was on.
        There were many people, but there were also many Starlight Masters. These people would not enter the remains.
        At this moment, they were also mesmerized by the scene.
        On the spaceship, a young god tier master frowned.
        The other party ... Seemed to be approaching.
        He had originally fixed the Flying Ship here just to show off the strength of Light Island. Later, Yuan Shuo and the others went up. He also felt that there was no need to retreat. If he retreated, it would be too embarrassing.
       
        He was a god tier master blessed by the heavens and one of the three suns of Silvermoon.
        Ever since he left the sect, everything had been smooth. He had successfully established the island of light and become a powerful organization. Even the branches of the three major organizations here, including the night patrols, would give him some face and were not willing to have any conflicts with this local god tier master blessed by the heavens.
        Therefore, the island master of light Island was very arrogant. He had the right and the confidence to be arrogant.
        However, at this moment, his heart was trembling.
        Not good!
        "Hurry ..."
        Just as he was about to say something, a long stick pierced through the sky and smashed down!
        "What?" Light Island master was shocked. He was also an expert, so when he saw this, he let out an angry roar and punched out. It was the divine fist of light, as if the sun had fallen.
        These two people were doing this on purpose!
        He could feel that these two bastards had the intention to hit him on purpose.
         However ... As soon as he used the God of Light fist, a huge Flaming Fist fell on him. It was so huge that it seemed like a giant ape was waving its fist in the void!
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com BOOM!
        In an instant, an incomparably powerful force exploded in the mind of the Lord of Light Island like a Flaming Mountain. He saw an ape splitting the heavens and earth!
        His eyes became slightly cloudy.
        This was the Shi of a Martial Master. Those who had never experienced it before would never know how strong Yuan Shuo's Shi was.
        The Lord of Light Island was a god tier master blessed by the heavens, but he didn't know much about martial masters.
        In the distance.
        Hong Yitang sneered and suddenly shook his head.
        There were always so many iron-headed people.
        It's fine if you look down on the ground, but you look down on the two of them like you're watching a monkey show. The two of them are indomitable martial masters and were once unparalleled old demons. How dare you look down on them?
        You're really looking for death!
        Heavenly priest?
        Three yang?
        In the future, there might not be an island of light.
        The three suns were strong, but it also depended on who they were facing.
        At this moment, everyone saw a terrifying scene. The powerful Lord of Light Island had just used the God of Light fist. In the blink of an eye, an even bigger fist had punched out and directly shattered his fist, opening his defense!
        At this moment, a Red Stick fell!
        This cudgel was incomparably powerful and instantly burned everything. As the cudgel fell, there was a loud bang. The Flying Ship that was still floating just a moment ago was directly split into two by the cudgel. As for the light Island master in the middle ... He had completely disappeared!
        No, there was still a trace of light power left.
        The huge fist landed completely, directly blowing up the spaceship that had been split in half!
        There were countless screams and cries of alarm.
        Some of the light island's superpowers who were still alive fell to the ground.
        Its speed was extremely fast!
        Some supers with the ability to fly suddenly shouted in horror ... They couldn't fly!
        In this place, Shi ruled the world. It was even a domain.  In this domain, they could not break through the seal of the two masters 'Shi. Their superpowers were directly sealed. Rumble ... With a loud sound, the supers fell from a hundred meters in the air!
         Other than a few lucky people, the rest were instantly smashed into meat paste.  Of the few people, some were caught by other supers and had no choice but to catch them. They fell directly into their camp and had no choice but to catch them. There were a few lucky ones who managed to grab hold of the edges of the canyon and escaped death.
        The powerful light Island had over a hundred supers. At this moment, apart from seven or eight lucky ones, the rest were killed by the two of them in an instant!
        Light Island master, who was at the three sun realm, was turned into ashes by the two men's punches and sticks.
        At this moment ... There were only the painful wails of a few people left in the world.
        ……
        At the fairy camp.
        At this moment, the group of cloaked powerhouses seemed to have been frozen. They were motionless and looked up at the sky. Under the cloaks, there were only pairs of eyes filled with shock.
        A Martial Master?
        To be able to reach this stage?
        Everyone knew that Yuan Shuo had killed Duan Tian, but no one knew that he had killed the three suns so easily.
        ……
        The Crimson Moon.
        Hao Kong's expression changed completely. He was a little frightened, a little incredulous, and a little angry.
        How could Yuan Shuo be so powerful?
        That punch directly broke through the defense of a god tier master blessed by the heavens. It was the three suns, not the sunlight.
        Wasn't fighting a thousand only comparable to sunlight?
        How was that possible?
        Sun Yifei's strength was understandable, but Yuan Shuo's strength was beyond comprehension.
        "How could this be ..."
        He mumbled in disbelief and disbelief.
        Above thousand warrior tier?
        At this moment, it wasn't just him. Many people had the same thought.
        But ... That was impossible!
        Even in the central region, it was rumored that there were a few martial masters who had already stepped into this level. However, they hardly made a move now, and they could not be seen either. Those mysterious powerhouses seemed to have disappeared from the central battlefield one by one.
        It was said that these people had found the way to the top of the thousand-fighting sword.
         But ... That was the central region, and there was no solid evidence yet.
        Today, in the Silver Moon, in this declining martial arts world, they actually saw a Martial Master expert who killed a three sun heavenly favor Divine Master with a single punch.
        ……
        In the direction of the night patrolman.
        Hao lianchuan's expression changed. This was Yuan Shuo?
        The island of light ... Was gone.
        Even if there were only a few of them left, the island of light was completely gone. A medium-sized organization, one of the three suns, and several sunlit organizations were completely destroyed by their punches and sticks.
        It was unbelievable!
        ……
        Next to Li Hao, Wang Ming's mouth was wide open, and he looked a little dazed.
       
        Those were the three suns, not the Dark Moon.
        It was gone just like that?
        "Teacher!"
        He exclaimed in a low voice. The next moment, his eyes were frighteningly bright as he mumbled,""I want to learn martial arts!"
        Yes, he wanted to learn martial arts.
        Oh my God, this is a Martial Master?
        Li Hao's strength had already made him feel inferior, but when Yuan Shuo attacked, he finally realized that Li Hao was nothing. Yuan Shuo was the real immortal.
        This was the legendary God of the land. He was unbelievably powerful and could break the sky with one punch.
        ? What three yang, can you block this punch?
        That was impossible!
         At this moment, even the extremely powerful department head Hao felt that he couldn't block this punch. Look ... He looked at Hao lianchuan and, as expected, saw department head Hao's wide-open mouth and eyes.
        Obviously, department head Hao was also stunned and scared silly.
        ……
        In the air.
        The two of them quickly flew back and landed on the broken bridge again.
        His expression was very calm.
        It was as if he had just killed a few small bugs.
        If outsiders knew that this kind of person was not killed, they would think that martial masters were just like this!
        If they were not killed, the martial masters who had died more than 20 years ago would probably not be satisfied.
        "Back then, when we were watching the battle, who dared to be so unruly? they would have been beaten to death long ago. Why didn't you beat them to death?
        Now, the two of them seemed to be in a good mood after killing these unruly guys.
        They didn't even mention these people. Sun Yifei shook his long rod and looked at Yuan Shuo. After a long time, he said softly,"Yuan Shuo, you win in the path of Martial Master!"
        Yuan Shuo had reached another level.
        "What realm is this?"
        He asked with anticipation and yearning.
        The battle had just begun.
        But he wanted to know. He really wanted to know.
        Was there any way beyond thousand warrior?
        He was afraid that if he didn't ask, he wouldn't have the chance to ask again. He wanted to know, he really wanted to know.
        "Spirit accumulation!"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Yuan Shuo's voice was calm,"I've only just entered the spirit accumulation stage. There's still a realm above the spirit accumulation stage!" Spirit fusion!"
        "Spirit accumulation ... Spirit fusion ..."
        Sun Yifei murmured to himself with excitement, disappointment, and unwillingness.
        "You ... You've walked out of the world of martial masters ... There's hope for all the martial masters in the world!" He looked at Yuan Shuo.
        He didn't know if he was happy or sad.
        He looked at Yuan Shuo and revealed a bright smile,""I'm not losing anything, I'm really not losing anything ... I can't believe that at this moment, I know that there's still a realm above Qian warrior, Yuan Shuo, and yunshen Martial Master ... Come, let me see the power of yunshen!"
        "As you wish!"
        "Roar!"  With a loud roar, a giant ape appeared once again. This time, it was a little different.
        The giant ape held a chain in its hand. When the chain struck out, it seemed to tear a hole in the sky.
        At this moment, a long rod pierced through the world.
        A great battle had erupted.
        At this moment, he was truly going all out.
        The crowd below was stunned.
        An accumulation God Martial Master!
        The attack that had just killed one of the three suns was just a small demonstration of the two powerhouses 'skills. At this moment, they also felt the power of The Burning Sky and splitting earth.
        At this moment, be it haokong or Yama ...
        They all tried to contact the outside world.
        The heavens had changed!
        Sun Yifei's battle with Yuan Shuo, and Yuan Shuo's breakthrough to the warrior Qian realm, making him the first spirit accumulation Martial Master in the world, would surely shock all the martial masters in the 99 provinces.
        There was really a way beyond the thousand warrior tier.
        Those in the central region who did not appear above the thousand-warrior tier ... Were they really spiritual, or were they fake?
        They did not know.
        However, Yuan Shuo must be real. A super who could suppress a late-stage three sun super and was even a Martial Master. Dou Qian could not possibly have such strength.
        ……
        Boom! Boom! Boom!
        It was like thunder, like a volcano erupting.
        In the air, two figures flickered and collided. The heart fire ape held the chain, and every strike broke the sky. The eyebrows-length staff was also extremely powerful. With one strike, the ground began to crack. One had to know that the other party was still in the air.
        Below the ground, Li Hao watched intently.
        He saw that the heart fire ape was suppressed. In an instant, it was sent flying by the rod. His expression changed, and his inner strength burst out. Sword Qi scattered. He was very nervous.
        His teacher was strong, but he could store spirit. He only stored a part of the spirit, and according to his realm, his teacher was only at the early three yang realm.
        The other party was a late-stage three yang cultivator.
        An ordinary three yang cultivator was nothing, but sun Yifei was obviously extraordinary.
        He even had the impulse to advance to the warrior power level at this moment, accumulate the spirit of his five internal organs, and participate in this battle ... To join forces with his teacher to fight the enemy.
        However, he knew that even if he managed to master the five viscera divine skill, his teacher would not let him go on stage.
         This was a battle that belonged to him, the last dignity of a Martial Master!
        And this was also the continuation of the glory of the Silver Moon martial forest from that battle.
        At this moment, Li Hao looked around, only to see fear, admiration, and envy. He suddenly laughed.
        Perhaps, this was the reason why his teacher accepted the challenge and why Sun Yifei challenged him in public.
        Silver moon's Wulin was still continuing.
        It had not declined!
        These superpowers were all shuddering under the might of a Martial Master!
        "Teacher ... Must win!"
        Li Hao shouted in his heart, you must win!
        [PS: after the end of the second chapter, the battle between Yuan Shuo and the eyebrows-abrest stick is not only a battle of life and death, but also a battle of revenge. It's also the beginning of a Martial master's rise again, so don't be too concerned about the outcome.]
       
        The battle continued.
        On the broken bridge, the two of them were no longer fighting in the air.
        Yuan Shuo's five birds technique was activated to the extreme, and so was his breathing technique. As he breathed in and out, his body even emitted bursts of white smoke. That was the intense breathing that passed through his internal organs. The difference in temperature caused the gas to evaporate.
        However, in the eyes of others, he was like a god, breathing clouds and mist.
        Perhaps, some of the ancient legends were like this.
        Standing high in the sky, there seemed to be clouds and mist around him. Wasn't this what it meant to swallow clouds and spit out mist?
        And sun Yifei was like a fire god.
        The flames didn't touch his body, but the staff was red. One strike after another, Yuan Shuo was forced to retreat. He was too strong!
        After becoming a superpower, he still walked the path of martial arts.
        Back then, he was a powerhouse on the path of martial arts. Although he no longer used inner strength today, he could still use his powerful super power to burst out the power of the eyebrows-abrest rod.
         Who said that supers only used their superpowers?
        Sun Yifei had also developed his own style in the path of superpowers. He used the power as his inner strength and used the breathing technique with the eyebrows-abrest rod without any side effects.
        BOOM!
        With a swing of the rod, one side of the broken bridge completely collapsed.
        Yuan Shuo stepped into the air like a bird or a Tiger pouncing forward. His fists turned into claws and grabbed at the long rod like a bird's claws!
        An eagle hunting a rabbit!
        At this moment, it was as if he had transformed into an Eagle, clawing at sun Yifei with his sharp claws. As he clawed at sun Yifei's long staff, streaks of fiery light appeared on the surface of the staff. Sun Yifei shook the staff, and the vibration force exploded as he thrust the staff forward ..... Bang! The long staff pierced through the sky and earth. Yuan Shuo quickly tried to Dodge, but his palm was still pierced through.
        The long stick did not stop and directly hit the cliff in the distance. With a loud bang, a huge cave appeared on the cliff, which was created by him.
        With a wave of his hand, the long staff flew out!
        The battle between the two became fiercer and fiercer!
        At this moment, sun Yifei's anger was boiling, and he looked like a few Suns had appeared around him. This was a real three-Sun Warrior, and he was as hot as the sun.
        The difference between Silvermoon's three suns and his was huge.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com His killing intent, battle awareness, experience, and methods were all inferior to this person.
        From Silver Moon to the central continent, sun Yifei had been killing for dozens of years. The red color on his long rod wasn't just the light of fire, but also the blood light!
        In mid-air, Yuan Shuo roared and the heart fire ape threw out the chain again!
        The chains wrapped around the staff, and loud clattering sounds resounded through the world.
        The moment the staff was wrapped around him, Yuan Shuo roared.
        Li Hao and the others quickly covered their ears.
        At this moment, it was as if a fierce tiger had really walked out of the forest. The roar that was countless times louder than the Tiger sounded like a great demon was attacking.
        "Roar!"
        The roar shook the world.
        Below, the weaker supers all released their mysterious energy, but they still could not block this powerful roar. Many people's eardrums were instantly broken, and their ears were bleeding.
        He retreated again and again!
         Many supers 'expressions changed completely. Some of them could not hide their fear and retreated.  The small organizations ran so fast that even after retreating a thousand meters, they still felt danger and continued to retreat.
        Of the mid-sized organizations, only swords gate was left. On swords gate's side, Hong Yitang signaled for everyone to leave, but he didn 't. Instead, he looked at the two men in the air with a fanatical expression.
        Martial arts!
        The path of a Martial Master, Silver Moon martial forest ...
        After today's battle, he believed that all the martial masters in the world would flock to him to worship him and continue to pursue the illusionary future of the Martial Master path.
        Because ... The future was promising!
        Yuan Shuo had broken the limit of the Qian generation.
        At this moment, even Hong Yitang's heart, which had been silent for many years, started to burn.
        A Martial Master!
        Martial arts could connect with the gods!
        Even though Yuan Shuo wasn't able to suppress sun Yifei at this moment and might even be suppressed by sun Yifei, Hong Yitang couldn't hide the burning desire in his heart. Old demon Yuan had reappeared, Silver Moon martial forest had returned!
        "Roar!"
        A series of roars shook the entire Valley, and the echoes were endless.
        In mid-air, Yuan Shuo stepped on the air. The power of the five birds technique was beyond comparison. Not only was it the ape technique, but he was also using the Tiger fighting technique. It was like a fierce tiger fighting. The heart fire ape was carrying a Tiger on its back, and its killing intent was monstrous.
        Five birds merging force!
        Other than the heart fire ape, Yuan Shuo still had other forces. At this moment, those forces quickly merged and turned into a fierce tiger. The ape and the Tiger stood side by side, and the two forces collided, erupting with an even stronger force.
        "Ha!"
        Yuan Shuo shouted and threw his fists at sun Yifei's head.
        The hammer closed!
        With a loud bang, sun Yifei swung his staff, and the power of the five birds shook!
        In the air, Yuan Shuo was wavering.
        Sun Yifei hacked at Yuan Shuo crazily, creating holes in his body and forcing Yuan Shuo to retreat again.
         The two of them had the upper hand one moment and the other moment, their strength was on par.
        Although the momentum was strong, it couldn't withstand the other party's power.
        At this moment, it was the opposite of Li Hao.
        Li Hao fought sun moxian. His five internal organs were strong, while sun moxian's force was strong, but force was useless. It couldn't break Li Hao's five internal organs, and in the end, he was killed by Li Hao.
        At the same time, Yuan Shuo's aura was very strong, but his inner strength was not as strong as his opponent 's.
        The rich fire energy greatly reduced Yuan Shuo's attack.
        At this moment, not only did Li Hao understand what was going on, but the others also understood what was going on. They all had strange looks in their eyes.
        It was the reverse!
        Before this, it was Li Hao who killed sun moxian. Now, if the situation continued like this, it would be sun Yifei who killed Yuan Shuo.
        The master and disciple's battle was actually going in opposite directions at this time.
       
        ……
        In the air.
        Yuan Shuo's chain shook, but it was unable to break the opponent's long staff. Yuan Shuo roared in anger like a violent Gorilla.
        Sun Yifei was getting fiercer and fiercer!
        His eyes were cold and sharp, with a hint of joy in them, but more of it was killing intent.
        When one heard the Dao in the morning, one could die in the evening.
        But ... It did not stop him from killing Yuan Shuo.
        On the path of martial arts, it was fine as long as there was a path.
        There was another violent collision. Yuan Shuo grabbed his staff and left a few deep claw marks on it. However, he was still hit by sun Yifei's punch. Sun Yifei backed off with the staff, and Yuan Shuo was sent flying, his blood spraying in the air.
        Yuan Shuo stood steadily in the air. His face was slightly pale and he looked a little tired.
         On the other hand, sun Yifei's face flushed red as he coughed,"is this the only way?"
        Was this the only way?
        He bared his teeth and smiled,'where is the second god? Of the five Forces of spirit accumulation, you only have one Spirit! Yuan Shuo, if you possess the five spirits, there's no need to fight today. I'll definitely die! But he's just a single God...He won't be enough to kill me!"
        Yuan Shuo was panting heavily.
        He looked at sun Yifei.
        Sun Yifei's eyes were sharp. After fighting for a long time, he had already seen some clues. Yuan Shuo had the five gods, so it was inevitable that he could defeat the three suns. In fact, Yuan Shuo didn't even need the five gods. He could defeat the three suns with the three gods.
        But he didn 't!
        He only had one Spirit, so he could attack for a while and deal with ordinary three suns. However, his opponent was sun Yifei, a Martial Master who was indomitable.
        As long as he could withstand the first wave of attacks, it would be time for sun Yifei to counterattack.
        "How arrogant!" Yuan Shuo smiled. Those who were arrogant with me back then ... It seems that not many of them survived!"
        After saying that, he roared and instantly turned into a fierce tiger!
        At the same time, waves of Yin Qi came from the Tiger's body. Under the Tiger's feet, there seemed to be clouds and water.
        Five birds technique, tiger moves in Yin. Yin belongs to water, and water corresponds to the kidney.
        The second god!
        His kidney was of the water element. His kidney was not strong enough and had not been nourished enough. If he forcefully recuperated his spirit, it might cause his kidney to break ... But so what?
        At this point, who would admit defeat?
        He, Yuan Shuo, had run amuck for his entire life, but in front of him, there were only people he had defeated!
        It was difficult to kill one God, but what about two?
        In an instant, a tiger's roar shook the heavens and earth. Yuan Shuo's fire and water melded together, and the ape and Tiger seemed to have become one. In an instant, they transformed into a monster with the head of a Tiger and the body of an ape. He struck out with his fist, and his fist transformed into claws!
        With a pfft, this claw was shockingly fast.
        In an instant, the claw grabbed sun Yifei's ankle and tore off pieces of his flesh.
        Sun Yifei wasn't shocked. Instead, he was happy!
        The second god!
         He saw the second god ... If he could, he wished he could see the fifth god, but he knew that it was impossible.  This was Yuan Shuo's limit.
        With the appearance of a third God, Yuan Shuo would probably die before he could even fight.
        Enough!
        "Good!"
        Sun Yifei laughed loudly, and the fire elemental power in his body instantly exploded to the extreme. At this moment, Li Hao even felt a little different. He looked at Hao lianchuan.
        Hao lianchuan's expression changed drastically.
        The fire Phoenix in his body seemed to have sensed something, and it started to move around like crazy. Obviously, the fire Phoenix seemed to have sensed sun Yifei's fire power, and it wanted to rush out of its body and meet this fire power.
        Li Hao's expression was grave. He had actually activated an origin divine weapon!
        As for his teacher, he was in trouble.
        His Water Tiger did have a bit of water. It lacked the power of the water element, and his kidney wasn't nourished enough. If this went on and the battle dragged on, it would cause great damage to his teacher.
        Li Hao looked around. He saw something and quickly looked at Liu Long.""Boss, get the night patrollers to collect the mysterious energy left behind by all the fallen supers ..."
        Liu Long was slightly stunned.
        Very quickly, he understood.
        He quickly left and walked toward Hao lianchuan.
        A moment later, under Hao lianchuan's command, the night patrollers began to extract the mysterious energy of the fallen powerhouses before the battle above ended and the others were frightened.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com If it was any other time, there would still be people who would snatch it.
        However, today ... No one dared to move.
        The two were still fighting, so no one dared to move, not even red Moon.
        Hao Kong knew that Yuan Shuo might be more lenient to the night patrolmen, but sun Yifei would never be lenient to Hong Yue.
        At this moment, a slight carelessness had disrupted the battle between the two. If the two of them turned against each other, Hong Yue would not be able to stop them from joining forces. In Hao Kong's opinion, only Zi Yue could intervene in such a battle.
        As for him, he was still a step away.
        Even if Fei Tian and Yama joined forces, they might only be able to barely resist the two of them. Only if one of them died in battle and the other was heavily injured would it be in everyone's interest.
         Li Hao's expression changed when he saw that everyone was collecting superpowers.
        He looked at Zhang Ting from the corner of his eyes.
        Night patrolman!
        An existence at the middle stage of the three yang realm.
        He didn't know if it was a water element divine weapon ... But he knew that even if his teacher won this battle, his kidney might explode. The collected mysterious energy and light energy might be able to repair it, but it wouldn't be enough.
        If he added a water element divine weapon ... He should be able to!
        At this moment, Li Hao firmly believed that his teacher would win.
        Regardless of whether he could win or not ... He hoped that his teacher would be able to recover quickly after the battle. Otherwise, his teacher might face great trouble.
        "I'm sorry ... Minister hou also said that it's up to you to kill me or not ..."
        Li Hao, who had broken through 100 points, was actually thinking of killing someone and snatching his treasure. Moreover, the person he killed was a middle stage three yang cultivator.
       
        If this news were to spread, it would probably shock everyone.
        But Li Hao really had such a plan.
        As for Zhang Ting, who came from the central region and was a spy of the night patrolmen ... So what?
        Just as this thought came to his mind, Liu Long suddenly pressed his shoulder. Liu Long seemed to have guessed something, or perhaps he didn 't, but he knew that Li Hao had the intention to kill him.
        "Don't be impatient!"
        Liu Long said in a deep voice,"now, everyone is waiting. You have to wait too!" The bird that sticks out gets shot ... I think elder Yuan doesn't want you to take any risks right now and just rest here!"
        Li Hao didn't say anything. He lowered his head and suppressed the anxiety in his heart.
        The second god!
        Sun Yifei's strength was beyond his imagination. Originally, he thought that his teacher would be able to defeat him since he had the first God. However, even with the second god, he still couldn't defeat sun Yifei.
        ……
         In the void.
        Yuan Shuo, who had the head of a Tiger and the body of an ape, once again launched a powerful attack. It was extremely powerful, and he broke the sky with a single punch.
        His fists and legs were invincible, and he was agile.
        He threw one punch after another, and this time, he completely suppressed his opponent. Sun Yifei kept retreating, and he kept spitting out blood. However, he was laughing like a madman!
        "Just like this?"
        "Yuan Shuo, it's not enough!"
        The second god was too superficial!
        Of course, even so, sun Yifei's skin was torn open, and blood was spurting out. However, he was still laughing happily. The next moment, he launched a counterattack with the long staff in his hand!
        Bang Bang Bang!
        The loud sounds continued. At this moment, the two of them didn't defend and only attacked!
        Attack, attack again!
        After a long time, Yuan Shuo roared and threw a punch. With a loud bang, the long staff broke!
        This powerful eyebrow-raising rod was finally shattered by Yuan Shuo's one punch after he had punched it hundreds of times and almost crushed his own fist!
        Pfft!
        Sun Yifei's chest caved in, and he was sent flying backward. He even spat out pieces of his internal organs, and the long stick in his hand was completely shattered by Yuan Shuo.
        He laughed.
        "You ... How much power do you still have?"
        Yuan Shuo was on the verge of collapsing. He didn't reply, his face filled with cold arrogance.
        How much power?
        There was not much left, so what?
        "Sun Yifei ... You ... You lost to me!"
        Yuan Shuo once again stepped on the air and walked towards him at a slow speed.
        Sun Yifei spat out a mouthful of blood, but he was still smiling."That year, I was knocked down by you ... It was just like today. You broke my eyebrow raising staff, and I fell to the ground with serious injuries. You walked toward me step by step ... I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't want to die in your hands ... So, I jumped off the Hengduan bridge!"
        "Yuan Shuo, it won't happen again today!"
        He revealed a bright smile and said,"today, I won 't!" My disciple, tell me ... Even in a desperate situation, there's still a chance of survival! Don't give up, I haven't lost yet, I'm not dead!"
        At this moment, his body once again emitted an incomparably powerful fire power!
        At this moment, a series of exclamations came from the surroundings.
        The mysterious source!
        That's right, just like how Yuan Shuo opened the mysterious source, but he realized that the mysterious source absorbed and devoured inner strength. He gave up on the mysterious source, which also cut off his hope of becoming a superpower.  And sun Yifei was already a super.
        The mysterious source was the source of his power and the source of his powers.
        At this moment, an eyebrow raising staff appeared in his hand again. It was the same as sun moxian 's, he used the last of his strength to form a special eyebrow raising staff. It was even condensed from sun Yifei's source of mystery.
        If he broke this staff, his source of mystery would be broken, and he would die without a doubt.
        This was the final madness!
        "I won't admit defeat ... I've lost once, there won't be a second time!"
        "Yuan Shuo, I won't lose even if you break my eyebrow raising staff again!" Sun Yifei laughed.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Because at that moment, he had already died.
        You're here to break my eyebrow-raising staff!
        "Kill!"
        With a loud roar, he struck out with his staff. This staff was extremely powerful.
        The severely injured eyebrows-abrest rod King was actually rejuvenated at this moment, erupting with an incomparably powerful force. The eyebrows-abrest rod reappeared!
        He wanted to win!
        Even if he had to win once, for a moment, he wanted to win once!
        ……
        "This is crazy!"
        Hao lianchuan muttered to himself. Crazy, he was really crazy.
        Sun Yifei, a late-stage three-sun realm master, actually condensed his mysterious source into the eyebrow-raising stick. If the stick broke, his mysterious source would be shattered, and he would die for sure. He was really fighting with his life on the line.
        Although it was a battle of life and death ... Even if sun Yifei really won, he might be crippled, or even lose a level.
        The loss of the mysterious source was too great for supers.
        "Is this what a Martial Master is like?"
        He thought to himself.
        Yuan Shuo asked him if he was a Martial Master.
        Hao lianchuan was not.
        That was why Yuan Shuo said,"you are not a Martial Master, so you don't understand martial masters. That is why ... You are not strong enough!"
        Martial masters had been in decline for twenty years.
        But today, who dared to say that martial masters had declined?
        No!
         Even Super Sun Yifei was showing off the style of a Martial Master. In the battle between martial masters, he wasn't a pure super.
        Beside him, the other sunlit cultivators also looked solemn.
        At this point, it was already considered a lose-lose situation for both sides.
        Yuan Shuo was obviously exhausted, and sun Yifei...Wasn't much better. If this continued, either one of them would die, or the other would be severely injured.
        He had thought that this time, entering the ruins would be the only risk.
        However, before he could enter, the island of light was gone.
        Two of the top three powerhouses of Silver Moon would probably die and be crippled this time.
        ……
        In the void.
        The sound of the stick suppressed the roar of the Tiger, and sun Yifei became crazier and crazier. He struck again and again, and the fire on the long stick shot into the sky.
