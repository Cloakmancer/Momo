"What do you think?" the human King grinned.The Dragon Master smiled."In the past, I thought that it must have been born. Otherwise, it wouldn't have left a mark in Tian Fang ... Later, when I saw the Dao that Li Hao used, I thought ... Perhaps I was wrong. It might be a very powerful cultivator who reversed time ... Of course, it's also very terrifying!"After saying that, he asked curiously,'Is He Dead? Otherwise, how could it have fallen into Li Hao's hands?"The human King's gaze did not change, but he sighed with emotion. This fellow had indeed seen through it!Shi Guang was still unable to hide it from this fella.He didn't say much and only glanced at the Dragon Master, somewhat curious.""How many Dao laws have you constructed?""Around 6000. Why? are you interested?"The Dragon Lord smiled, but the human King's expression changed slightly.More than 6000!"You're from the chaos race. You cultivate the chaos Dao. How can you comprehend so many Dao laws?"The Dragon Master laughed,"could it be that the chaos race is not allowed to produce individual geniuses?" Besides, the chaos race is the most talented and has the best foundation. As long as they can sort out the order of the entire chaos great Dao ... What's wrong with having more than nine thousand, let alone six thousand?"He said it so simply!At this moment, the human King's expression turned serious.He had entered the eighth rank, but he had no confidence in dealing with this person.Of course, there was Cang Mao, light, and old Zhang here, so he was not too worried.But ... He looked into the distance and raised his eyebrows slightly. "You're going to take down the five demon realms?""Yes,"The Dragon Lord nodded,"I hope that the previous incident will not happen again!" So ... I'm here today to make a presumptuous request. "The Dragon Master smiled."How about ... New martial temporarily withdraw from the square region? as for Guangming, it doesn't matter whether he stays or leaves. I hope that the square region can become my backyard and won't catch fire again. You can either leave or ... Fight!"Hearing this, light Thearch was unhappy. He said in a low voice,""The square region is the human race's territory to begin with. Your chaos race is only a latecomer. Even you, long Zhan, are the same!" You want us to leave?What a joke!As for the Dragon Master, he laughed."How about this? Guangming, you're in the native universe now. If you can take three of my punches and you don't leave, I'll leave. I'll take the chaos race and leave the square domain for the time being. What do you think?"Three punches?The light Thearch's eyes flickered. Last time, he killed a rank eight with two or three punches because no one had the Dao universe or the power of the world to enhance them, and the Dragon Master had the dragon world with him.Moreover, the two of them were in a weakened state.However, he was at his peak!Not only that, but at this moment, they were still in the native world. He really didn't believe that the Dragon Lord could do anything to him with three punches!In fact, he was confident that he could compete with the Dragon Lord here!"You said that?""If you go back on your word, the two level eight venerable sovereigns of new martial arts are also here. Don't blame us for joining forces to attack you!""Don't worry!""Are you ready?" the Dragon Master laughed and looked at him."Of course ..."In an instant, the Dragon Lord disappeared. When he punched out, there was no monstrous power. Only the Dao domain enveloped it. The laws of the great Dao changed, and the heaven and earth seemed to have turned into a cage!The light Thearch's expression changed as he also unleashed the God of Light fist!The power of the world and the power of the universe supplemented his body at the same time. The human king and emperor Cang at the side retreated as the human King watched on with a solemn expression.The next moment, the light Thearch groaned and the light power on his fist shattered instantly!This punch seemed to have hit the great Dao universe directly, making the radiance Supreme Emperor pale with fright. He was an eighth level venerable sovereign, and he was fighting in his own territory!The next moment, the Dragon Lord laughed and said,"second punch!."Another punch came without a sound. The light Thearch let out a roar. The light God fist was like a huge sun, illuminating the entire heaven and earth. In an instant, a fist burst out and the two fists collided!BOOM!With a loud bang, the light Thearch was sent flying backward, covered in blood. His body seemed to have collapsed, and his fist was shattered!"Do you still want to receive a third punch?" the Dragon Lord said with a smile.At that moment, the human King laughed,""Why don't I take a punch?"In an instant, a long saber appeared and slashed out!Yin and yang emerged. Under the yin and yang, there seemed to be an invincible force emerging. The human King slashed out with his saber, and his eyes instantly turned blood red. The Dragon Lord also punched out. In an instant, the long saber was shattered, and even the yin and yang collapsed!The human King retreated, and an extremely powerful special power seemed to emerge from his body. In an instant, he suppressed the aftershock of his opponent, but blood seeped out of the corner of his mouth.The Dragon Lord looked at his fist, and a bloody mark appeared on it.He glanced at the human King and chuckled,""It's a pity that your inner world hasn't reached level eight. It's only at Level Seven ... There's a big gap between us. If it had reached level eight, you might have been able to fight me!" Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  The human King wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and grinned,""It's hard enough, I like it! I like to cut people like you, hard, it's more comfortable to cut! You can do whatever you want!""You're very strong ... But you're not invincible. Big cat and I are not afraid of you even if we work together!" He laughed."That's right." The Dragon Master nodded slightly."That's why I'm just discussing it. I don't have any other intentions."If not, he would have directly suppressed it."How about this, I'm not an unreasonable person." The human King chuckled. It's not impossible for me to leave the four-sided domain ... I can choose not to return before Tian Fang revives ... The condition is that you give me three rank Seven Worlds. Don't you still have six or seven great worlds?"The Dragon Master looked at him deeply. The human King had a carefree attitude and laughed wantonly,""Otherwise, we definitely won't leave. At most, we'll just do it!"The Dragon Lord laughed. After a long time, he slowly said,""Yes! However, I don't believe the human King's words. How about this, when we get the world, we'll sign a great Dao agreement. If you don't return before Tian Fang completely revives, I'll fulfill my promise!"He looked at the dumbfounded light Emperor and chuckled. Without looking back, he disappeared from where he was.As for the radiance Supreme Emperor, he was at a loss and in disbelief.How did this happen?I had the advantage of being native, but I was defeated by the other party with two punches?And at this moment, the human King was grimacing in pain as he rubbed his body and muttered,""It's so F * cking hard! Don't look at it. This old dragon wasn't that relaxed either. It was just that his physical body was stronger, so he seemed more relaxed! But ... Six thousand ..."As he said this, he became serious. "You're still far from him, and so am I! If this guy really brings Red Moon and those Beasts of Chaos, we'll have a hard time dealing with him unless we join forces with Li Hao and the others!"After saying that, he looked into the distance and said in a deep voice,""He might not have any more worlds in his hands. Without a rank seven world, perhaps ... It has been devoured! The number of grade-7 experts might have increased. The world he mentioned might be the demon world. He's quite confident ...""Then ..."The radiance Supreme Emperor was struggling. Was he really going to retreat?'But what about me? what about this bright world?'I can't take it away!Emperor Cang could, but the other party brought neo martial!On the side, Supreme Emperor Yao yang said in a low voice,""It seems like ... Mingtang might not even have the chance to succeed the throne."‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe radiance Supreme Emperor cursed in his heart. 'You're still thinking about this at this time when your lair is almost gone?'Also, that's my son, not yours!You, what are you thinking all day?Those who didn't know better would think that your son was mingtang!

(It's the last two hours of the month. If you don't vote, it'll expire. After 12 o' clock, please give me some monthly votes.)The Dragon Lord came to the light and threw three punches.It was not to start a war with neo martial arts 'Guangming. He was just telling them that if they really started a war, at this moment, both sides would only suffer losses. Neo martial arts might have more tier eights, but he, long Zhan, was stronger!The light Emperor, who was in charge of the great world, was seriously injured by two punches.Either you guys retreat, or I retreat.There was no other way!As for who would retreat, that would depend on their strength.If they didn't retreat, there would definitely be a battle.The radiance Thearch couldn't take the three punches ... Neo martial wanted to retreat, so the radiance Thearch naturally had no choice.At this moment, light Thearch was a little depressed and shocked. After a long time, he sighed."The power of a Dragon is so terrifying!"He really didn't feel anything earlier.Why ... Did he suddenly become so powerful?At this moment, the human King suddenly laughed and said,"he has left the dragon world and opened his own Dao domain. He has embarked on the path of all DAOs returning to one!" This guy is indeed difficult to deal with. In the four-sided domain, you, Hong Yue, Chi Yang ... Even a few rank eight venerable sovereigns are not as good as him!"Light Emperor couldn't help but ask,""Now that the human King has stepped into the 8th tier, is there really no way for him to fight against Emperor Cang if he joins forces with him?"A human King was very strong, a level Seven suppressing a level eight.Now that he had stepped into the eighth step, was he still unable to fight with the other party?"Whether it's a seventh-rank or eighth-rank, there's not much difference."However, the human King shook his head."At this level, one can't look at the limits of great DAOs, or the depth of one's Foundation, or the number of Dao laws one has. The Dragon Lord who has fused more than 6000 Dao is not someone I can match up to!""Myriad DAOs merge?" Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Light Emperor was deep in thought. He understood this, but he knew that it would be very difficult.At this moment, he could not help but ask,"has the human King ... Integrated the Dao laws?""Can you guess?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùWhat am I supposed to guess! The radiance Thearch was speechless.He was already so old ... Alright, the human King was still young, but he wasn't young anymore. How could he have the time to guess?He judged that the inner world of a human King should also be a manifestation of one's own Dao domain.As for how many Dao laws the human King had fused with ... That was hard to determine.Three thousand?Four thousand? In any case, it was definitely less than six thousand. Otherwise, with the human King's personality, he would have already started a fight with the Dragon Master.The fact that they didn't fight meant that the human King also knew that he was no match for this person.The radiance Thearch felt a little dejected. He suddenly sighed."Actually, after reaching the eighth step, we also know that the road ahead is very difficult to walk on. "Opening one's own Dao and fusing one's own Dao might allow one to step into level nine ... However, to us, stepping into level eight is already a huge price to pay ... If we also take the path of 10000 DAOs returning to one ... It's fine if we succeed, but what if we fail? Give up on the great world? In the great world, if all the people cultivate together, there's still hope for us to accumulate time and reach level nine ... A quantitative change leads to a qualitative change!"But ...If they gave up on the great world, would there still be hope?There wasn't much hope.The great world had its necessity and benefits. When there were more cultivators, although it was still difficult to advance, more and more experts would be born, continuously strengthening one's great Dao. As the accumulation continued, if one hundred thousand years did not work, one million years would work. If one million years did not work, another million years would come ...By relying on the accumulation of time, even if he couldn't reach level nine, he might be close to level nine.This was the advantage of the great world.The human King nodded."This is actually another path. There might not be only one path of cultivation!"He laughed.At that moment, he looked into the distance and saw a series of powerful auras. The auras of dozens of rank Sevens appeared in the sky, and even the auras of rank eights were unleashed.The human King raised his brows slightly,'that Black Tiger is actually at the eighth rank! Li Hao is having a hard time. Black Tiger's wife was killed by them, wasn't she?""Black Tiger Thearch ..."At this moment, light Thearch also raised his eyebrows slightly.There was another grade 8!Chi Yang and Yun Xiao had died, but now, two new tier 8 neo martial artists had been born. Now, there was also black Tiger, Wu Shan, and Thunderlord. The number of tier 8 neo martial artists in the four regions had increased instead of not being many.However ... The older generation of level eights had been replaced. Today, he was the only one who still maintained the world ... But could this world of light still be maintained?Even the Dragon Lord had abandoned the world."Human ruler, if we leave, the humans of the four regions ..."He glanced at the human King. This was a world where countless humans existed in the four regions, and you were the human King!The human King's face was calm,"he's not a neo martial artist!" Well, even if they were all humans, the Dragon Lord wouldn't massacre the humans now after taking over the four-sided domain. His current goal was to take over the entire four-sided domain and make it his own backyard! There are at least 30 to 40 human worlds in the three regions. If they massacre the human race and enrage the masses, even tier 7 humans who didn't want to participate will have to do so to protect themselves ..."With the Dragon Lord's current situation, at least for now, he would not do so.Light Thearch sighed again.He then looked into the distance."Are we really going to leave the demons alone?"The eight rank seven venerable sovereigns of the monster race were probably doomed this time.His original plan was to have Silver Moon and the new martial attack from both sides once the Dragon Lord dealt with the demons. They might be able to severely injure the other party, but now, the Dragon Lord had come here alone and held everyone back.As for Li Hao ... He didn't show his face at all. It was very likely that he had already left the lightning territory.

3352 Chapter 544
Clearly, he didn't care about the life and death of the demon race.These guys were cold-blooded enough. The radiance Supreme Emperor had thought that they would treat the monster race as their allies, but now he found that they didn 't.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.At the edge of the lightning territory.A great battle broke out.The eight major demon clans and the incoming chaos beasts instantly engaged in a fierce battle. The powerful pressure instantly shook, and in the blink of an eye, dozens of Level Seven auras rose up.The iron-eating Supreme Emperor held his iron staff and waved it wildly, breaking the void. Even the black Tiger Supreme Emperor, who had just advanced to rank eight, couldn't break through his defense in a short time, especially when he had the world Dao.The black Tiger roared madly!The five great demon worlds were extremely hateful. Last time, if it wasn't for them, they might have had a chance.Of the five great demon realms, the iron-eating realm, the barbaric bull realm, the iron Eagle realm, the fire Dolphin realm, and the flying Wolf realm had three seventh level venerable sovereigns, and the flying Wolf realm had two.Brutal bull, Steel Eagle, and fire Dolphin were only seventh rank venerable sovereigns.At this moment, the chaos race had countless experts, and the number of tier 7 experts had increased instead of decreasing. They had even surpassed what they had before, making them extremely terrifying.The bull and iron Eagle worlds had long given up on defending. Suddenly, one of the two sector Lords, a giant bull, roared,""I surrender!"On the other side, the iron Eagle spread its wings and flew high. Its sharp wings seemed to cut through the void. It tried to escape several times, but failed. At this moment, it also shouted,"Qing Qiu, I am also willing to surrender. Last time, it was the iron-eating race that forced us to fight back ... The iron-eating race was strong, and we were powerless to fight back!"Of the eight seventh level venerable sovereigns, two of them chose to surrender immediately. Seeing that they were no match for him, of course, it was more important to keep their lives.As for the iron eater Thearch, he didn't say a word. With just a swing of his iron staff, he shattered the heavens and earth. He erupted with madness and even suppressed the black Tiger. At that moment, his blood-red eyes were filled with anger and helplessness!The demons were not United.He had no choice.The chaos race was simply too powerful.Previously, he had thought that it was an opportunity. The chaos race had suffered heavy losses, but ... Who would have thought that the chaos race had abandoned the great world and created many venerable sovereigns?Moreover, the dragon clan had many hidden seventh rank venerable sovereigns.In addition, the black Tiger had reached level eight ... There was no hope at all. Hong Yue, a human, had also joined the other party, so there was even less hope.He had originally hoped that when the chaos race attacked, perhaps new martial and silver Moon would join in the battle ... But there was no movement.The iron-eating Thearch was not surprised that the two leaders of the monster race had chosen to surrender.If it wasn't for his suppression, these guys would have surrendered long ago.At this moment, the Qingqiu Fox in the distance laughed,""Iron eater, demon race, only your race is stubborn! The Dragon Lord is a man of great talent and strategy, which part of him is not worth your service?"Even though they had completely suppressed the demons and the remaining few of the six demon races were wavering ... The Qingqiu Fox was also very confused about the iron-eating tribe's resistance and the leadership of the five realms. Why were the iron-eating race so insistent on resisting?At that moment, a red light suddenly flashed. Before the green Hill Fox could react, a seventh-rank venerable sovereign from the iron-eating race was fighting a chaos expert. Suddenly, his eyes dimmed.In an instant, the level Seven venerable sovereign of the iron-eating clan collapsed!"Damn it!"At that moment, the iron eater Thearch roared in anger. He had gone crazy!He had gone completely crazy!As for the Qingqiu Fox, she frowned.The black Tiger, who was fighting the iron-eating Thearch, also had a slight change in expression. In fact, even though he had a deep hatred for the iron-eating race, he knew that they were extremely powerful.Iron eater venerable Emperor was a powerhouse at the peak of the seventh rank.There were three tier 7 experts in a race, and if they were willing to serve the chaos race, they would be capable experts.But now, Hong Yue had sneaked an attack on an iron-eater expert and killed him directly!After killing an iron-eater expert, was he still expecting the other party to surrender?The iron-eating Emperor was the vanguard of the resistance, and at this moment, he would not surrender!As expected, the iron-eating Thearch roared crazily and smashed the sky with his iron staff. He then roared,""Red Moon! Even if I die today, I will kill you!"Behind him, the iron-eating realm expanded crazily!After knocking back the black Tiger Imperator with one strike, he rushed straight at the red moon Imperator with red eyes, regardless of the other coming from behind. He wanted to kill this man! Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  So what if he was a level eight?He was indeed very powerful, but a human race venerable sovereign without a world had a weak body. His Dao domain had not advanced to rank eight, so what was there to fear?In the distance, Red Moon sovereign chuckled and retreated.They retreated behind the chaos behemoths.After ambushing and killing a rank seven iron-eater, he did not stay, nor did he want to fight with this crazy iron-eater venerable Emperor. If he were to fight him one-on-one, he might not be able to win as the other party had the terrain and the great world was right behind him. He did not have a great world to rely on.That was enough.By killing a rank seven, not only could he answer to the Dragon Lord, but most importantly ... The iron-eating venerable sovereign would definitely not surrender at this moment. This was to prevent the iron-eating race from joining the Dragon race. The Dragon race, which was already strong to begin with, would be even more difficult to deal with. Yes, he did it on purpose, and no one could find fault with him!He had deliberately killed the other party so that the iron-eating race would not surrender.He was even looking forward to Silver Moon and neo martial coming to help ... It would be best if both sides suffered heavy losses.Unfortunately ... There was no movement from either side. It was very hateful.

3353 Chapter 544
As an eighth level venerable sovereign, a master of a region, how could he be willing to be a dog?He could be summoned and waved away! However, the Dragon Lord was too strong and had many experts under his command. At this moment, he could only use this method to interfere with the other party and prevent the dragon clan from subduing a large number of experts. Otherwise, a peak rank seven expert like the iron-eating Supreme Emperor might have a chance of breaking through to rank eight when he reached the Dragon Lord's side!Although Black Tiger and the others didn't understand this, they also felt that Red Moon sovereign had killed a venerable sovereign of the iron-eating race. There was no chance of subduing her. Black Tiger roared,""Kill them!""No need to hold back!"Initially, he had wanted to hold back a little and see if he could suppress them. But now, it seemed like ... He could only kill them."I surrender!"Right at this moment, the world Overlord let out a loud roar. Clearly, he was also afraid.Seeing that a venerable sovereign of the iron-eating clan had been killed, the other party was also worried that he would follow in their footsteps.The iron-eating clan was the boss of the five realms of the demon race. The flying Wolf Clan had two seventh level venerable sovereigns, so they could be considered the second boss. At this moment, the two seventh level venerable sovereigns of the flying Wolf Clan both had two heads. They were two-headed wolves.At that moment, they saw the iron-eating Thearch's madness. It was as if the last of his madness had defeated the seventh-order chaos beasts one by one, but ... There was no hope.The remaining rank 7 iron-eating race member followed the iron-eating venerable Emperor and charged forward. If this continued, they would definitely die even if they entered the encirclement.The two wolves stopped resisting. Soon, one of the two-headed wolves growled,""My brother is willing to surrender!"In the blink of an eye, five of the eight demon clans chose to surrender.One of the three tier 7 metal-eaters had already been killed. The remaining two would probably not be able to survive.The demons 'resistance was obviously very weak.The iron eater Emperor's eyes were filled with ferocity. He glanced at Red Moon Emperor, who was hiding behind the other party. There was only killing intent and hatred in his eyes. It would be fine if he was killed by the chaos race.This human was shameless to the extreme!A level eight venerable sovereign had attacked his clansmen.He should be killed!'I was killed because I was weaker than you.' Iron-eating venerable sovereign didn't hate him that much. 'But you're an eighth rank venerable sovereign. You can kill your own clansmen in a head-on fight. Why did you have to ambush them?'After the sneak attack, he hid behind the Chaos Beast, that was even more shameful!The five major demon clans had chosen to surrender, but he did not care. Since there was no way out, it might be worth it if surrendering could save his life.However, he had never intended to surrender. Now that his clansmen had been killed, it was even more impossible for him to surrender.Behind him, Thearch Black Tiger was already pressing forward.The chaos race's venerable sovereigns were everywhere.The iron-eating Thearch glanced at the clansmen who had followed behind him. At this moment, they were also in a precarious situation and could be killed on the spot at any moment ...He finally calmed down a little from his rage."Red Moon!"At that moment, the iron eater Thearch roared,""I will definitely kill you!" Red Moon sovereign's expression changed slightly. In the next moment, he growled,""Stop it!"At this moment, the black Tiger grabbed nothing. At this moment, heaven and earth shook, and a great Dao universe seemed to collapse. The auras of the two metal-eating race venerable sovereigns erupted, and the void around them seemed to collapse!A seventh-tier great Dao universe exploded!In the next moment, the iron eater venerable Emperor grabbed the remaining venerable sovereign and instantly entered the void. In the blink of an eye, they entered the Thunder region not far away. He was still angry."Hongyue, as long as I'm alive, I'll kill you!"Red Moon sovereign's expression changed slightly!He looked at the chaos thearchs who had stopped and then at the black Tiger. The level eight Black Tiger was very close to the other party, but he actually ... Couldn't catch him. He let the other party explode his great Dao universe and escape?His expression changed.And at this moment, not far away, a person walked out of the chaos as if he was taking a leisurely stroll in a courtyard. It was the Dragon Lord.No one knew when he had arrived.Red Moon sovereign's expression changed drastically as he had not sensed it before.Did the Dragon Lord just arrive? Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  If he didn't just arrive, it meant that the Dragon Lord had a chance to stop the other party. Why ... Didn't he make a move?"Dragon Lord!"The black Tiger Thearch didn't seem to be surprised. He was just a little confused and doubtful. It wasn't too obvious, but he was indeed a little suspicious. Just now, he actually had the hope of stopping the iron-eating Thearch.But ... The Dragon Master's message had interfered with his own, allowing these two fellows to escape.Why?The Dragon Lord only looked into the distance silently. After a long time, he said softly,""So what if he escaped? the world is gone. It's either destroyed by the lightning territory or he escaped to the outer region. Iron-eater is considered a talent among the demon race. After escaping from the great world, he might have a chance of reaching level eight ..."Then, he shook his head and looked at Red Moon sovereign,""If he reaches level eight, he'll definitely seek revenge on you. Be careful these days ..."Red Moon sovereign's expression changed slightly.Damn it!What was the meaning of this?He seemed to have vaguely understood, but he was a little confused. 'You left the iron eater to restrict me and deter me. Aren't you afraid that the iron eater will become a great threat to you?'Was it worth it?Bastard!He seemed to have realized that the Dragon Lord might have deliberately gone easy on them, allowing the two iron demons to escape. But ... Just to restrict him?'Damn bastard.'He cursed in his heart. He had wanted to kill an expert of the iron-eating race and let the iron-eating Emperor fight to the end with these chaos beasts. In the end, the iron-eating Emperor had escaped. Now, he was the one in trouble.The iron-eating venerable Emperor was not a weakling. Although he was only at Level Seven and did not even have a Dao universe now, if he really entered level eight as the Dragon Lord had said ... He would have to be careful in the future!

3354 Chapter 544
"Hongyue ... Now that the five demon clans have surrendered, the Dragon field has no more enemies! You can continue with your work. Help me subdue some human powerhouses ..."The red moon sovereign's expression changed for a while. Without saying anything, he disappeared from where he was.After he left, Thearch Black Tiger couldn't help but ask,""Dragon Lord, why ... Did you let those two escape? Iron-eating is very strong. If we don't kill him, I'm afraid it will become a future trouble!""Restrict Red Moon and stop him from overthinking."This ... The black Tiger felt that there was no need to do this, right?If this Hong Yue dared to disobey him, he would just kill her.He was a little puzzled. In the next moment, the Dragon Lord laughed and transmitted a message."Alright, that's one of the reasons. Second, let iron eater go to Li Hao. He has no other choice but to go to Li Hao! If he doesn't look for Li Hao after entering the Thunder region, the others won't help him either. "This ...The black Tiger couldn't hold it in anymore."Dragon Master, the iron eaters are very strong, and the other iron eaters, venerable Emperor tie han, isn't weak either. This ..."Wasn't this just helping the enemy?Why did he do that?He really did not understand.Since he knew that the other party would go to Li Hao, was it a good idea to send two seventh-rank fighters to him?He didn't doubt the Dragon Lord's actions, but he just felt a little worried."Without the world, iron eater's combat strength will decline in a short time. It won't reach level eight."The Dragon Lord added,"Give Li Hao and the others something to do. Don't think about coming back to cause trouble for us. For now, I don't plan to deal with them. Let them be confused for a while ..."The black Tiger was still confused.Would these two fellows dare to have an internal strife?The Dragon Master thought for a moment and explained again,""You know iron eater. He clearly knew that there was danger, so why didn't he leave? he didn't even think about escaping until we came? Because...To him, the outer region was even more dangerous. "There's a reason why the iron-eating race isn't willing to surrender. A long time ago, the iron-eating race had five brothers who were all extremely powerful. The iron-eating world had a chance of becoming a level eight great world ..." "However, there was one time when a seventh rank venerable sovereign entered the outer region and clashed with the iron-eating race. The other party was not weak and killed two of the iron-eating venerable sovereigns, who were also the brothers of the iron-eating venerable sovereign. Originally, the iron-eating race had hopes of killing the other party to avenge their deaths ..."The Dragon Lord paused before continuing,""After that, I stopped him and let him go. Iron eater has always hated me."Black Tiger didn't know about this and was a little surprised."Why?"He was puzzled again. The Dragon Lord was very overbearing!The iron-eating race was in the Dragon field after all. They shouldn't have been so hostile to each other in the early years. The Dragon Master was a man with great ambition. How could he let the other party Enter the Dragon field and kill two brothers of the iron-eating race?Even if he didn't manage to stop him in time, he shouldn't have stopped the iron-eating Emperor if he wanted to kill the other party for revenge.The Dragon Lord seemed to be lost in his memories. After a long time, he said,""It wasn't appropriate to kill that person back then. The Dragon field had just settled down, and he had a powerful background. If he died in the Dragon field, it would bring some trouble to the Dragon field. At that time, the chaos had just taken root here and hadn't yet established ourselves. Once we kill a seventh rank venerable sovereign, we'll attract one or two eighth rank venerable sovereigns. That'll be troublesome!""This time, I'll spare Shi tie's life ... It can be considered as making up for the choice I made back then ..."Dragon Lord, your meaning is that that tier 7 ... Has a great background?""Yes.""Yes." The Dragon Lord nodded slightly."There are also some Overlord level experts in the outer region. Other than the newly promoted huntian Supreme Emperor, there are also a few peak type 8 experts. There are also one or two type 8 experts under their command, and quite a few Type 7 experts ... The type 7 expert from back then was the descendant of one of the Overlord level experts."He sighed,'back then, I wasn't as strong as I am now. I had just reached level eight and had just gained a foothold in the Dragon field ... At that time, this place wasn't called the Dragon field yet. If tie Shi killed that man and got revenge, it would be a small matter. I was just afraid that he would interfere with my plan to unify the Dragon field ... So I suppressed him and let him go. He's always hated me ..."This was also the first time black Tiger knew the reason behind this.It was no wonder that even after being suppressed for so many years, the iron eater Emperor had never mentioned getting along with the chaos race. He only wanted to fight back.It turned out that there was such an inside story."Then ... Dragon Lord, what you mean is that if iron eater finds Li Hao's group, it might trigger a conflict between Li Hao's group and the chaos Overlord?"Would he?Did the other party still remember this?Even if he remembered, would he take revenge on iron eater?After all, the iron-eating Guild was at a disadvantage.The other party didn't die and had even killed two iron-eating powerhouses."I don't know, but maybe. He was a peak Type 7 expert back then, so he might be a type 8 expert now ..."The Dragon Master chuckled."Now, the square region is in constant turmoil. It must have attracted the attention of some Chaos Overlords. It's fine if they didn't see it, but they saw iron eater walk out of the square region ... Iron eater almost killed him back then. If they can take revenge, why not?""If that's the case ... If Li Hao dares to take her in, he'll have to take on the trouble. According to my understanding of Li Hao, if he really takes her in, he'll have to take on the trouble even if he knows it's troublesome!"

"Take the fire Dolphin, Steel Eagle, and wild bull realms and give them to the human King!""What?"The black Tiger was stunned. This time, it was really stunned.The Dragon Lord didn't say much. He looked at the level Seven monsters who had just surrendered and smiled."All the people of the Three Realms, including all the living beings of the broken iron-eating realm, are to be teleported into the flying Wolf realm!""Because I've reached an agreement with new martial and light. To make them retreat, I need to use three worlds to exchange for it ... I'm too lazy to go through the trouble, so it's better to avoid it. Three sector Lords, do you have any objections?"The three level 7 demons were all silent.Do you have any objections?He couldn't say it even if he did.They had surrendered and originally thought that they could save the world. In the end, the Dragon Lord actually gave it to the human King!The two seventh level venerable sovereigns of the flying Wolf tribe were secretly delighted. In that case, the flying Wolf realm could still be preserved? no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  The Dragon Lord chuckled."The flying Wolf realm is considered the strongest realm among the demons. The iron-eating Thearch has escaped, and the iron-eating realm is in ruins. The two Wolf realm Lords are the leaders of the entire demon race!""There are still some demon realms in the three regions ... There are even some demon macro worlds. There are very few of them, but there are still some. Next, the two of you may have to run around and help me suppress and subdue the demons in the three regions!""With the departure of new martial, the four-sided region will soon be unified!""I don't want the people to be plunged into misery and suffering," the Dragon Master said."If we can live in peace, that's naturally for the best. Whether it's the demon race, the human race, or the chaos race, if we can all maintain peace ... That would be a blessing for the four-sided region!"The two venerable sovereigns of the flying Wolf tribe immediately responded.This matter was not difficult.If the new martial was really going to leave, if the light Thearch didn't leave ... He probably wouldn't dare to move either. Now, there were three eighth-grade powerhouses and dozens of seventh-grade venerable sovereigns on the Dragon Lord's side.This kind of strength was still a force. Even if there were many Grade 7 experts in the three regions, they were not United. Would they dare to resist?At this moment, the Dragon Master looked around and finally looked at Feng Yan with some regret.The fire Phoenix was dead!The fire Phoenix was a very important assistant to him. For so many years, she had helped him with many things, including planting many people and pawns in the three regions. Now, she was dead ...He didn't think too much about it and quickly turned to Feng Yan.""Feng Yan, you know about the situation in the fire Phoenix realm. Your mother must have explained it to you when she was alive. Now that the four regions are about to be unified ... Some of the realms have people planted by your mother. I want you to contact these people to either persuade them to surrender, submit, or exterminate them!""We will only have enough resources to let some experts reach higher levels if we take down the four-square domain!""A level nine venerable sovereign has been born in the outer chaotic domain and is currently unifying the world ... Tianfang world is about to recover in the four-sided domain. This is also a secret land that everyone is paying attention to. They won't give it up so easily ..." Feng Yan nodded. At this moment, there was only admiration.However, after some thought, he still said,"Dragon Lord, when you reach Grade 9, unifying chaos ... It will be a laborious effort. If you are not from the chaos race, there is no need to fight for status. If you are from the human race, the natural Overlord, why do you still need to conquer the world?"She didn't quite understand.Just for power and reputation?As for the Dragon Lord, he had no choice. The chaos race was discriminated against and hunted down in every part of the chaos. If they did not conquer a world, the chaos race could only wander in the chaos and become the targets of the other races.p In addition, most of the chaos beings had their own inner worlds. Killing a chaos being would usually mean an incomparably huge harvest.Therefore, it was necessary for the Dragon Master to lead the chaos race to a place where they would no longer be humiliated and unify the world. However, why did that chaos heaven Supreme Emperor do that?The Dragon Lord didn't understand it before, but now, he had some enlightenment. He smiled and said,""Huntian might not be a true rank 9! He might be advancing towards grade-9 and have probably sensed something ... Actually, there are benefits in unifying chaos. We can establish an order in chaos!""Order ... Is the best way to reach level nine!"Order?Many of the primal Chaos emperors were puzzled.The Dragon Master suddenly sighed."In the eyes of the human race, we, the chaos race, are the most unstable factor in the entire chaos. Therefore ... If we leave the four-sided domain, we will also be the target of the other party!"At this moment, the Dragon Lord's expression changed.At his level, after leaving the dragon world, he discovered that the path of the ninth step had a lot to do with the existence of order.This might be a shortcut that wasn't that complicated. It was so complicated that he had to fuse all the DAOs into one.And the chaos race was the most chaotic existence in the chaos!It was scattered, wandering everywhere, devouring worlds, and relying on the chaos great Dao ...If the chaos race was not exterminated, how could huntian Supreme Emperor establish order?The other party should be stronger than him. Perhaps he had comprehended 7000 or 8000 Dao principles, or even less. However, he had other opportunities. In short, there was a high probability that he was not a true ninth-rank.At this moment, he was subduing everyone in order to establish order and establish his own Dao law system so that he could truly step into the level nine!Many of the beasts of primordial chaos actually didn't quite understand.However, he understood the meaning behind it."Dragon Lord's meaning is that if we want to leave the four-sided region, or if we don't leave, we might have to fight with that rank nine world?" the black Tiger said gloomily.

"Yes,"The Dragon Lord nodded."According to my guess, in the process of establishing order, the other party is not simply trying to unify. Instead, they are trying to achieve the true path of grade-9. If we stop them, we will be cutting off their path ... This is a life-and-death feud! But ... Could it be that my chaos race would be annihilated just like this? Therefore, there will definitely be a battle!"All the beasts felt heavy.Why did a tier 9 enemy suddenly appear?Even if the Dragon Lord said that the other party might not be a true tier 9, since the outer region said so, it was clearly very powerful. Could the Dragon Lord ... Be a match?At this moment, the Dragon Master said,"taking down the four-sided domain is to strengthen ourselves and all of you. On the other hand, it is also to seize tianfang universe. Tianfang universe is a top-notch level nine forging and is extremely powerful. If we can take down tianfang ... Even if we don't reach level nine, we can still comprehend a thing or two." In addition, it's also to prevent the human race from obtaining it. Otherwise, the human race might give birth to a type 9 ..."He then looked at the bright area and smiled.""New martial's human King, Silver moon's Li Hao, these people are all top geniuses born in the square domain. They're all people who aren't willing to be ruled. One side needs to rule the chaos and complete their own path to rank 9, and these thorns of the human race must be dealt with, because these people are the destroyers of order!""Rather than spending so much effort to kill them, why not ... Let them have internal strife!"The Dragon Lord seemed to be confident that these people would come into conflict with the other party.At that time, there would be a good show to watch.The beasts didn't understand, but they felt that it was very powerful. The black Tiger didn't say anything more. Although he felt that giving the three great worlds to the enemy was somewhat helping the enemy, if he wanted to give the two seventh level venerable sovereigns and the Dragon Lord of the iron-eating race to Li Hao, then give the three great Dao universes ... It was fine!It was a bit of a pity, but he also believed that the Dragon Lord would lead everyone towards the light.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.The human King looked into the distance and sighed,""The five demonic realms have been taken down, so fast!"It seemed like only a few died. The Dragon Lord didn't seem to want to go on a killing spree?The human King thought to himself.As for the radiance Supreme Emperor, he was in a dilemma at the moment. The demon Realm was gone. There were five great demon realms and eight seventh-rank Supreme emperors. It was said that the iron-eating Supreme Emperor was not weak. He was at the peak of the seventh rank. Although he was not as strong as the eighth rank, the gap was not big.Was it gone just like that?The Dragon Lord didn't participate.If that was the case ... Once new martial left, light obviously couldn't stop the other party.As the only rank 8 world, the Dragon field would definitely target it."Human King ... Are you really not going to consider staying?""At this stage, if we're not a match, why should we stay? It's more interesting outside!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  Alright!From the looks of it, there was no way to persuade him."Then ... Then if we leave, the human Emperor...The human Emperor...Do you have a way to take my world of light away?" he asked hesitantly. "There is!"The human King chuckled."I'll leave the neo martial world behind. I'll let the big cat bring light away. Naturally, I can leave."Go to hell!The radiance Thearch was speechless. Wasn't this nonsense?At this moment, the human King was looking at him with a smile, as if waiting for him to make a decision. As for the light Emperor, he was extremely conflicted. He was really, really conflicted!A type 8 world!Who could let it go just like that?If he was really willing to let it go so easily, he would not be the current light Thearch. Perhaps he would have long become a powerhouse on the same level as the Dragon Master. Desire, greed, and reluctance were the key to restricting the strong.Even if you knew it in your heart, you couldn't give it up so easily.After a long time, the light Thearch sighed."Then I shall use a Tier 6 world to move the humans from the world of light into it ... Emperor Cang, can you help me carry it?""Of course, no problem!"The human King chuckled and looked at him again.The radiance Thearch felt helpless and said after a long while, "I've managed the world of light for nearly a million years!""Yes, I know." The human King nodded his head."I know. You don't have to say this. Just tell me directly. How are you going to handle this world?"Are you giving it to me?"I won't force you, but if you don't give it to me ... I'll take you out of the outer region and run away. I won't take you to play with me."Light Thearch was completely helpless. In the end, he said with some difficulty, some dejection, and some dejection,"Human ruler, I don't think I can take this world of light away. I can't take it away. If I devour it myself ... It won't be of much use because I haven't constructed an independent Dao domain. Yaoyang, on the other hand, can try devouring it. Perhaps he can enter level eight ..."Beside him, Supreme Emperor Yao yang was pleasantly surprised.That works too!The next moment, however, the light Thearch sighed."But even if Yao yang enters the eighth rank, there's a limit to his combat strength. His comprehension of the great Dao is not as good as mine ..."Thearch Yao yang was speechless!"Since that's the case ... I don't think the human King's inner world is strong enough. If it devours my light, perhaps the inner world can enter level eight. By then, the human King's combat power will be unparalleled ... Perhaps ... He can rival the Dragon Lord?"He wasn't too sure, but at that moment, he made a decision.At this stage, it was not bad to let Yao yang enter the eighth step, but ... Yao yang, this idiot, had entered the eighth step. What could he do?He couldn't change the overall situation!Even if he entered the eighth rank, he would only be the next Wu Shan. Wu Shan was not weak, but the light Thearch knew Wu Shan's strength. He was defeated by the Dragon Master with two punches, but Wu Shan would probably die with one punch.

Similarly, it was the same for yaoyang, who had reached level 8.Since that was the case ... He'd better stay at the seventh-rank with peace of mind!The human King grinned,"is this appropriate?" This is not appropriate ..."The light Thearch was speechless!He was a little speechless.In the eight-order world of the four-direction region, the red sun and the cloud sky had been broken by the new martial. The red moon had been broken by the Silver Moon. Although the light still existed, he would be given to the new martial ...Of the four overlords, in the end, everyone except the Dragon Lord had become a joke.The key was that the human King was still acting innocent after getting an advantage!He was a little helpless and annoyed.Fortunately, in the next moment, the human King chuckled and patted his shoulder.""Old Guang, we'll be brothers from now on, brothers for life! After we get out, I'll protect you. Sooner or later, we'll come back and kill the Dragon Lord!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùYou're the old Guang, your whole family is old Guang.My title is light, not my real name!Meanwhile, the Supreme martial artist beside him was a little distracted. Light ... Still fell into Fang Ping's hands in the end. This guy ... Swallowed light. If his inner world had really broken through to rank-8, would he ... Still stay?As this thought surfaced in his mind, he saw the human King Pat him.""Old Zhang, work hard in the future!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe Grandmaster was helpless. He looked at him and said softly,"Are you that eager to leave?" The human King chuckled, and as he laughed, he scolded in a low voice,""Damn it, it's been a thousand years, more than a thousand years ... I'm tired of guarding this broken place every day!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe Grandmaster was silent for a long time before sighing helplessly,"For more than a thousand years, you've been wandering outside for half the time ... When have you always stayed in neo martial?" "Tsk!" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The human King was disdainful and too lazy to explain. The remaining half of the time was also spent on neo martial arts. It was so annoying.He had to go out and have fun, right?He grinned and looked out of the Thunder region. I'm going to be free!"The inner world will advance, leave neo martial arts, and let old Zhang take my position. Hmm, not bad!He could finally run!As for Zhi Zun, he didn't say anything more. He just felt a little emotional. The human King succeeded because of the neo martial arts and lost because of the neo martial arts. In fact, the neo martial arts had dragged the human King down for the past thousand years. He wasn't the kind of person who stayed behind. He wanted and desired to go out and wander. However, the human King had a responsibility.His responsibility had always revolved around neo martial and never left.Silver moon's Li Hao was perhaps the envy of the human King ... He could run away whenever he wanted to, but the human King could not. He could not run around as he pleased. The neo martial world was special and everyone knew that if he ran around, he could easily cause the neo martial artist to die.And now, the opportunity he had been waiting for was finally here?He looked into the distance at the Dragon field, and the Dragon Lord's face appeared in his mind. Had this old dragon seen through something?Was he deliberately freeing Fang ping so that he could run out and have fun?The Grandmaster had a slight headache. Once the human King was free from his restraints, it would be very difficult for anyone to restrain him. At that time ... There would be no lack of trouble.Then, he looked at the light Thearch ... This fellow could have been given to anyone but Fang ping. He was really ... Asking for trouble.When you get out, you'll know that it's better to give it to your yaoyang to advance his cultivation than to give it to him.At that moment, the Grandmaster was filled with a myriad of thoughts. Beside him, a cat seemed to be eager to try as well. It looked at the Grandmaster ... Should I just leave as well?The Grandmaster didn't say a word, only silently looking into the distance.If you leave after he leaves, will there still be a peaceful day in this world?A cat that said that it did not fight would go fishing everywhere. If you continue to follow Fang ping, this chaos will sooner or later be neo martial's enemy everywhere.

Chapter 3358 The Two Kings Travel Everywhere
(1st, give me a few monthly tickets)At the edge of the lightning territory.A fourth level venerable sovereign was peeking inside.The lightning territory was a very special place within the primordial chaos.Even the four-sided domain's name was only heard of, and no one had ever seen it. Even if the experts of the four-sided domain walked out, they were often not people that ordinary people could see.Furthermore, the experts of the four-sided domain rarely came out.There wasn't much internal or external communication.The four-sided domain was most famous for tianfang world. There were even more legends about this world in the outer domains than in the four-sided domain.Of course, the four-sided domain had once again attracted the attention of many.There was no other reason. A few days ago, a Great war broke out, and hundreds of Level Seven and level eight experts 'auras erupted in the square region, shocking the chaos.Even in the outer region, a level 7 was a peak existence.In many people's eyes, the four-sided domain was actually very small.Such a small place ... Some people were not clear about the situation. They even thought that the square region might be a small region that was a Little Big. There might be a few seventh-rank powerhouses. They did not even know if there were eighth-rank powerhouses.However, last time, the outer area was also shaken.How could there be so many powerhouses in the tiny four-sided region?Tier 7 was as common as clouds!At this moment, the people in the four-sided domain wanted to come out, and the people outside wanted to go in. The cultivators who wanted to come out saw the danger and were unwilling to stay in the four-sided domain. Many rogue cultivators and even the Lords of small and medium-sized worlds chose to abandon their worlds and even devour them. They chose to leave.Taking advantage of the recent peace in the Thunder region, Li Hao's group was not the only one who had ventured out. Some venerable sovereigns had also taken the risk to travel through the Thunder region and head toward the outer region.At this moment, there was a fourth stage venerable sovereign looking around.He also wanted to go in and see what the primal Chaos lightning tribulation was.He was also afraid of being struck to death.Recently, venerable sovereigns had been struck to death, whether they were outside or inside. They had all died miserably.Many venerable sovereigns were searching around the Thunder region. Some of them were here to Scout out the situation, while others were here to rope in people. Venerable sovereigns from the four regions, regardless of whether they were world Lords or not, were all independent cultivators after they came out because they had all abandoned their worlds.Even a Type 7 was an existence that had abandoned a world. Unless it was a chaos expert, it was best not to bring a world with them if they did not want to be struck to death by lightning. Otherwise, their speed would be slowed down and they could easily be struck to death.Therefore, the powerhouses who came out became individual cultivators. Most of them did not know anything about the outer region. They were often roped in by some people and joined some forces. This was also one of the reasons why many powerhouses stayed here.Now, the chaos was in turmoil. Huntian Supreme Emperor had advanced to rank nine and was going to swallow the world. This was nothing to many experts.However, to some of the overlords, it was a terrible thing.Many overlords were also expanding their forces and territories, trying to swallow the world and strengthen themselves in order to compete with huntian Supreme Emperor. Small and medium-sized forces were also trying to recruit more people to protect themselves or to sell their goods for a good price.In some great worlds, the once-precious spots for venerable sovereigns were now open to itinerant cultivators. There were no longer any restrictions.At this moment, Imperial venerable Kang Han was still looking around and was somewhat eager to try. Should I go in and take a look?It was said that there had been countless casualties in the four-sided domain war. Broken Worlds and broken Dao universes were everywhere. To cultivators, these were treasures. It was said that too many great beings had died in the four-sided domain. A large number of great beings had abandoned the worlds and did not have the time to devour them ...If they were lucky enough to cross over, they would be rich.Of course, it would be a great loss if he died.Just as he was hesitating, his expression suddenly changed.Nearby, a lightning pillar exploded.A bolt of lightning flashed.In just an instant ... With a rumble, the lightning dissipated. In the next moment, under Imperial Emperor Kang Han's somewhat shocked gaze, heaven and earth seemed to be covered, and a world appeared.The world could pass through the lightning territory?Imperial Emperor Kang Han was so shocked that he didn't even have the time to be shocked. At this moment, he only had one thought ... Run!The great world!He could sense that it was a great world. A top expert from the four-sided domain had escaped with a great world.He was only a rank four, but he had encountered this person here ... Although most of the experts in the four-direction domain had escaped and didn't dare to rashly cause trouble, if a major world encountered him and directly killed him, he couldn't do anything.Just as he was thinking about it, he suddenly became extremely frightened. He realized that he seemed to be enveloped by something.Dao domain?Yes, it was a Dao domain!There was a high-level expert who had his eyes on him!He was terrified.In the next moment, his body unconsciously flew towards that great world.The next moment, it landed in a Palace filled with the power of lightning. This ... Seemed to be a Thunder-elemental great world. That's right, to be able to travel through the lightning territory, he was most likely an expert from a Thunder-elemental great world.He looked over ...His body was extremely stiff.There were not many people in the hall, but ... But ... He could not see through any of them. All of them seemed to be ... Advanced venerable sovereigns?How was that possible?Could this be a rank eight world? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  However, from its appearance, it was at most at the seventh rank.The Thunder World had just advanced not long ago, and the great path universe had entered level eight. However, the world itself was actually at the intersection point between Level Seven and level eight. At this moment, it could not be considered a complete level eight world."Kang Han from kangxin world greets the seniors ..."Kang Han was cautious and at this moment, he was trembling with fear.He had never seen a level Seven cultivator from the four regions before. At most, there were some level five or six venerable sovereigns. However, even if they encountered a level four venerable sovereign, they would not attack.

Chapter 3359 The Two Kings Travel Everywhere
At most, he would just avoid them.They were all unfamiliar with the place and were afraid of getting into trouble.Moreover, a sixth step against a fourth step, sometimes it wasn't that simple.'My luck is really too good ... So good that Imperial venerable Kang Han trembled a little.'The people inside didn't know much about the outside world. Similarly, he didn't know much about the four-sided domain. At this moment, he only felt that he was finished. These people must be the experts who had escaped.These experts were all very crazy when they were defeated in their own territory.If it had not been defeated, under normal circumstances, how could the great world have fled so easily?"Kang Han?"Li Hao's mind fluctuated for a moment, and he soon laughed. "Don't be nervous. I just came out and am unfamiliar with the place. I just happened to see fellow Daoist nearby, so I invited fellow Daoist to come in and have a seat. I want to ask you some things. I don't have any other intentions. "At this moment, there were not many people in the hall, only Li Hao and his group of top experts.The two eighth level venerable sovereigns didn't say anything.Although they had left the four regions, the Thunderbolt master still controlled the Thunder World and could be considered a top-notch existence in the outer region. At this moment, he could completely leave this place. However, the Thunderbolt master did not mention this.The four-sided domain ... Li Hao would definitely return, and so would they.After all, it was the old lair where they had lived for hundreds of thousands of years.The outer region was, after all, the territory of an outsider."I don't dare, I don't dare ...""If there's anything that the seniors want to ask, feel free to ask ... I'll tell you everything I know ..." Imperial venerable Kang Han said with a nervous expression.Before he could finish, Li Hao frowned.""Thunderbolt master, let's leave this place first. We'll break out of this world with this domain. The commotion is quite big, and someone has probably sensed it."The Thunderbolt master did not say much. He turned to look at Wu Shan."Wushan, you and I ..."It was still very difficult for a rank 8 to move an entire rank 8 world, even though the Thunder World had yet to completely enter the rank 8 realm.It would be much easier if he called Wushan.Wushan was speechless!He turned to look at Sen LAN."Sen LAN, let's go together. Since second cat has brought Sen LAN for you, you're free. You're free anyway ..."I don't think I'm the only one doing the hard work.Sector Lord Sen LAN was speechless!It's just moving a world. Although the Thunder World is big, it's not a true rank eight world. Two rank eight experts moving it is still very fast. Why did you call me?He looked at the empty silence ...Kong Ji was speechless!Why was no one looking at Li Hao?Why are you all looking at me?All of them were dawdling over small matters."Senior daoqi, shall we go together?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùDao Qi was also speechless. Damn it, who was this?What was going on with this group of people? He was a little helpless and didn't say anything. He didn't call for second cat. Second cat was still carrying the orchid world. It was obviously not right to ask others to work.Without saying anything more, the two rank eight and two rank seven venerable sovereigns quickly disappeared.The four experts drove the Thunder World and shifted it, quickly escaping into the distance. The world of Nirvana opened up and was covered by the Dao chess pieces. The five-finger Mountain emerged from the fog Mountain. The clouds and fog shrouded the entire Thunder World.Their auras were completely gone. In an instant, the four great experts drove the world away.At that moment, in the main hall, Imperial Emperor Kang Han was a little shocked.He couldn't see through any of the people who had just left.Were they all advanced venerable sovereigns?If that was the case ... Could it be that this world was really a level 8 world?Li Hao didn't care anymore. He looked at Kang Han and smiled. "Don't be nervous. Let's sit down and talk. It's a little impolite to invite you over.""It's fine, I'm fine ..."Kang Han hurriedly replied. At this moment, he was a little puzzled. This person was the master of this world?It didn't feel like it.On the other hand, the burly man who had just left had a flickering Thunder-elemental aura. He seemed to be the master of the world, and he was a little confused.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äã At the same time.In the area where the Thunder World had just appeared, a few figures appeared in an instant. Their auras were very powerful, and the weakest was at the sixth step. There were even a few seventh step experts.At this moment, after sensing it, some people were a little puzzled. Best novel online free at nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  "Lightning-type power?""Thunder World?""It's said that in the square domain, the Thunder World and Silvermoon joined forces and fought a fierce battle against the chaos race. Many rank seven venerable sovereigns died ... Could it be that the Thunder World has come out of the Thunder territory?""I'm not sure ... But it's possible!""But ... How can a major world move so quickly?""Did you sense it wrong?"The grade 7 experts instantly started conversing.They had some understanding of the four-sided region. Unlike the venerable sovereigns of small and medium-sized worlds, the four-sided region had a universe left behind by a level nine venerable sovereign. The experts paid close attention to the four-sided region. Although they had not interacted much in the past few years, they had still had some exchanges.Some venerable sovereigns had come out of the four-direction region and knew a little about the situation. They didn't know the details, but they knew that Thunder World Master and silver Moon master had joined forces and started the war in the Dragon region after the Dragon Master left.Soon, the group of experts began to investigate and frowned.A great world that originated from the four regions still had to be taken seriously. A high-level venerable sovereign was not like a mid-or low-level venerable sovereign. It could often change the situation of a great world. Moreover, there might be more than one seventh-rank venerable sovereign in the Thunder World.It was said that the Silver Moon King hadn't reached the 7th rank yet, but he had the power to kill 7th rank experts.He wasn't too sure about the details, but he knew that there were at least two powerhouses of the seventh step on this side. One of them was the Thunderbolt master, and the other was Li Hao."Did he not bring the world out, and only the Thunderbolt master came out?"Someone asked. Perhaps the venerable sovereigns of the Thunder World had just come out and were not the Thunder master.Otherwise, unless there were chaos beasts, it would be very difficult for the human race to escape with a great world. If it were that simple, the powerhouses of the square domain would not be so conflicted about not being able to escape with a great world at any time.
