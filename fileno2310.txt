This was the most powerful monster plant in the entire Silvermoon!A monster plant at the peak of the Saint path!At this moment, a man and a tree were facing each other. They asked each other questions, but neither was willing to answer the other."Senior, if we continue to be in a stalemate, you might overflow!""So what?"The sword tree sneered,"I'm already half-dead and half-alive!" If I hadn't seen the return of the starry sky sword ... Do you think I would have bothered with you?"After saying that, he sneered and said,"it's also because the starry sky sword has returned ... I think you're one of that beast's men, right?" The starry sky sword was taken away by him in the past ... Now that it has returned, it seems that he has found a way to control it!""Li daoheng?""I was right, wasn't I?"p The sword tree sneered,"many years later, what's his purpose in sending you here?" Are you worried that we're not completely dead? Or is he telling me that he can control the starry sky sword ... What a ridiculous fellow!"Li Hao laughed, li daoheng? Does senior think I'm Li daoheng's successor? That's right ... The starry sky sword, the Li family bloodline, the sword intent of the sword Saint ... Li daoheng has all of these!"It was normal to be suspicious.This was the place where venerable sovereigns were sealed!Could normal people enter this place?Li Hao chuckled."It's very difficult for me to prove it ... No matter what I say, senior might not believe me ... How about this, I'll explain it casually. Li daoheng is dog shit. His whole family ... Forget it, I can't scold him. I have a good relationship with the ninth master, Li Daozong. I won't scold his whole family ... Li daoheng's life is worse than a pile of shit ..."Li Hao's so-called defense was to scold li daoheng from head to toe."This guy doesn't like humans. He likes to have sex with all kinds of disgusting creatures ... For example, the moon. He even F * cked the moon ... It's inhumane ...""Also, if li daoheng has any descendants, they'll all be the kind without an * sshole ..."‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùOn the other side, the shadow was shaking.Vulgar!This person ... Was he one of li daoheng's men?Just as Li Hao had said, it was very difficult for him to explain anything. Whatever he knew, li daoheng knew.It didn't mean anything!According to the sword tree, li daoheng was indeed the one who had brought his greatest reliance, the starry sky sword. Now that Li Hao had brought it back, it was hard to explain.Passing through the venerable sovereign's sealed area was not something that ordinary people could do.Perhaps li daoheng was the only one left.How could he not be suspicious?Even Li Hao would be suspicious!Scolding him didn't prove anything, but Jian Shu could more or less be at ease. Would a proud person like li daoheng allow a junior to insult him like this?Would his successor dare to scold him like that? The contempt, disdain, and ridicule that came from his bones ... Were actually very difficult to disguise!The sword tree phantom lowered its guard slightly."How did you get into the eight trigrams Formation?""The starry sky sword brought me in!""I know. I'm asking you how you passed through the sealed area of the venerable sovereign and entered sword city ...""I came here like this ..."

When he came back to his senses, he was greatly shocked!Li Hao, who had been far away from it a moment ago, was now right in front of it.Li Hao laughed,"that's how I got in!" I had people forcefully attack the seal, create turbulence, and hide in the starry sky sword. Do you believe that I used this method to teleport here bit by bit?"The sword tree trembled."Is this ... An illusion? or what?""I can't say."The sword tree was silent.This method ... Was too powerful!Of course, it was also an experienced and knowledgeable person, so it quickly composed itself and said,""What is your purpose in coming to sword city?""Find treasures, find things, find ways to kill the venerable sovereigns, kill li daoheng, and take the Silver Moon world!""You're thinking too much. There's nothing left. Sword city was destroyed, and I'm the only one who's struggling on my deathbed. I've left behind a very weak source, and after 100000 years, I've recovered a little ... Now, I might not even be as strong as an undying ... What can you find to deal with them?"He was a little disappointed and depressed."Where does venerable sword live?" Li Hao asked with a smile.‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao laughed and said,"don't think about it. If I was sent by li daoheng, I would definitely know." 'I don't know, which means he didn't send me. He might have already searched me, so what's the point of me searching again?' Of course, if they were not on the same side, they might be able to comprehend the sword essence left behind by the sword venerable! My sword intent was all learned through the eight trigrams Formation's Phantom image, so it might not be authentic!""Venerated sword used the sky as his blanket and the earth as his bed. He spent most of his time cultivating under my body tree ... Where did he find a place to stay!""So miserable?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao laughed,"it seems that I've really gained nothing!" By the way, the one who massacred the Li clan was indeed li daoheng, right?""It's him. ""What was his combat strength at that time?""Heavenly King.""You're at the peak of the Saint plane and have been comprehending the sword will of the sword Saint, but you can't beat him? Even if he was a Heavenly King ... He should have just advanced, right? If he had advanced a long time ago, Sword Saint would have taken him away. I think he only broke through to Heavenly King the moment Sword Saint left and the Stargate was sealed ... You're an old peak Saint, but you can't rival a newly-advanced Heavenly King?"The sword tree was silent for a moment before it said,"just as you said, he only broke through after venerable sword left. He's only in the early Heavenly King stage ... His realm isn't very stable yet. However ... I really couldn't beat him!" At that time, he was the only Heavenly King in the city, and I was the first one to be defeated by him ... After that, he massacred the entire sword city!"

"Why did he kill the Li family?"Li Hao was curious."He's also a member of the Li family. After venerable the sword left, as long as he doesn't expose his betrayal, sword city shouldn't have found out. He can make the Li family work for him. With the Li family around ... Perhaps we can kill the venerable sovereign earlier ...""With his intelligence, I think you guys might not have noticed anything unusual until he attacked you!""You seem to know him very well. Have you seen him before?" Jian Shu sighed."We've met once. It happened in an instant. I'm not sure if it's true.""Then you understand him that well?"Jian Shu was a little suspicious. Li Hao smiled and said,""It's normal. A smart person likes to figure out another smart person's thoughts. It's just that ... I still don't understand why he wanted to slaughter the Li family.""I don't know,""You don't know?""If I had known ... Would I have been killed by him?"Li Hao thought for a moment and felt that it made sense.Li Hao didn't say anything else. He waved his hand, and a chair appeared out of thin air. He sat down and smiled."Senior, let's sit down and chat. It's rare to meet a living ...""Who are you?" Jian Shu asked after a moment of silence."I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Li Hao, a member of the Li family ... Of course, I don't know if I'm Li Hao or not! The starry sky sword is my ancestral sword. The world has been sealed for 100000 years. 21 years ago, the world started to recover, and I was born in that year! Four years ago, my parents died in the Silver City! A year ago, I stepped onto the path of martial arts and began to take revenge. I conquered the world, and now I have some small achievements and control the Silver Moon world!""Not long ago, after I killed a group of Saints and Heavenly Kings, I felt that the world was so big that there were still many enemies. I was no match for them, so I wanted to enter the seal and look for other opportunities ... Then I came to the Silver City."The sword tree listened quietly.A year ago, he had stepped onto the martial path. A year later, he had taken control of the world and killed Saints and Heavenly Kings ... The other party was indeed very strong.But ... This heavenly record still shocked it.Of course, there was also one person who was unrivaled in the world for three years. He was the new martial world's King."The new generation's proud Son of Heaven?"Jian Shu mumbled,"descendant of the Li family ... What other descendants do the Li family have? other than Li Daozong, there's only li daoheng ... But the starry sky sword is with you. Perhaps it's just a switch of the sword venerable's will. The sword eye ... It's most likely because of the starry sky sword. You're not a descendant of the Li family. If you can be considered one ... You can only be considered a descendant of the starry sky sword."‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùGo to hell!Li Hao didn't want to curse!But at this moment, he still wanted to curse!You are the descendant of the starry sky sword!Why did these words sound so unpleasant?As a civilized person, he felt that other than people like Ying Hongyue and Li daoheng, he was even polite to Zheng Yu. However, this tree was simply asking for a scolding!"You ..." The sword tree quickly said,"you are The Prodigy of this era. Has heaven's will been born in this generation?""Yes,""You're a liar!""What?""I can't sense any heaven's will on you ... This place also belongs to the Silver Moon! If you're the Son of heaven's will, you shouldn't be like this ..."Li Hao was stunned and laughed,"so you're talking about this?" I used to be, but not anymore. I cut a part of heaven's will last time, and now heaven's will won't kill me. Even if it's being polite to me, can it still continue to love me?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThese words did not sound very reliable!However, after thinking about it, Jian Shu realized that everything was possible.After all, he was not an ignorant person. The tree planted by the sword venerable had a wide range of knowledge.Anything was possible with such a person."You want to deal with that bastard li daoheng?""Of course!"  Best n0vel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã ùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìã‚ÑØùìÅùí∑ùíæùìÉ "It's very difficult ... He's also a peerless genius, although I want to kill him immediately! But let me tell you, in 100000 years, this person is at least a half-step sovereign. Not only that ... He has been planning for many years, and he may become a venerable sovereign at any time! Of course, if his origin is severed ... Even if he becomes a venerable sovereign, he won't be as powerful as a true venerable sovereign. However, at that time, he will no longer be a half-step sovereign, but a fake venerable sovereign ... An existence even more powerful than a half-step sovereign!""I know!" Li Hao nodded."Then you ... Still want to fight with him?"Li Hao said helplessly,'senior, what are you saying? even if I don't fight with him, he won't let me off! He brought out the starry sky sword and modified my bloodline generation by generation so that I could adapt to it and control it. He must have a purpose! It's nothing more than controlling heaven and earth, controlling the new Dao, controlling the Stargate ... In short, he must have his own ideas. Otherwise, why would he leave the starry sky sword behind?""You're very smart ...""It's just a normal guess, and that's considered smart?"The sword tree was struck and was speechless for a long time.Li Hao continued,"senior, you probably still don't trust me. That's normal. However, you're about to die. There's probably no hope of revenge!" Do you want to bet? If you bet, then let's continue chatting. If you don't bet, there's no point in wasting time! If you lose, senior won't lose anything, because you don't think anyone can beat that guy!""If you win, I can kill him, and you'll win big! Are you willing to bet?",m Li Hao was straightforward. Who had the time to gain your trust?There was no time!Besides, how can we gain your trust with just the two of us?Please you?Would it work?Not at all!Getting straight to the point, choose one of the two, are you going to bet or not?This tree must have grasped something. The reason why he felt this way was because this tree had a strong desire to live, just like the Emperor guards. Why did the Emperor guards have to protect the emperor's palace?And this tree ... Must have something that he couldn't let go of, or else he would definitely die!Then, Li Hao added, also, he must have cut off your great Dao of origins! Even though the great Dao was broken, you still managed to survive. Although I'm too lazy to guess, I still guessed that there must be a treasure left behind by the sword Saint in your body to save your life! Perhaps senior is protecting this thing ... Of course, this is just a guess. "Li Hao continued,"this city can still function. It didn't fall apart because of everyone's death. Perhaps ... There are some treasures that stabilized this city!" "In addition, if senior really has no one to rely on, if you really have no way, then when you see me now, regardless of whether I was sent by li daoheng or not, you should grab onto the last straw to save your life. Senior might not have any, but you've tested me quite a bit. It seems like you still have something to rely on!""I've already said that I've killed a Heavenly King, yet you're still so indifferent. Could it be that the city has a way to deal with a Heavenly King? Of course, he's the Heavenly King now, not the one from back then. Otherwise, he'd have to deal with li daoheng!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao looked left and right, judged for a while, and pointed out the suspicious points. In the end, he said,""There might still be living things in the city, and it's not just you. You've been waiting for a long time. Perhaps you're waiting for the living things to come and meet you. Perhaps you want to capture me!"Li Hao sat comfortably, even leaning against it. He smiled and said,""Don't waste your time. You're not good at dealing with enemies, but you have many means to deal with your own people. Why bother?"The sword tree did not say a word!The young man in front of him didn't look like a young man at all. He was like an old monster!"Why should I believe you?" the sword tree asked after a long time.Li Hao laughed."No reason. I've said so much that you won't believe me even if I kill a Heavenly King in a year ... If you can find a second one, then go!" If I can pass through the venerable sovereign's seal and you can find the second one, you should go and find one as well. Otherwise, I won't be able to make you believe me!"At this moment, it was Jian Shu's turn to be conflicted."Wait for a while, I'll think about it ..." He said after a long time."Really ... Forget it, do as you wish!"Li Hao smiled and said,"can I take a walk around the city?" In sword city, is there any other place worth going to?""There is a cliff in the west of the city. Venerable sword once cultivated there for a while. You can go and have a look!" Jian Shu said after a moment of silence."Alright, thank you!"Li Hao instantly disappeared, leaving this place in the blink of an eye.Give him some space!A long time after he left, a broken stone flew over and landed on the broken stump.After a while, an even more broken seal flew over and landed on the tree stump.At this moment, the sword city's Supreme Council meeting seemed to have started.A broken tree, a piece of gravel, and a broken seal.

2312 Chapter 387
(It's so painful to wake up early, being sealed every day)There might be more than one living thing in the sword city.Li Hao had some speculations about this, but he didn't care. He quickly headed to the west of the city.The cliff.At the place where the sword Saint cultivated.He flew all the way out of the city. Li Hao looked around and soon found a place with cliffs.It was a broken cliff.Li Hao flew up.On the cliff, there was a faint sword intent that had not been extinguished for 100000 years, enveloping the entire cliff.It was just ... Different from the Holy Land he had imagined.It was simple.It was very simple.It was just a broken cliff ... Apart from a faint sword intent, there seemed to be nothing special about it.Li Hao walked up and sensed the sword intent in the air. It was not much different from the Supreme Sword intent he had sensed before."The sword tree sent me here ... Just to observe the sword intent left behind by the sword venerable?"It was as if he had come for nothing again.Li Hao revealed a faint smile. It seemed that this big tree really didn't trust him. He had simply found a place to fool him and sent him away.Since he was already here, he would take things as they came.Perhaps Jian Shu still needed to discuss with others on how to deal with him.The city was currently in a state of loathing. Since that was the case ... He would comprehend it first.He sat cross-legged and closed his eyes, allowing the faint sword intent to wash over his body. The somewhat sharp sword intent stimulated his pores to shrink.However, after experiencing the suppression of the blood Emperor's saber, this bit of sword intent ... Did not make Li Hao feel any pressure."The cultivation of a sword venerable ... Doesn't seem to be anything special ..."Li Hao suddenly thought of something. His heart moved. Suddenly, his body emitted a faint energy that was so special that no one could see it.It was as if time had frozen at this moment.The power of time!Li Hao only had a slight grasp of the power of time. At this moment, he suddenly remembered that there was still sword intent left here. It was the result of venerable sword's cultivation, and it had lasted for a long time.If he could turn back time, would he be able to go back to the time when venerable the sword cultivated?Of course, that must have been 100000 years ago.Turning back time by 100000 years ... Even the star in the Dao universe couldn't do it, let alone Li Hao. Li Hao had no doubt that time couldn't be turned back. Time could be frozen. In fact, only the time in this area could be frozen. Unless the entire great thousand universe was frozen, time would still pass in the areas that were not covered.Turning back time was even more impossible.However, one could use the power of time to capture some of the afterimages of the past. Some top powerhouses could actually use some means to go back to the past. Such powerhouses all had the ability to reach the heavens and the earth, especially in an era where time had not been controlled. Only the true ultimate powerhouses could do it.Li Hao couldn't do that.However, he wanted to try and see if he could use the sword mind of the sword venerable as a medium to capture some scenes of the sword venerable's cultivation.The power of time covered the sword intent.The flowing sword essence instantly stopped.In just an instant, it began to flow again.Li Hao could now freeze a Saint for a few seconds and a Heavenly King for an instant, but this sword intent ... Even if it was not powerful, it was as difficult to freeze as a Heavenly King. It was clear that even if it was just a little bit, the difficulty of freezing a venerable sovereign's sword intent was beyond imagination.Li Hao's weak power of time ... Would probably be of no use against a real venerable sovereign.Li Hao wasn't dejected.He continued to try to reverse the flow of the sword intent bit by bit. He didn't know if he could capture some afterimages or even images. Since he had nothing to do, he would just take it as familiarizing himself with the power of time.He didn't dare to use the blood Emperor's blade as it was too powerful!But this little bit of sword essence ... Was still bearable.The sword intent flowed, but very quickly, it solidified again.Every time Li Hao used this power, it would last for a very short time. He needed some time to recover after each use. He could not release it infinitely. If he could, it would be incredible!  Best novel online free at‚Äã ùïüùï†ùïßùïñùïùùïìùïöùïü  He tried again and again.The sword intent was frozen, and the sword intent was flowing. The freezing and flowing kept alternating.Since he couldn't comprehend anything, he decided to use venerable the sword's sword consciousness as a test subject. Li Hao didn't dare to try it out.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Mcmau sub-academy.In the back garden.A tree, a stone, and a seal were communicating with each other.Very soon, the exchange seemed to have ended.The shadow of the sword tree looked to the west of the city."He's still there. Should I call him over?"As for the cliff in the west of the city, whether or not Li Hao could comprehend anything ... Comprehension my ass.Venerable the sword had cultivated there before, but there were many places for him to cultivate. If he could gain enlightenment in every cultivation place, there would be countless experts in the world.In sword city, countless people had been to the cliff ... But it was useless. Besides a little sword intent, there was nothing else.Other than feeling a little powerful, there was nothing else.He had sent Li Hao there so that he could leave the main city first.A muffled voice came from the rock,'wait for him to come himself! This person ... It's hard to say for now. The cliff in the west of the city doesn't have many benefits, but after staying for a long time, he's covered by the sword will of venerable the sword. The sword will has the effect of killing demons and driving away evil. Maybe we can judge whether this person's personality is good or bad ...""A true expert will not be easily affected by sword intent.""He's not a true powerhouse yet ... Even if he killed a Heavenly King, he's only in the Saint realm!"

2313 Chapter 387
The Saints of the past were powerful, but they weren't top-notch existences.All of you are experienced and knowledgeable people, so you don't think this is a top-notch expert.For this reason, the three of them did not call Li Hao back.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶On the cliff in the west of the city.Li Hao had a lot of fun. It wasn't exactly fun. It was also a kind of training. Training wasn't bitter or hateful. Training came from one's heart and passion. Pure training was actually very boring.He realized that he did not go back to the time when venerable the sword had cultivated ... It was normal. It was just a thought and he did not really have to do it.  Best novel online free at‚Äã ùïüùï†ùïßùïñùïùùïìùïöùïü  But at this moment, Li Hao had also gained something unexpected.The overflowing sword essence was constantly solidified, flowing, solidifying, flowing ...At this moment, the originally thin sword essence had actually become rich.The sword intent here seemed to be constant.However, as Li Hao continued to freeze and flow, the sword intent became more and more intense and began to gather. At first, it only hurt his skin, but now, the flowing sword intent could actually Pierce his skin!"This works too?"Li Hao mumbled,"if I repeat this process endlessly and accumulate sword intent, won't I be able to restore the Supreme sword's attack?"Of course, at that time, he might be killed by the sword intent!But ... Li Hao seemed to have discovered something incredible.'If I continue to gather sword intent, will I be able to gather a powerful sword intent that I can control ... With my current strength, if I use the starry sky sword to bear it, will I be able to absorb one and kill the sword intent of a late Heavenly King with one strike?'The premise was that ... The sword intent here could really become stronger and stronger, and not be depleted so quickly!"If this sword intent is continuous, there's still hope ... I'm just afraid that after I gather it for a while, the sword intent will completely dissipate. By then, there'll be no more fun!"How much of the sword mind of the sword venerable was there?After 100,000 years, how much was left?He did not know.However, he could try. The premise was that the starry sky sword or his physical body could accommodate it. Otherwise, it would only bring him trouble.At this thought, Li Hao took out the starry sky sword and slowly touched the sword intent.The starry sky sword trembled slightly, as if it was excited.It was a familiar sword intent!When the longsword came into contact with the sword intent, the sword intent did not burst out in a targeted manner. Instead, it flowed slowly like a small dragon of spirit Qi, circling the longsword. It seemed to be somewhat familiar, and gradually, it started to circle around the starry sky sword.Li Hao's eyes lit up!As expected!After all, it was the sword of the sword Lord. He was familiar with the sword will of the sword Lord and could still accommodate it. If it were other weapons, there was a high probability that he would not be able to do this. Li Hao was overjoyed, as if he had discovered something extraordinary.If the sword intent of the sword Saint could ... Then ... What about the saber intent of the blood Emperor?Of course, the blood Emperor's saber intent was stronger mainly because his weapon was very powerful. It was constantly emitting pressure. He couldn't take the weapon away, and he had nothing to carry it ... No, it was the word 'heaven battling'!Li Hao suddenly thought of something.Perhaps, he could give it a try when he returned."It can actually continuously gather power ... Interesting. The power of time can be used in this way?"As if he had discovered a new continent, Li Hao kept trying. At this moment, he even forgot about the sword tree.He had come here to strengthen himself.As for whether it was the help of the sword tree or he had thought of a way ... The purpose was the same. Since it was possible to gather a powerful sword here, or even the complete sword of the sword venerable, it was an opportunity for him to use it or to comprehend it!Thus, Li Hao continued to solidify his sword intent. While he solidified it, it was only in a small area, while the other areas seemed to continue to generate sword intent and converge ...Just like that, the sword intent surrounding the starry sky sword became stronger and stronger!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Mcmau sub-academy.Just like that, the three defeated soldiers ... Waited with complicated feelings."Playing hard to get!" The stone said in a muffled voice.The giant seal replied,"it's just a test of our patience. He probably thinks that haste makes waste. But he didn't think about it. We've waited for 100000 years. How can a young man like him last longer than us?"Jian Shu thought for a while and nodded."There's no hurry. It's only been a day. There's no chance at all at the cliff ... If he's willing to endure with us, then we'll endure it together. We can't take the initiative to find him, otherwise ... We'll seem impatient!"‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The next day.Li Hao still hadn't come.The stone gate was a little annoyed,"boring!" I'm made of stone, and I'll change the world whenever I sit down. Who would care about a day or two?""He's even more anxious than us!"The big seal echoed."It's been two days. Why don't we ... Forget it and wait a little longer?"Jian Shu hesitated.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶On the third day.The stone stopped talking. "Could he have realized something?" the giant seal asked.The sword tree was conflicted."There's nothing there. If there were opportunities there, countless experts would have been born in sword city!" In the past, the sword Saint himself had said that there were countless places for cultivators to cultivate. The place with real opportunities was not the place for cultivation, but the place for enlightenment! During the period of enlightenment, the will of the Dao would overflow, and only then would there be the true remnants of the great Dao ... That was the so-called Daoist field! Otherwise, if an expert were to cultivate as he pleased, wouldn't every place be a Holy Land? The broken cliff is just a move and a remnant of the sword essence. It's almost useless against those above the immortal level ... It's just a reference!"You've been in a useless place for three days!

Chapter 2314 Longevity Sword Intent (3)
That place would definitely not have any opportunities, it guaranteed!It was said by the sword Saint himself. How could he not know about it? how could he let you find the opportunity? wouldn't that be a big joke?"Shi TOU, go and investigate ...""Me?""You were born with a reserved aura. Look from afar and see if he's still there ...""It's definitely there!" "If I tell you to go, then go!"The sword tree was angry, and the stone was helpless. In a flash, it disappeared on the spot.At the West Gate.When the stone appeared, he looked around and saw a young man sitting cross-legged on a cliff in the distance. He didn't move at all ... He ridiculed the young man secretly but put on an act!Let's see who can last longer!We're not in a hurry!They had already waited for 100000 years, and they were in a hurry for a few days?He wasn't in a hurry!The next moment, the stone disappeared.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.On the cliff, Li Hao was extremely excited. The starry sky sword kept trembling, and a gradually rich sword intent kept wandering in the sword. The sword seemed to be particularly excited!Li Hao's face was also deathly pale. After constantly using this energy, Li Hao realized that ... There seemed to be some disadvantages.He had used too much of it. It might take three to five years, or even ten to twenty years, to gather so much sword intent ... But at this moment, he had gathered so much in three days, and the time he had saved during this period ... Seemed to be reflected on Li Hao.To put it simply ... The ten to twenty years of accumulation was actually consuming Li Hao's own lifespan!It was equivalent to him waiting here for ten to twenty years!"I see!"Li Hao mumbled, feeling even more delighted. This was normal.Otherwise, if this kind of power was really mastered to the extreme, it would be too terrifying. If it was used without limit, wouldn't it be possible to freeze people for 10000 years if he wanted to? but to freeze people for 10000 years ... Perhaps he would suffer an extremely serious backlash."It's alright ... It's just ten to twenty years of lifespan ..."Now, even Li Hao himself didn't know how long he could live.If the true body entered the river, he would be able to live for as long as the river could live.As for the exact time ... Who would know if he wasn't killed?Li Hao didn't dare to say that his lifespan was unlimited, but he felt that he could definitely outlive those Saints. The Saints could survive for 100000 years, so how could he?At this moment, the sword intent in the sword was getting stronger!Li Hao's eyes were bright!It was worth it!Without saying anything, he discovered a little bit of the power of time, which was a huge gain. At this moment, Li Hao felt that the sword intent that he had gathered might be even stronger than his full-power attack!Moreover, it was extremely pure, and even contained some of the power of a Sword Saint!Such a sword might even be able to kill a fake Heavenly King ... And it was referring to the Heavenly Kings in Thunder City.It had only been three days!What if I continue to gather them?However, the sword essence that was born seemed to be thinner. It seemed that the sword essence here was not endless. The sword Saint had cultivated here before, but it might not have been for a long time.Perhaps, he would be able to gather his sword essence faster if he found the next place of cultivation for the sword venerable. However ... Let's finish gathering all of them here first.Li Hao ignored the sword tree and continued.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the blink of an eye, seven days had passed.At the West Gate.A stone, a tree, and a seal appeared at the same time."He's stone!"Shi TOU said gloomily.I'm not.I've run back and forth seven or eight times, but that person hasn't moved even once.In fact, they were very patient and patient ... But that was on the premise that Li Hao had never been here. When the city was dead silent, they had no choice but to wait.However, Li Hao had come, and ... He had even said that they would cooperate and help them kill their enemy.Although he rejected her verbally, he was actually tempted.In the end, a certain man, like a scumbag, confessed to you and proposed to you. You said you would consider it, but he ... There was no news from you!That kind of pain was indescribable to outsiders.You can't take the initiative to go to my house and ask. You said you wanted to propose and I agreed. Why aren't you coming?At this moment, the three of them were just like these women.Li Hao had confessed and proposed ... And then he didn't care about them anymore, making them suffer more. If you didn't confess, would we have been moved?But you scumbag, you've already proposed, why are you still pretending to be a Saint!The three broken soldiers were all furious.

Bah!Let's see who can last longer.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Seven days.Li Hao looked more Haggard than seven days ago. His eyes were tired, but he was in good spirits.At this moment, the starry sky sword was trembling.The sword intent that was spreading out in the surroundings seemed to have all been gathered and extracted.In the past, the reason why the sword intent did not dissipate and did not die out for a hundred thousand years was because it had been circulating.However, at this moment ... The cycle was broken and it was extracted by someone.Seven days was equivalent to hundreds of years of Li Hao's time.After all, it was only the place where the sword Saint cultivated, not the sword Saint himself ... At this moment, there was almost no sword essence being born on the surrounding cliffs.The sword intent in the starry sky sword was exceptionally sharp.How strong was he?Li Hao didn't try it, but he sensed it. As soon as his spirit entered the starry sky sword, he felt an unparalleled power. The starry sky sword couldn't even suppress it, and Li Hao could only forcibly suppress it.He felt that ... This sword attack was more powerful than any of his previous attacks!Just like that day, when the venerable sovereign's blood essence erupted!It was the feeling of a Heavenly King-level powerhouse being destroyed in an instant!

2315 Chapter 387
The moon god had appeared that day in person. She was definitely no weaker than the Heavenly King, but she had been destroyed in an instant. If li daoheng had not made a move, she would have been killed.This time ... He felt the same way.Li Hao was ecstatic!Although his strength had not increased by much, he had gained another trump card. Secondly, there were no traps. This was the pure sword will of the sword venerable. He could still comprehend it.He was also a swordsman. He couldn't sense anything from the thin sword intent before, but now ... Li Hao could sense all kinds of Dao intent contained in the sword intent, including destruction, rebirth, and destruction ... It was too complicated!He felt that he needed to study it himself and then use the combination method in the 'Yuan Ping Chronicles' to replace the various sword intents with new DAOs to form this sword and form the true intent of the revered sword!Perhaps, this was the only way to restore what the sword mind of the sword venerable was like.Overjoyed, Li Hao was about to stop.Suddenly ...Crack!Li Hao was slightly stunned. He turned his head and looked ...In the next moment, he rose into the air.Just as it flew away, there was a loud bang.The cliff exploded instantly!Without the support of the sword intent, the cliff, which had already experienced the circulation of the sword intent and barely maintained its balance, instantly exploded and lost its balance.BOOM!With a loud explosion, the broken cliff disappeared completely and formed an even larger cliff.The cliff in the west of the city, the training place of the revered sword ... Was destroyed by Li Hao by accident.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the West Gate.The three of them were still complaining about the heartless scumbag ...A loud noise suddenly came.The three of them looked over instantly. The next moment, stone was surprised."Why did the cliff explode?"That was the place where the sword mind of the sword venerable was overflowing. It couldn't have exploded, right?"Dammit! What did this bastard do?""He couldn't have realized something, right?""Comprehend what? It's just a bit of sword essence ... Did he destroy the cliff on purpose?""I don't think so? With his strength, if he wanted to destroy the cliff, he would have to use his full power ... I didn't feel his power ...""Strange! Did you really get something?"A place that everyone had been to and gained nothing. You, a newbie, had been here for seven days and you had gained any insights?Do you think everyone is a fool?You think you're the only smart one?Li daoheng was smart, wasn't he? it wasn't like he had never been to this cliff before and had gained nothing. Yet, you've already gained something after seven days?Jian Shu concluded,"this bastard, he's trying to intimidate us!" He destroyed the cultivation place of the sword Saint on purpose and told us that this is the consequence of lying to him!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùWas he cheated?He only asked the other party to go to the broken cliff to take a look, and did not say that there would definitely be opportunities. The seal was extremely powerful,'damn it! Regardless of whether it's the place where the sword Saint comprehended the Dao or not, it's still the place where the sword Saint cultivated. How could he destroy it like this ... This person is extremely audacious!"Just as he said that, a seal and a stone instantly disappeared.In the next moment, Li Hao arrived.His smile was extremely bright, but he seemed very weak. However, his spirit was exuberant to the extreme."Senior sword tree, thank you for your guidance! The broken cliff in the west of the city, the Holy Land of the sword Dao, you live up to your reputation!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe sword tree felt that he was mocking!How detestable!At this moment, Li Hao didn't mock him at all."I'm serious. Let me find it myself. I don't know how long it'll take me to find this place. The sword intent isn't too strong, and the city isn't small. It's not easy to find it."What a good person!No, it was a good tree! no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  He had gained a lot this time. The Supreme sword's sword will was secondary. The key was that Li Hao had a better understanding of the power of time. He had been using this energy for seven days.He was much more skilled!As expected, people had to come out for a walk before they could gain insights and gains."However ... I'm sorry. Due to my comprehension and gains, I forgot about the Cliff's existence for a moment ... As a result, the cliff collapsed ..."The illusionary woman transformed from the sword tree said in a cold voice,""No harm! If you have the ability to destroy the cliff, that's your ability!"In its eyes, Li Hao was mocking him!It was a demonstration!He originally wanted to talk, but at this moment ... He suddenly lost interest and said coldly,""Since you've gained something, it seems that you don't need my help anymore. You're able to comprehend something from the broken cliff. With such talent, why do you still need the help of others?"There was a hint of mockery in his words.Don't you have unparalleled talent?You can harvest it from the broken cliff ... Why do you need help from others?"Senior ... Have you misunderstood something?" Li Hao smiled."There's no misunderstanding at all!""I really did gain something ..." Sword tree smiled contemptuously."That's a good thing. Congratulations! If the sword Saint knew about this, he would be shocked that he had a worthy successor! If someone can comprehend something from the broken cliff, the sword Saint will be very pleased!"Li Hao was speechless.As expected, women ... Female trees were unreasonable!Be it a woman or a mother tree, why don't you listen to an explanation?'You didn't even ask if I really got anything, and you decided that I didn't get anything, so you deliberately caused trouble?'Thinking about it this way ... Lin Hongyu was actually a good person. She was never like this, never picking a fight, and never deliberately rebutted.Li Hao didn't say much. With a smile, he summoned the starry sky sword and slashed out!Facts speak louder than words!What's the point of explaining?Let's see the truth with our hands!With one sword, the wind and clouds changed colors!At this moment, the entire sword city seemed to tremble slightly. The rocks and seals that were hiding in the dark trembled and appeared at the same time in the next moment. The sword tree even trembled violently!

2316 Chapter 387
In an instant, three broken existences appeared at the same time to block the attack of the sword intent!BOOM!At first, Li Hao had only wanted to prove himself, but then he saw two things suddenly appear ... All of a sudden, they increased their power. Sword intent overflowed, and the pure Aura of sword Dao suppressed the world with a BOOM!There was a loud bang!A stone, a seal, and a tree flew out one after another with some disbelief and shock. The sword tree's voice was somewhat sharp."Longevity sword intent!"This was the true longevity sword intent!This was impossible!No matter how similar, how talented, and how capable you were, it was impossible for you to have the same enlightenment as the sword Saint.Others might not be able to tell, but as a sword tree that had accompanied the sword venerable in his cultivation, it knew all too well what the true longevity sword intent was like.Whether it was imitation or modification, in short, no one could burst out the sword intent that belonged to the venerable sword!However, at this moment ... It could sense boundless purity!This was the type!Not only that, at this moment, the entire sword city was trembling as if it was extremely excited.The stone and the seal also let out a cry of shock.Longevity sword intent!After 100,000 years, they could feel the extremely familiar longevity sword intent again. How was this possible?Sword Saint?No, the sword Saint had gone out!Who was this person?Even if li daoheng, the monster of the Li family, was also a sword expert, but ... No matter how strong his sword intent was, no matter how similar it was to the longevity sword intent, it was still not the same!Was this person the reincarnation of the sword Saint?It was impossible!The sword Saint was extremely powerful. Outsiders might not know, but they knew that the sword Saint might have ... Solved the problem of not being able to last long. Perhaps, the sword Saint from 100000 years ago was not weaker than a Supreme.Of course, that was just what they thought.After all, they had not really fought.However ... The sword Saint would not die, nor would he reincarnate. Even if he reincarnated, he would not come to the Silver Moon ... So, this person was definitely not the reincarnation of the sword Saint!At that moment, the three powerhouses were completely stunned.Li Hao also quickly put away his sword.He looked at the three of them in surprise.A tree, a stone, and a seal.Seal, it's probably a city Lord seal ... But it seems to be very broken.Stone ... Li Hao took a closer look. It seemed ... Seemed ... Somewhat special. What stone was this?Paperweight?Whetstone?On the rock, sword intent was also surging. In fact, all three of them had sword intent. The entire sword city seemed to be an ocean of swords. Everyone cultivated the way of the sword!And these three were not weak.p In a situation where they were all broken, all three of them might have the battle power of a Saint.To be able to maintain such battle prowess in an extremely weak state was actually extremely terrifying.Sure enough, anyone who had a relationship with venerable sovereigns was not weak.He was a little shaken, but the other three weren't just shocked. They couldn't believe it, and they were even a little crazy."How did you grow the longevity sword?" Jian Shu's voice was extremely sharp."Impossible!""Who are you?""You've met venerable the sword?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao didn't respond to the series of questions. He was silently comprehending something, and his eyes flickered.Sword city ... Had just trembled a little.The moment the sword intent exploded, the entire sword city trembled.What was going on?Li Hao thought quickly. After a long time, he looked at the three excited veterans and said softly,""I told you that I comprehended something on the cliff. You didn't believe me, so I can only prove it to you. Now ... Do you believe me?""That's impossible!"The stone man's voice was like muffled Thunder,"absolutely impossible!" He couldn't sense anything from the broken cliff. Even if he could, he couldn't sense the complete longevity sword, which was almost the same longevity sword essence! You ... Who are you? Don't tell me ... Don't tell me ... You are ...""What is it?" Li Hao smiled."You are ... The clone of the sword Saint?"He could only think this way. He had no choice.It was impossible for the sword Saint to reincarnate!That was a clone? no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  But ... That was impossible!Jian Shu was also a little hesitant,'did you really comprehend the longevity sword intent on the cliff? But even so, the comprehension was one's own comprehension. Who could restore the complete longevity sword? There's a difference ... Don't lie to us and think that we don't understand!" Who are you trying to fool?Li Hao smiled."I didn't say that it was the longevity sword intent. I just used what I've learned. As for what you think is the same, that's your business, right?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe few of them were speechless.He still couldn't believe it and felt that it shouldn't be like this.No matter how talented you are, can you replicate sword intent?At this moment, the stone transmitted a message, Jian Shu, is he the clone of the sword Saint?"Impossible!" The seal interrupted."I suspect ... He's the reincarnation of the starry sky sword?""Bullshit!"The starry sky sword reincarnated ... You're talking nonsense!""Then tell me, how did he do it?""I don't know,"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe three experts were all dumbfounded.He could not understand why this was happening.The sword tree, on the other hand, was calmer. It said,""It's also possible ... It's possible that the sword intent on the cliff gathered and was captured by him. He's holding ... Holding the starry sky sword and has integrated this sword intent ...""That's impossible! The sword intent on the broken cliff could be gathered together? In a mere seven days, let alone seven days, seven years, seventy years, or even seven hundred years ... He wouldn't be able to do it!"The three of you can't understand all this.However, at this moment, her feelings were complicated.In any case, the other party had really used the real longevity sword. This time, some of the things that they had discussed before might have to be changed.Li Hao, on the other hand, was relaxed.Interesting!These three seemed to know a lot.This was not important!The important thing was that these three were so broken. If they recovered to their peak, they would at least be at the peak of the Saint plane, right?Or even ... A Heavenly King?The Heavenly King of this era!If he brought them out, they would at least be three top-notch combat powers!They were both venerable sovereigns who had comprehended countless sword wills, so their offensive power must be very strong. In comparison ... Zhang an, the grandson of a venerable sovereign, seemed to be just ordinary.When these three recovered to their peak, they might not be weaker than Zhang an.Zhang an looked so miserable!The same generation as the human King, the elite of the human race, the grandson of the Supreme Being, how could he only have such strength?He could not understand!It was not too much to get a Heavenly King, right?However, when he thought of the book of the great Dao and the extremely messy and numerous great DAOs, perhaps ... This Division Chief Zhang might not be as indifferent as he appeared to be. Perhaps he was also someone with great ambitions?The will of a Supreme Being, the will of a human King, the will of the blood Emperor ... The will of countless top experts were all integrated into the book of Dao.Did this person also want to reach the heavens in a single step?Who knows!The book of Dao seemed to be of average strength at the moment, but it still had potential. The premise was that Zhang an could merge all these together and not separate them. If he could separate them, he would only be able to kill a few weak Heavenly Kings.Thinking of this, Li Hao smiled.""The three of you, can we have a chat? Or ... Take me to the place where the real sword venerable cultivated? So that the longevity sword could be born again! Now that you've left, you're just a bunch of scoundrels who have tarnished your reputation. Why don't you let me comprehend more of the longevity sword intent and kill all my enemies with one strike to wash away your reputation?"The three experts didn't say a word.After a long time, the sword tree seemed to waver and said,""How did you do it?""I don't think it's a good idea to pry into someone's Secret,"The sword tree was speechless.I know it's not good, but I'm ... Really too curious!Because Li Hao had used the real longevity sword intent, Jian Shu changed his mind. After a while, he said,""Let's go back to mcmau first. You seem to be a little special ... Maybe we can talk about it in detail!"Li Hao nodded. He looked at sword city and suddenly laughed."The sword city seems to be cheering too. The longevity sword will has reappeared!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe three of them ignored him.Li Hao toyed with the Galaxy Sword in his hand thoughtfully. The Galaxy Sword was very powerful, but ... Compared to the saber of the blood Emperor, it was still a little lacking!Although the sword used by the sword venerable was a one-time use, it was said that the starry sky sword was jointly created by the human King and the forging sovereign. They gave it to the sword venerable so that he would not have to change the sword every time!However, the starry sky sword in his hand seemed to have become a little weak.Of course, compared to some Saint weapons and even Heavenly King weapons, the starry sky sword was not much worse.But ... That was a venerable sovereign's sword!He wasn't an ordinary venerable sovereign, but a sword principle venerable sovereign who was known as the number one attacker!Li Hao did not say anything. He followed the three of them to mcmau's sub-college. At this moment, the three in front of him had their spiritual power trembling continuously. They were clearly communicating with each other.Li Hao smiled. It seemed that after using the longevity sword intent, the three of them had changed their minds.

Chapter 2317 The Silver Moon's Secret (1)
In the back garden of mcmau's sub-college.The three remaining experts of sword city didn't say a word. They were all waiting for something.Li Hao was at ease and didn't seem to be in a hurry.This continued for a while. no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  The sword trees still couldn't win against Li Hao, because they were probably even more anxious than Li Hao." 100000 years ago, the Crimson Moon world met the sun god. The master of the Crimson Moon world injured the sun god ... The sun God's power was unparalleled! To be able to injure the sun god, the level of the Crimson Moon world must be extremely high!" Jian Shu didn't mention sword city, but started with the conflict in the neo martial era."Sword Master is in charge of the Silver Moon. He received news that the human King is going to attack the red moon. Sword Master led an Army of tens of millions and recruited the Silver Moon Army. Countless experts followed him and left the Stargate to fight the firmament. They want to destroy the red moon!""Venerable sword just left ... And venerable sovereigns invaded! In fact, there is more than one ... There is also a battle outside the Stargate. There should be many venerable sovereigns attacking the Silvermoon Army. I, Zeng yinyue, saw a venerable sovereign fall!"Jian Shu sneered."Although there were only two venerable sovereigns, venerable sword and Vice-Chancellor Fang, who went out to fight that day, the enemy might not be any less than five venerable sovereigns ... But venerable sword's attack is unparalleled, and his combat strength is unparalleled ... The strong enemy who came to attack will definitely suffer heavy losses!""It's just that ... After all, the arrival was unexpected. In the end, there was still a venerable sovereign, perhaps the weakest one, who entered the Silver Moon world. At that time, the Stargate was instantly closed. Someone in the eight major cities activated the array and closed the Stargate ... The situation outside is unknown, but it is very likely ..."It paused for a moment."It's very likely that the battle was too intense. Perhaps ... The impact pushed the Silvermoon world far away from neo martial!"Li Hao was stunned. Was it the world of Silvermoon that had distanced itself from neo martial arts, and not the people outside who had given up on Silvermoon?Sword tree continued,'there's a high probability that Silver Moon has completely left neo martial because it's too far away from the main world! As a result, he could not connect again. The chaos was too big, and the difference of a millimeter in the universe was a thousand miles! That's why even when the sword Saint defeated the enemy, he couldn't find the Silvermoon world. ""However, several venerable sovereigns have attacked. They shouldn't be able to do anything to venerable sword!""After that, li daoheng became a Heavenly King. With the power of a Heavenly King, he took over sword city at this time of danger and activated the eight trigrams Formation of heaven and earth to seal the world barrier. With Silvermoon, the Stargate, and sword city as the three cores of the formation, and the eight main cities that suppressed the foundation of the world, he suppressed the venerable sovereign!"The sword tree paused for a moment.He seemed to be recalling something.After a long time, he continued."At that time, there were many strong people in sword city, but they were no match for venerable sovereigns ... Li daoheng proposed to call on the eight great families, use the eight divine weapons, activate the eight major city seals, cut off the connection with new martial, and forcibly leave new martial. He wanted to devour the world, kill venerable sovereigns, destroy the red moon, open the Stargate, and help venerable swordsman ..."Li Hao listened in silence.At that moment, someone stood up and thought of a way to solve the threat of the venerable sovereigns. They could even open the Stargate and help venerable sword in the battle ... Logically speaking, they should have succeeded in that era.Obviously, something must have happened in between. Otherwise, a hundred thousand years ago, according to the sword tree, li daoheng might have succeeded then. Why ... Did he not succeed?Li Hao was a little confused.These people had obviously been fooled by li daoheng from the beginning."Failed?""You discovered me?" Li Hao asked."No, I didn 't,"With a light sigh, Jian Shu spoke,"he's very talented and charming. He's a strong person with great leadership skills. In fact, he has the bearing of a leader!" In addition, he was the only Heavenly King in the world at that time ... Or rather, the only Heavenly King in the sword city. He was also very young, so everyone believed in him!""However, in the end, a problem occurred during the merging process ... He couldn't use the starry sky sword!"Li Hao was stunned.Jianshu was also helpless,"no one expected such an accident!" At that time ... There were actually people who could use the starry sky sword. In fact, some people in the Li family could use it! But ... But he just can't use it ... Everyone suddenly thinks, is there a problem?""Only he can't use it?" Li Hao was stunned."Right!"Jian Shu nodded,"of the eight divine weapons, the starry sky sword is the leader and the most crucial one!" Eight divine weapons, eight main cities, eight parts of the world, the core of the formation ... It can be said that everything in the Silvermoon world is related to the eight divine weapons and the starry sky sword!""There's no reason why a genius like him can't use it ... Even the Li family isn't the direct descendant of venerable the sword, let alone those who aren 't. Other people can use it, but when it's in his hands, the starry sky sword won't listen to him!"Li Hao glanced at the starry sky sword in his hand. Was this what he was talking about?Or was it ... Sword city?Of course, he didn't ask.The sword tree continued,"because of this, everyone has more doubts and more awareness of defense. Thinking back, the timing of his Heavenly King attainment was too coincidental. In addition, the venerable sovereign was sealed at that time. Everyone still had time. Someone suggested that we get out of the seal first and think of a way to join forces with the experts of the other seven main cities. Then we can think of a way ...""At that time, li daoheng used the starry sky sword many times, hoping to control it, but he never succeeded. In addition, everyone had to go out ... After that, the internal battle of sword city broke out!"Li Hao nodded. To li daoheng, going out ... Would be meaningless. Everything would be exposed, so it would be better to just kill all the Li clan members.However, he was still puzzled,'I can understand if the Li family can't use it! However, many people in the Li family can use it, but he can 'T. Do you know the reason behind this? Why is that so?"

Chapter 2318 The Silver Moon's Secret (2)
He had the Li family's bloodline, and the sword venerable had even personally taught him sword principle.Could it be that the starry sky sword could pick people at that time?However, at that time, the starry sky sword probably didn't have any spirituality or consciousness. It shouldn't have been like that.The sword tree thought for a moment and said,"we don't know the exact reason ... But when li daoheng slaughtered sword city, he said ... Revered sword ... Revered sword deliberately didn't let him take control of sword city!" Now that I think about it, perhaps the sword venerable had predicted that he was not a good person and had done something to the starry sky sword, making it impossible for him to control it. " Li Hao shook his head."It's unlikely ... If venerable the sword knew that he wasn't a good person, he would have killed him long ago. Why would he scheme against him?" Your hypothesis is not valid!""Don't I know venerable the sword better than you?"Jian Shu snorted."You don't understand swordsmen! Or rather, a true swordsman!"Li Hao still shook his head."Don't think that you're familiar with venerable the sword. From what I know, venerable the sword is decisive in killing. If he knew that li daoheng wasn't a good person, he would have killed him long ago!" He said. It was impossible for li daoheng to show his betrayal in front of venerable the sword. Perhaps he had ambition, perhaps he had brains, wisdom, talent ... Venerable the sword would not care about these things! However, if his heart is not right, then revered sword will definitely be able to see through it. He hid it very well, so before this, li daoheng would not reveal anything. Revered sword would not have found out and left a mark on the starry sky sword!"These people ... Or perhaps these demons, did not understand the mentality of the revered sword artist.Li Hao understood!Of course, he was understanding it based on his own understanding. If it were him, he would definitely not do this. If you had bad intentions, I would just kill you with a sword. Being ambitious was actually nothing.Deliberately leaving some tricks ... It was possible if they were equal in strength, but why did he have to do this when the difference in strength was huge?For example, Qian Wuliang and the others ... They were ambitious, had their own ideas, and had brains.Li Hao wouldn't deliberately leave any tricks to target them.If he really found something wrong ... He would kill him directly.It was that simple!After playing with the starry sky sword in his hand, Li Hao said,""He killed the Li family members and took the starry sky sword with him. Perhaps he was hoping that someone would be able to open the starry sky sword in the future, and even deliberately not use the Li family's bloodline, but an external bloodline. He wanted to try, so why couldn't he use it?""Let me think ... Maybe ... In this process, it wasn't just my family who had the Galaxy Sword! Perhaps he had experimented on many people ... To find a common point!"As for why he couldn't use the starry sky sword ... Who knew?In fact, he couldn't do it in the beginning.Only the secret technique of five birds could do it!The secret skill of five birds was related to the new Dao ...In that case, it was related to the new Dao?However ... Some of the Li clan members could use it, but they didn't master the new Dao. At this thought, Li Hao suddenly asked, did the Li family members who used the starry sky sword have any special characteristics?"Special characteristics?"Jian Shu was stunned,"they are all from the Li family. What are their characteristics?" They all use swords ..."Nonsense!"I mean," Li Hao said."These people from the Li family use the starry sky sword. What do you mean by 'use'?"The sword tree was stunned again,"it's just normal usage!."What use?Li Hao frowned. He had no choice but to make it more clear that the intelligence of monster plants was not very high."I mean, did they use the starry sky sword to display extremely powerful combat power?""No, I didn 't! The starry sky sword is just a symbol ...""Nonsense!"Li Hao's words were impolite!He said directly,'the venerable sovereign's sword is not only a symbol, but also a powerful one! "That's right. If it can really be used, I don't think it's impossible for them to lose to li daoheng. From the looks of it, the so-called use is actually just the right to activate the starry sky sword given to some people by the sword venerable. The fact that these people can use it should be given by the sword venerable, not that they can use it themselves!"Speaking of this, he continued,"in that case, these people who can be used should be the kind of people who occupy the core positions. At the critical moment, it should be the Li family who needs to give orders!" Is that so?" Read m0re at nOŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  "Yes!" Jian Shu nodded after some thought."That's right! In fact, no one can use the starry sky sword, except for the sword Saint himself ... Of course, there's another type of person who can use it, the new Dao!"Li Hao suddenly sighed with emotion,'I ... Somewhat understand now! Perhaps the birth of the new Dao is really related to venerable the sword. He didn't devour the Silver Moon because he had a bigger plan. He wanted to cultivate a new Dao by combining all the DAOs into one!""However, we were not completely successful at that time, and we were faced with war! It's not that li daoheng can't use it, but that the sword venerable didn't grant him such authority. However, once someone perceives a new Dao, he might be able to use it!""This has nothing to do with talent or bloodline.""Li daoheng ... Perhaps he discovered it later on, but it was probably a long time later, even after I could use it. He thought of this and knew that it was related to the secret technique of five birds. And the secret technique of five birds ... Actually already involved some new Dao!"His teacher had gathered all the DAOs from the past and the present and merged them into one. He also had the embryonic form of the Supreme sword's 10000 DAOs as one ... It was very tender, but he had unintentionally merged with the 10000 DAOs as one and formed the five DAOs as one!Thus, the door to the new Dao was opened!The five DAOs combined to compete with the sword venerable ... Was like a Firefly competing with the sun and the moon!

Chapter 2319 The Silver Moon's Secret (3)
However, it was indeed a prototype.At this moment, Li Hao figured out many things. Not everyone could use the starry sky sword. At that time, his teacher should have been able to use it. Later, he learned the secret technique of five birds, so he could use it too!Cultivators who cultivated a single Dao could not use it. It had to be the kind that fused multiple DAOs!If he could think of it now ... Then if li daoheng had been observing all this time, he should have seen it and felt it!He had already known about it, but he needed time to cultivate the new Dao.Many thoughts appeared in his mind, and he connected all the questions that he had in the past.Sword saint's new Dao!The new Dao universe was actually related to the sword venerable. It might have been born 100000 years ago, but it was not perfect and could not even appear ... Because it was too close to the universe of origin, it was suppressed and could not be revealed.Therefore, the sword Saint could not open up such a great path universe! Read m0re at nOŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  If that was the case ... The unification of 10000 DAOs of venerable the sword must have reached an extremely terrifying level. He might be stronger than everyone had guessed. The five venerable sovereigns who had attacked him should not be able to defeat him!However, the Silvermoon world might have run away on its own during the battle, or it might have been knocked out and lost.And the sword venerable wanted to support new martial arts, so he might not have the time to look for it.Perhaps he felt that ... Silver moon's accident was not a big deal, and neo martial arts was more important.As these thoughts surfaced in his mind, Li Hao's expression changed slightly. If li daoheng knew the key to controlling the starry sky sword, why didn't he take it from him?He suddenly said,"the sword city is the true body of the starry sky sword, right?" The starry sky sword in my hands should be closely related to the real starry sky sword ... But it might not be the real one?""The effect might be similar, but in reality, the power is completely different, right?""Li daoheng ... If I'm not wrong, li daoheng might have been to sword city in the past few years, or rather, in the last year!" Li Hao looked at the sword tree and said softly.He looked at the sword tree and said in a deep voice,"let me think. When he came, he might have been ... Very weak. He had started to cultivate a new Dao!" He might have even tried to control sword city in sword city ... Before this, sword city should have exploded with sword Qi a few times ... Sword city shook!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù The three powerhouses didn't say a word, but they were a little shocked."If he was weak, the three of you wouldn't have been able to think of a way to kill him ... That's not right. In that case, there's a high chance that li daoheng has a Dao protector, a half-step sovereign! My body ..."Li Hao guessed for a while and then said, I kind of understand! Li daoheng must have cultivated a new Dao, but he had refined his half-step sovereign power into a puppet to protect him! This person has already understood the crux of the matter, so ... Sword city is a very important part of him!""The sword city is sealed. Ordinary people can't reach this place. Even if they do, they can't take the sword city away!"Li Hao calculated for a moment and said,"however ... He's a meticulous person. It's impossible for him to ignore everything. He must have a backup plan in sword city just in case!"Backup!Li Hao quickly calculated and said in a deep voice,""There must be a place in the city ... The most important place, the core of sword city, which has been sealed by him or planted by him ... It's impossible for you to recover so little in the past 100000 years ... Let me think ... Perhaps the three of you tried to enter a certain place, but were repelled and even suffered heavy injuries!""Therefore, even after countless years, you have not recovered much!"The three of them didn't say a word and let Li Hao say whatever he wanted. At this moment, they were all extremely shocked. Li Hao, on the other hand, continued to gather all the clues.After a long time, he exhaled and said,'this is fate. The new Dao only appeared when the world recovered! During this period, it should have been breeding ... Li daoheng had missed this time. He had no choice but to become an ordinary venerable sovereign ... So he had been waiting! By the time the new Dao appears, this guy might have already understood it. ""But he has too little understanding of the new Dao after all. It was only when we discovered the truth Dao universe that he quickly reacted and thought of the void Dao universe ... Perhaps after I entered the truth Dao universe, he immediately opened the void Dao universe!"Looking at the sword city again, Li Hao said softly,""The starry sky sword in my hand is most likely just a replica ... Or rather, it's only a part of the original body, not the whole! Whether li daoheng seized it or not didn't matter much! The key is still the sword city. The sword city should be the sword of the sword venerable!"At this thought, Li Hao said, so the starry sky sword in my hand may be a key, a key to the real starry sky sword! Also, he also asked me to help him collect the divine weapons of the other eight great families ... And also to help him collect the divine weapons of the eight main cities!""This person is very proud!"Li Hao mumbled,"the key parts of the entire Silver Moon are the eight main cities, the eight divine weapons, the great Dao universe, Red Moon Emperor, the Stargate ... Each of us will collect a part of these things. In the end, what he needs to do is simple. He just needs to defeat me!""From then on, the entire Silver Moon, everything, will belong to him! This way, his achievements will definitely surpass some ordinary venerable sovereigns. Ordinary venerable sovereigns can't have such an opportunity at all ... If venerable sovereigns are also divided into levels, once he succeeds, he may become a top venerable sovereign second only to the human King and the others!"
