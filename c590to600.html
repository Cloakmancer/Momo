iled and nodded,"I know a little!" However, I feel that hou bu should be able to deal with it. It's just a small problem. Hou bu needs to see my value and I'm showing it to them! If the Marquis feels that I'm worth enough, then that's not a problem. On the contrary, if I feel that the Marquis does not have the ability to protect me...I will have to consider whether or not I should continue to stay. "
 Chief Yu's expression was cold,"protecting you is naturally not a problem." It doesn't mean that you can keep causing trouble for the Minister ..."
 "Wrong!"
 Li Hao disagreed and shook his head,"you should know that I'm a Martial Master!" The disciple of old demon Yuan! "As a Martial Master, he accepted the condition of protecting me because he wanted to help me solve these problems ... A true Martial Master would never grow up in a greenhouse! My master is like this, and I ... Am the same!"
 Li Hao looked at chief Yu and said,"chief Yu, you must have been a Martial Master before. I sensed a weak force from you before. It's the power to turn. Since you were a Martial Master who sensed force before, I think you should know better than Hao bu that people like us are born to cause trouble!"
 Chief Steward Yu's eyes flickered again.
 Li Hao, what a man!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He actually felt some aura from her ... It had been so many years that she had almost forgotten that she had once been a Martial Master.
 She looked around again, and after a moment, she said coldly,""There won't be a next time ... You should go back first. I'll solve the trouble here, but I have to remind you that you can't hide it forever!"
 Li Hao laughed,"that's enough!" "It won't take too long. When I've reached the profound spirit stage, if chief Yu wants to see it, I'm willing to show you what a true profound spirit Martial Master is. My teacher has only just reached the initial profound spirit stage, and it's still too early for him to have all five profound spirits. Perhaps ... I'll be faster?" At that time, I think the little trouble today will not be a problem!"
  The five gods appeared together!
 At this moment, Chief Steward Yu's heart trembled slightly.
 She knew about Yuan Shuo. When he killed sun Yifei, two gods were out of his body.
 Where's Li Hao?
 Although Huang Jie wasn't a Martial Master, he was at the peak of the three suns realm. Even if he was slightly weaker than sun Yifei, he wouldn't be too far off.
 Although she didn't see the exact situation, she could make out the general picture.
 Although Li Hao didn't have the strength to kill Huang Jie, he must have fought with him before. This person's strength might only be slightly weaker than his master 's, but he had already surpassed countless martial masters!
 The second person in Silver Moon martial forest?
 At this moment, Chief Steward Yu did not know what to feel in his heart. He was a little depressed, and after a while, he said,""You can go back first!"
 "Many thanks!"
 Li Hao cupped his fists, turned around, and left.
 After walking for a while, he suddenly turned around and asked,"does the chief have a storage ring?"
 Chief Steward Yu frowned slightly.
 "If there is, did you bring the uniform of the night patrolman?"
 Li Hao pointed at his tattered clothes and smiled.""It's too tattered, and the traces of battle are too obvious. Can I change into a new set of clothes?"
 Chief Steward Yu had almost forgotten about this.
 Exhaling, he waved his hand, and a brand new uniform appeared. He threw it to Li Hao.  It was different from the usual uniform. One could tell that the new uniform was made of extraordinary material.
 Li Hao had seen it before!
 Hou Xiaochen was wearing this.
 Li Hao laughed. He was not shy at all. He quickly took off his tattered clothes and put on new clothes and a new pair of leather boots. He used his inner strength to shake off some of the blood on his body.
 Hou Xiaochen's clothes fit him quite well. They were a little too small for him, and the other guy was two or three centimeters shorter than him, so he didn't stand out.
 Li Hao tossed the torn clothes aside and said with a smile,""Chief, do you know how to set fire? If you don't know how to, ask Hao bu for help. "
 "I'll handle it!"
 Chief Steward Yu glanced at him but did not say anything.
 Li Hao nodded and left.
 As for the mysterious energy of the two three yang, he didn't take it, nor did he speak.
 At this time, Chief Steward Yu and the others still needed corpses to deal with all parties. If they made it a bloody mess, it would not be good to see people. It would make the night patrolmen seem too petty. If they killed the people, they would take away the mysterious ability.
 How could Li Hao Do such a thing?
 As for the storage rings...It didn't matter. After killing someone, of course he had to take some treasures. Otherwise, wouldn't he have killed for nothing?
 It was not until Li Hao disappeared at the end of the dilapidated alley that Chief Steward Yu slightly frowned.
 Hao lianchuan also landed from the sky. He looked at the end of the alley and then at Chief Steward Yu. His eyes flickered. This ... Although he had thought that she was not weak, he had really misjudged her.
 "The Marquis didn't come?"
  "En!"
 Chief Steward Yu did not say much. He looked around and said,""Burn them all, except for the broken Red Moon Mask. Burn the rest and don't leave anything behind!"
 They were all burned, leaving nothing behind.
 As for Li Hao and Hao lianchuan's plan to frame Hong Yue, it didn't matter.
 Chief Steward Yu was also very experienced in dealing with these people.
 'Even if it's a set-up, Hu Qingfeng will be furious when he sees the two dead bodies. He might even go crazy. He'll definitely come looking for trouble ... There's no need to go through all that trouble. Just destroy everything and leave nothing behind except for half a mask.'
 "As for who died, how many people died, and how they died ... You can think about it yourself!
 Hao lianchuan's eyes flickered, but he didn't say much.
 A flame instantly spread through the entire alley.
 In an instant, the flames spread all the way to the ground in the alley, incinerating the body of the earth element user. Waves of mysterious energy seeped out, and wind, earth, wood, and metal mixed together, making it look extremely messy.

 Chief Steward Yu sensed it for a moment and waved his hand. A force of Thunderbolt overflowed. In an instant, the surrounding walls collapsed one after another, and the sword marks left behind all disappeared.
 Lightning element!
 Hao lianchuan's heart skipped a beat. The Thunder element was a super power that was extremely good at fighting. This Yu dami was not weak at all.
 After destroying everything in front of him, Chief Steward Yu turned to look at him and said coldly,""How much effort did you put in to kill Huang Jie?"
 " 30%..." Hao lianchuan said after a moment of silence.
 Chief Steward Yu had an idea.
 Looking in the direction Li Hao had left, he took a light breath."I don't know if it's good or bad for this person to stay in white moon City. You should interact less with him, collude less with him, and do more daring things ... You don't understand. A true Martial Master is far more daring than you think! In the past, Yuan Shuo ran amok in Silver Moon, and there was nothing he didn't dare to do or kill. In my opinion, this person's bloodlust might be even greater than Yuan Shuo 's!"
 "He's all alone and has no one to worry about. Apart from Yuan Shuo, who's worth him worrying about, he has no other obstacles. Hao lianchuan, if you don't want to be dragged down by him, try to stay as far away from him as possible!"
 Hao lianchuan was a little embarrassed. This was the first time someone had said this to him.
 If someone had told him to stay away from Li Hao before, in case he got dragged down by Li Hao, he would have thought it was a joke. Li Hao, you can't blame me.
  However, at this moment, he felt that perhaps chief Yu was right.
 He had only spoken a few words to Li Hao, hoping to lure Yu Xiao to kill and terrorize everyone, but in the end ... Even Huang Jie was killed. If it wasn't for Li Hao's lack of strength, he suspected that Li Hao would go on a killing spree today, killing until even Hao lianchuan was afraid!
 "Chief Yu, then now ..."
 "Now?"
 Chief Steward Yu glanced at him and said indifferently,""You're the one who caused the trouble, so you should settle it yourself. You're the one who killed them, so you can make up whatever story you want. It's up to them whether they believe it or not. The only thing is that you didn't know the identity of these people, so you took out the blazing Phoenix spear and killed them all ... It's that simple!"
 Hao lianchuan's face was bitter.
 Hu Qingfeng would find out sooner or later, and he would probably be in big trouble.
 He had originally thought that if the hou tribe was around, things would be easier. Now that the hou tribe was not around, this secret Yu did not seem to be in the mood to help him solve these problems.
 "Then ..."
 "That's it, I'll go back first!"
 Chief Steward Yu did not want to talk too much with him. His aura burst out and the fire Phoenix spear appeared in his hand. In the blink of an eye, a flash of fire crossed the sky and he disappeared on the spot, landing in the night patrolmen's headquarters.
 They came quickly and left quickly.
 This time, Hao lianchuan was in a difficult position.
 'If you want to leave, then leave. You even took the Phoenix spear with you ... You really ... Really aren't afraid of me dying!'
  He cursed in his heart. At this moment, he could also feel a mysterious energy surging within him. Clearly, when those people saw the light disappear, they knew that the person who had sent it was no longer there. These people probably thought that it was hou Xiaochen.  Now that hou Xiaochen had left, people began to head over.
 Other than the three major organizations, who did not dare to show their faces in public, the other parties were not afraid to show their faces, nor were they afraid of what Hao lianchuan would do.
 The first one to arrive was not Hu Qingfeng.
 A wave of air swept over, and in an instant, two figures quickly arrived. They were none other than Hu dingfang and Chen Yuhua. Hu dingfang's expression was ugly, and he quickly arrived and looked around.
 He only saw a sea of fire!
 "Hao lianchuan, where's Li Hao?" he asked with a frown.
 His heart skipped a beat. Could he be dead?
 Beside him, Chen Yuhua's expression was also extremely ugly. That Little Junior Brother, he's gone before we even met?
 How could this be good!
 Hao lianchuan glanced at the two of them and said calmly,""He's fine. He's only slightly injured. I've already sent him back. There's no need for a mere hundred martial masters to get involved!"
 The two of them heaved a sigh of relief.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At this moment, many figures landed.
 Hu Qingfeng was the first to arrive. He looked calm, but there was some anger hidden in the depths of his eyes.
  Following that, a burly man wearing the inspector's uniform appeared. However, unlike the others, there were many stars shining on his uniform. He was wearing leather boots and landed with a loud thud. His face was filled with dignity.
 Hao lianchuan ignored Hu Qingfeng. When he saw the man, he quickly greeted him,""Secretary!"
 This person was their superior in name, and not just his, but also hou Xiaochen 's. This was because this person was the Silver Moon division's Secretary, and from the speed at which he moved, he was also an expert.
 The burly man nodded slightly and looked around. His tone wasn't stern, but calm."Evil energy intruders. Do you want to kill them all?"
 "All of them were killed!"
 "Is there any evidence that it was the Crimson Moon that attacked?"
 Hao lianchuan quickly replied,"no, it's just that a few of them were wearing the red moon ghost mask. Also, the other party attacked only to capture Li Hao, not to kill him. Other than Red Moon, it wouldn't be too difficult to attack someone who has surpassed 100. Two three-sun existences just to capture Li Hao ... Other than Red Moon, I can't think of any other organization that would do this."
 At this moment, Hu Qingfeng spoke with a cold tone,""No one was left alive?"
 "Once the fire Phoenix spear is out ... There won't be any survivors!"
 Hao lianchuan was neither humble nor arrogant."Lord Hu, you may not know this, but the fire Phoenix spear has been nurtured by the Marquis for many years. The spear carries the will of the Marquis. Even if it is not controlled by the Marquis, it is not too difficult to kill two three suns with the fire Phoenix spear."

 At this moment, there were more people outside the alley.
 Including Hong Yitang, He Yong, and the others in the city, they all rushed over.
 These people didn't greet Hu Qingfeng and the others.
 He Yong looked around and his eyes flickered slightly. He frowned. As a top martial Master, he could vaguely sense something different.
 Sword intent?
 Spear's consciousness?
 Anyway, it was a similar feeling.
 As for Hong Yitang, he was expressionless, but he was extremely shocked ... Sword intent!
 It wasn't just the sword essence. He could vaguely ... Sense a familiar feeling.
 He walked a few steps out of the alley without saying a word. Then, he reached out his hand and grabbed an extremely small piece of metal. At this moment, the shock in his heart could not be any greater!
  Earth overturning sword!
 He was all too familiar with his own earth overturning sword.
 Even if other people saw this small fragment, they wouldn't care. It was too small, just a little bigger than a grain of rice. Who would care about this?
 But he cared!
 He knew that the Earthcover sword was with Li Hao. Li Hao had been attacked, so even if the Earthcover sword was left here, he actually wouldn't feel that there was anything wrong.
 But at this moment ... The earth overturning sword was shattered!
 The kind that would be completely shattered!
 This wasn't the point. The enemy was too strong, so it was normal for him to shatter the earth overturning sword. However ... This was obviously not shattered, but shattered by himself. And it wasn't shattered by a superpower, but ... Sword force!
 Countless thoughts rose in his mind, and he even restored some things.
 A top-level swordsman was attacked. His sword aura burst out and instantly shattered the earth-covered sword. The earth-covered sword turned into fragments and shot in all directions. The sword aura was extremely strong, surpassing the level of a thousand-man warrior!
 This man ... Was also a swordsman!
 He could also vaguely feel the killing intent, the anger, and the madness ...
 This sword intent was vaguely familiar.
 He didn't dare to believe it, and he didn't dare to think about it.
 At this moment, he recalled the scene he had experienced in the ancient city. That day, when he gave the earth overturning sword to Li Hao, he had actually felt something different, but he didn't think too deeply about it at the time.
 Today ... He had no choice but to think deeply.
 The scene of the battle was covered in flames and completely destroyed. Only half of the Crimson Moon Mask, which he had deliberately left behind, was left. Everything else had been destroyed. Why did Hao lianchuan have to resort to using the fire Phoenix spear to kill people?
 What was he trying to hide?
 What was he hiding?
 Hong Yitang's eyes flickered. Of course, it was to hide the fact that he didn't kill these people. It was a swordsman, an extremely powerful swordsman.
 How many people in the current martial arts world could achieve this?
 Yuan Shuo?
 Yuan Shuo was not a swordsman. Perhaps he could do it, but he was definitely not Yuan Shuo. If his sword intent was so strong, he would have been a top-tier swordsman long ago and not a five birds beast King.
 "Li Hao!"  This name appeared in his mind with great difficulty. Hong Yitang almost couldn't keep his mind steady.
 Li Hao was an extremely powerful swordsman.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded in her ear,""Earthcover sword, What are you looking at?"
 He Yong walked over casually and laughed,""Are you scared out of your wits?"
 Hong Yitang turned his head to look, but He Yong was staring at his hand. He laughed and said,""You picked up money?"
 Hong Yitang put his hands behind his back. The fragment of the earth-crushing sword in his hand gradually melted in his palm.
 He looked at He Yong and smiled.""I'm not as lucky as brother he. I'm not that lucky to pick up money, but I'm just lamenting ... Three suns, there weren't many silver moons in the past, but now, they've been dying one after another. Even I'm afraid if they continue to die like this. I'm just a tiny three suns ... I was still able to hang around before, but now I feel that my fate is so uncertain and precarious!"
 He Yong chuckled."You're a mouse. Are you afraid of this?"
 He sneered and laughed,""Besides, you're not the one who's going to die, so what are you afraid of? Did you do it?"
 "Brother he must be joking!"
 He Yong laughed and didn't care. He quickly transmitted,""Brother Hong, don't you feel that ... Something's not quite right?"
 "What do you mean?"
 Hong Yitang also asked.
 "I have a feeling that ... Our Silver Moon might have gained another powerful Martial Master. Either that, or old demon Yuan is still around!"
 "That's impossible, right?"
 Hong Yitang was a little surprised. He transmitted his voice,""Why do you say so?"
 "Forget it. You're just a fake Martial Master. It's useless to talk to you!"
 “……”
 Hong Yitang smiled bitterly but didn't say anything. He Yong also walked away and looked elsewhere.
 Hong Yitang waited for him to leave before he let out a sigh of relief.
 He Yong might have felt something.
 However, he would never have imagined that the powerful Martial Master he was talking about was most likely Li Hao.
 At this moment, Hong Yitang saw another group of people arrive. He saw the people from the administration Bureau, some people from the military, and some people from the four major organizations of white moon City.
  Seeing this, Hong Yitang did not stay for long.
 Soon, he chose to leave.
 This matter was not something he could get involved in.
 At this moment, Hong Yitang wasn't interested in these things. He didn't care who died, as long as he wasn't the one.
 As for whether they were from the red moon ... Who cared!
 There were many Crimson Moon experts, but a large number of them had been killed before, and several of the three suns had died. At this stage, could there really be two more three suns?
 Among them, there seemed to be a peak three-yang.
 Ziyue was killed?
 That would be a joke. Ziyue would not take such a risk.
 It was hard to determine who the two three suns had gone missing, but sooner or later, the news would spread.

 At this moment, Hong Yitang was more concerned about whether he should do something if Li Hao killed someone.
 He had originally thought that Yuan Shuo would return sooner or later.
 With Yuan Shuo and hou Xiaochen's relationship, he might be able to get closer to Yuan Shuo and slowly get closer to the night patrolman, but at this moment ... He was thinking that Yuan Shuo had gone missing, and he didn't know when he would return.
 What about Li Hao?
 This kid really hid his strength deeply!
 However, since he had made a move today, he might not be able to hide it any longer.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Paper can't contain fire!
 Hao lianchuan had set everything on fire, so it was hard for anyone to pin the blame on Li Hao. However, if Li Hao continued to act strangely, he would be exposed sooner or later.
 "I even gave him an earth overturning sword ... But it seems like it's gone now."
 As Hong Yitang thought about this, he had already left.
  After he left, He Yong's figure appeared again, frowning slightly.
 Did Hong Yitang discover something?
 He had clearly seen this guy pick up something before, but this guy had hidden it silently. There must be something wrong!
 He glanced at the dilapidated alley. There was nothing but fire.
 Destroy the scene?
 Was the person he killed not simple, or was there some other reason?
 He Yong thought about it and did not stay any longer. He left quickly. Whitemoon city was getting more and more dangerous. All sorts of monsters and demons were appearing.
 ……
 In an alley.
 Hao lianchuan reported the situation to the inspector and finally said,""Hou bu came just now. When he learned that all the enemies had been killed, he didn't stay. His injuries haven't completely healed, so he left this matter to me!"
 "Hongyue is so bold," Hao lianchuan said in a deep voice."She actually attacked an important member of the night patrol in the city. What I mean is, we should surround and annihilate Hongyue! The Marquis is in seclusion and has not come out due to his injuries. The night patrollers are not strong enough. At this moment, we really hope to obtain the support of headquarters!"
 He looked at Hu Qingfeng and said in a deep voice,"Lord Hu, Hongyue doesn't take the night patrollers seriously. It just so happens that a few special agents are in the city this time. The night patrollers 'duty is to clean up all the evil superpowers!"
 "Whether it's for the sake of the night patrolman's face, or to fight evil and uphold justice ... Hong Yue's crimes are unforgivable and difficult to record! I hope Lord Hu can give me some support!"
  "Damn it!" Hu Qingfeng cursed.  However, at this moment, he couldn't refuse.
 As a Special Agent of the night patrolmen, if he refused at this moment, the prestige of the night patrolmen would be completely destroyed. Even if he had other thoughts, he would have to consider them. After all, they were not the only faction in the headquarters.
 The situation at the headquarters was complicated. He only represented a portion of the people, not everyone.
 If he stayed here, he would not be able to do his job well and lose the face of the night patrol. Someone would still find trouble with him.
 "Don't worry, I won't stand by and do nothing since the evil superpowers are so bold!"Hu Qingfeng said in a deep voice. I'll send people to look for Hong Yue's traces. If they are found, they will be killed without question!"
 He was just saying it and didn't have the mood to do it.
 Hao lianchuan didn't mind. He just nodded and said fiercely,""On the red moon's side, they are getting more and more outrageous. Not only did they attack Silver City, but now they even dare to invade white moon City! There are even two three sun level powerhouses who have infiltrated the city. From today onwards, I suggest that the White moon City be under military control! The inspection Office, night patrollers, and Garrison will take over Whitemoon city until all the remaining Scarlet Moon evils are wiped out!"
 No one spoke.
 Someone glanced over at the administration Bureau. Director Zhao was not here. The one who came was his Deputy, the second in command of the administration Bureau. He was also a white-haired old man who looked very refined.
 The old man didn't say anything. He just sighed and said softly,""It's up to you. We'll take care of the aftermath. I'll get someone to count the losses and see if there are any innocent civilians injured or lost. Can't the battle of superpowers avoid the crowd?"
 After sighing, he looked at Hao lianchuan and said,""Deputy Minister Tong, Silver Moon has been safe and sound for many years. The citizens have been living a peaceful life, so we need to be extra careful with our Nightwatchers. If there are any more attacks, we hope that we can control the area and avoid the areas where people gather."
 After saying that, he looked at Hu Qingfeng."Special Agent Hu, the special agents of the Heavenly Star City are very powerful. Please put in a lot of effort this time. If you can annihilate the red moon organization, it will be a great contribution. The administrative Bureau will also ask for your merits!"
  "I will. Don't worry, Deputy Director Zhou!" Hu Qingfeng smiled and nodded.
 The old man didn't say anything more and left quickly.
 Since they were not in the right field, the administration Bureau would not get involved anymore.
 At this moment, someone thought of something. Someone from the inspection Office whispered something to the burly man. The burly man nodded and someone quickly left.
 Surveillance!
 There was actually a surveillance camera at the entrance of the alley, but it had been destroyed. However, if he could take a look, he might be able to discover something or confirm the identity of the attacker.
 Until now, no one knew how many people had died here. They only knew that there were two three suns.
 As for Hao lianchuan, his reply was that he had taken out his fiery phoenix spear in a fit of anger. The fiery phoenix spear naturally exploded with a powerful killing force. By the time he came down, all the attackers had been killed!
 Except for those who had protected Li Hao, the others were turned into ashes in an instant. He didn't see how many people there were or who they were.
 Seeing that there was nothing left at the scene, the crowd dispersed.

 Hu Qingfeng didn't stay, but he still couldn't hide his anger and confusion.
 Is Hong Yue crazy?
 Or was someone pretending to be Hong Yue?
 The three dead Suns couldn't be fake. The heterogeneous mysterious energy was very rich. He judged that two of the three suns, one wood-type and one metal-type, and the metal-type was probably not weak!
 He was probably on par with Huang Jie.
 As for the wood element, it might be on par with Yu Xiao.
 Red Moon had reached a tacit agreement ... Why did they still do this?
 Although the bloodlines of the eight great families are important, once you take down hou Xiaochen, you'll be able to do whatever you want with him.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He didn't quite understand!
 He returned to the hotel in no time.
  In the hotel, the other two experts didn't leave on their own. Instead, they had been waiting.
 Hu Qingfeng wasn't in a good mood. He took a glance and said with a frown, "Where's Huang Jie and Yu Xiao?"
 Those two bastards still dared to run around in such a big matter?
 Just as he was thinking ... He was slightly stunned.
 That's right, such a big thing had happened. He had arranged for those two to stay in the hotel, so why would they run around?
 Metal ... Wood ...
 He suddenly had a bad premonition. His face changed as he looked at the remaining two people, a man and a woman, with an ugly expression."Huang Jie and Yu Xiao, did you see them when you came back?"
 "No, I don't ..."
 The woman answered first. Hu Qingfeng's face changed again, and he said coldly,""Have you called them yet? Have you contacted them?"
 "...Not yet ..."
 "Hurry up!"
 "Shut up!" Hu Qingfeng shouted angrily. The two of them were so frightened that they didn't know what to do, and they felt uneasy.
 What was going on?
 Meanwhile, Hu Qingfeng's expression was getting uglier and uglier.
 Not to that extent!
 Huang Jie and Yu Xiao weren't idiots. They had nothing better to do than Rob people.
 The bloodline of the eight great families ... Was it really related to them?
 It doesn't matter!
 Therefore, apart from Red Moon, no one would cause trouble for Li Hao. No one knew what was going on.
 However, the three dead Suns, one was at the peak of the metal element and the other was at the middle stage of the wood element. This ... Was too much of a coincidence!
 It was impossible for those two to not sense what was happening in the city.
 However, he had never appeared!
 Where was he?
 The more Hu Qingfeng thought about it, the more uneasy, angry, and grave he became.
 What if Huang Jie and Yu Xiao were the ones who died?
 Then ... We're in big trouble!
 In fact, he couldn't say that the two of them were dead. Otherwise, if he said that Huang Jie and Yu Xiao were dead, he would be in big trouble!
 "Damn that Hao lianchuan!"  He suddenly thought of something and his eyes turned cold.
 Hao lianchuan had been trying to avoid the attack. He did not know the identity of the people who came, but he knew that they were probably from the red moon. In a few words, he defined the attack as an attack of evil energy and even asked Hu Qingfeng to cooperate.
 At this moment, how could he say that those two could be Yu Xiao and Huang Jie!
 Not only could he not, but he also had to cover up the fact that these two people had disappeared!
 "Damn it, damn it!"
 At this moment, if he still couldn't determine who had died, he would be an idiot.
 In an instant, his face turned so livid that it made people tremble in fear!
 He...Had been dragged into the ditch by Hao lianchuan!
 Hao lianchuan definitely knew who was the one who died!
 He did it on purpose!
 In front of him, the woman quickly said in a low voice,""It ... It didn't get through ..."
 Hu Qingfeng was silent.
 That was for sure!
 The two of them were already dead, buried in the sea of fire. Where could they go to open up the path?
 After a long while, he said solemnly,"he's dead!" Don't say anything, just tell the outside world that these two were arranged to go on business and left white moon City early this morning ..."
 "My Lord!"
 The two of them paled. Was he dead?
 The battle that had erupted earlier was Yu Xiao's group?
 Then ... Wouldn't they be in danger?
 Hu Qingfeng took a deep breath."Right now, we're only fighting in the dark. Hou Xiaochen won't dare to do anything to us in the open ... But white moon City is no longer safe!"
 However, she couldn't leave immediately.
 Otherwise, it would be even more dangerous.
 At this time, he was a little worried and said in a deep voice,""We can't leave right away. From now on, we have to show our faces more. Don't go out unless there's something important. Even if we do, try to stay at the administration Bureau!"
 The more he thought about it, the more uneasy he felt.
 At this time, he had also firmly remembered the fat Hao lianchuan!
 Bastard!
 As expected, the Silvermoon Nightwalker was a bunch of rebels!
  This Hao lianchuan actually knew their identities, but he still killed them ... Damn it, damn it!
 ……
 At the same time.
 At the administration Bureau.
 In a small office.
 Deputy Director Zhou looked at director Zhao and said,""Yu Xiao and Huang Jie are the ones who died. Hu Qingfeng doesn't know yet. He's probably only just realized something unusual."
 He shook his head and said,"Hu Qingfeng is strong, but he's not smart. About half of the people present have already guessed who died. The Secretary and he Yong from the royal family ... They have probably guessed it. He's the only one who's still confused. He was confused by Hao lianchuan's words."
 "Was it hou Xiaochen's doing?"
 Director Zhao muttered and quickly shook his head,""It doesn't look like it. If it really was hou Xiaochen's doing, then even Hu Qingfeng wouldn't be able to escape! This means that it's Hao lianchuan's own idea. This little fatty is quite bold. "
 Director Zhou shook his head,"it doesn't seem like it. Or rather, it might be his idea, but it might also be beyond his expectations ... He destroyed the scene!" If he really did it, he probably wouldn't have destroyed the scene and confirmed the other party's identity, or even that they were related to the red moon. His purpose was to confirm these things ... Not to find no evidence and let go of the debt when the person dies. "

 "What did you find?"
 Director Zhao looked at his old friend and knew that he had discovered something.
 Director Zhou exhaled gently,"the one who did this might not be Hao lianchuan, but someone else!" His identity could not be easily exposed. This person isn't weak. He killed two three-sun existences without exposing his identity ... If he's not Yu Luosha, then he's ... Li Hao!"
 "What?"
 Director Zhao was stunned. He didn't care about Yu Luosha and just raised his brows,""Li Hao?"
 "Right!"
 Director Zhou thought for a moment and said,"a person with a cultivation base over 100 is fine under the attack of two three suns. If it was really done by Red Moon, then it's highly possible. But if it wasn't Red Moon but Yu Xiao and the other two, then they must have discovered something. Is there a need to capture Li Hao alive?" Can I take it away? Wasn't he afraid that hou Xiaochen would come out? Could they escape? So ... If they were to make a move, it must be to kill Li Hao, not to capture him!"
 "Hao lianchuan arrived very quickly, probably in less than 30 seconds. However, the two three suns attacked the one with a cultivation base of over 100. They would have killed him long ago ... Unless they had an internal conflict. But if they were not stupid, why would they have an internal conflict now?"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "So ..."
 "Why don't Yuan Shuo stay?" he asked after some thought.
  At this moment, director Zhao frowned and shook his head,""Yuan Shuo has left! There's news from the neighboring Linjiang province that Yuan Shuo and the Jade lightsaber sword have joined forces and did something big last night. The two of them destroyed one of Hong Yue's strongholds in Linjiang and killed a three suns expert. Yuan Shuo even clamored and left behind some harsh words, telling Ying Hongyue to wait for him in the central region. He won't come back until he kills Ying Hongyue!"
 “……”
 ? Director Zhou took a deep breath,"then there are other people behind Li Hao?."
 If there wasn't ... That would be an extremely terrifying thing.
 At this moment, Li Hao's name finally entered their sight.
 Director Zhao was silent for a while, then he suddenly laughed,""Forget it, let's not worry about that for now. We'll talk about it when hou Xiaochen returns."
 "Where did he go?"
 Director Zhou asked.
 The two of them seemed to be certain that hou Xiaochen wasn't in the city. They didn't seem to care about the person who had appeared before, as if they already knew about chief Yu's identity and strength.
 Director Zhao looked out the window and thought for a while,""I'm not sure. He's not the only one not in the city. The one from the military is definitely not here either. These two people must have joined forces to deal with a strong enemy ... Ordinary people are not worth it for them to do this. Hu Qingfeng is here to cover for them. He can prove that they are in the city ... Just wait. The news will come soon. If Xuguang or a top figure dies, they will probably be there. "
 Director Zhou was speechless.
 Is commander Yu not here?
 What kind of person was worth the two of them joining hands to deal with?
 He had some vague ideas, but he didn't dare to say it out loud. Even if there were only the two of them here, he didn't dare to say it. If that was the case ... The northern region might be in chaos for a while.
 The Silver Moon might welcome a short period of peace and would no longer attract too much attention!
 Whether it was Yuan Shuo or hou Xiaochen, they had shown off their strength to intimidate others, and they had done it to divert attention ... These people were all terrifying, and they definitely wouldn't just suddenly attack and kill for no reason ...
 Martial arts, the Nightwalker, and the military-these three parties had come to an agreement. It seemed that Silver moon's situation was more complicated than he had imagined.
 At this moment, the administration department also fell silent.
 ……
 At the same time.
 In Li Hao's room, Li Hao was eating. He was eating very happily.
 On the side, Wang Ming's mind had been wandering the whole time.
 After Li Hao had taken a few bites, he quickly served him a drink and stammered,""Senior ... Brother li, have some drinks to moisten your throat!"
 Li Hao took a sip of his drink and raised his head to look at him.
 Wang Ming swallowed and stammered,"Senior brother ... Our five birds sect is really ... Really amazing!"
 Li Hao smiled.
 Seeing this, Wang Ming hurriedly said,"that ... I didn't see anything. Oh right, I destroyed everything. There's absolutely nothing left. There's absolutely no backup!"
 Li Hao nodded, not saying anything.
  Wang Ming seemed to have come back to his senses. He looked at Li Hao with a strange expression, and after a long while, he said,"Senior brother ... Do you think I still have a chance to learn martial arts?"  "I don't know,"
 "Don 't, senior brother, give me a chance, okay?"
 Wang Ming's face was full of anticipation."I want to learn martial arts. Really. I want to become a Martial Master, a powerful Martial Master!"
 "We'll see. Teacher might have a way, but I don 't."
 Alright!
 Wang Ming was very dejected, but he couldn't forget that scene in his mind ... A sword had pierced through the sky, and in an instant, a flash of sword Qi had appeared and killed a sun glory expert in an instant. Then the sword Qi had soared into the sky, and then ... It was gone.
 Just this much!
 However, he knew that two of the three suns had died.
 When Hao lianchuan arrived, the battle seemed to be almost over.
 This cheap senior brother in front of him ... Was really F * cking scary!
 It was so terrifying that he felt that even department head Hao was probably no match for it.
 Not probably ... Even without the fire Phoenix spear, he would probably be killed by a sword, right?
 艹!
 Were these martial masters really that terrifying?
 Wang Ming served her attentively. His thoughts had long gone far away, and he still couldn't let go of it. It was too terrifying.
 Li Hao was also powerful when he killed Zhang Ting, but he was definitely not as powerful as he was now. His progress was too fast, so fast that he was a little scared.
 "Senior brother ... What should we do next? Will we be exposed?"
 Wang Ming was a little frightened. The person he had killed wasn't ordinary.
 Li Hao ate without raising his head. He said calmly,""What do you mean? I really have no choice ... Teacher's path is ahead, so I'll go find him. What are you worried about?"
 Find a teacher?
 Wang Ming took a deep breath. If this person also went, and a few murderous stars gathered together ... That would be even more terrifying. Just thinking about it made him excited-no, scared!
 Wang Ming didn't say anything else.
 At this moment, all he could think about was becoming a Martial Master, a powerful Martial Master. The image of the five birds sect had already been deeply engraved in his mind.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, looked out of the window.
 This time, there should be some people who would make some guesses.
 Thus...He still had to quickly become stronger!
 Even if he hid it, he couldn't hide it from everyone. He didn't want to completely hide it from them. As long as his strength improved quickly and these people were still immersed in the fact that he had killed three suns, when he could kill Xu Guang ... At that time, what would happen?
  Li Hao smiled.
 Hou Xiaochen, chief Yu, department head Hao, Hu Qingfeng ...
 One by one, names appeared in his mind.
 Li Hao felt that he could also try to jump out and become one of the paragons with his absolute strength, instead of passively enduring something.
 After eating for a while, Li Hao said,"the food tastes good. It's especially fragrant. Old Wang, buy more!"
 "No problem!"
 Wang Ming hurriedly replied, his face full of excitement.
 Li Hao glanced at him and laughed. This guy was quite interesting at times. I don't eat people, so why do you keep looking at me like that?
 Have you forgotten that you were one of the participants?
 I went to the hospital for a check-up today. My lumbar disc is a little protruding. I'll give it a try first. Thank you for your concern. Thank you, everyone. I've seen many effective suggestions. Thank you, big shots!

 He ate and drank to his heart's content.
 Li Hao was quite satisfied.
 However, he still had some doubts.
 After some thought, he looked at Wang Ming and asked,"Minister hou, do you usually travel far?"
 "I don't know. What's wrong?"
 Wang Ming indeed didn't know, and he wasn't familiar with that person.
 Li Hao nodded and didn't ask any further.
 Today, he had killed so many people. No matter what, it was not a small matter. In the end, it was only chief Yu who came to deal with it. Moreover, he was so mysterious that his identity was not exposed. It was obvious that he had some thoughts of pretending.
 If hou Xiaochen had really gone into seclusion, there was no need to pretend.
 That meant that hou Xiaochen really wasn't in the city.
  Where did he go?
 This person had just killed a top-notch expert, and now everyone's eyes were on white moon City. To be more serious, more than half of the dynasty's eyes were focused here. If he ran away, wasn't he afraid that something would go wrong?
 What else was worth it for him to disappear at this moment?
 While Li Hao was thinking, he heard weak footsteps outside the door.
 "Dong Dong Dong!"
 There was a knock on the door.
 Startled, Wang Ming glanced at Li Hao. Li Hao nodded and said in a low voice,"Open the door."
 After saying that, he waved his hand and swept all the leftovers into the trash can. He covered the trash can and walked toward the door with a pale face.
 Wang Ming didn't know who had come and was a little scared, but he still quickly opened the door.
 He heaved a sigh of relief when he opened the door.
 "Uncle Hu!"
 Hu dingfang glanced at him. This time, he recognized this guy. He nodded slightly, but his expression was not very good.
 In his opinion, Li Hao's attack had something to do with the conversation between the two.
 This Wang Ming's mouth was too big!
 "General Hu!"
 Li Hao seemed to be a little surprised. He glanced at Hu dingfang and asked doubtfully,""Why has general Hu come?"
 "Are you alright?"
 Hu dingfang glanced at Li Hao. Fortunately, he was fine. Other than his face being a little pale, he was indeed not hurt.
 Li Hao showed a weak smile.""It's nothing. Department head Hao came quickly. The other party didn't want to kill me. They just wanted to capture me, so I didn't get hurt. It's just a small injury."
 When Hu dingfang saw that Wang Ming wasn't leaving, he could only say that this guy didn't have a good eye.
 He didn't say much and said in a deep voice,""If there's anything you need, you can find me! If you have nowhere to go, you can go to the Tiger wing Army to find me. Some things are not what Hao lianchuan told you. Some things that happened back then were also coincidences and misunderstandings. "
 He felt that Hao lianchuan must have added oil to the fire.
 Li Hao should have known that he knew the secret technique of five birds.
  However, in Hu dingfang's opinion, if it wasn't for Hao lianchuan's interference, Li Hao might have chosen to join the Tiger wing Army. That fatty was not a good person!  Li Hao hurriedly nodded and said,""I understand, but ... I can't make a decision now. I have to wait for master to come back before I can make the next arrangement."
 “……”
 Hu dingfang was also speechless and did not say anything else.
 He thought about it for a while and said,"if you have time, you can ... You can come to my house for a meal. Also, I'll think of a way to get you some blood deities. You're too weak. Although it's okay to break through 100, the world will only become more and more chaotic!"
 "Silver Moon is actually quite safe. The nearby provinces are already in chaos! Back then, the three northern provinces rebelled and caused the entire North to be in turmoil. Although commander Yu quelled the rebellion, there are still some scattered Flames of War spreading ..."
 At this point, he felt that there was no need to say too much, so he added,""If it's difficult to improve in martial arts, you can consider becoming a supernatural. The mysterious realm is easier to obtain. Although your master has created a new path for martial masters, he is not an ordinary person. Not everyone can walk this path."
 Li Hao hurriedly nodded.
 Hu dingfang stopped talking, and Li Hao didn't seem to have any intention of keeping them.
 Seeing this, Hu dingfang turned around and left.
 "Take care, general Hu!"
 Hu dingfang waved his hand and did not respond.
 Li Hao waited for him to leave for a while, then walked to the window and looked down. Sure enough, a woman was waiting for him.
 Wang Ming also came over, looked down, and said in surprise,"Old Hu's wife. His wife rarely shows up. This time, even she is here. Are you old Hu's relative?"
 The woman below seemed to have sensed something and looked up.
 However, the 12th floor wasn't low, and he didn't know what he saw.
 Li Hao looked at it for a while, then looked at Wang Ming and smiled."You still don't understand it?"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "What?"
 Li Hao sighed and shook his head.
 This guy could be quite silly sometimes.
 Hu dingfang knows the five birds technique, and it's quite powerful. Don't you feel anything?
 It was obviously related to the five birds sect!
 Shouldn't normal people have made some judgments long ago?
  Why don't you use your brain at all?
 "The one below ... You should also call her Senior Sister."
 "Oh!"
 Wang Ming nodded at first, then was startled. After a long while, he said a little strangely,"I understand! Teacher Yuan's former student? I've never heard of it!"
 This time, he understood.
 Then, he thought of Hu dingfang. After thinking for a long time, he took a deep breath and said,"I understand. Hu dingfang knows the five birds technique, and I feel that it's very powerful, even more powerful than me. I'm an in-name disciple who knows breathing techniques! That fellow can do it too?"
 Li Hao smiled.
 He wasn't that stupid!
 In the next moment, it was at Li Hao's waist.
 Wang Ming kept gasping."So this means that Hu dingfang and I are of the same generation. I'm teacher's in-name disciple, and he can't even be considered an in-name disciple. In five birds sect, my status is even higher than his ... Senior brother, if I go to him now and say I'm his senior brother ... Do you think he'll beat me?"

 "Get lost!"
 Li Hao laughed and cursed. As he watched Hu dingfang and the woman leave together, he slowly said,""There's no need to have too many disputes. The teachers are probably very disappointed!"
 After saying that, Li Hao shook his head and suddenly sighed.""He's very talented!"
 "What?"
 "Didn't you see?"
 "Ah?"
 Wang Ming still didn't understand. Li Hao lifted his chin."Look at your Senior sister's steps."
 Wang Ming stuck his head out to take a look, and after a while, he was a little confused."Senior sister's gait ... Is quite enchanting ..."
 Li Hao almost rolled his eyes, speechless.
 "Bewitching my ass! This is deer movement, an instinctive reaction that can only be achieved when deer techniques are deeply ingrained in one's bones. When they walk, they will pay attention to their surroundings and be on guard against any movements. If I'm not mistaken, this Senior Sister of ours is a warrior of the warrior dimension, and she has been in that realm for many years. "
  "Hiss!"
 Wang Ming took a deep breath,"so powerful?" Even stronger than teacher?"
 Li Hao shook his head,"if you still want to practice martial arts, read more books and ask more people!" Teacher is a fusion of Five Forces, not an ordinary one that breaks through 100, not an ordinary Qian. "
 Then, Li Hao added,"in the current martial arts world, let's not talk about the outside world. In the Silver Moon martial arts world, those who entered the universe before teacher, and I mean those who entered the universe locally, are all useless!"
 "Ah?"
 Wang Ming was startled. What did he mean?
 Douqian was trash?
 Li Hao continued,"those who didn't break through to the Qian warrior realm, or rather, those who only broke through to the Qian warrior realm after they left the city, are likely to be strong."
 Wang Ming was dumbfounded and really didn't understand.
 Li Hao explained,"in Silver Moon martial forest, the geniuses of the older generation were all suppressed by our teacher. Our teacher swept away a generation of martial artists. Before he entered the warrior Qian stage, those people's spirits were always suppressed by him!"
 "It sounds incredible, but in reality, it's not at all. This is a kind of divine intent and divine force suppression!"
 "Therefore, people like Earth-crushing sword Hong Yitang and eyebrows-scrunched sun Yifei didn't make it to the Qian warrior realm. What is Qian warrior to them now?"
 "There is also He Yong. He only stepped into the Qian warrior realm after he left this place."
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao could be considered a martial Dao master now, so he was more understanding and calm. He continued,""To put it simply, some of the people who were defeated by my teacher back then were very, very talented. To be able to be defeated and not die, they were all outstanding people! However, as long as I stay in Silver Moon, I won't be able to break through to thousand warrior unless I go out ... But even if I do, I might not be able to break through ..."
 Wang Ming scratched his head. It was really hard to understand.
 Did this have anything to do with walking out?
 Also, weren't we just talking about Senior Sister?
 Seeing that he didn't understand, Li Hao didn't bother to say anything more and returned to the main topic.""Senior Sister is teacher's disciple. Logically speaking, she shouldn't have advanced to the Dou Qian class before teacher. It's not that she can 't, but teacher didn't advance and she advanced first. This can only mean that her Shi is very weak, so weak that it's not suppressed by teacher!"
  "Simply put, only the strong deserve to be suppressed by teacher. The weak don't deserve it!"  "The team leader should be a bit stronger than her, because the team leader advanced under the teacher's suppression. Although he advanced in a hurry and didn't have a deep understanding of Shi, he should still be more powerful than an ordinary Qian warrior!"
 Wang Ming nodded.
 He still did not quite understand the situation, but he roughly knew one thing: on Silver moon's side, all the Qian fighters who had advanced before Yuan Shuo were weaklings!
 Was this what Li Hao meant?
 Even though he still didn't understand the reason, he understood that this was a suppression from his teacher.
 It was too terrifying!
 "Senior brother, do you mean that even though our Senior Sister is a Qian warrior, she is actually very weak?"
 "It's not that weak, I think it's at the level of a normal warrior of a thousand. "
 Li Hao laughed."If we divide the master douqian into three levels, the teacher is the strongest level. The second level is He Yong and the others. After being defeated, they will go far away and advance to the douqian level. They can still make further progress!" The third level is the level of boss Liu and the others. It's considered to be the standard of a Qian master. "
 "How about you?"
 Wang Ming couldn't help but ask.
 Li Hao laughed."I'm about the same as He Yong and the others. I'm weaker in terms of influence, but I'm slightly better than He Yong and the others. Because I'm a member of the five birds sect, I'm above them and below teacher."
 He understood!
 Wang Ming nodded."The second person in the martial arts world?"
 "I don't dare!"
 Li Hao laughed,"I'm not being humble. It's the truth." It could only be said that in the current situation of Silver Moon martial forest ... It could be said so! However, the other regions are vast, and no one knows how their martial Dao has developed over the years, how many Qian fighters they have, or if any Qian fighters have reached another level, so you can't say that. "
 Wang Ming nodded again.
  As the two of them conversed, Hu dingfang and his wife had already disappeared.
 Wang Ming said a little regretfully,"you're not too warm to him. Otherwise, you could at least borrow some strength from him. Hu dingfang is still very powerful, and his status is high. He's in charge of the Tiger wing Army."
 "I won't get involved in the matter between him and teacher. I'll wait for teacher to come back."
 Li Hao shook his head.
 "What a pity!" He said regretfully."I killed so many people today, but I didn't get any mysterious energy. What a pity!"
 It wasn't easy to collect it back then, so he could only give up.
 Although his five internal organs had been strengthened to the limit in a short period of time, the more mysterious the better. Two three yang and two sunshine. There was still quite a lot of mysterious energy, about 3000 cubic meters!
 It was all wasted!
 Wang Ming also felt that it was a pity. He knew that later on, there seemed to be another gold element student who went over.
 What a pity!

 ……
 After chatting for a while, Wang Ming also left.
 One had to be tactful.
 Li Hao had just fought a great battle. If he kept flattering him, he would get tired too.
 Li Hao wasn't in a hurry to check his loot.
 He first went to take a bath and washed himself clean. Then, he entered the room and took out two storage rings.
 Li Hao had never seen this thing before, but he roughly knew how to use it.
 He had memorized many ancient books, and some of them had records.
 It was very simple. Spiritual power ... Of course, he now understood it as divine will or force. With this special power, one could open a storage ring. As for how to activate a superpower, Li Hao had no idea. Perhaps it was through blood ownership claim?
 Who knows!
  He released his divine will, and sure enough, he sensed something on a storage ring that seemed to be a barrier. Li Hao's divine will transformed into a sword and pierced through something with a bang.
 In an instant, his vision blurred, as if he had entered a small space.
 It was as dark as a small house. It couldn't even be considered a house. It was probably the size of a coffin, so it shouldn't be a problem to put a person in.
 With the divine intent as a lamp, he could see what was inside.
 "Five divine power stones ... Rich man!"
 Li Hao laughed. Not bad, there were even divine power stones.
 That's right, Yu Xiao had given him one before, even though that fellow definitely felt that he could take it back.
 However, five divine power stones were not bad.
 Other than these few divine power stones, there was another familiar item. It was a storage ring, not a storage ring!
 The storage ring was used to store mysterious energy.
 Li Hao's divine will quickly moved, and a ring appeared in an instant. He examined it and found that it was similar to the storage ring he was wearing. It also had five slots, and each slot probably contained 200 cubic meters of mysterious energy.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com All four slots of this storage ring were filled with wood energy!
 "It's Yu Xiao 's!"
 Li Hao had an idea. These experts had obviously brought supplies with them. 800 cubic meters of wood energy was a lot, and it might have been more before. It was full, so this guy had probably used some.
 This was an unexpected gain!
 This was also the first time Li Hao had obtained a mysterious power other than his own after killing someone. The people from the central continent were indeed rich, and they were not comparable to the local supers of Silver Moon. They even had a large amount of mysterious power as supplies.
 "Five divine power stones to replenish the energy of the small sword. The 800 cubic meters of wood energy can also be used to cultivate wood force. "
 Even though the wooden sword stance had yet to take shape.  Li Hao looked at the other storage ring and laughed. Since Yu Xiao, who was at the middle stage of the three suns realm, had brought these treasures, the other metal-elemental cultivator at the peak of the three suns realm would probably have a lot of them, right?
 In Yu Xiao's storage ring, other than these two items, there were also a few other miscellaneous items. For example, some female undergarments ... They seemed to have been used!
 Li Hao could only attribute it to this guy's fetish for cross-dressing.
 As for other things, he was too lazy to think about them.
 There were also some of Yu Xiao's clothes and a token. Li Hao had this too. It wasn't a treasure, but a proof of identity. It was a symbol of a night patrolman's status.
 It was just a symbol, not of much use.
 Li Hao didn't stand on ceremony. He quickly opened the second storage ring. This time, it was slightly more difficult to open, but it wasn't too difficult.
 He opened it, and sure enough, the configuration was similar.
 There were more divine power stones, eight of them.
 As for the storage ring, there was also one, but the metal energy inside was less, only around 600 points. Li Hao was very disappointed. This guy, who was at the peak of the three suns realm, had obviously consumed more energy. He wondered if he had used it during his daily cultivation. What a waste!
 In total, Li Hao had obtained two storage rings, more than 1400 units of mysterious energy, and 13 divine power stones, which replenished the divine power stones that he had been struggling with.
 This time, his injuries were not light, and the energy in the small sword was almost exhausted.
 He only had seven divine power stones now. If he had not gained something, he would not have needed to use these seven Stones for long. Now that he had 13 divine power stones, he would not be short of supplies for the time being.
 The things provided by the two three suns were either mysterious energy or divine power stones. The rest were not worth mentioning.
 Li Hao opened the secret manual that he had obtained from Martial Master Dou Qian.
 "What?"
 At first glance, Li Hao was slightly stunned. What a familiar name!
  [Hundred battle spear]!
 Li Hao had heard of this spear technique before. It was the secret technique of Zhang Jin 'an, the bronze spear, one of the three Spears of the Silver Moon.
 The copper spear was dead!
 In that case, the one who attacked before could be the copper Spear's inheritor or or descendant?
 Li Hao frowned, but he didn't care too much. So what if he was killed? the other party's identity was similar to his Captain 'S. He might be a second generation martial artist. It wasn't easy for him to become a Qian warrior.
 He should never have been tempted by the blood God's clone on him.
 The three Spears of the Silver Moon were all famous martial arts experts back then. The other party might not have paid much attention to the five birds breathing technique. Even if it was very powerful, the secret technique passed down in his family was not weak either. Li Hao recalled that when the other party attacked with his spear, it was like a dragon. It did look like he had been through a lot.
 However, he probably hadn't experienced the era of fighting and killing back then, so he didn't feel as murderous as his Captain. After all, his Captain had fought many battles in the Silver City.
 The successor of the copper spear had been killed by him ... Could the copper Spear's legacy be considered to have been completely severed?
 As Li Hao thought to himself, he opened the booklet. The booklet explained some things to pay attention to in spear techniques, as well as some basic elements of spear techniques. When he flipped to the last page, as expected, there was no matching breathing technique.

 In this case, if the copper spear had no other inheritors, the line of the copper spear would be completely cut off!
 That was because Li Hao didn't know any breathing techniques either. There was only a form, not a fundamental technique. The copper Spear's hundred-battle spear was only for show.
 Li Hao flipped through it for a while. The moves were exquisite. For spear users, even if they didn't have a breathing technique, they could still learn from it. It was not bad. Unfortunately, Li Hao didn't use a spear, nor was he good at it.
 "Martial Master ... As expected, there's nothing worth coveting!"
 Li Hao shook his head. If the situation allowed it, he had no interest in killing a Martial Master.
 It was meaningless!
 It would only be interesting if the other party was on par with him or even stronger. At that time, he would not kill for the sake of killing, but for the sake of martial arts.
 There was no point in killing the weak.
 It was hard to get the complete version of secret Arts, and there was no benefit in killing them. There was no mysterious energy, so why kill them?
 Back then, his teacher was able to obtain Shadowless sword's breathing technique probably because Shadowless Sword was too confident. He was confident that he wouldn't lose and wouldn't die. Otherwise, he wouldn't have left behind a complete inheritance.
  After counting, there were only these things.
 It was not worth it to kill and steal.
 Under normal circumstances, the experts who could kill Yu Xiao and the others wouldn't be interested in these items. But for Li Hao, they were pretty good.
 Li Hao threw the two storage rings to the side. He didn't care much about them, nor did he like them.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It would be more convenient to bring it back with him.
 At this moment, he was more concerned about his Fire Tiger sword force!
 The Divine Will merged with his heart. At this moment, Li Hao could clearly see the current Tiger's momentum. It was completely different from before. In his heart, a thick chain was locking a sword, a fiery red Tiger head sword!
 There seemed to be a fierce tiger imprinted on the body of the sword. However, it was very illusory and not very clear. The fierce tiger seemed to be lying dormant.
 "The fire sword and the earth sword have both appeared ... Next, it's best to use the other three swords of the five elements sword, the wood, metal, and water swords!"
 The two swords had yet to merge.
 Li Hao, however, was in no hurry.
 By the time the five elements sword was fully formed, his teacher's experience would be very useful. His teacher had combined the five elements and five Forces, and the essence of both sides was similar. At that time, Yuan Shuo's experience would be very useful.
 Li Hao could save a lot of time and take a shortcut to merge the five swords and use the sword force to lead!
 At that time, he would complete the fusion in an instant, and even unleash five swords to break through the momentum, instantly erupting with incomparably powerful strength.
 "I don't have many gold and wood threads. The most important thing now is the sword force of melted water!"
 He didn't know if he would gain any insights from looking at the sea.
 Maybe, maybe not.
  However, he still wanted to take a look. He was only at the seventh fold of the ninth-stage refined force so far. He would probably need some time to reach the ninth fold.  Sunguang was very powerful. Li Hao estimated that if he could use three sword stances, he would most likely be able to deal with a peak three-sun.
 The four sword forces might not be able to match the rising light, but at the three yang level, they were probably invincible.
 When all five sword energies were displayed, Li Hao felt that he would be able to truly match the Sunglow level.
 It was only a manifestation, not a fusion. Once it was fused, Li Hao once again judged that he might be able to kill Xuguang ... All of this was just his general theoretical deduction. Whether it was true or not would depend on the actual situation.
 Even the strongest in the martial arts world had not reached this stage. At the very least, no one had ever been heard of being able to match Xu Guang. Even his teacher had only been able to match the peak of the three suns.
 At that time, his teacher was a double God!
 However, his teacher was different. He had fused Five Forces, and his two gods were slightly different from Li Hao 's.
 "I'll probably need to produce three gods to be on par with teacher's two gods ... But in the end, my fusion of five powers might surpass teacher's fusion of five powers ..."
 This was because his sword force was stronger than the five birds force alone.
 Now, he could not compare to his teacher because of his experience, his combat reaction, and the lack of fusion of Shi.
 Otherwise, with his teacher's experience and strength, Huang Jie would have been killed by Li Hao's second attack. Li Hao had taken advantage of Hao lianchuan's sudden appearance and scared Huang Jie, which was why Li Hao had been able to kill him quickly.
 Li Hao concluded.
 After every battle, one had to comprehend, experience, and summarize. Only by finding one's strengths and weaknesses would one be able to improve themselves.
 After thinking for a long time, Li Hao started to miss old man Yuan again.
 If his teacher was still here, he would definitely help him find some shortcomings and share his experience with him. Li Hao would definitely gain more from this.
 ……
  At the edge of Linjiang province.
 The sky was already dark.
 In the wilderness, a bonfire lit up.
 Yuan Shuo had caught a rabbit out of nowhere and was roasting it.
 As he warmed himself by the fire, he laughed and said,""Jade light, stop cultivating. Cultivation is about balancing work and rest. These years, I've been working and resting, and I've had a new understanding. If you keep cultivating, you won't be able to gain more benefits than fighting!"
 Wu Hongshan opened her eyes and looked at him, but didn't say anything.
 Yuan Shuo had nothing to do, so he asked,""After so many years, you haven't had a disciple or anything?"
 "Why do you want to take in a disciple?"
 "You have accepted a few apprentices. What about now?" Wu Redwood said lightly.
 Yuan Shuo laughed,"I'm fine now. What's up?" "Let's not talk about the previous events. Before I left, my little disciple had already broken through 100. He had comprehended the double forces. I left for a few days and he went to the ruins. With his luck and comprehension, he might have already entered the Dou Qian realm!"
