r not he could subdue the heart fire ape was related to the cultivation of his five internal organs and the next step in his cultivation.
 Would it work if the heart was strong enough to break the balance of the five internal organs?
 Yuan Shuo did not know.
 Therefore, he could only try.
 He didn't have enough time to cultivate his five internal organs at the same time.
 "Huchi huchi ..."
 At this moment, the big ape in his heart let out a series of cries, as if it was struggling to escape from his heart, unwilling to be bound like this.
 It couldn't be trapped!
 For the past five days, Yuan Shuo had exhausted all his means, but he was unable to trap this big ape. Even if it was only his divine will, it was not willing to stay in his heart, so he could only control it with difficulty.
 It had been five days!
  Yuan Shuo could sense the passage of time, but he seemed to be unable to succeed.
 Yuan Shuo was not disappointed, nor did he panic.
 After five days, he did not come back empty-handed.
 "You forced me to do this!" He sighed.
 Why did he have to be disobedient!
 The next moment, his heart beat rapidly. Gradually, a chain seemed to appear on the surface of his heart. The so-called superpower lock in the superpower realm was also the heart lock.
 Since you don't want to stay here ... Then don't blame me for locking you up!
 A few days ago, he was unwilling to use this move because he was afraid that his heart fire ape would be too strong. What if it broke the chain?
 He had forcefully entered the realm of superpowers?
 Become a fire element super?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com That was not an outcome he wanted to see.
 However, at this point, Yuan Shuo could only take a gamble. He gambled that the heart fire ape could not break the heart lock. The heart lock was still very strong. It had absorbed a large amount of fire elements and strengthened his heart, so naturally, it had also strengthened the heart lock.
 For an ordinary person, the Super Lock would have been broken. However, when a Martial Master strengthened a certain part, he would be strengthening the Super Lock.
 This way, the heart fire ape might not be able to break it.
 If he really broke it ... It might be the time for him to break through.
 At this moment, Yuan Shuo made up his mind. The chains around his heart locked onto the large ape.
 "Huchi huchi ..."
 The yells became louder and deafening.
 The big ape roared madly and struggled. It waved its arms and hammered at the chains, not willing to be bound.
 However, the chain was firmly falling toward it.
 Heart lock, heart lock.
 Since it had entered his heart, how could he escape?
 Even though the heart fire ape was extremely powerful, at this moment, it was still suppressed by the giant chain. This sound only rang out in Yuan Shuo's heart.
 A moment later, the heart fire ape was suppressed under a huge chain.
  This was Yuan Shuo's heart.  It was extremely powerful!
 No matter how the heart fire ape struggled, it was to no avail. Its heart beat violently, struggled, and even went berserk.
 Boom ... Boom ... Boom ...
 This was the sound of a heart beating, and it lasted for a long time. Blood was also seeping out from the corner of Yuan Shuo's mouth, but he still revealed a bright smile.
 It was really locked!
 "So ... Before I advance to the next realm, I must strengthen my five organs and strengthen my superpower lock ..."
 He memorized the entire process in his heart.
 All of this had to be passed down.
 He didn't even have time to be happy. Instead, he stared intently and waited for the next change with all his attention. He would pay attention to any change.
 In his heart, the moment the heart fire ape was completely locked, his heart beat faster and his other four internal organs trembled violently and became unstable.
 The balance of the five internal organs had been broken!
 His lungs, spleen ... And other organs were even bleeding slightly. It seemed that the balance had been broken. His heart had become stronger, and the speed of blood flow had increased. As a result, some of these organs could not bear the strengthened heart.
 "Therefore, while subduing one of the internal organs, the other four internal organs must also be strong. Otherwise, they'll be easily broken ..."
 "Super Chain, the stronger the better! Too weak, but once the influence was too strong, it was easy to break the chain. If one was lucky, they could become a super. If you're unlucky, you'll be crushed along with your organs ..."
 He was comprehending all of this. At this moment, the heart fire ape had already stopped struggling.
 However, Yuan Shuo soon noticed something unusual.
 In his heart, the heart fire ape stopped struggling and the chain gradually calmed down. However, not long after, the heart fire ape suddenly came back to life. At this moment, the heart fire ape seemed to be entangled with the Super Chain.
 The giant ape held the chain and suddenly roared in its heart.
 Fire!
 Countless flames appeared in its eyes, and the heart fire ape instantly transformed into a true fire Monkey.
 Yuan Shuo's heart skipped a beat, and the next moment, the power of the five birds erupted.
 The Tiger, deer, bear, and bird forces were still the same as before, but the moment the ape force appeared, it was instantly separated from the other four forces. The powerful fire ape seemed to have appeared out of thin air, and at this moment, it was still wrapped in chains.
 Hualala!
  The sound of chains rang out.
 In the next moment, the heart fire ape was a little violent. It suddenly shot out a chain in the air.
 This attack seemed to have penetrated through matter!
 ……
 In the courtyard.
 Liu Long and the others also sensed something unusual. While they were waiting, Li Hao's expression suddenly changed. He saw a fiery red chain shoot out from the room!
 It carried a powerful aura!
 It wasn't because he had special eyes that he could see it, but because everyone saw it.
 In an instant, both Li Hao and Liu Long jumped and rolled to avoid the chain.
 On the other hand, Wang Ming, who had entered sunlight and glanced at the chain, was a little excited when he saw the chain coming at him, whether it was because he couldn't avoid it or because he didn't think there was a need to.

 They might have thought that Yuan Shuo was testing them!
 Without another word, a golden sword appeared and slashed at the chain!
 Clang!
 A crisp sound was heard, and in the next moment, Yuan Shuo shouted,""Come back!"
 With a bang, the Golden long sword shattered into pieces.
 And the chain was still moving forward. Wang Ming's face changed dramatically, and blood seeped out of his mouth. Just as the chain was about to penetrate his head, it suddenly seemed to be controlled and pulled back!
 The next moment, the door opened.
 Yuan Shuo's face was a little flushed as he walked out and glanced at Wang Ming. After a long while, he said,"What are you doing?"
 At this moment, Wang Ming was still a little scared and scared, and he swallowed his saliva."Teacher ... Isn't he testing us?"
 “……”
  Yuan Shuo was speechless.
 What test!
 In that instant, the heart fire ape was actually still disobedient and still wanted to resist, uncontrollably releasing this attack. Of course, the locked heart fire ape was still controlled by Yuan Shuo and suppressed.
 It was just that he hadn't expected Wang Ming to be so simple-minded ... And stupid!
 What test?
 What was there to test?
 "Congratulations, teacher!"
 At this moment, Li Hao stood up from his roll and casually dusted himself off, his face beaming with joy.
 Was it a success?
 Also, what was that chain just now?
 Dou Qian was only a Martial Master, but the chain just now appeared out of thin air and instantly destroyed riyao's metal-elemental long sword. This did have a hint of superpowers.
 The fiery red chains were related to the heart God?
 While Li Hao was thinking, Yuan Shuo glanced at him, then at Liu Long, who was cupping his hands at him, and smiled.""It's just the beginning. There's nothing to congratulate me about!"
 After saying that, he looked outside and saw that the sky was already bright.
 As for Wang Ming, he also came back to his senses at this time. Wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth, he looked at Yuan Shuo and said in a daze,"Teacher ... What was that?"
 Yuan Shuo was a Martial Master!
 Martial masters often represented one point-they were invincible in close combat and weak in long-range combat.
 He also knew a little about Dou Qian's force.
 However, that chain just now didn't feel like it was momentum.
 Long range attack!
 A douqian Martial Master had actually destroyed his super sword with a long-range attack!
 It was unbelievable!
 At this moment, Wang Ming couldn't quite understand.
 Yuan Shuo glanced at him and said,""Who said martial masters can only attack in close range? You think that I can't do anything to you because you're too far away from me, right?"
 "No... That's not what I meant ..."
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "That's what you mean!"Yuan Shuo laughed.
 Wang Ming was embarrassed.
 He thought that even if he met Yuan Shuo in riyao, he might not be able to defeat him, but at least he could escape from him.
 However ... That blow just now had made him a little dizzy.
 "Alright, you guys can come in!"
  Yuan Shuo didn't say anything more and turned around to return to his room.  Li Hao and the others followed him into the house.
 At this moment, Yuan Shuo's hair was a little messy. He didn't call the others and went to the bathroom to wash his body.
 ……
 As soon as Yuan Shuo left, Wang Ming came to life and said in shock,"That move just now was amazing ... How did teacher do it?"
 The attack from across the air made him unable to fight back at all.
 This was too terrifying!
 Li Hao didn't say anything. Liu Long was also thinking. He was still thinking about the attack just now.
 What kind of secret skill was this?
 He had never seen it before!
 It wasn't a weapon. If it was a weapon, there was no need to be so shocked.
 It felt like a superpower!
 Yuan Shuo had become a superhuman?
 From a warrior of thousands to a superpower, he became a three-Sun Expert in an instant?
 All sorts of thoughts emerged.
 Everyone was silent for a while. After seven or eight minutes, Yuan Shuo walked out and changed his clothes.
 He directly sat down on the chair, his hair still a little wet. When he saw them looking at him, he smiled and said,""What are you looking at? Still thinking? It wasn't a superpower, it was the ability of a Martial Master! I've said it before, a Martial Master is not inferior to a superhuman, but stronger! The heart belongs to the fire element. It may seem like a fire element power, but it's completely different!"
 "Superpowers use mystical powers, while I use force. I'm God!"
 "Divine intent materializing?" Liu Long gasped.
 How was that possible?
 ? Divine intent was only a kind of force, a kind of oppressive force. How could it possibly become material?
 Yuan Shuo glanced at him and said after a long while,""Don't think too much. I'll tell you one thing, inner strength nourishes the five internal organs! Your water power can also nourish your kidneys. "
 Liu Long raised his eyebrows.
 Wang Ming also looked at Liu Long in surprise and shock.
 Liu Long didn't react at first, but after a while, he seemed to have reacted and said with a cold face,"What are you thinking about?"
 Wang Ming coughed dryly.
 He didn't think of anything!
 He smiled embarrassedly and looked at Li Hao. He squinted his eyes as if to say,""Chief's kidney deficiency!"
 Li Hao was speechless.
 Wang Ming didn't understand any of this, and he didn't know what to think.
  Although the teacher didn't say it directly, letting Liu Long nourish his five internal organs, especially his kidney, was already telling him what his next step should be.
 The teacher had succeeded!
 Li Hao was also overjoyed, but before he could say anything, Yuan Shuo said,""You guys go out first. Li Hao, stay here!"
 This was to pass it on to his disciples in private.
 As an in-name disciple, Wang Ming had no way of obtaining the secret impartation at this time.
 Liu Long didn't say anything. He got up and walked out. Liu Yan smiled and followed him out. Wang Ming was still a little unwilling ... What's there that you can't tell me?
 However, after thinking about it, he left obediently.
 ……
 After everyone had left.
 Yuan Shuo said in a deep voice,"your five internal organs must be strong!" He had to be very powerful. Otherwise, he could easily be killed by the backlash. Second, the superpower lock is very strong, but there's a limit to it. It can fuse with the five internal organs. You must judge in advance whether the superpower lock can lock in the power!"

 "Force lock?"
 Yuan Shuo did not say anything. In the next moment, he seemed to have transformed into a giant ape!
 At this moment, a long chain was wrapped around the giant fire ape.
 "Teacher, is this a superpower lock?" Li Hao's eyes twinkled.
 "Right!"
 The fire ape opened its mouth and once again transformed into Yuan Shuo."Or rather, it's not a superpower lock, but a bridge built between the five internal organs and the body ..."
 He fell into deep thought and said after a while,""These chains aren't just for sealing. I feel that they're also connected to all the secret treasures in my body! The human body is a treasure vault. These chains lock up these treasure vaults, but they also have the function of connecting them. "
 "You don't have to interrupt it ... If you do, it means your secret treasure is released."
 Li Hao nodded, deep in thought.
 "Teacher, then are you considered to have advanced in rank now?"
  "It doesn 't!"
 Yuan Shuo shook his head,"today, I've gained more insights and discovered more things." Cultivating the five internal organs at the same time ... Was as difficult as ascending to the heavens! I'm only at the first viscera and soul lock now. Strictly speaking, I haven't advanced to the next level. I'm just one step further in the Qianqian realm, but I haven't officially stepped into that stage yet. "
 "In my opinion, above the thousand-warrior tier should be the accumulation of spirit! The five internal organs contain the spirit!"
 "The accumulation of spirit can be divided into five stages. One internal organ contains one Spirit!"
 Spirit accumulation!
 This was a new realm given by his teacher, nurturing the spirit of the five internal organs. It was just nurturing.
 "When all the spirits of the five internal organs are successfully cultivated, only then will it be the great success of the spirit cultivation. After the spirit cultivation, it is the opening of the secret chambers of the five internal organs, which I would like to call the spirit fusion stage!"
 Slashing ten, breaking hundred, fighting thousand, accumulating spirit, and merging spirit.
 Li Hao thought for a moment."Accumulation of spirit. Is it comparable to three suns?"
 "Barely!"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Don't compare it to superpowers,"Yuan Shuo explained," it doesn't mean much. " Whether or not yunshen can deal with the three suns, whether or not it can be on the same level as the three suns, we will only know after we fight. "
 "However, after entering the spirit nurturing stage, just like me, I'm now nurturing the heart fire ape. I feel that in terms of pure strength, I might not be weaker than the previous Qiao Feilong!"
 Obviously, he felt that it could be compared in this way.
 He was now considered to have stepped into the spirit accumulation level.
 And at this level, the God that nourishes the five internal organs would be amazing if all of them were successful.
 "Teacher is truly a God!" Li Hao exhaled.
 Yuan Shuo's first move this time had broken the inherent realm of martial arts teaching.  Yuan Shuo shook his head."I've only made a General Plan. In fact, there are still many problems. For example, How do I fuse the five viscera and spirit after the spirit accumulation?" We can't use it alone every time, it won't be very useful. "
 "Also, the five internal organs contain the spirit. Do you want to do it together or one by one ... Which is better?"
 "In addition, not everyone can withstand breaking the balance ... If a realm can be recognized by the public, it means that everyone can cultivate it, not just you. A realm that you can cultivate alone is not called a realm!"
 If it couldn't allow others to step into it, it wouldn't be a new realm.
 He continued,"I did absorb a lot of fire elements. When it was combined with your sword energy, others didn 't. How many years would it take to nourish the five internal organs?" Ten years? 20 years? Or 50 years?"
 He couldn't even imagine how long it would take to nourish his five internal organs and withstand Shi if he cultivated bit by bit.
 "Therefore, in the thousand fighting stage, the breathing technique needs to be improved. Not only can it adjust the body, but it can also strengthen the five internal organs!"
 Yuan Shuo said in a deep voice,"the breathing technique of five birds is not enough now. I didn't think it was a big deal when I entered the warrior dimension, but now I'm thinking about how to improve the breathing technique of five birds so that it can nourish the five internal organs with inner strength instead of the five elements. You have to understand that the sword energy ... Is only yours. It's an external object!"
 If this thing was gone, would everyone not advance?
 He's not going to cultivate?
 Therefore, at this moment, Yuan Shuo was thinking about how to modify the breathing technique of five birds so that this fundamental technique could strengthen the five internal organs and allow everyone to cultivate it.
 It wasn't that he wanted to teach it to others, but he had to teach it to his disciples.
 Did they all have to use Li Hao's sword energy?
 His teacher actually had the intention to modify the breathing technique of five animals. At this moment, Li Hao could only admire him. To be honest, he had never considered this at all, because in his opinion, the current sword energy might be enough for the master and disciple.
 Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, had considered the long term.
 What he meant was that he wanted to push the entire Martial Master realm forward.
  Was that even possible?
 Li Hao didn't argue. He couldn't support his teacher's decision, nor could he stop him.
 This was because they were no longer on the same level!
 "You actually have a very good foundation ... You have been strengthening your five internal organs all this time. At this stage, you won't be able to show anything. When you reach the warrior energy level, you will be able to save a lot of time compared to others. You can even directly accumulate spirit!"
 "You're right." Yuan Shuo was filled with emotion as well."Perhaps, you'll surpass me one day ... The nourishment of my other four internal organs might not be as good as yours."
 "Teacher, you can also absorb the sword energy and quickly nourish it!"
 Yuan Shuo smiled and threw the small sword to Li Hao."Feel it!"
 Li Hao took the small sword and used the five animals breathing technique. After a while, he said helplessly,""You're almost done?"
 It seemed to be almost gone!
 Yuan Shuo let out a dry cough."These days, my heart can't take it anymore, so I've inhaled a little more. I didn't have time to look for the other stone doors, so I only have a little left. I didn't dare to inhale all of it. When we go to the Hengduan Canyon, we might need it. At least, I'll save some to save my life."

 He was really almost done!
 Recently, Li Hao and Yuan Shuo had used up a lot of the sword energy that they had absorbed at the stone gate. They were about to run out.
 Alright!
 Li Hao now knew why his teacher wanted to modify the breathing technique of five birds. If he didn't modify it now, he would use up all the swords in the other ruins of the stone gate.
 Yuan Shuo didn't say anything else. In fact, he was a little embarrassed.
 But at that time, his heart couldn't withstand the pressure of Shi, so he had to absorb the sword energy to save his life. There was still hope for him to replenish the sword energy, but if he died, Li Hao would be in even more trouble.
 Then, Yuan Shuo explained the problems, troubles, and situations that he might encounter during the process of spirit accumulation.
 Perhaps only Yuan Shuo had the experience of such things.
 As for whether there were any other douqian martial masters in the other regions who had reached this level ... It was hard to say. Even if there were, they might not be the same, and the path they took might not be the same.
 ……
  The master and disciple chatted for about half an hour.
 After a while, the two of them walked out of the house.
 Outside, Liu Long and the others were chatting ... In fact, it was mainly Wang Ming who was chatting. He had a lot to say, so he asked endless questions.
 Seeing Li Hao and the others come out, Wang Ming said excitedly,"Teacher, did you break through the 10000 mark?"
 “……”
 Where did he get over 10000?
 Yuan Shuo shook his head.
 Wang Ming was instantly a little disappointed. No, it was such a pity!
 After all, he was Yuan Shuo's in-name disciple. If Yuan Shuo really entered the next level of Martial Master, he could at least pull some connections and find a strong backer.
 Liu Long, on the other hand, glanced at Yuan Shuo but did not ask anything.
 Yuan Shuo had asked him to nourish his five internal organs the moment they met. He vaguely understood that this might be related to his next step.
 After entering the battle of thousands, Liu Long was actually very confused.
 What should he do next?
 How could he go further?
 He still had a lot of room for improvement when he first entered the Qian dynasty, such as powerful momentum and powerful inner strength. He had just started on these paths, but these were all things that would happen sooner or later. Sooner or later, his inner strength would be so powerful that it could not be any stronger.
 The momentum would also grow to the point where it could no longer grow.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com What happened after that?
 There was no way out!
 Yuan Shuo had given him a hint today.
 "Elder Yuan, are we leaving today?"
 Liu Long didn't say much about this."Minister Kuang and the others have arrived at the Hengduan Canyon a long time ago. It will take at least a day for us to get there from here. There might be some trouble on the way. When we get to the vicinity of the Hengduan Canyon, we have to walk ... It's too late. I'm afraid we can 't."
 Time was running out.
 If he went, he would at least need to recuperate.
 He was afraid that Yuan Shuo was unable to move at this moment. After being in seclusion for so many days, he had consumed a lot of energy.
  "Let's go, just bring some food!"  "Hao lianchuan is probably waiting impatiently," Yuan Shuo laughed."I'm afraid he's cursing now!"
 The day after tomorrow was the agreed time for the exploration. The others might have already arrived, but he, Yuan Shuo, had not. It would be strange if he did not curse!
 Liu Long also laughed, thinking that it was really possible.
 ……
 At the same time.
 Hengduan Canyon.
 In one of the tents, Hao lianchuan was indeed scolding someone. He was very angry."Find a way to send a message to the Silver City. What is Yuan Shuo doing?"
 He didn't seem to have moved yet!
 It was already the 26th, and silver City was thousands of miles away from here. The road wasn't easy to walk, and this group of people couldn't fly. When they reached the place, they might have to walk ... Were they going to arrive at a critical time?
 However, the journey of becoming a Martial Master was quite exhausting. Wouldn't he be asking for trouble then?
 He didn't understand. Was Yuan Shuo so arrogant that he forgot that martial masters couldn't fly?
 Was he counting on his flying bird technique to fly a thousand miles?
 On the side, a middle-aged woman heard this and laughed,""Hao bu, don't be impatient! "Besides, if Yuan Shuo doesn't come, the other guilds won't dare to rashly explore. After all, Yuan Shuo is an expert in this field ..."
 Hao lianchuan did not say anything, but he cursed in his heart.
 He said it so simply!
 The key was that the 28th was the most suitable time to explore. This was also the reason why they had specially set this time. If they missed the 28th, it would be best to wait for another month.
 Who knew what would happen in this one month?
 Below Hao lianchuan, a strong man said in a muffled voice,""Do you want me to pick it up? Or should Huang Yun go over to pick it up?"
 Huang Yun's speed was fast, while he was skilled in escaping through the earth.
 "No need!"
 Hao lianchuan shook his head and said in a low voice,"it's not convenient to leave now. We're all keeping an eye on each other. If you leave, be careful of those guys assassinating you."
 As for Yuan Shuo, he was not in great danger.
 First, the experts had left, and the commotion would not be small.
  Secondly, everyone hoped that Yuan Shuo could participate in the exploration. They probably would not attack him for the time being.
 Hao lianchuan exhaled and did not continue. Instead, he said with a heavy tone,""Did you see sun Yifei?"
 "No! However, I heard that someone saw him in the transverse Canyon ... I think he was at the bridge ..."
 Only then did Hao lianchuan reveal his true worry.
 Sun Yifei...Wouldn't attack Yuan Shuo without waiting for the exploration to start, right?
 If that was the case, a war would probably break out before they even entered the ruins. The night patrolmen would definitely not let Yuan Shuo be killed so easily.
 It was really a big problem!
 Someone also thought of this and sighed,""Back then, the Silver Moon martial forest was messed up by these people, and people died every day. Now that sun Yifei and Yuan Shuo are back ... The chaos in the Silver Moon martial forest won't happen again, right?"
 For a moment, everyone was speechless.
 Some people hadn't forgotten what had happened decades ago!

 Silver City.
 Li Hao and the others got into the car. This time, Liu Long was the one driving. There was still some distance, after all, and Liu Long was worried about Li Hao and Wang Ming.
 In the car, there were four people and a dog.
 Heibao got into the car, but Li Hao and Yuan Shuo didn't care.
 If Heibao didn't go, he would be a stray dog.
 If he could come back, he would. If he couldn 't, then they would both die there.
 In the front passenger seat.
 Liu Yan was in charge of telling them the information. Some of it was from the night patrolmen, while some of it was from the silver Blizzard city.
 ……
 "The crosscut Canyon is more than a thousand li away from us. It's very long, at least a thousand li. The canyon is said to be difficult for birds to cross. It's more than 300 meters deep and tens of meters high in the shallow places. "
  "There are stone cliffs on both sides, and there are some historical sites in the canyon. It is said that during the ancient civilization, there might have been a city there. Later, the ground collapsed and the entire city was buried in the canyon."
 "This time, there are three major organizations, Silver moon's branch, and two other medium-sized organizations. In addition, there are 14 small organizations."
 "We can't rule out the possibility that there are other independent supers involved!"
 Liu Yan turned around and glanced at Li Hao. Wang Ming and Yuan Shuo should know the situation, but Li Hao might not. She explained,"According to the intelligence, it's a medium-sized organization. It can only be called a medium-sized organization if it has three suns! There was also sunlight, which was a small organization. During this exploration, the strength of the mid-sized organizations might not be weaker than the three large organizations. The three large organizations 'main forces are not in Silver Moon, but the mid-sized organizations might send out their main forces!"
 Li Hao knew that she was talking to him, so he nodded.
 Liu Yan continued, one of them is from the island of light and the other is from the swords gate.
 Li Hao nodded again. Yuan Shuo suddenly interjected,""The sword Master of swords gate should be one of the Seven Swords of Silver Moon martial arts world, the earth-covered sword, Chi Hongyi Tang."
 "Teacher, you know him?"
 Li Hao's words didn't mean that they knew each other, but ... That they had a grudge?
 Just say it directly!
 You've already killed three of the seven Swords of the Silver Moon, and Li Hao has obtained the inheritance of the Shadowless Sword.
 What he wanted to know now was how deep the hatred between the two of you was.
 Yuan Shuo obviously understood what he meant and said angrily,""No grudges! I'm not familiar with him. That guy was rather low-key back then. The other Seven Swords were somewhat high-profile and mysterious. The earth overturning sword was neither too high nor too low, neither too outstanding nor too ostentatious. This kind of person died very few times back then, so not many people came to kill him!"
 “……”
 Everyone was speechless.
 To kill him?
 Did you all do the same thing back then, directly killing your way to the door?  Liu Long, who was driving, also said,""The sword head of swords gate is Hong Yitang? The information didn't show it. Speaking of which, my father still had some connection with the Earthcover sword back then ..."
 Yuan Shuo replied indifferently,"don't try to get close to him. It's useless!" Besides, your father, Liu Hao, has been dead for many years. Even if we have any friendship, it's long gone!"
 A person died like a lamp going out.
 In the martial arts world, unless one was a close friend, there would be no such thing as a relationship after so many years of death.
 Liu Long didn't say anything else.
 Li Hao couldn't help but ask,"does this mean that many of the Martial Master powerhouses have become super powerhouses?"
 "Why are there so few of them among the night watchers?" he asked.
 Whether it was Hao lianchuan or hou Xiaochen, he had never heard of any famous martial masters.
 Yuan Shuo remained silent.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Wang Ming, on the other hand, whispered,"that ... I know a little. Back then, Silver Moon martial forest was in chaos and turmoil. Even in the early stages of the rise of superpowers, martial masters went around killing. When the night watchers were established, the higher-ups 'orders were ... To try not to recruit martial masters!"
 There was even a period of time when the star dynasty explicitly banned martial arts!
 It was all because of the martial masters. These martial masters weren't like the superpowers of today, who wanted to rule the world. Martial masters weren't interested in these things, but these people were even more unscrupulous and ostentatious.
 For the title of the world's number one, they were willing to kill until corpses covered the ground.
 If you kill me today, I'll kill you tomorrow!
 At that time, the night patrollers did not dare to recruit martial masters.
 Therefore, there were not many martial masters among the night watchers. However, some supernatural organizations were open to anyone. Some supernatural organizations were even founded by martial masters.
  They chatted for a while before Liu Yan continued,""This time, the three major organizations will definitely send three suns experts. As for the exact number and who they are, we don't have any information. There was a high chance that the two medium-sized organizations would also send three suns. As for the 14 small organizations, I'm sure there are a lot of them in sunlight. "
 "As for the night watchers, Hao bu is currently leading the team. There are seven sun glory powerhouses."
 The formation of the night patrollers was not small.
 Yuan Shuo was currently resting with his eyes closed. After Liu Yan roughly explained the situation, Yuan Shuo opened his eyes and said, "Don't just focus on the people, there's also the ruins itself!"
 "Three years ago, I explored the ruins and almost died there!"
 The injury to his heart was caused by that.
 He had almost died.
 "At that time, a sunlit man led the team but he also died there. There were also a few dark moons. You have to know that three years ago, the sunlit was still very valuable. Superpowers developed rapidly and after three years, there was hope for the sunlit to enter the three suns!"
 On the side, Wang Ming seemed to have thought of something and immediately said,"Yes, yes, yes. I just joined the night patrolman three years ago. At that time, a top-notch powerhouse and several Dark Moon cultivators died ..."
 "This is ..." Yuan Shuo ignored him and continued,"this ancient ruin ... Is not an ordinary ancient ruin. It's an ancient city!"

 There were also big and small ruins.
 A tomb was also called a relic.
 This time, it was a city!
 Of course, with the size of the ruins, the rewards and opportunities were also great.
 "Ancient city?"
 Liu Long Drove the car, his eyes fixed on the car, and he said solemnly,""Underground city?"
 "Yes!"
 Yuan Shuo replied calmly,"it's an underground city. It's buried, but it still looks like the city. This city is not simple. There's a treasure that envelops the entire city. It's also what the night patrolman wants!"
 It was a buried city. More importantly, the entire city had been preserved because there was a treasure that prevented the soil and rocks from destroying the city.
 "This ..." Liu Long was slightly shocked."A treasure can really protect a large city. After so many years, under the vicissitudes of the world, can it still preserve the city?"
 This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "It's true. "
 Yuan Shuo nodded and said,"such a treasure really exists!" That's why the entire Silver Moon superpower realm is going crazy over it. Even if the Nightwatchers and the three major organizations are at odds and the central continent is in a bloody battle, they're still willing to explore this place together. "
 "The benefits are moving. How many good things are there in such a well-preserved city?"
 "Ancient books, origin divine weapons, ancient civilization technology, ancient civilization martial arts, ancient civilization superpowers ... I might be able to find them all. There are also some incredibly powerful treasures. "
 Yuan Shuo seemed to have thought of something and muttered,""Back then, I once excavated an ancient site. That ancient site wasn't very big. Guess what I excavated that time?"
 The crowd did not know, but they all listened.
 "A tree!"
 Yuan Shuo sighed,"it's a tree that has been buried for countless years. The tree has long withered and died, leaving only the trunk." In the beginning, no one paid any attention to it, but who knew that someone would accidentally break the tree trunk ... At that moment, everyone felt a kind of power ... The power of life!"
 Yuan Shuo was a little emotional and eager."We saw a drop of water, a different drop of water, buried in the middle of the tree trunk. The moment the tree trunk was opened, the drop of water quickly dissipated. However, the energy that seeped out caused some of the old trees in the surroundings to instantly sprout branches and spread leaves, instantly growing into towering trees. All of us who were present felt like we were 10 years younger after being swept by this aura!"
 "I can't believe it." Yuan Shuo sighed."I was able to maintain my peak condition at the age of 70. If I wasn't injured, I might have even stepped into the Qian dynasty. This is also related to that drop of water. This is a treasure left behind by the ancient civilization!"
 Everyone's heart surged with excitement as they listened!
 A drop of water that had been sealed for tens of millions of years actually made a person younger the moment it overflowed. It also made a tree instantly grow into a towering tree.
 What kind of treasure was this?
 It was unimaginable!  For a Martial Master, a 70-year-old was indeed going downhill. However, when Yuan Shuo was 70 years old, he was still thinking of stepping into the Qian warrior realm. It was a pity that he was injured. Otherwise, he might have succeeded long ago.
 "Elder Yuan, is there such a treasure in this ancient city?" Liu Long asked in a deep voice.
 "I'm not sure, but there might be. "
 "This ancient city hasn't been developed yet," Yuan Shuo said."We can't enter it ... Well, we can't say that. We should have entered the outer city, but it's just the outer city, and many of us died."
 "The outer city? What's the source of the danger?"
 Liu Long continued to ask around. These things, perhaps only Yuan Shuo knew, and others might not even tell him.
 Yuan Shuo recalled for a moment and was a little uncertain at the moment. After a moment, he said,""It's hard to say exactly what it was. That day, when we entered it together, there was a sudden explosion and many people were burned to death! This was just the beginning. Not long after, countless sharp blades shot out from the darkness, killing many people as well. "
 "In the end, when it was just me and that sunlight, I heard footsteps ..."
 Footsteps?
 A living person!
 The few of them were shocked!
 There were living people in the city?
 How was that possible?
  How old was this ancient civilization city?
 No one was sure because it was impossible to judge. The date recorded in the ancient books had long been cut off from this era. It was now the Xingyuan calendar.
 Such a large city, even if it was completely preserved, it was impossible for anyone to exist, right?
 It would have been rotten to the bones!
 "It's indeed the sound of footsteps ... Of course, it could be a puppet."
 Yuan Shuo couldn't be sure if it was a living person or a puppet, so he said solemnly,""In short, we only heard the sound and didn't see the real person. "However, we were attacked. The existence in the darkness attacked us! It was very powerful. I saw a flash of light, and that sunlight was killed! At that time, I quickly escaped from the scene, and while I was running, I couldn't care about the danger. As a result, a sharp blade pierced through my heart ... Fortunately, I'm a Martial Master, and my inner strength has the effect of nourishing. I hurriedly sealed the gap in my heart, and I was lucky enough to escape!"
 He sighed,'this damn place ... I didn't want to come. "But I had to come. Over the years, the night patrollers sent people in again, but only a few survived. Most of them didn't find anything, so they hoped that I could help them explore again."
 "Teacher, so you didn't see anything?" Li Hao frowned.
 "I also saw some things."
 Yuan Shuo laughed."In the beginning, we actually saw a lot of things. There was even light at the beginning. We saw the entire city! The darkness only appeared later. It seemed that the lights in the city were turned off. I heard from the night patrolmen that when they went back later, it was completely dark!"

 "In short, even if you go, you have to be careful, more careful."
 At this point, Yuan Shuo hesitated for a moment, but he still said,""I'll tell you a little secret. You're not allowed to tell anyone!"
 Everyone nodded.
 "After you enter, be careful and try not to leave the ground!"
 Off the ground?
 What did that mean?
 "Not leaving the ground?" Wang Ming said hurriedly,"don't tell me you're just standing there and not moving?"
 "I don't mean it that way."
 "It's to try not to fly in the air,"Yuan Shuo said softly," I suspect that this ancient city has some restrictions that prohibit flying. Many people died that day, and I concluded that it might have something to do with them flying in the air or jumping ... I'm not saying that they can't leave the ground at all, but there must be a limit. Also, pay attention to the sound of footsteps nearby. "
 A city that might ban flying.
  Anyone who broke the rules would be killed.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It had been buried for countless years, but it could still be used. Such a technology was simply terrifying.
 The city today could not do this.
 Even if there was a flight and martial prohibition order, it was only a manual inspection. If they saw it, it would count. If they couldn't catch it, it didn't count.
 "Don't tell anyone about this!"
 Yuan Shuo said meaningfully,"we've more or less found out about the night patrolmen. However, this is the first time many of the other organizations are investigating. We'll just kill them one by one!"
 The crowd nodded again.
 This was the benefit of experience. Yuan Shuo did not die there, so he had some gains.
 "Not only that, but there's also a lot of danger involved," Yuan Shuo continued. "Danger can appear anywhere. Remember one more thing, don't touch anything. Even if you see the weapons and treasures of the ancient civilization, don't touch them for the time being. If you move, you might be in danger. "
 "I can't move?"
 Wang Ming said disappointedly,"then what's the point of exploring? if we can't touch the treasure after finding it, isn't that just sending ourselves to our deaths?"
 What was the point of that?
 "Their target is the city! They believed that there was a control core in the city, which might be the origin god weapon that covered the entire city! If they take away that origin divine weapon, all the benefits will naturally go to them. Besides, everyone's main goal is probably that origin divine weapon. "
 An origin god weapon that could cover the entire city and could still operate after being suppressed underground for countless years, how powerful was it?
 Some superpower organizations only lacked a stable base.
 Once it was effective, even the city-destroying weapons of the night patrollers could withstand it. Then, the superpower organization could quickly build a large city and migrate some people. In this way, they would have a stable rear and make a real name for themselves!  And now, these organizations were all very mysterious.
 One of the important reasons was that they did not dare to expose their base.
 The sunlit three suns might be able to escape being locked on and not be killed by firearms, but the weak could not. If the weak were all dead, the organization would be destroyed and their future would be cut off. With only a few powerhouses, what was the need for the organization?
 Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"in that case, everyone's target is the origin God weapons in the city. I can understand if it's a medium-sized organization. But what about a small one?" Does sunlight also want to take the origin god weapon?"
 In your dreams!
 Yuan Shuo shook his head."That's not it. These guys 'main target is the treasures in the city. When the big organizations take the origin God weapons, they'll naturally get a share." Besides, they didn't know that they couldn't touch those treasures ... They were all here for these. Not only that, if there's a chance to seize the origin god weapon ... Why not?"
 Yuan Shuo chuckled."If I can really take it away, I'll just abandon everything. What organization? what hometown? I'll just take the origin divine weapon and leave. I'll hide for a while. When I'm strong enough, I'll appear again. Who would dare to provoke me? Therefore, some people came with the same thought. "
 Li Hao was well aware of the benefits of an origin god weapon.
 Take the starry sky sword for example. Putting aside the sword itself, the sword energy contained in it was already incredible. Li Hao's rapid progress and Yuan Shuo's advancement into the spirit accumulation stage were all related to the small sword.
 An origin god weapon that could cover the entire city was obviously incredibly powerful.
 To be able to block dirt and rocks for countless years and withstand the pressure of hundreds of millions of tons of dirt and rocks, what if it could protect a person?
 Did it mean that no one in the world today could break through such a defense?
 His defense was invincible!
 Li Hao thought to himself, and then thought of what his teacher had told him that night. This ancient city might have some connection to the eight great families, and he seemed to have seen a turtle at the gate of the outer city.
 Yes, a turtle.
  In the folk songs of the eight great families, there was a line that said,"the Wang family is raising a big turtle."
 Although it was very strange to connect the eight great families with the ancient city through a turtle.
 However, during the ancient civilization era, if the eight great families were very powerful, the Silver City would only be a thousand miles away from here. How could such an ancient city have no relationship with the Silver City?
 It was a thousand miles now ... Perhaps they were very close to each other during the ancient civilization?
 In addition, if the experts in the ancient civilization were as powerful as the swordsman Li Hao saw, a thousand miles would be nothing.
 The supers of the modern era could fly a thousand miles in two to three hours.
 What about the experts of that period?
 Could it be reached in an instant!
 That thousand miles was not a barrier.
 Thus, when his teacher said that this city might be related to the eight great families, and that the origin god weapon might be the turtle of the Wang family, Li Hao had been thinking about what he could do this time.

 "Stone gate, ancient city ..."
 At this moment, he was still wondering if the stone gate had anything to do with this ancient city.
 His teacher guessed that there were eight stone gates.
 The stone door he saw last time was either a turtle shell or a hammer. It was round. Could the turtle shell here be the key to opening the stone door?
 While they were talking, the carriage had already left Silver City.
 Since he was young, Li Hao had rarely left the Silver City.
 When his parents were still around when he was a child, he had actually been to the neighboring city. After he grew up, he had always stayed in Silver City. He was probably the least experienced among them.
 The car drove out of the Silver City.
 The road was still there, and it was a rather wide main road.
 The car was also driving very smoothly.
  Wang Ming knew that Li Hao wasn't very knowledgeable, so he laughed and said,""Looking at you, haven't you seen it before? This was a road built by the star dynasty a few years ago. At that time, the hope Road ran through 99 provinces, making it convenient for the dynasty to control it at any time. But after the rise of superpowers, it was a mess. Some places were not repaired and were interrupted. Some places have been repaired, but after so many years, there has been no opportunity, no manpower, and no resources to repair or maintain them. So now, many roads in various places are not working. "
 "There are also some people who deliberately destroyed the great Dao, hoping to escape from the control of the star dynasty."
 Wang Ming sighed," 99 provinces, how many people are there!?" With a population of nearly ten billion, a province is like a world. Some of the officials have long wanted to be independent. "
 "Silver Moon is located at the borders, so it's rare for it to be so quiet."
 The border ...
 Ninety-nine provinces were already very, very large, covering more than half of the world.
 However, it did not mean that the territory was limitless.
 To the North of the Silver Moon province, across a few mountains, was another country. However, people living in the star dynasty rarely paid attention to it.
 In the earlier years ... Or perhaps a hundred years ago, there were still Wars.
 Therefore, Silver City was the core of Silver Moon province at that time. It was a city of war and had even fought with the neighboring country.
 However, in the past hundred years, both sides had been completely isolated.
 The Silver City was no longer a strategic location. Even the star dynasty had almost forgotten that there were other countries on the other side of the mountain.
 The status of the Borderlands had also been greatly reduced.
 There were no more enemies. What else could the border represent other than being remote?
 Who would care about a small country that had not dared to invade for a hundred years?  The other's territory was said to be smaller than Silver Moon province.
 Even Li Hao had only read about him in some books. His father's generation and his grandfather's generation had never had any contact with him, nor had there been any war.
 He had a vague impression that the country behind the mountain range was called the great li.
 As for why it was called this, what system it was, how many people there were, and whether superpowers would appear ... None of that was known.
 No one cared!
 There had been no war in the past hundred years, and there were still a few tall mountains between them. It was almost like two different worlds. The 99 provinces of the star dynasty were not peaceful, so who had the time to care about the other side?
 Even a province like silver Moon, which was located within the territory of the star dynasty, did not receive much attention in the past few years. If it were not for the fact that some of the Silver Moon experts were still active, they would have long been forgotten. The star dynasty actually had a Silver Moon province.
 These thoughts appeared in Li Hao's mind.
 He looked at the undulating Plains on both sides and saw some hares shuttling through the road. Some of the trees were withered and some were broken. No one would probably come to maintain this road.
 "Silver Moon isn't too chaotic, but why is the management of the city's exterior so lax?"
 Li Hao asked. Other people might know about this, but he really didn 't.
 Wang Ming lived in Whitemoon city, and his family was considered powerful, so he knew about these things." 20 years ago, superpowers appeared and the night watchers were formed. When the night patrollers were first established, they didn't have much of an impact. But as the stronger ones got stronger, the night patrollers gradually needed the right to speak. "
 "As for the original Administrative Bureau, the garrison headquarters, there were some conflicts with the night patrols. Although the scale was not large, there were still some conflicts, especially over at the administrative Bureau. The administrative Bureau is directly under the dynasty, but the night patrols belong to the inspection Division. The two sides are not in the same system. The administrative Bureau has always wanted to take over the night patrols, but there have been a few conflicts ..."
 Li Hao listened quietly. It seemed that the struggle for power was inevitable at any time.
  "Has the star dynasty lost control of the major provinces?"
 Li Hao asked again.
 Wang Ming smiled and said,"I don't know. It's said that more than twenty provinces in the central region are still under the dynasty's control!" However, apart from these provinces, the dynasty is unable to control the other regions. "
 Three quarters of the area was out of control!
 It was beyond Li Hao's expectations!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He had originally thought that only one province was in chaos. He did not expect that other than the 20 provinces, the rest of the provinces were out of control.
 The star dynasty ... Was the first Dynasty in history to completely unify the world. The so-called unification was not the size of a few provinces, but the entire central region, the entire world ... Was ruled!
 As for the remote and small countries, such as the Li Dynasty, they were separated by many mountains and were small, not worth ruling over.
 It was said that when the country was first established, it took 50 years to conquer this world.
 The dynasty had been established for almost 200 years, and the royal family had already retired behind the scenes.

 80 years ago, the star dynasty had introduced the system of nine divisions co-governance.
 The royal family retreated behind the scenes and enjoyed all kinds of glory and treatment, but they no longer participated in the actual management.
 The entire dynasty was managed by the nine divisions.
 One of them was the Inspector General!
 Of course, it wasn't a small branch like silver City, but the headquarters of the inspection Bureau. The night patrolmen were still under the name of the inspection Bureau, which showed how powerful the inspection Bureau was. The military power of the entire dynasty was on par with the garrison.
 Of course, the garrison was only for Silver Moon, and it was under the jurisdiction of the military law.
 The dynasty's military power was under the jurisdiction of the military law Division.
 The inspection Division was mainly in charge of local law and order. They were not as good as the other party in some aspects, but they had more things to manage and more people to deal with all aspects of the dynasty.
 Next to him, Wang Ming continued,"the night patrollers are still the only official superpower organization, but I heard that the central continent has already started to set up other organizations!" This includes the star Army, which is formed by the military court. It's said that all the supers are there. "
 "The Division of Administration has also set up an inspector's office. I heard that they're also recruiting superhumans."
  "The Department of Commerce has also set up a business protection Security Committee and is also absorbing superpowers ..."
 Li Hao listened quietly. This was the general trend of the world!
 However, in the past, he wouldn't have paid attention to it, nor would he have cared.
 He hadn't even run around the small silver City, let alone the entire world. It was too big!
 How many people had never left a small city in their entire lives?
 Even if they did, how many people would never be able to leave Silver Moon?
 As for the central region, the nine divisions, and the royal family ... They were too far away from them.
 At this moment, when he heard this, he said,""Why don't we strengthen the night patrols?"
 "Hehe!"
 Wang Ming smiled.
 Yuan Shuo and the others also laughed.
 Liu Long could not help but say,"this is called balance!" The inspection Division is only one of the nine divisions. When the night patrols were first established, their superpowers weren't too strong. It didn't matter then, but now that their superpowers are getting stronger, do you think the other eight divisions will be at ease leaving their superpowers to the inspection Division?"
 Alright!
 Li Hao actually understood this.
 However, he thought that they should gather their forces when facing the large organizations. Now, they were somewhat scattered.  "Are the three major organizations that powerful?"
 Li Hao frowned again."There are 99 provinces in the world, and most of them are under the command of the nine divisions. With the addition of firearms of mass destruction, they can't even take down the three great organizations?"
 "It's not that simple!"
 At this moment, the one who spoke was Yuan Shuo. He was more knowledgeable and said softly,""We're not too sure how strong the three major organizations are. However, the three major organizations were definitely supported by the power of some provinces! It was used to bring chaos to the central region and to restrict the power of the dynasty, in preparation for their independence. Intelligence, weapons, manpower, and resources would all be provided to the three major organizations! The three organizations are all supers, and they do things secretly. They have many powerhouses, so it's naturally difficult to destroy them!"
 The reason for the power of superpowers was not that simple.
 The most important thing was that there was someone behind it.
 The dynasty had been unified for 200 years and ruled over 10 billion people. At this moment, the world was in chaos and the dynasty was out of control. Many ambitious big shots wanted the world to be more chaotic and the dynasty to go out of control completely!
 This was something that many people knew.
 But so what if he knew?
 Putting aside the fact that there was no evidence, even if there was evidence, those important figures who were preparing to rebel against the dynasty had already made some preparations. If they rashly moved against them, it would quickly cause a chain reaction.
 The entire world collapsed in an instant.
 Li Hao actually didn't quite understand these people's thoughts. He could only lament,""If you're not in your position, don't scheme for your government! In my opinion, it's already very good for the nine divisions to rule together. It was said that 80 years ago, the royal family was still in control. Back then, it was truly chaotic. The royal family's authority was unrestricted, and they killed innocents and convicted criminals at will. The laws were not clear ... That was what chaotic times were! "But now, the nine divisions rule the world together. Commerce is booming, agriculture is developed, and urbanization is accelerating. Everyone can eat and drink to their hearts 'content, and all kinds of technology are improving ..."
 At this time, what was the point of overthrowing the world?
 When the world was in chaos, it was the common people who were in chaos.
  He didn't have much of a bad impression of the nine divisions. Although it was unfair and had its own problems, the nine divisions had ruled the world for 80 years. In these 80 years, at least he had never heard of anyone starving to death in the Silver City.
 And 80 years ago ... Wasn't it normal for people to starve to death?
 The royal family was now restricted. Although they still had many privileges, they were not as flamboyant as they were in the past and were extremely low-key. Wasn't such a system good?
 Could it be that the important figures still wanted to be the next emperor?
 However, would the common people who had experienced the co-governance of the nine divisions be willing to have an Emperor above their heads?
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao was sure that if he went out and asked if they were willing to let the royal family manage the world again ... About 99% of people would not be willing. The remaining people were either stupid or were related to the interests.
 If he didn't win the hearts of the people, would he succeed?
 He thought to himself, but he didn't say it out loud.
 These were matters that were too distant for him to consider, and they were all matters that were considered by important people. As for Silver Moon, he did not feel that the man had any signs of independence, perhaps because his status was too low, so he simply did not know what Silver moon's upper echelons were thinking.
 The car quickly drove away, and silver City was getting further and further away, gradually disappearing behind them.

 "A car is coming!"
 Outside the valley, less than 50 li away from the valley, the road was already damaged. The road that could pass through the valley in the past had come to an end. The bridge that was further away had been blown up.
 Back then, they had paid a huge price to build a bridge across the transverse Canyon, but it was destroyed more than ten years ago, cutting off the north and south of Silver Moon.
 In the past, the Hengduan heavenly bridge was still there, and the Silver Moon was connected from the north to the south. The southern and northern cities exchanged for what they needed, and the business was booming.
 Now, the north and south were divided, causing the entire Silver Moon to be in a somewhat depressed state.
 Silver Moon had tried to rebuild the heavenly bridge several times, but they had all failed. Today, fewer and fewer people mentioned rebuilding the heavenly bridge.
 At that moment, at the end of the road, someone stared at the car and whispered.
 "Rob?"
 "You're courting death! Can't you see that's the inspector's car?"
 "So what if it's the inspection Office ...? The inspection Office doesn't care about this!"
  Behind the huge rock, a few people whispered.
 The inspection Office was famous.
 However, that was within the city. Outside the city, so what if it was the inspection Office?
 In recent years, with the rise of superpowers, the inspector's office was no longer as impressive as it was before. There were almost all the night patrols here, but even they had to be careful in the wilderness.
 A few martial masters and star light Masters whispered among themselves. In this day and age, those who dared to Rob in the wild were not ordinary people.
 Some martial masters and Starlight Masters, who were weak and unwilling to be bound, began to Rob and Rob.
 If they were lucky, they might be able to snatch some good things.
 Of course, if one was unlucky and met with an expert, they could only admit defeat and admit that they were unlucky. If they wanted to kill or cut him up, they could only do so.
 The few of them were still talking when the next moment, they suddenly felt that there was no sound around them.
 When he turned around, his face instantly turned pale. Just as he was about to escape, a stick fell directly, instantly smashing his head into pieces!
 Three people walked out from behind the huge rock.
 The two men and one woman were all very young.
 On the ground, there were seven or eight corpses.
 Some of them were killed by the stick, while others had their throats crushed.
 Sun moxian walked at the front. He looked at the car in the distance and said softly,""Is it them?"
 "It should be!"
 The woman said in a low voice.
 The youngest ten decapitation realm expert frowned and said,""Master, why don't you just come over and kill this Yuan Shuo? why do you want us to issue a letter of challenge?"
 Yes, a letter of challenge.
 Sun Yifei didn't come directly, and he didn't even have the intention to hide.
 He had his disciple wait for Yuan Shuo at the path that they had to pass.
 He wanted to openly declare war!
 Sun moxian said softly,"this is a habit in the realm of martial masters. Little Junior Brother, You Must Remember This!" Back then, master challenged old demon Yuan but was defeated on the heavenly bridge. Master has a demon in his heart ..."
  "Inner demons?"  "The inner demon is not what you think it is, or rather, it's a knot in my heart. Master lost to Yuan Shuo and left to become a three sun superhuman, but in the martial Dao, he still carries the name of the loser! He wants to get back at him ... Only by openly challenging old demon Yuan and defeating him can he wash away the shame of the past!"
 "But ..."
 The junior Brother of the tenth realm didn't quite understand. Was it necessary?
 This was different from the style of the central region.
 In the central region, strength was King. As long as they won, there was no need for a letter of challenge. Whether it was a sneak attack or an assassination, the dead had no right to speak.
 His master was stronger than Yuan Shuo, and if he came over and killed him with a single strike, who would dare say that his master was inferior?
 "This is the rule of the Silver Moon martial forest!"
 Sun moxian once again emphasized his tone and said in a low voice,""Later, be more polite."
 "What?"
 Behind them, a man and a woman were acting strangely. Be more polite?
 As the eldest senior brother of their martial path, sun moxian had no choice but to remind them,""This is Yuan Shuo, old demon Yuan ... He's ruthless and killed half of Silver Moon martial forest's people back then! We're here to challenge him, not to die. If he thinks we're not polite enough and kills us, then even if master kills him, we'll die in vain!"
 The two of them took a deep breath. That was true.
 This was the old devil!
 An existence that had killed countless people.
 The three of them didn't say anything else and began to wait.
 The car in front of them gradually stopped. The road was too bumpy, so they might as well walk.
 A moment later, four people and a dog got out of the car together.
 ……
 Liu Long was in front, and Yuan Shuo was behind him.
 After walking for a while, Liu Long looked into the distance and frowned,""There's the smell of blood!"
 As soon as they arrived near the transverse Canyon, they smelled blood.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com There were very few people here. Did a battle between supers erupt?
  Yuan Shuo didn't say anything. He just looked in that direction and continued walking.
 As for Li Hao, he also glanced around and didn't see any light orbs. He knew that there shouldn't be any supers, so he didn't say anything. Even if there were people, they would either be ordinary people or martial masters.
 Wang Ming was rather bold as he laughed and said,"What are you afraid of? with our strength, even three suns will die!"
 One douqian who had killed three suns, one douqian, one sunlight, and two others who had broken through 100 suns. With such strength, they could be unscrupulous no matter where they were.
 Of course, it was hard to say in the central region. There were too many experts.
 The few of them didn't speak and continued to move forward at a fast speed.
 They were still dozens of miles away from the crosscut Canyon, which was not too far for a Martial Master.
 Since they left in the morning, the sky had almost turned dark.
 The few of them still hoped to arrive at the designated location before night fell and set up camp to prevent any problems from happening at night.
 After walking for a while, they saw a huge rock ahead.
