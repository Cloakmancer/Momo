A fifth stage venerable sovereign was killed in an instant.Of course, this had to do with the fact that the other party's Dao was injured. After a few rounds, his Dao was seriously injured, and he had to find fault with Li Hao. He happened to run into Li Hao, who was a member of time, and was naturally courting death.But no matter what, a Tier 5 was no longer a weakling.He was easily killed here.At this moment, even the illusory figure trembled slightly. Of course, it was not because of the death of Sui han, but the appearance of time. Best n0vel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã ùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìã‚ÑØùìÅùí∑ùíæùìÉ At this moment, the shadow was motionless.As for Li Hao, he didn't care about the shadow.He began to comprehend the Dao again.Was he worried that the shadow would kill him?To be honest, he wasn't too worried. The shadow should be an Artifact Spirit, and it was very likely to be the Dao chess's Artifact Spirit. And the Dao chess was most likely the weapon of the master of tianfang, and it shouldn't be at its peak right now.If the other party really made a move, Li Hao might have a way to deal with it.Furthermore, according to the person from Tian Fang, the master of Tian Fang had been searching for the time King all this while. The master of Tian Fang might not be dead. As long as he was still alive, would the weapon spirit dare to go against the will of a level nine venerable sovereign and kill the future time King?Even if Li Hao wasn't the time King yet.Therefore, he was a little depressed.But he wasn't that worried.At this moment, Li Hao chose to continue his enlightenment. Of course, he was also more careful.The shadow didn't speak or move.It was as if nothing had happened between the two sides.No one cared about Xi Han's death.Li Hao continued to move.His speed was still neither fast nor slow.However, as more and more DAOs were created and he came into contact with them, Li Hao still sped up. Moreover, as the Bridge of Life and death was gradually built and was about to reach perfection, Li Hao didn't stay for too long and absorbed the energy.That was because he was about to enter the perfected stage of Tier 3. No matter how much energy he had, he could only store it and not absorb it.It was saturated!The ultimate yang star had barely emerged, but the ultimate Yin path had yet to be discovered. Li Hao had no idea where the path was, either. He could only take one step at a time.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶It took Li Hao almost ten days to finish the first 1000 squares.The second time he finished 1000 squares, Li Hao used seven days.After completing 2000 squares, Li Hao's 360 bridges of life and death were all successfully built. At this time, Li Hao was truly at the peak of stage three. He was truly at the peak state.A large circulation had even formed inside the human body, the circulation of the sword Dao.This was also the Dao Meridian of the human body.The 360 illusory and corporeal Dao meridians had been completely activated, completely saturated, and completely fused.Life and death were the core.At this stage, it could be said that Li Hao had almost developed the human body to the extreme. He had developed the Silvermoon people's innate Dao meridians to the extreme.The human body still had some Dao meridians.However, these Dao meridians were not the main Dao meridians. They were Dao meridians of other great DAOs and not the main Dao meridians of the Silvermoon people.In other words, Silvermoon's great Dao universe was dominated by these 360 illusory and corporeal great DAOs.Now, they were almost completely under Li Hao's control.After walking out of the 2000th square, Li Hao's aura was complete. It had been 26 days since he entered this place.Li Hao did some calculations. There were only a few days left until the one-month deadline.He had spent 17 days on the Dao chess game, 3 days on the first stage to deal with the yin Chi, and 6 days outside the dark Shrine.For venerable sovereigns, one month passed by so easily."I've passed 2000 squares!"Li Hao looked at the mysterious man, who seemed to have just come back to his senses. He said,""Yes, what do you want?"According to their previous agreement, one request could be completed after one thousand squares.At this moment, he had already passed 2000 squares. Li Hao didn't mention his first request.Li Hao calculated for a moment."I have two chances, right?" he asked."Yes,"Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"I'm now at the perfected stage of level three, but I don't have a deep understanding of the way of yin and yang. I've completed 2000 squares, but I haven't discovered the way of ultimate Yin. Is the way of ultimate Yin still further?""Yes,""This isn't a request, is it?""It doesn't count,""These are just some basic questions," the mysterious man replied with a smile.Li Hao nodded."Then can I ask again, where is it?"The mysterious man was silent for a moment, but he still said,""About 6000 units."Li Hao was stunned for a moment."Why is it so far?"The shadow explained,"about 1000 slots. With the path of yang, according to the rules of the great Dao and the orthodoxy of experts, it is estimated that at about 6000 slots, the adjustment of yin and yang can help people step into the path of the seventh rank. Do you understand what I mean?"Li Hao's heart moved, and he nodded.Understood!Yin Yang integration, rank seven!p "So you're saying that for some paths of the two extremes, if there's one pole in front, the rest are almost all after six thousand slots?""Right!"The mysterious man praised. Very smart.The shadow spoke again."You're right. Including the life and death Dao that you're cultivating now, there will be the Dao of life in about 3000 slots. However, the Dao of death will also be after 6000 slots. Almost all the DAOs of the two extremes correspond like this!""Of course, the basic five elements of water and fire are not considered the Dao of the two extremes."Li Hao understood.So that was how it was!After 6,000 cells!No wonder I saw the ultimate yang in the 1000th grid and couldn't find the ultimate Yin in the 2000th.Li Hao thought for a moment."Then, if I make a request," he said,"that I have to comprehend the ultimate Yin way in advance. Is that okay?""Sure!""Are you sure?" the mysterious man asked again.Li Hao was stunned and didn't say anything for a long time.Am I sure?Comprehending some ultimate Yin Dao now was still very beneficial to him. It could help him sense yin and yang in advance. Although he might not be able to combine yin and yang, understanding the two Dao would be very helpful for the subsequent combination of yin and yang.

2701 Chapter 448
If he hadn't sensed it in advance, Li Hao knew that he wouldn't have been able to go beyond the 6000th square.In fact, when he reached 2000 cells, he was slightly exhausted.He still had hope of finishing about 3000 squares.However, four thousand, five thousand ... It would be very difficult for him to reach the end.His comprehension had not exceeded this stage.Comprehending the ultimate Yin Dao in advance meant that he would miss some of the Dao sequences in the middle. If he comprehended it in advance, it would be difficult to integrate it later if he comprehended it later. If he reached the 6000th grid smoothly, he should be able to integrate yin and yang more easily.However, he had already been here for almost a month.He didn't want to miss this opportunity.Missing the opportunity to find Heaven's Fate and the others ... Might also be a way to save people.This was the first reason. The second reason was that if they stayed here for too long, who knew if the venerable Emperor Hui long would come in?According to Li Hao's plan, he could reach the 6000th square, but it might take several years.This was because he needed to absorb and digest some of the knowledge. He could not go on like this.As countless thoughts crossed his mind, Li Hao said,""Can I make another request?""Go ahead,""Can you come with me? Or ... Can I take the go pieces with me?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe mysterious man laughed."No!""Why? Didn't you say that you can agree to any request?""You can actually take a chess piece with you!"The mysterious man said softly,'but not now! "If you reach the 7000th square, you can make this request, because Dao chess ... Is not an ordinary divine weapon! The Dao chess is refined from a great path world and great path universe controlled by a level eight venerable sovereign. Once you take it away and walk out of the heaven's side, without the suppression of the heaven's side, it will instantly turn into a great world ... At that time, are you sure you can protect the Dao chess?"Li Hao was stunned and shook his head.It couldn 't.An ownerless level eight great world ... At that time, he would probably be devoured until not even his bones were left.At that time, many major cosmos absolute beings would come directly.Passing through 7000 squares meant that his comprehension had reached the level of a rank seven venerable sovereign, or that his strength had reached this level. He could be considered a high-level venerable sovereign. At this time, he could take it away and guard it.It wasn't that he couldn't take it away, but he didn't have the right to do so now. Li Hao felt a little regretful."Then ..."Li Hao's head ached."I want to go out now, but I still want to understand Dao chess. What should I do?" he asked."You can come back anytime!"The mysterious man was easy to talk to."The dark Demon Palace welcomes venerable sovereigns from all over the world to discuss Dao!" He could come back anytime.Li Hao pondered for a while, then said,""Then let me ask you. I have a request ... For example, can I enter Dao chess at any time when I'm outside the tianfang world?"This ...The shadow was silent."You mean, if you don't come back, and if there's a chance or danger outside, you want to enter the Dao chess game at any time and place to comprehend the Dao or even take refuge?" the mysterious man said after thinking for a while."Right!"Li Hao nodded."I'm going out for a while. I might fight, kill people, or comprehend the Dao ... At that time, I need an absolutely safe place. It's best if it's Dao chess. I want to enter it and comprehend the Dao once ...""This ...""I can agree to your request," the mysterious man said after some consideration."But you'll have to do it yourself!""How do I contribute?""There's not enough energy for the Dao chess. If you go out, you might be very far away from tianfang. Of course, the Dao chess is made in an eighth-tier great cosmos and is a ninth-tier sovereign weapon. It's also extremely powerful ... In tianfang great world, you can summon the Dao chess even with the 3000 Primal Chaos rulers around you ... Provided that you consume a large amount of energy.""Is the corpse of a rank five venerable sovereign enough?" Best novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé Li Hao asked.The mysterious man laughed. 'This guy ...' The mysterious man said. "It's possible if the distance is close, but if the distance is too far, for example, it's exactly 3000 Primal Chaos iron ruler, it'll probably be difficult ... It may require more energy."Li Hao nodded in understanding."Then I want this condition!"This wasn't just a problem of wudao being able to enter at any time, it could also be used to escape.A weapon refined from a type 8 world, and a type 9 expert at that, could instantly sweep him away. Even a Type 7 venerable Emperor would find it hard to catch up.This was the key to saving his life!Of course, that was only if he was within 3000 Primal Chaos iron rods of the Grand world.3,000 Primal Chaos iron ruler was not close.A first level venerable sovereign could teleport 3000 times.A third level venerable sovereign would have to teleport thousands of times, which was actually quite far."Alright, I'll leave a mark on you later. If you need it, you can use the mark to summon the Dao chess to cover it. Besides, although the Dao chess is strong, no one can control it anymore. It's not an offensive monarch weapon either. A seventh rank venerable sovereign can still cover it up, but if you encounter an eighth rank venerable sovereign ... The other party might be able to follow the fluctuations and track Dao chess. By then, it won't just be you who's in trouble, it'll be Dao chess too.""Why would I provoke a level eight venerable sovereign?" Li Hao was surprised.‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùIt was hard to say!The mysterious man muttered in his heart,"you're only at the 3rd rank now, but you've already killed a 5th rank."It was fine before, but now that he knew that you were a Dao of time cultivator, it was hard to say whether the mysterious man would dare to do it or not.

Li Hao didn't say much.After some thought, he was considering the second condition.Domain, sealing the world, was actually the condition he had raised before. It was also very important. However, after seeing the power of Dao chess, to be honest, he felt that it was a waste to raise conditions randomly.I'll be able to comprehend a domain by myself sooner or later."Senior, if I pass 3000 or 4000 squares the next time, can I still raise conditions?""Sure."Li Hao heaved a sigh of relief and no longer acted courteously. He said,""Then my second condition ... I want a friend to make a move in Dao chess! He's within Tian Fang's range. ""Have you been here?""I've been here, but I don't think I've entered the chess board. " Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã  The mysterious man thought for a moment."I've been here but didn't enter the Dao chess game. That means I don't have enough luck ... Of course, it might also be because I'm not compatible with the dark Demon Ridge enough ... However, since you've mentioned it, I can agree to it. Are you sure you want to give this opportunity to someone else?"If people knew about the existence of daoqi ... Wouldn't they have ideas about daoqi?The mysterious man felt that perhaps this kid was too naive."The other party helped me a few times ... And I've been owing him a favor. I'm sorry."Li Hao laughed."Besides, since the master of Tian Fang placed Dao chess here, it's actually for people to discuss Dao. That person is also a cultivator. The great Dao of the world can not be distinguished without debate!" Although we're still far from being the master of Tian Fang, with the achievements of our predecessors and our comprehension, the later generations will have the opportunity to surpass them. Otherwise, the great Dao will stagnate, and it will be difficult to have the opportunity to surpass them. ""Alright, since you don't mind ... That's fine too!"The mysterious figure was easy to talk to, but it had a lot to do with Li Hao's identity as a Dao of time cultivator.Otherwise, even if he agreed to the first condition, he could not agree to the second one.Daoist chess was only for those who were fated.Does drought count?Actually, it was!First, the other party was a dark-type powerhouse from The Dark World. The dark Envoy was also from The Dark World. Although he had some grudges with the Master of Darkness, he still gave the cultivators from The Dark World some opportunities.Second, the other party had entered together with Li Hao. This was an opportunity for him to pass the first level. It was a pity that the other party did not seize it.Therefore, mi han and Li Hao were both fated.Kong Ji didn't enter this place the first time, so he wasn't a fated person. Sometimes, the strong also talked about fate.But now, Li Hao was using one condition as a price ... And that was fate.The mysterious man continued,"didn't you want to comprehend your domain?" You're giving up now?""No hurry!" Li Hao smiled."The next time I enter, I'll definitely gain some insight. There's no rush!""If you continue to stay here and comprehend, you might be able to successfully reach level six ... It might not take many years. Thirty years, fifty years, a hundred years ... At most, a hundred years. You can still successfully enter the ultimate Yin path region.""Why not?" the mysterious man was confused."I'm going out to do something. I'm here to repay a favor. "Li Hao sighed."It's the hardest to repay a favor ... Not only that, senior, you might have noticed that I'm carrying too many debts now. I'm light without any debts, but with debts ... How can I stay here for a hundred years?" Besides, I still have some matters to attend to. The world I'm in might also be being pursued by people. ""That's true, this is the trouble of being human. ""Even someone as powerful as the master of Tian Fang has debts and troubles ... Being a human is not as easy as being a weapon," the mysterious man said with a smile."Maybe!"Li Hao chuckled."But that's good. If I really have no desires, then what's the point of life?" No matter if it was to pursue Dao or to seek Dao, there would always be some pursuits and some goals. It was impossible to really put down everything. The great Dao was emotionless. Then, what was the difference between man and Dao? What's the difference between this and the desolate primordial chaos?" "I don't understand the thoughts of you humans."The virtual shadows didn't say much, each with their own thoughts and pursuits.Since Li Hao wasn't in a hurry to comprehend the ultimate Yin way, the mysterious man wouldn't force him to do anything. Now that he had comprehended it ... It might not be a good thing.Perhaps, he still needed some opportunity."Then, if your friend comes here to gain enlightenment ..." The mysterious man continued,"because he hasn't broken through the first level, he won't be qualified to make a request after passing a thousand squares. You don't have any objections to this, right?""Can he pass the first stage again?""Yes ..."The mysterious man did not mind."It's just that you have to kill all the yin swirls in the first stage. I don't have high expectations. Return all the dark Dao accumulation crystals and extract the blood essence of the rank five venerable sovereign to extract the energy for the first stage. Then, I can let your friend pass the first stage."‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùJust pretend I didn't say anything!Li Hao secretly ridiculed. How was that possible?I'm already very loyal to Kong Ji by letting him play a game of chess. If he wants me to return all the gains ... Wouldn't I be an idiot?At this moment, the mysterious man couldn't help but say,""You can't take the Dao chess piece away! However, the secret agent's praying mat is an eighth level venerable sovereign's heart of enlightenment. Don't you want to take it away?"You don't want this either?However, Li Hao shook his head."An eighth-rank darkness element is not compatible with me. Unless I can comprehend light and darkness and fuse them together, I don't really need this!"Why would he bring this?

It was useless.Besides, I can still make more requests after I leave for 3000 or 4000. Even if I want more, it's not now.It was not safe to carry it with him now.If I'm seen or sensed by an expert, it'll only increase my danger.Li Hao understood this.Seeing this, the mysterious man didn't say anything else, but said with a playful tone,""Don't you want to try ... To see if you can take me down?""Senior, are you the tool spirit of the Dao chess?"Li Hao said helplessly,"if that's the case, then senior's main body is a level-eight great world and a great path universe. As for the artifact Spirit, it's at least level six!" Besides, senior also said that I can't suppress it after I take it out, and it will instantly turn into a great world. Wouldn't I be targeted? Even if I can defeat senior and take away senior's main body ... It's useless. Since that's the case ... Why would I do something that harms others without benefiting myself?""If senior is not the spirit of Dao chess ... Then it's even more useless. Even if I defeat senior, or even kill senior ... There won't be much effect, and it'll be a waste of energy and time, right?""You're right!"The mysterious man laughed. It's just that ... I'm still a little disappointed that you didn't continue. Actually, I want to see if you can make it to the 4000th or even 5000th square if you keep going. ""There's no rush!"Li Hao shook his head,"I've reached the peak of the third step. It's a waste to leave now!" There are many DAOs that I can't absorb. I still hope that I can comprehend ultimate Yin outside, balance yin and yang, and even complete the integration. If I continue, with the power of the Dao chess, perhaps I can directly cross the stage of energy accumulation and enter the sixth rank from the fourth rank without too many barriers ..."If they left now, they would be wasting a lot of opportunities.If he had comprehended ultimate Yin and entered the fourth level, he could have absorbed thousands of squares of the great Dao's power and advanced. This way, he could save a lot of time and not keep killing people.Killing too many people, one would fail in an easy task sooner or later.Li Hao's account book was also clear.When that time came, he would be able to reach the ultimate Yin Dao. He might even be able to deepen his comprehension of Yin Yang integration and make more preparations for his breakthrough to Level Seven. Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã  At this moment, the illusory figure completely understood that this person actually knew what he wanted.He actually understood.He wasn't acting on impulse, but he was really prepared to wait for the next time. When he had accumulated enough, he would enter Dao chess and advance in one go.Such a person had a clear goal!The mysterious man felt a little more like praising him.In fact ... It was a typical double standard.,m Xi han also had a clear goal of advancing from Level 5 to Level 6, and his attitude was firm and unchanged. However, the shadow felt that he was aiming too high. Li Hao, on the other hand, was clearly only Level 3, but he kept talking about Level 6 and Level 7, but the shadow felt that Li Hao was very bold.This was a large-scale double standard scene!Of course, if Min Han really entered level six, his Dao injuries would be completely healed, and he could even inherit the level eight Dark Envoy's Dao accumulation. When he had the chance to enter level eight in the future, the shadow would probably change his mind.Unfortunately ... The other party had failed, so the illusory figure naturally didn't take a fancy to it.Li Hao didn't stay any longer.In any case, he would enter the game again. Just as he was about to leave, Li Hao stopped for a moment.""Senior, may I ask why the experts of tianfang world left?""I can't say for sure."It was hard to say!It wasn't that he didn't know, couldn't say, or just couldn't say.Li Hao's heart skipped a beat, but he didn't pursue the matter. He said,""Can the great path universe of tianfang world recover?""Yes, I can!"This time, the other party gave a definite answer."Back then, I only took away the power of a great Dao, not the great Dao universe! In other words, the great Dao universe had become an empty shell, but it still existed. It was just that all the DAOs had been destroyed! It's just that tianfang's inheritance has been cut off, and the orthodoxy has disappeared. There's no way to restore the great Dao universe ... If you want to revive it, the opportunity ... Might still be on you. "Me?Li Hao was enlightened."Yes,""But there are many Taoist reserves here. There will always be some people who have comprehended it. Can't it be restored?""They can ... But they can't reach the seventh step!"The shadow didn't stand on ceremony."If they can't reach Level Seven, they won't be able to revive the Dao universe. The revival of the Dao universe needs an opportunity! They can't make it to the seventh step, but you have a great chance. That's why I said that the hope is on you. "Alright!You're really good at judging people.I also think that I can reach the seventh step!Li Hao grinned.Yes, that's what I think."Senior, I'll take my leave then!""You can leave once you get out!"The mysterious man didn't say anything. He simply cast an imprint on Li Hao. In an instant, a chessboard seemed to have appeared above Li Hao's River."This is the imprint of a Dao chess piece. I believe that you only need to pour in enough energy. Within the tianfang world, you don't need any energy to activate it! You can use it twice, once for your friend, once ... For yourself!""Many thanks, senior!"Li Hao didn't stand on ceremony. Of course, he had to check it a little to avoid any traps.However ... He would go out and take a look.It wasn't good to do such a thing in front of others.This time, he had gained a lot.All 360 bridges of life and death were successfully built, and he entered the Grand completion of Tier 3.

2704 Chapter 448
After walking 2000 squares, he had some understanding of the various great DAOs. This was also an improvement in his Foundation. It would definitely be of great help when he stepped into level four in the future.Moreover, he could play chess again, which was also an opportunity.In addition, Li Hao now had a lot of dark Taoist connotation crystals. Besides his own, he had a few more intermediate dark Taoist connotation crystals after killing mi han.At that time, mi han had obtained a total of five of them, three of which were level four, two of which were level five. Some of the energy from one of the level five had been extracted by mi han, but there was still a lot left.In addition to these, there were also some treasures from a few venerable sovereigns ... Of course, Li Hao didn't think much of them.He didn't really care about treasures.Even a rank five venerable sovereign's treasure was only an external object.Li Hao wouldn't absorb these things or learn too much about the way of darkness, but he would still be able to sell them for a sky-high price.In exchange for some treasures that could be used by the Silver Moon cultivators ... Li Hao felt that he might be able to produce a few more venerable sovereigns.The prerequisite was that he had the qualifications.Sure enough, killing and setting fire were all gold. He had gained a lot from killing a few venerable sovereigns.As for the dark Demon Ridge, he would just leave it here for now.He would continue to guard the Supreme Dragon Emperor!If he really took the dark Demon Ridge away this time ... The Supreme Dragon Emperor would probably kill him before he would stop.After all, he was still a sixth rank venerable sovereign, and he could not afford to offend him for the time being.However, the next time he wanted to activate the dark Demon Ridge, he had to use a little blood essence of a venerable sovereign this time. This time, many Yin puppets had died. If he wanted to activate the dark Demon Ridge, he had to get a complete middle-stage venerable sovereign to supplement The Phantom image. Otherwise, he probably wouldn't even be able to comprehend a single strand of hair.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the outside world.27 days had passed.Seeing that the one-month deadline was about to arrive, venerable Emperor Hui long was also confused.Still not out?What happened to them after they entered the dark Shrine?It's been so long!If the one-month time limit was up, it was not that he could not continue to stay. However, by then, the energy he provided would have been completely exhausted. If he wanted to come out again, he would need to replenish the resources.But ... Would he fill in the gap?It would consume a lot of energy.Kong Ji beside him was calm, but Hui long wasn 't. Did these people really get something?He had actually been to the dark Shrine before.However, he was being chased by so many Yin Chi. Although they couldn't kill him, they would revive again after he killed them. He killed them a few times and couldn't be bothered to kill them anymore. It was too troublesome!Moreover, there were too many Yin swirls. He usually went in alone, and after he went in, all the yin swirls would chase after him.Even if dozens of venerable sovereigns attacked him together, he might not be able to win.Li Hao had won because he had consumed a large amount of dark energy while chasing others, which weakened the yin swirls that were chasing him. Otherwise, Li Hao wouldn't have been able to deal with the yin swirls that were chasing him.The first stage was not that easy to pass.As the venerable Dragon Emperor was thinking, his eyes suddenly moved.At this moment, the door before him trembled. Someone was coming out!Finally, someone was coming out!He hurriedly looked at the door.The next moment, a figure appeared.Li Hao!Li Hao went through a teleportation and soon arrived at the Dragon Temple.In front of him, two auras appeared.One belonged to the Dragon Emperor, and the other was empty.Before Emperor Hui long could speak, Kong Ji said,""You're back? It seems like I've gained something from this delay. "Kong Ji ignored Hui long Emperor and nodded slightly with a smile.Venerable Emperor Hui long was a little upset, but he suppressed it and said with a smile,""Fellow Daoist Hao Yue ... It seems you've gained a lot!""For a moment, I thought that a third stage venerable sovereign had come out, but ... Fellow Daoist Hao Yue hasn't entered the second stage yet. What a pity."At this moment, Li Hao concealed his aura again. The river surrounded him, and his Taoist connotation was concealed. Ordinary people couldn't see through the river of life and death.However, venerable Dragon Emperor knew about it.This person was not a rank one!He was a genuine rank three venerable sovereign!Li Hao smiled."It's a pity, but it's too dangerous inside. I only absorbed a little dark energy from the periphery and cultivated for a few days. How can I reach stage two so easily?"He knew that venerable Dragon Emperor might know his strength.But ... So what?Would this person, with his smooth and slick personality, expose him directly?It won 't!Perhaps, he would even treat it as a private matter and make things difficult for her.Li Hao didn't care. Besides, this guy had a grudge against him. He had sealed off the dark Demon Ridge twice to test him. If Li Hao was unlucky, he might have been killed by him.This guy, I'm strong enough, he'll have a good time!The two of us have a grudge! Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã  The venerable Dragon Emperor didn't say anything else. He smiled and looked at the door again,""Daoist Chao Han and the others still haven't come out?""I don't know,""I've never seen them,"Li Hao shook his head.Anyway, he only had one thought, to not admit it.p Even if you know that I killed their people, I won't admit it.They were all dead!According to his understanding of this person, a dead venerable sovereign was worse than a dog!The venerable sovereigns were all dead. Would the venerable Dragon Emperor fight against Kong Ji and himself for the sake of the dead venerable sovereigns?Currently, there were still a few middle-stage venerable sovereigns in the Hui long temple.

Other than Kong Ji, there was also a fifth stage venerable sovereign and several fourth stage venerable sovereigns.But ... For a Tier 5 who had died right after joining, he would turn against empty silence?It definitely wouldn 't!Huilong frowned slightly.Still not out?At this moment, he knew that Li Hao had also gone to the dark Shrine. However, Sui han was a fifth rank Supreme Emperor, after all. Although Haoyue was a third rank Supreme Emperor, he was not weak among the third rank. He had even killed a third rank ...However, the gap between Tier 3 and Tier 5 was still extremely huge!Therefore, in his mind, Li Hao couldn't have killed Li Han.In addition, he was unable to detect any life light spots in the darkness shrine. He could not tell if mi han and the others were still in the darkness shrine. Were they dead or were they still digesting the opportunities?However, the energy he provided would be completely exhausted in a few days.At that time, it would be very troublesome if those people wanted to come out.Unless he kept it open again.Hui long Emperor slightly frowned and glanced at Li Hao.""Daoist Hao Yue, did you not see Daoist mi han and the others?""No!"Li Hao shook his head."I'm just a level one venerable sovereign. I wandered around the periphery and didn't find anything. How could I have seen those experts?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùHe was lying through his teeth!Hui long Emperor frowned slightly, and after a while, he said,""Then let's wait for a few more days. A month's time is up and the door will automatically close without any energy to maintain it. I hope they can come out before that. If not ... We can only wait for the movement inside to become louder, and then I will think of a way to get them out."How troublesome!If he opened it again, he would waste a lot of resources. Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã  However, he couldn't just ignore a fifth rank venerable sovereign and two third rank venerable sovereigns.As for this Hao Yue, this time, since Sui han did not come out, there was no reason to suppress him.If Pi han also came out, he could trigger some conflict between them and cause some conflict between Pi han and Kong Ji.However, the person in question didn't come out ... What could he say!He was the temple master, so he naturally couldn't oppress Haoyue for no reason. That would make others think that he was a heartless person, and wouldn't that make him a laughingstock for the other venerable sovereigns?At least, he did a good job at Huilong temple.Venerable Dragon Emperor had nothing to say, and Kong Ji seemed to be a little regretful.""It's a pity that Xi han didn't come out!""Temple master, if Sui han comes out, inform me immediately."Huilong was stunned.What did that mean?Inform you immediately?What are you doing?As for Kong Ji, he didn't say much.As for why he was notified ... Of course, it was to ask if you had any objections to Haoyue killing a few of your subordinates.If you have a problem ... I'll kill you. That will save us a lot of trouble.It was too troublesome to guard against thieves for a thousand days.A Tier 5 was not a small problem, so he would kill him first.He didn't think about anything else at all. What denial, reneging on a debt, or arguing ... He wasn't very good at it, and he didn't have the patience to do it. It was too annoying, so it was better to be straightforward.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ At this moment, Li Hao somewhat understood Kong Ji's thoughts.He couldn't help but laugh.p Kong Ji was also a wonderful person.To be honest, Li Hao didn't think that there was anything worth looking forward to in the tianfang world, nor did he meet anyone interesting. The only interesting person he met was Kong Ji.Although in the eyes of others, Kong Ji was a man of few words."Daoist Kong Ji, let's go first. We'll just let the Abbey Dean keep an eye on them!"Then, he smiled at Hui long and said,"thank you for giving me this opportunity. I've gained a little. If elder Chao Han and the others come out, please send my regards. I'll take my leave first!"Hui long raised his eyebrows slightly. These words ... Were somewhat uncomfortable to hear.He didn't say anything and nodded slightly.""Then Haoyue will go back and rest for a while. This time, he must be exhausted. After all ... There are always some second or third rank opponents inside ... It's not easy to escape from death."I'm just short of saying,"stop talking about these things." I actually know what you've done.Li Hao, however, didn't care. He smiled and left with Kong Ji.After they left, the Supreme Emperor Hui long frowned and looked at the door.Should he go and take a look?However, if he entered, he would consume a lot of energy."I'll wait for three more days ... If he still doesn't come out after three days, I'll have to go and take a look!"The operation to hunt and kill the revered sword artist was about to begin.If a rank five venerable sovereign did not return, it would cause a lot of trouble for the plan. An additional rank five venerable sovereign would increase the chances of success.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.In the temple.The two of them returned."How many did you kill?" Kong Ji looked at Li Hao."Five!""It's about the same as I expected," Kong Ji laughed."Pi han will probably die from anger.""I'm already so angry. "Kong Ji looked at Li Hao in a daze."A stage two expert was killed by the yin Chi," Li Hao explained.‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùËâπ!At this moment, Kong Ji didn't say anything. He was just stunned.You killed a Tier 5?How was that possible?This was because he had not seen the chaos lightning tribulation. Even in the dark Demon Ridge, if Li Hao had borrowed the power of an eighth-rank cultivator, the chaos lightning tribulation would definitely have been triggered. Therefore, he was certain that Li Hao had not borrowed the power of an eighth-rank cultivator this time.Since he did not have any leverage ... How did he kill a rank five venerable sovereign?That's impossible!Even if Li Hao had entered Stage 3, it was impossible for him to directly defeat a Stage 5.If that was the case, then Li Hao was too terrifying.

Li Hao explained again,"he did it himself. His Dao was seriously injured. He wanted to find trouble with me. I only used one sword attack ... And he died!"It was easy to say, but Kong Ji knew that it wasn 't.For a moment, he also sighed,"amazing!",m At this moment, he was still a little moved.""Tier 5 ... To be honest, I can kill him too. I have the confidence to kill him, but it won't be easy! You're amazing!""You're too kind!""By the way, do you know about daoqi?" Li Hao smiled brightly."Dao chess?"Kong Ji was stunned. After a long while, he said,"I've heard of it. It's said that the master of Tian Fang killed an enemy and completely refined the world that the enemy was in into a chess piece ... But I'm not sure about the details. Don't tell me you've encountered it?""Yes,""Here?""Yes."Kong Ji was instantly shocked, what a great opportunity! It's definitely not easy to refine a great cosmos. Congratulations, fellow Daoist!""Envious?" Li Hao laughed.Kong Ji laughed and nodded."A little, but it's okay. Sometimes, what's yours is yours. If it's not yours, you can't force it!" I've been there too, but I didn't meet him. It's just that we're not fated, but it's fine. "Li Hao smiled again."The weapon spirit of Dao chess and I ... Perhaps it's the weapon spirit of Dao chess. We've reached a condition. Fellow Daoist, you can go there once. It's very interesting!" I won't go into the details, but I'm sure it'll be very interesting. It'll be of great help to you!"Kong Ji frowned.Li Hao continued,"fellow Daoist, you've helped me a lot during this trip to tianfang. It's normal for fellow Daoists to exchange blows!" If we only expect one side to give, then it's not friendship. Sooner or later, there will be some trouble. Whether you don't care or I don't feel good ... It will hurt our relationship. "Kong Ji nodded slightly."That's fine. I'm not sure about the effects of Dao chess. But you said that it's helpful to me. It's definitely not simple!" I'm only helping you with a small matter ...""Regardless of size!"Li Hao laughed."We'll go back and forth. You help me, and I help you. It'll be easier for us to continue our friendship. Otherwise ... It'll be hard to continue our conversation.""That works too!"Kong Ji nodded again."You mean I'm going to take a look at Dao chess. You're leaving?" Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã  "Yes,""Not coming with us?"Li Hao shook his head."Your people are probably all middle-stage venerable sovereigns. It's not convenient." Moreover, it's too difficult for me to deal with an intermediate right now! Besides, you and I might not be moving together. I'll go first, and if we have the chance, we'll meet again in the primordial chaos. "Kong Ji didn't feel any regret and nodded."We will definitely meet. Although the primal Chaos is huge, the key is in the red moon region. We will meet again sooner or later!" Then I'll go to the Dao chess after you leave. ""When I leave, come and send me off. I'll send you in on the way!"Kong Ji nodded. That was fine too.It would save him some trouble.The two of them didn't talk too much. They didn't mention how they met venerable the sword and what to do. They also didn't say whether Kong Ji really wanted to deal with a neo martial artist ...These were all personal choices.The two of them spent most of their time talking about mantras and rarely talked about other things.If Kong Ji really wanted to go against neo martial and was killed by neo martial, it would be his fate.Of course, if he killed a neo martial artist, there would naturally be a neo martial artist to settle the score with him.It was not impossible for the two of them to fight the next time they met."Then I'll rest for a day. Tomorrow, I'll go to the city and see if I can exchange for some treasures to take with me ... The day after tomorrow, I'll go to the Coiling Dragon Well. I'll leave in a few days." "You have a treasure to exchange?"Kong Ji laughed."You can come to me. I have a channel for you to exchange. If you kill someone and Exchange it here, it's a bit of a slap in the face.""That's convenient!"Li Hao also smiled. It was a good thing.As for the channel behind the emptiness, whether it was a major world or something else, he did not ask.Who cares!"In addition ... Fellow Daoist, please prepare a map of chaos for me. It should at least include the Crimson Moon region and the heavenly square region, right?""There are!"Kong Ji nodded. Although this map was extremely precious.After all, only venerable sovereigns were qualified to roam the chaos.Those who could travel through the two regions were all top-notch existences, even seventh rank venerable sovereigns. The map that the other party had made was naturally extraordinary.But ... What did it matter?In any case, the radiance world had it. He didn't mind making a copy.After a brief conversation, Li Hao took out dozens of dark crystals and some treasures left by the venerable sovereigns. He was not sure how much they were worth.He only had one purpose-to exchange for some treasures that were useful to those below venerable sovereign.Kong Ji was also a rich man. He only took a glance at it. Even the dark Tao accumulation crystal that everyone was after, he only took a few glances and threw it all into the storage space.He would get someone to change it later.As a level eight venerable Emperor, the great radiance world was extremely powerful and had countless treasures. Li Hao only wanted some treasures below the venerable Emperor level, but the ones he exchanged were treasures that could be used by venerable emperors. To be honest, almost no one would do that.It wasn't strange that Li Hao had done it.These things were all in high demand. They could even strengthen the great light world if they were brought back. Although they were dark crystals, the power of darkness and the power of light complemented each other even though they were opposing forces. At the venerable sovereign level, everyone actually knew and understood this principle.On the contrary, it was even more popular!It was fortunate that Li Hao didn't mention a small world. Otherwise, he could've changed to a few small worlds, or perhaps even a medium world.The two of them exchanged a few more words before leaving to find someone to exchange for treasures.Li Hao was going to leave in a few days, and it would take time for him to go back and forth.Fortunately, Tian Fang also had forces from the great radiance world. He did not know if they had enough reserves.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶On the other side, the Supreme Emperor of the Hui long clan was still waiting in silence. In his heart, he was cursing at mai han.Still not coming out!Trash!Haoyue went in, and you couldn't kill him, so could it be that you didn't meet him?If you don't come out, I'll have to go in and catch you!He cursed, but he couldn't show it, so he could only sulk.Even if Li Hao left the house the next day, he had no reason to stop him.Fortunately, he was certain that Li Hao wasn't the Silver Moon King, so he didn't pay much attention to him. Otherwise, it wouldn't have been so easy for Li Hao to leave.

Chapter 2707 Everyone Is At Ease!
Outside the tianfang world.Several venerable sovereigns walked out together.Many people looked at Li Hao, who was standing behind them, and then looked at the empty atmosphere. They all cursed in their hearts, this guy ... Who invited him?How stressful!A rank five venerable sovereign was sending him off!That's right, Li Hao didn't hide anything at all, and Kong Ji came to send them off directly, not caring about other people's opinions.I'm here to send you off, so what?Li Hao's thoughts were simple ... It wasn't a secret that he had joined the Dragon returning temple, and it wasn't a secret that he was on good terms with Kong Ji. In that case, it was normal for Kong Ji to come and bid him farewell.However, under normal circumstances, was it normal for a level five venerable sovereign to come and bid farewell to a level one venerable sovereign?It was not normal at all!Rank five venerable sovereign ... This time, the one leading the team to kill Heaven's Fate and the others was only a rank four venerable sovereign. At this moment, he had a helpless expression on his face and would occasionally turn his head to look behind him.Rank four was an absolute powerhouse among the Rogue cultivators.Middle-stage venerable sovereign!However, the other party was a fifth stage venerable sovereign. This was one of the reasons. Secondly, the Huilong temple might not be a big deal in the eyes of the great worlds, but to the Rogue cultivators, there were many middle stage venerable sovereigns here. This was not ordinary.Can't afford to offend!They were only chaos Rangers. Of course, there was an advantage to this-they were upright!This was a venerable sovereign of the Hui long temple, a true venerable sovereign of a force. Moreover, the ideas of the Hui long temple were not a secret to some venerable sovereigns of the tianfang world. They wanted to deal with the neo-martial artist powerhouse!As such, he was able to avoid a problem, as he didn't have to worry about this person being a spy or something.At the very least, he had a good relationship with middle-stage venerable sovereigns in Huilong temple.Otherwise, a new venerable sovereign with an unknown background would still be a little daunting."This Hao Yue is quite capable. It's said that the void Emperor rarely interacts with others in the Dragon Temple, but it seems that the rumors are all false. Look, he's personally sending him off ... This relationship is not ordinary!""He's not ordinary, but he's also troublesome ... I heard that he's just a newly-advanced venerable sovereign. If ... Something happens to him, do we still want to go back to the tianfang world?"Some people were worried about this problem.That's right, if he killed this pretty boy, Kong Ji would personally send him off when he returned. It would be a little intimidating ... They had really misunderstood. Kong Ji did not have such intentions at all.But to outsiders, this was what he meant.Even the fourth stage venerable sovereign was under a lot of pressure.'This new venerable sovereign has been killed. Unless I don't return to the tianfang world ... I'll be in big trouble.'It was really a headache!A rank four venerable sovereign could not travel too far in the chaos. The tianfang region, the Crimson Moon region, and the nearby regions were their areas of operation.Kong Ji was at the fifth step while he was only at the fourth step, so he was not his match.What a headache!It was equivalent to shoving a second generation in. A newly-advanced venerable sovereign was not a strong person.He couldn't help but look at Richard in the crowd. It was all this guy's fault. Trouble. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Behind them.Kong Ji didn't say much. He handed a storage ring to Li Hao, who stuffed it into his body without looking at it. A venerable sovereign's body had its own small space, so he didn't need a storage ring. However, he couldn't show everyone a bunch of things in a trade."The chaos is very big, but it is also very small!"Kong Ji looked at Li Hao and smiled."You and I are not people who go into seclusion to seal the Dao. Although the chaos is large, you and I will walk through the chaos sooner or later. I hope that the next time I see you, fellow Daoist ... You and I will both have some improvements!"Li Hao nodded."I hope you can reach the peak of level six as soon as possible, fellow Daoist. Although the path to Level Seven is difficult ... It's not impossible. This Tian Fang is actually an opportunity. Your opportunity may be here, and mine ... May be here too!""Tian Fang is indeed a treasure land!"Kong Ji nodded,"this place used to be the place where rank nine Supreme emperors asked about their Dao. It's extraordinary!" Countless major cosmos absolute beings are coveting it, but they haven't been able to see the truth. This place will sooner or later become a turbulent place in the four regions!"The red moon region was now the place of turmoil.However, Kong Ji felt that Tian Fang would be the core of the chaos sooner or later.There were nine levels in this place.He was the only one in the records who had reached the ninth rank."Don't say much!"Kong Ji didn't say anything else. He cupped his hands and bowed."Fellow Daoist, have a good journey!""Many thanks!"Li Hao returned the gesture. With a wave of his hand, the mark of the chess piece appeared. In an instant, the mark appeared in the empty hand.Kong Ji did not say anything and turned to leave. Suddenly, he turned back and looked at the rank four venerable sovereign,""Haoyue is my best friend, so I don't need to remind him of anything. But since you're here, I'll say one more thing. Don't make my friend angry, or else ... Don't let me see you in the four regions of the sky!"As soon as he said that, the rank four venerable sovereign was somewhat dissatisfied.You're at the fifth rank and I'm at the fourth rank. Do you think I'm really afraid of you?This threat ... Made him feel uncomfortable! Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã  The next moment, Kong Ji smiled faintly."I am the son of the God of Light. My father. The God of Light!"As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared.In the darkness, a rank five venerable sovereign appeared. The power of light emerged, and he looked in that direction with a cold look!At this moment, the entire area was silent.The fourth stage venerable sovereign's body stiffened!Who was it?The son of the God of Light!F * ck! How was that possible?What was he doing here?Oh my God!At this moment, Li Hao was also stunned. Soon, he turned to look at the fourth level venerable sovereign and said apologetically,""I'm sorry. Senior, please don't blame me. This friend of mine ... Doesn't have any ill intentions. "

Chapter 2708 Everyone Is At Ease!
The fourth level venerable sovereign's face was stiff. After a long time, he was a little embarrassed and embarrassed."It's okay. It's the Son of God of light ... I ... I didn't expect this ... I didn't expect this ... This is really ..."He didn't know what to say.F * ck!An eighth-rank radiant sovereign.Heavens!Why am I so unlucky?If it was the Tier 5 void, to be honest, he would be a little apprehensive, but not afraid. However, the tier 8 Lord of Light ... There were two tier 8 great worlds in the entire tianfang region, one was the divine light realm, and the other was the cloud realm.Eighth-rank!Who could afford to offend him?In any case, he, a Tier 4, absolutely could not afford to offend him.The point is, you're the son of the God of Light, but you're actually cultivating dark energy. Are you a traitor?Alright!He knew that it was impossible.At this moment, the situation was so complicated that it was hard to imagine. Kong Ji was a fifth rank venerable sovereign. He would not say anything, nor would he dare to say anything. Moreover, a fifth rank venerable sovereign of light had appeared. Obviously, this was also a kind of deterrence and proof.There are many people in the tianfang world. If you dare to say anything and pretend to be someone else, in less than a month, a high-level venerable sovereign from the radiance world will come and have a heart-to-heart talk with you.Unless you want to die!Otherwise, only a fool would impersonate him.There was more than one advanced venerable sovereign in the divine light plane.The strength of the neighboring Red Moon region and red Moon world was not much different from the other party, but there were many advanced venerable sovereigns.Now, everyone looked at Li Hao in a completely different light.If they had only been envious and jealous before, they were now filled with fear, uneasiness, and helplessness.Previously, if this person had died, a Tier 5 ... Would not have been so terrifying.'But now this one is dead ... My God, in any case, there are four regions nearby, so don't mess around anymore. Otherwise, if the divine light realm's high-level venerable sovereigns were to make a move, the surrounding regions would not be safe.'This could be considered as Kong Ji returning the favor.He knew that Li Hao wasn't afraid of Tier 4 beings, but it would be best to save some trouble, not just for the people here, but also for those who might be hiding in the dark.These people were hunting for neo martial artists ... Were there really no strong people following them in secret?It was hard to say!As for the emptiness, it didn't mean that it didn't exist.Since that's the case ... I'll tell you who I am.Let's see if you can afford to provoke me.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, there was no need to say if there were other people.Near the southern realm gate.A venerable sovereign's expression changed slightly.Inside the Dragon returning temple, the Dragon returning Emperor was speechless. After a long while, he cursed in a low voice,"it's really him."Ëâπ!Not to be trifled with! With his smooth and slick personality, he knew that this was the son of the God of Light. It was reasonable to please him, even if it was embarrassing.More importantly, the cloud divine realm and the divine light realm had been fighting for the position of the leader of the heavenly square region.Although it wasn't like neo martial where Red Moon and neo martial went to war directly, the relationship between the two sides was ordinary.He was a rogue cultivator in name ... But he was not.It would be very troublesome to please Kong Ji.Huilong was helpless. Forget it, he couldn't afford to offend them.Just treat it like a master!I knew it, this guy isn't simple.Fortunately, he had been rather polite earlier and did not provoke this person.The Crown Prince of the divine light plane actually didn't cultivate the power of light...No wonder the rumors said that this son of the God of Light had a strange personality. Even the radiant sovereign had almost vomited blood in anger.But there was nothing he could do. The radiant sovereign was simply too powerful, and it was difficult for him to produce any descendants. He only had one.Even if he was rebellious ... He could only pinch his nose and accept it.Fortunately, eighth rank venerable sovereigns had unlimited lifespans and would not die for the time being. Otherwise, with such a troublesome successor, who would be at ease to let him take over?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Outside the southern realm gate.Seeing Li Hao's group leave, another person did not say anything. He just kneeled and bowed to Li Hao. He did not care if Li Hao saw him or not, but he also sighed. Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã  After this farewell ... He didn't know if they would meet again.However, he knew that whether he could become a saint Emperor or not depended on this person.The giant pincer felt that it had made great progress over the past few days. In the past, it had been almost impossible to reach the venerable sovereign realm, but now, it vaguely understood how difficult it was to reach the venerable sovereign realm!As for me, the giant pincer, I might have a chance to see the magnificent scenery of the venerable sovereign realm.All of this started a year ago when he had welcomed this person here.It was only a year. To experts, it passed by in the blink of an eye.To me, it was the turning point of my life.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In front of him, Li Hao waved his hand. He didn't look back, but he knew.He just waved his hand casually, not wanting to have too much to do with the giant pincers. He was too weak. An expert like Kong Ji who had a mountain behind him didn't really matter.But what was a giant pincer? He was just a Heavenly King!Even if I'm almost a pseudo-Emperor, I'm still too weak. As for me, Li Hao ... Who knows how many powerful enemies I'll make in the future? it's best to stay away from me.It was only now that he had the mood to look around.In fact, everyone was also paying attention to him.This time, it was not just the few of them. There were a total of 12 venerable sovereigns, which was beyond imagination. It was said that there were only two venerable sovereigns in new martial arts, but 12 of them had been dispatched here.Other than Li Hao and the fourth stage venerable sovereign, there were ten more.Among them, there were four rank three, three rank two, and three rank one.The two he had encountered in the Coiling Dragon Well were among them. One was Empress Yi, a level one venerable sovereign, and the other was a level two venerable sovereign. Li Hao also learned her name, venerable sovereign Chan Xiu.

Chapter 2709 Everyone's At Ease!
The fourth-stage venerable sovereign leading the team was called venerable sovereign Ming Hao, who was an expert in sealing.Li Hao didn't know what their specific abilities were.Li Hao wasn't too interested in the others.He was not familiar with it, nor was he powerful.Twelve venerable sovereigns. Even if Li Hao was only a first level venerable sovereign in name, so many people were here to deal with two junior venerable sovereigns ... It could be seen that whether it was a trap or something else, these people were all highly valued by neo martial arts.It had been a year since Silver Moon opened the Stargate.This year, the red moon region had not been very peaceful. It was said that the neo martial human Kings had been dispatched several times and wanted to sneak into a great world several times ... Fortunately, they were repelled by the Joint Forces of the experts from all four sides. Otherwise, there might have been the destruction of another great world.Even so, the current Hongyue region was also jittery at the sound of the wind.They were afraid that the new martial artist King would appear at any time and kill them.A large number of worlds were moving towards the Crimson Moon world. Even though the Crimson Moon had a bad reputation, compared to the neo martial human King ... Everyone suddenly felt that the Crimson Moon might be more reliable.It was said that the high-level venerable sovereigns of both sides had met once in the depths of the chaos.The sun god of new martial arts and a seventh level venerable sovereign of Red Moon had fought in the depths of chaos. Both sides had suffered losses and retreated. Now, a battle between high-level venerable sovereigns had broken out.As for venerable the sword, he had also appeared last month. His attack was also sharp and ruthless. He killed all the venerable sovereigns in a medium world that was migrating to the Crimson Moon world, including a medium world Lord who had just entered rank six.It also shook the surroundings!It was very difficult for a Type 6 to die. Under normal circumstances, unless a Type 7 attacked, it would be difficult for a Type 6 to kill the other party, not to mention a world Lord with world power.However, the offensive power of the neo martial Swordmaster was too strong. Although he could not last long, his destructive power was terrifying!The world Lord of the medium-level world was seriously injured by him with one strike and killed with the second. He didn't even need to use three strikes. As a result, many worlds were frightened and wandered around, not daring to move to the Crimson Moon Area.This news was constantly spreading.Li Hao had also heard about it.It had to be said that the group of people from neo martial were really ruthless and could cause trouble. The other party had no allies and was not afraid of being wiped out by the Crimson Moon experts. The other party only had the neo martial world. In the end, the great world was in Emperor Cang's body. Emperor Cang had disappeared without a trace, so where could the Crimson Moon experts go?If there were too few people, they were afraid of being eaten.With so many people ... Did he not want his lair anymore?New martial was now fighting guerilla warfare, and red Moon was too big a target, so it could not fight guerilla warfare and could only passively defend. This also led to the level eight great world to be at a disadvantage against new martial.These things were also mentioned by these people on the road.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"Haoyue."In the chaotic void, Richard was the one most familiar with Li Hao ... Although they had only met once, and this was only their second time.However, the referee was very polite and warm to Li Hao.It wasn't just because of the emptiness, it had been like this before. The first reason was that a venerable sovereign from the Yunyang great world had disappeared. The second reason was that Li Hao was rather handsome. The third reason was that after meeting Li Hao, she and another venerable sovereign had an explosion of their Taoist connotation in the Coiling Dragon Well and gained some enlightenment. Please click …≥œÉ ã“Ω Ö·Ç¶Œπ…≥ for visiting. ‚Äã  Although he was still at rank one, the referee felt that he would soon reach rank two.He was quite lucky!Supreme Emperor Hao Yue was a person who could bring luck."What's wrong?"At this moment, Li Hao was looking around in the boundless chaos. However, he had a map in his hand, which was not simple, and he was comparing it to his position."Is venerable Emperor void really the Son of God of light?""I'm not sure, probably. "Li Hao smiled."I don't want to talk about this with fellow Daoist Kong Ji. I only found out about it today. He never mentioned it before."The referee didn't believe it, but he didn't think Li Hao was a liar."Then how did you meet venerable sovereign void?" she asked curiously."I said I wanted to join the Dragon Temple, so they came to inspect me. We met when I came to venerable Emperor Kong Ji."It was that simple?A year before and after?For venerable sovereigns, the so-called friendship had to be hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of years.The others were actually eavesdropping on the referee and Li Hao's conversation.At this moment, they all felt that it was impossible.Liar!This fellow might have known Kong Ji for a long time, and ... Some people even suspected that this Haoyue might have come from a major world, or perhaps even the divine light plane. Otherwise, how could he have a friendship with Kong Ji?Li Hao didn't continue this topic. Instead, he asked curiously,""This time, we're going to deal with new martial arts 'Heaven's Fate and King Huai. Where are these two now?"The others didn't say anything.Yi turned his head to look at the fourth-stage venerable sovereign, and venerable sovereign Ming Hao nodded slightly.He had nothing to hide.Seeing this, Yi said,"they're approaching the Crimson Moon world. They're near where the Dark Moon world used to be ... After the dark Moon world migrated, there are no other worlds there. They're almost there." Li Hao checked the map with his consciousness and found that the Dark Moon world was still at its original location.
