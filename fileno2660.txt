"Small space ..."Li Hao didn't mind that second cat ignored him. He squatted down and carefully studied the structure of the place.This could be considered a small world.However, it was attached to the great world.This actually had some similarities with the creation of heaven and earth."Or should I say ... A domain!"Li Hao observed it carefully and sensed the energy structure. He realized that it was a special domain, like his own divine rune domain.He used his domain to form a special space."So ... This place doesn't just contain the Taoist connotation. There might be some special things, like my Holy prose attached to the great Dao, or the foundation of some great Dao that constructed this special space!"The divine text was actually the manifestation of the great Dao.Divine runes could form a territory.For example, Li Hao's divine text could not be used right now, but he was stronger. In the future, a piece of divine text could form a space, a special space of divine text.For example, if he had reached level eight and left the word "dark" behind, it could form a special space similar to that of the dark Demon Ridge.Because of this experience, Li Hao quickly made some speculations.This Dark Demon Ridge could be considered a special domain space."The power of darkness in it might be similar to self-cultivation of the divine text. My divine text can also operate a cultivation technique and absorb energy to maintain the energy without weakening. One divine text can guard a space ..."Li Hao came to another conclusion."But such a powerful space ... If it's similar to divine text ... How powerful would the divine text of a rank-8 powerhouse be?"  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  Of course, now that he was gone, and the master was not here.Even if something similar to Holy prose existed, it should not be as powerful as before.He might be able to see something if he turned back time, but Li Hao didn't use it rashly this time. It was too troublesome, and there would be a lot of consequences. If this powerhouse at the eighth step caused him some more trouble ... Two powerhouses at the seventh step were already enough to deal with him, let alone a powerhouse at the eighth step."Treasure hunting and Dao Comprehension are normal, without the use of time!"Li Hao made up his mind. 'I don't believe that I have to use time to benefit when others don' t. 'As long as he didn't go back to the past, a normal treasure hunt shouldn't cause too much karma."There must be a core here, something similar to the core of the divine text! If you control this place ... You might even be able to control the entire small space. ""And the temple in the central area could be the core, or the core is located there!"At this moment, Li Hao had another idea.If he could control that place, he might be able to enter and exit this small world freely.This place, not to mention other things, was similar to a domain. A domain of a type 8 powerhouse could still defend against some weak people. The strength of the domain was not weaker than the Silvermoon world. It had a great defensive ability against some low-rank venerable sovereigns.He wasn't too sure about the intermediate ones.Other people were thinking about enlightenment, but Li Hao was thinking about wiping them out ... He might as well take the dark Demon Ridge away. In this way, whatever Taoist connotation there was, wouldn't it be his?Moreover, he felt that even if there was a Taoist connotation here, the key to the Taoist connotation was not the overflowing energy.Instead, it was the source of the overflowing energy!A text that existed like divine text, a cultivation technique, a fragment of the great Dao, a weapon ... A treasure that existed like these things.This was the key to the remnants of the Taoist connotation."Every time it's opened, it requires the blood essence of a venerable sovereign. This means that the thing doesn't have enough energy, so it needs the power of the blood essence of a venerable sovereign to activate it ..."Li Hao kept thinking.,m This place had been in the Huilong temple's control for many years, but it still existed. This meant that the Huilong Thearch had not discovered this treasure yet.Venerable Dragon Emperor, did you cultivate dark energy?Probably not.It might have something to do with the great Dao that they cultivated. The venerable sovereigns from The Dark World had a chance, but there were many experts who cultivated the dark element. Most of them had been here before, but no one had found it or taken it away ... This meant that it would not be easy to get close to or take it away."If I leave behind a piece of divine text, how can a weakling take it away?""Putting everything else aside, if a Dao integration stage super mighty figure were to try to take away the divine text I left behind ... It wouldn't be easy. In fact, he might even suffer a backlash!"Li Hao put himself in his shoes and thought,"you can't take away the divine text I left behind unless you're very familiar with the path of divine text."Otherwise, it would be very difficult to take it away safely even if he did not set any tests."The Dao of darkness is still the key ..."Thinking of this, Li Hao didn't move forward. Instead, he sat down with his legs crossed and a "dark" character surrounded him.There was no hurry.If treasures could be taken away so easily, this place would have long since ceased to exist.He could just take it slowly.After all, venerable Emperor Hui long had said that this place would only close after a month. It might not even close. It was just that it would be a little dangerous after a month.The "dark" character began to absorb the energy around it.Li Hao started to think about something. The river of life and death also started to spin.A surge of dark element power gushed into the river, even turning it into darkness.Second cat was a little uncomfortable and irritated. Li Hao often changed things. First, it was the river of time, then the river of life and death, and now, he had brought in a lot of dark energy, making it uncomfortable to sleep.

"What are you doing?"Second cat still made a sound."Dao Comprehension."Bullshit!Second cat was speechless. You're deliberately disgusting me!Was this considered enlightenment?Getting some black energy to dye the river Black, this was enlightenment?"Why does Wu Dao need to dye?""It's not dyeing. That's how dark energy works ...""Nonsense, the great Dao is colorless, and everything is based on the heart! Who set the rule that dark energy should be black? Why can't it be white?"Li Hao was stunned.After a long while, he said,"that makes sense, but ... It's dark. How can it be dark if it's not dark?""Black and white is just your definition. Who said that black is the current black and white is the current white?"“……”Bar spirit cat!Li Hao was speechless. I understand the logic, but you're being unreasonable!His heart moved, and in an instant, the river turned white.The energy was still the same as before.However, the color had changed."Is this a reversal of black and white?"  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  Li Hao laughed, while second cat muttered,"this is good. It's dark and uncomfortable."White ... The energy was still the same as before, but it looked much better."The great Dao follows the heart?"At this moment, Li Hao had other thoughts.More and more dark energy was surging toward him.……In the distance.A venerable sovereign from The Dark World looked in one direction and was a little confused. Were there any other companions there?This seemed to be caused by the cultivation of a dark-type expert.However, before they came in, they agreed not to rush to cultivate. They would go to the darkness shrine first, which was also their goal this time. They actually all knew that there was a darkness shrine in the dark Demon Ridge.This time, he was also here for this place.This was the main reason why he joined the Hui long temple.According to Xi han, if he could obtain some benefits or opportunities, he might even have the hope of reviving the dark great Dao universe. At that time, he would no longer need to rely on others.As for Li Hao's entry ... No one took it seriously.Moreover, the other party wasn't a dark-type powerhouse.The venerable sovereigns frowned slightly when they sensed the fluctuations of the dark energy.There was no use in cultivating at this time.Why did you break the original plan?Should I go and take a look?Just as he was thinking, he was suddenly startled. As some of the dark energy was drawn away, he suddenly saw something that flashed by. It seemed to be a person, but it also seemed to be a demon.It emerged from the darkness and quickly disappeared."What?" The venerable sovereign took a look and frowned slightly. Was he mistaken?That was impossible!However, he didn't sense any aura. Instead, he felt an endless darkness.There were other creatures in the dark Demon Ridge?……Back to the Dragon Temple.Hui long Emperor also frowned slightly.This Haoyue, what was he doing?After entering, he actually stayed in the same place and didn't move. Was he comprehending Dao?Under normal circumstances, shouldn't they be searching around?Or ... Could it be that the other party wasn't the Silver Moon King, but a true new venerable sovereign, so he wasn't very brave and was very vigilant, and was afraid of causing trouble, so he decided not to move forward and just stayed where he was to comprehend?"Did I make a wrong judgment?"He pondered for a while and looked at the brightest spot. As he had expected, mi han went straight to The Dark Divine Palace. He knew that the venerable sovereign of The Dark World must have some ideas.But ... Hui long Emperor pouted. If it was so easy to get benefits, it would have been gone a long time ago.In the past, even rank seven venerable sovereigns had come to the darknorth, but they had not found much.……Li Hao didn't stop for just one or two hours.For three whole days, he stayed in the same place, motionless, as if he was really just here to gain enlightenment. There was no movement at all. Even Hui long Thearch outside had given up. This guy, maybe he really came here to gain enlightenment.Three days later.Li Hao stood up.Beside him, the word "dark" was much stronger.In the river of life and death, a star began to grow. Like a Dark Star, it illuminated the river and stood side by side with the life and death Star. Although it was not as powerful as the life and death Star, it was not weak either."Why didn't you get a half-black and half-white Star this time?"As Li Hao walked, he heard second cat's voice."Light and darkness co-exist?""I'm afraid that I'll be killed by the power of darkness if I cultivate light here!"Li Hao said as he walked."How could that be!"Second cat felt that Li Hao was thinking too much."Why would a true expert care about such things? The opposition of light and darkness is wrong in the first place. With light there is darkness, and with darkness there is light ... If the Dao only has light and no darkness, then how do you distinguish it?"Li Hao nodded and said, that's true! But ... Aren't you afraid of getting yourself killed by creating it like this?""Are you afraid?""A little."Li Hao laughed."Where did you get the wrong idea? I'm not a lunatic. Why would I keep looking for death?""There might be a surprise!"Second cat seemed to be encouraging Li Hao, but Li Hao didn't listen. Perhaps there was a surprise ... But what if he really died?They weren't familiar.We'll talk about it after we get familiar with this place.At this moment, the cultivation of the power of darkness was showing some results. Looking forward, one could see everything within a thousand meters, which was much more convenient than before.It had been three days, and the venerable sovereigns might have arrived.However, after walking for a while, Li Hao frowned and looked around ... He felt that something was watching him. It had been the same for the past few days.

2662 Chapter 442
Since two days ago ... He had felt that there were some creatures nearby, as if they were watching him.There was someone else in this place?Or the venerable sovereigns from The Dark World?……At the same time.In the distance.BOOM!A venerable sovereign from The Dark World had a bloody gash on his chest. He looked around with a serious expression and was extremely vigilant.This place ... Actually had living things.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  What was this thing?It was incomparably powerful and almost fused with the darkness. Even if he was a dark-type cultivator, it would be difficult to capture the other party's figure.In the past two days, he had been attacked several times.Each time was more dangerous than the last.The Dragon Emperor had never mentioned this."Have the others encountered such a crisis?"He thought about it, but he could not be sure. The original plan was to meet at the central temple, but it had been three days, and he had not arrived there.No one came to look for him either. He didn't know if they were worried about an accident or if the others were too busy to take care of themselves.……"Strange."At this moment, Emperor Hui long was also a little confused.The light plate in front of him showed some special circumstances. Some black spots were attacking some light spots. This meant that the dark puppets were attacking the venerable sovereigns.But ... This was not the case in the past.Under normal circumstances, the dark treacherous currents would only attack if the other party had not left after a month. This was also when there would be some danger or even disappearances after a month.But this time, it had only been three days.Why was it like this?At this moment, the strongest of the seven spots of light was about to reach the temple. However, there were more and more black spots nearby. It seemed like the dark vortex did not welcome the newcomers."The Dark World and the sky world's Secret agent have a grudge?"He made a judgment in his heart and felt that this might be the case.Otherwise, why would there be a difference?They were both dark-elemental cultivators, and the Master of Darkness had existed for a long time. Perhaps he had some grudges with Tian Fang's Secret envoy? However, now that the powerhouses of heaven had disappeared and the Master of Darkness had fallen, there was no way to ask.This thought had something to do with Li Hao's situation. There did not seem to be many dark swirls around Li Hao, and the two sides had never met before. This meant that they were not from The Dark World, so they were not targeted.……In reality, Li Hao was currently enveloped by the divine runes of the "dark" element, and the power of darkness that was overflowing from his body originated from this place. Therefore, some of the dark puppets nearby seemed to be hesitating and did not attack Li Hao.As a result, although he had stopped for three days, Li Hao's speed was not slow.Soon, Li Hao heard some movement.There seemed to be a battle ahead?Battle?How could that be? The other six venerable sovereigns were on the same team. Even if there was a fight, it should be him.Li Hao was a little wary.They continued forward.In this place, only sound would travel slightly further. Auras and fluctuations were almost undetectable. If there was no sound, no one would know even if they fought to the death in this place.He was like a Night Elf, and he didn't go far.It was only about 10000 meters. He advanced for a while and saw the scene in front of him.From about a thousand meters away, he saw a venerable sovereign fighting, but his opponent was not a venerable sovereign. It looked like a monster, a Savage with too long hair, or a mechanical puppet.The savage was extremely crazy. He also blended into the darkness and disappeared in a flash. His claws or nails were extremely sharp and glowed with a dim light. He could easily leave a bloody mark on a second stage venerable sovereign's body.The venerable sovereign's body seemed to be just ordinary flesh and blood in this claw.Li Hao knew about that venerable sovereign. In fact, there were only two level-two venerable sovereigns among the several venerable sovereigns who had entered this time. He did not know the person's specific name, but he knew that he might be the weakest among the six powerhouses.At this moment, he was a little terrified and anxious. He would occasionally berate the other party as if he wanted to scare them away, but at the same time, he was hoping that other experts would notice and come to his rescue.He seemed to be able to see further. When Li Hao appeared, he seemed to have seen him. At first, his eyes were filled with disappointment, but the next moment, they were filled with hope."Is it fellow Daoist Hao Yue?""For some reason, some undead creatures have appeared here ... It's very dangerous for them to attack us!""Have you met the other venerable sovereigns of my dark world?"Li Hao did not say anything.The venerable sovereign was a little anxious."This undead creature isn't weak. I've been entangled for so long and can't get away ... However, it's not much stronger than me. If fellow Daoist can help me, I can kill it ... The dark Qi in its body is dense. After killing it, all the benefits will belong to fellow Daoist ... If fellow Daoist is unwilling, I'll have to trouble fellow Daoist to help me find the others ..."He kept talking and started to move toward Li Hao.A venerable sovereign seemed to have lost many abilities in such an environment. He couldn't even tear the void and escape.As for the savage-like monster, it was the same as before. It seemed to have no intelligence.

He just kept flashing and attacking.Each attack would leave a wound on the venerable sovereign. A pure dark energy attached itself to the venerable sovereign's body and even devoured the energy inside.They were both dark energy, but the dark energy here was obviously of a higher level.Li Hao retreated a distance. The venerable sovereign was a little anxious and said again,""Fellow Daoist Hao Yue, we're both venerable sovereigns from the Dragon Temple. Are you willing or not? at least give me a response. If you're not willing to take the risk, I won't force you!"Li Hao ignored him. He retreated a distance again and made a careful judgment.He tilted his head and listened for a while.He came to a conclusion ... This Savage seemed to have locked onto the venerable sovereign through his voice.It was possible that this venerable sovereign had made a sound and attracted the barbarian's attention.As for his response, he might also be targeted.Bad intentions!As venerable sovereigns, why were they shouting at such a close distance? they could have just sent a voice transmission directly. Did they have to open their mouths to make themselves sound loud?In the darkness, who knew how many of such existences there were.From the looks of it, this person had also been forced into a corner.Otherwise, it would be better to be quiet.Li Hao ignored him. He was not interested in helping others. At this moment, he carefully examined the savage ... It seemed to be a human, but ... It seemed to have no intelligence.There were some signs of losing control.From the looks of it, it seemed to be a dark-type cultivator who was entangled with the dark power here and turned into a dark marionette. "The power of darkness in this place can even control experts?"Wasn't this the equivalent of another form of possession?He took a closer look and saw that the second level venerable sovereign was still fighting back. Sometimes, he would leave some wounds on the Savage's body. However, as the venerable sovereign had said, the creature was like an undead creature. The wounds healed in an instant, and it had no effect on the savage.This thing was not easy to deal with!Why did this thing suddenly appear?"Fellow Daoist Hao Yue!"At this time, there were more wounds on the venerable sovereign's body, and the wounds were almost impossible to heal. It was almost impossible for a venerable sovereign to do this, but it had happened.His blood was still dripping.At this moment, he was also a little anxious and uneasy. He spoke again,""Fellow Daoist, you just need to help me block it for a while, and I will have a way to deal with this thing! If you help me, I'm willing to pay 3000 great Dao crystals!"A great Dao crystal was enough for a first stage venerable sovereign to cultivate for a day.Blocking for a moment was equivalent to ten years of hard work.This deal was actually quite cost-effective. A first level venerable sovereign was in need of these things.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  Seeing that Li Hao was unmoved, he couldn't help but say again,""Five thousand? Ten thousand? If fellow Daoist is still not satisfied, I'll tell you that there should be a Dark Crystal inside this undead creature's body. It's not just an energy crystal, but also a Dao accumulation crystal. It should be the dark Yin puppet, a puppet of the Dao. It should have been devoured by the Dao accumulation left here, controlled, and turned into a puppet!""As long as we kill this thing, it will definitely drop a great Dao crystal, which contains some of the rules of the owner of this place!""This thing is a priceless treasure to darkness-type cultivators!""Even if you can't use it," he said anxiously,"if you get it and Exchange it with someone else, I can still exchange it for hundreds of thousands of great Dao crystals! If you have dozens of them, you can even buy a small world to devour, and it'll be enough for fellow Daoist to enter rank two in an instant!"The Taoist connotation of the great Dao?Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. These words might not be false.He looked at the Barbarian and observed him carefully. The source of energy in the barbarian's body seemed to be gathered into one. On the outside, there was also some dark Taoist connotation flowing.Maybe ... There was really a piece of the Tao crystal, just as he said.One was worth hundreds of thousands of Dao crystals?Li Hao had asked last time. A small world was worth about ten million great Dao crystals, which was equivalent to a level-one venerable sovereign's chaos Qi that had been condensed for twenty to thirty thousand years.Was it worth it?Some people felt that it was worth it.Each piece of this thing was worth hundreds of thousands ... Of course, to a level one venerable sovereign, killing this thing was equivalent to killing a level two or even level three venerable sovereign. If he had the ability, why would he lack hundreds of thousands of great Dao crystals?The Dao accumulations of the great Dao of darkness.Unfortunately, it wasn't the life and death great Dao, nor the other five elements great Dao. Even the light great Dao would be very useful to Li Hao.Only the way of darkness ... Silver Moon had too few people who cultivated it, and there were not many experts."The remnants of the great Dao...The backlash of the Dao ... These dark Yin swirls might have been backfired when they were trying to comprehend the great Dao!"Li Hao was lost in thought. Could it be that these people had touched the object that looked like divine text in this small world?Therefore, he suffered a backlash.Was it because the Taoist connotation and power of that thing were too strong that these cultivators couldn't withstand the invasion of the dark power at all?Seeing that Li Hao was still not answering and seemed to be in a daze, the level two venerable sovereign became anxious!His heart was filled with anger.This person had not responded!Just as Li Hao had thought, he had come to the conclusion that it was the sound that had triggered this thing's attack. If Li Hao had made a sound, he might have been able to lure this thing away, but Li Hao just didn't make a sound.If he continued like this, he would be killed.Even if a rank two venerable sovereign had a strong life force, in this place, his injuries could not be healed. He would die sooner or later.

Moreover, there was probably more than one dark puppet here.The commotion would attract more dark Yin swirls sooner or later.He looked at Li Hao and made up his mind.Since you've found your way here ... Don't blame me.If you don't take the initiative to help, I'll take the initiative.In an instant, he dashed toward Li Hao. 'If you don't say anything, I'll help you!'Even if he had to take the puppet's attack head on, he would drag Li Hao down with him.A wave of dense dark energy rushed straight at Li Hao!How could you not make a move when a battle starts? On the other side, Li Hao came back to his senses and looked at that person. He wasn't surprised.At the moment of life and death, a fellow Daoist would rather die than a poor Daoist.Of course, it was better to be able to drag people down.It was better than dying.A second stage venerable sovereign ... That was pretty good.However, he had been fighting with the puppet for a long time and was still injured. Although he was stronger than an ordinary first stage venerable sovereign, there was a limit to his strength.To kill?Or ... Retreat?If he killed him, he might have to face the attack of the dark puppets. He wasn't afraid of one, but Li Hao felt that there was more than one here. What if more came after he killed one?However, on second thought, he had already constructed 220 bridges of life and death.With more than 240 traces, he had hope of entering the third stage.A second stage venerable sovereign, even if his energy was limited ... It should be enough to help him Form 20 bridges, right?"I didn't take the initiative ..."Li Hao muttered to himself. Kong Ji told him not to kill people randomly in case he caused trouble.However, I didn't take the initiative this time.It was the other party who attacked me first!It was just an excuse ... Li Hao didn't really care.If there were only seven venerable sovereigns here, it would be a little troublesome to kill them.However, now that such a thing had appeared here, the death of a venerable sovereign ... Was nothing. Even if something happened, he could find an excuse.At this moment, Li Hao was determined to kill!The people of the Dark World were killed.Even if he didn't kill him, this guy would be killed sooner or later.With this thought in mind, he didn't use his sword technique. Instead, at this moment, the power of life and death emerged. They were both level two venerable sovereigns, but the other party's body was broken. Li Hao didn't fear him even if he didn't use his sword technique.The life and death Stars appeared.In an instant, the power of death descended. The other party had just attacked when he suddenly felt the power of death. His expression changed slightly, but Li Hao was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, the power of death entered his body.The venerable sovereign wanted to use the power of darkness to suppress Li Hao, but as soon as the power of darkness was released, a divine rune appeared and devoured the power of darkness.The venerable sovereign's expression changed!What was this? Just as he was thinking about it, the power of death exploded in his body. A destructive power exploded in his body. The bed in the venerable sovereign's body trembled. The power of bed that he had brought out from the dark World was instantly covered by the power of death.Li Hao's life and death Stars instantly enveloped his opponent.Countless life forces were sucked away.The venerable sovereign's expression changed drastically."Venerable Emperor of life and death!"At this moment, he felt that this person was not only a death-type venerable sovereign, but also a venerable sovereign of both life and death. Not good!Venerable sovereigns were considered to be knowledgeable.Life and death, yin and yang, light and darkness, water and fire ...Once these venerable sovereigns of the two opposing attributes fused the power of the two extremes, their strength would often exceed those of the same level by a large margin.More importantly, this Hao Yue wasn't at the first rank!It was a rank two venerable sovereign, the same rank as him!This is troublesome!……  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  At the same time.Outside.Hui long Emperor's expression changed. He had already seen the encounter between the two. The moment Li Hao's light spot flickered, he burst out a powerful force that almost covered the entire disc.At this moment, the entire Dark Demon Ridge seemed to be enveloped by something, sealed off, and cut off from the outside world.The Supreme Emperor was looking forward to it, but he was also a little nervous. He wanted to see what was going on.At this moment, he seemed to have suffered some backlash, but he didn't care. He just stared at Li Hao's dot of light ... After a while, he was a little disappointed and desperate.There was no change!Not an expert from the Dao universe?How could that be!He had Great Expectations that bright moon Emperor was the Silver Moon King, but ... Even though Li Hao was the Silver Moon King, he didn't seem to have a great Dao universe. Otherwise, his strength would be weakened by the isolation of the dark Demon Ridge.The few from the dark great world were almost unaffected because they didn't have a Dao universe.But Li Hao was not affected at all.At this moment, Supreme Emperor Hui long was disappointed!It wasn 't!Or rather, even if it was, there was no Dao universe. Maybe the realm Lord had guessed wrong."Damn it!""Damn it!" The venerable Emperor cursed in his heart. He was both regretful and depressed.Very quickly, he recovered some of his spirit. Perhaps ... The current Haoyue had yet to use the power of the great path of the universe. Right, perhaps this was the case. Perhaps this person was not only at the second rank. Perhaps he did not even need to use the power of the great path of the universe to have this strength.Yes, that was a possibility!He could only comfort himself in this way. Otherwise, he would be too disappointed this time.He took another look and saw that the other light spot had disappeared, but he didn't care.A second level venerable sovereign, who was injured before, was killed by this Hao Yue ... What does it have to do with me?Among the venerable sovereigns in the dark World, he only valued the rank five venerable sovereign.Moreover, this time, Haoyue had killed that person ... Which was actually a good thing. Huilong temple now had three fifth level venerable sovereigns. If this time, Kong Ji and mi han were to have some conflict, this would actually be a way to control them.

Otherwise, if the two tier 5 experts were really close, it would be a threat to him."Let's wait a little longer ... Maybe I can't let Haoyue reveal the second rank ... Maybe, the third rank will do ..."He thought to himself, but he still didn't want to give up.……At this moment, Li Hao's power of life and death erupted and extracted his vitality. The next moment, death descended.In an instant, the second stage venerable sovereign seemed to have been sucked dry by him.The dark power in his body instantly dissipated, and a long river appeared, sweeping across the world. A level two venerable sovereign was swept into the river by Li Hao and melted in it!Li Hao, however, frowned and looked up at the sky.In that instant, he had sensed that this domain seemed to have been sealed by something, but it disappeared very quickly."Seal off the dark Demon Ridge ..."Return to the Dragon Emperor?Or was it someone else?What was he after?Li Hao was a little confused. It didn't seem to have any effect. Then, what was venerable Dragon Emperor after?Strange!In that case ... The other party might have noticed something, including the fact that he had killed someone?This was not a good thing!Is he monitoring us?Such a thought came to Li Hao's mind. He didn't even care about the Barbarian-like darkness and attacked him. At this moment, he quickly retreated and kept looking at the sky with a grave expression.The feeling of being monitored didn't feel good.Moreover, when he was about to kill his opponent, the world was suddenly sealed ... It didn't affect him, but ... What if he was a cultivator of the great Dao universe?Would he cut off his connection with the Dao?If they were cut off, wouldn't they be weakened immediately and killed by the enemy?"The great Dao universe ..."His heart skipped a beat. Could it be ... Because of this?Did the other party suspect that he was also a cultivator from the Dao universe?Li Hao thought of many things, but he wasn't sure.If that was the case, it meant that the Dragon Emperor might have really doubted his identity. However, how could he be sure that Silvermoon existed in the universe of the great path?He wasn't a cultivator from the Dao universe. If Qian Wuliang and the others were here, he might be cut off instantly and become weak. But he wouldn't be like that. His Dao was in the river of life and death.These thoughts flashed through Li Hao's mind. He quickly escaped and allowed the savage to pursue him. At this moment, he was gathering the power of a rank two venerable sovereign in the river and purifying it.He wanted to try to build a bridge here. Even if he couldn't enter the 3rd rank, he had to at least have the ability to enter the 3rd rank at any time.……At the same time.Outside.Kong Ji suddenly looked inside and raised his eyebrows slightly. Just now, Hui long seemed to be doing something. That feeling ... In an instant, the entire Hui long temple seemed to have lost the emergence of the power of the Taoist connotation.Block the dark Demon Ridge?"Blocking the dark Demon Ridge ... And isolating the great Dao universe? Are you suspecting that guy's identity?"If that was the case ... Huilong's acting was really good.He didn't show anything before.In that case, Li Hao was probably doing something too. Fighting or killing?Kong Ji smiled and didn't care too much.If he wanted to kill someone, then so be it!What did it matter if a few venerable sovereigns from a great world without a Dao universe died?As for mi Han's dissatisfaction ... If he killed mi han, he would lose a fifth rank venerable sovereign. For Hui long, it meant that he would lose a fifth rank venerable sovereign. Would Hui long fall out with him? would he offend another fifth rank venerable sovereign if he lost another fifth rank venerable sovereign?He was a smart person and would not make such a choice.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ   The solution to the problem was quite simple.Kong Ji thought about it and laughed.It was indeed not troublesome!It was just that ... Some things would be exposed, but it didn't matter. It wasn't his idea to pretend to be a pig to eat the Tiger. There was no need to do that. It was just that there was no need to be so fierce in daily life!"Mm, that's it ... When Sui han comes out, it's fine if he doesn't say anything. If he does, I'll kill him!"Kong Ji thought to himself and made a decision.This problem was not difficult to solve.As for Huilong, he didn't need to worry about him.If he could kill a fifth rank venerable sovereign, he wouldn't be afraid of a sixth rank one.Huilong was a smooth person. At that time, he had to respect and please him.If it really didn't work, he would just bring out his backer.However, just because he did not use it did not mean that he could not use it. If he really used it, he would be ridiculed. He had left the radiance great world in high spirits back then. Now, he was using the name of the radiance great world again. He would lose some face.Kong Ji laughed and didn't care anymore.Why should I care about what other people think?This moment was just one of Hui Long's outbursts. He seemed to have thought of many things, but he also felt that it was quite interesting to think about it this way.

Chapter 2666 Rapid Advancement (1)
Dark Demon Ridge.In front of the Dark Temple.Min Han had finally reached this place. At this moment, he was not in a good mood. Along the way, he had encountered the attacks of some dark Yin swirls, among which there were even rank 4 dark Yin swirls.To him, it was naturally not much of a threat.However, he was not the only one who had entered this time. There were several venerable sovereigns from The Dark World.Now that The Dark World had been destroyed, these venerable sovereigns were his capital.If there was a rank four Yin Chi that attacked others, it would be troublesome.He turned around and hesitated. Should he go out and look for those people, or wait here?It might be even more troublesome if they missed the search.Wait ... Would they be able to wait?Or should he enter the dark Shrine first?He glanced at The Dark Divine Palace. At this moment, the pitch-black door was closed tightly. Mi han was a little hesitant. They had agreed to meet here and enter only after everyone had gathered.If he had gone in earlier and the others had come, they would not have been able to see him and had been waiting for him. When he came out, he would have been a little dissatisfied."Let's wait for two more days!"Very quickly, mi han made a decision.This was the third day. If there were still people who hadn't arrived on the fifth day, he wouldn't wait anymore.At this time, he looked around again, his eyes a little gloomy.Why are these dark Yin puppets attacking us?In the past, there were people who had entered the dark Demon Ridge, but they had never heard of such a dangerous place. If a fourth-rank Yin Chi appeared and attacked experts, many venerable sovereigns would die Here."It's a little strange ..."As he thought about it, he was extremely vigilant.Then, he looked at the dark Shrine. Could there be dark swirls in this shrine?Then, he thought of venerable sovereign Hao Yue. He was merely a first rank venerable sovereign. He was afraid that he would not be able to come this far. It was a pity. Otherwise, he would have taught him a lesson.Whether he killed or injured him, that guy had provoked him before. If not for Hui Long's respect, Sui han would have been impolite to him.Just as he was thinking, he suddenly looked into the distance.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  He was a fifth rank venerable sovereign, but he could only see three to four thousand meters away.However, he seemed to have heard a faint scream."What?"Mi han frowned slightly. Were the others attacked?Should I go and take a look?……At the same time. After killing the level-two venerable sovereign, Li Hao did not fight with the Barbarian. Instead, he kept running away. The river of life and death was draining the energy of the venerable sovereign and purifying it.Although they were both second stage venerable sovereigns, Li Hao felt that the dark energy of this person was not pure enough, even if he came from a great world.At least, compared to this place, the other party's dark power was a little mixed.Pieces of dark great Dao crystals were condensed.He did not know if a second stage venerable sovereign could help him build the last twenty bridges of life and death. Ever since he became a venerable sovereign, he had killed many venerable sovereigns, but the energy consumption of the river of life and death was too great.If it were someone else, there would not be so many venerable sovereigns to kill.Soon, the dark crystals that had been purified began to melt and connect with the stars. They communicated with life and death, building a bridge between life and death. Originally, Li Hao had already built 220 bridges of life and death.According to Li Hao's judgment, if he built more than 240 bridges, he should be able to enter stage three.From the first stage to the third stage of the venerable sovereign realm, the main process was to accumulate energy. There was no transformation at this stage, so there was no barrier between realms.The bridge started to increase.Very quickly, a bridge between life and death was successfully built.Li Hao's aura was slightly stronger.In the darkness, the savage who had attacked the venerable sovereign earlier suddenly appeared. His shining claws instantly pierced into Li Hao's body. However, as soon as the claws entered, the word "dark" began to absorb the power of darkness from the claws.The divine text expanded, but it did not get penetrated by the dark power like the previous venerable sovereign. The dark power released by the savage was absorbed by Li Hao's "dark" divine text.Li Hao's eyes flickered.His way of darkness might not be stronger than that rank two venerable sovereign 's, but at this moment, the divine runes were absorbing his opponent's dark power. It might be related to the fact that his divine runes had previously absorbed a large amount of dark power from the dark Demon Ridge.The power of darkness within the Holy prose is of a higher level.Or rather, he was at the same level as this Savage.Thus, he was able to complete the absorption."He's quite difficult to deal with!"Li Hao glanced at the savage who had disappeared in an instant. He came and went without a trace, as if he had hidden in the darkness. It was almost impossible to see his figure, and he could appear and attack you at any time.He also had the strength of a second stage, but the level of the dark power in his body was very high, causing the previous venerable sovereign to be unable to get rid of it at all.Fortunately, there was only one.If a few more of them came, he would be a little difficult to deal with.Li Hao quickly retreated. He didn't kill the dark Mantis, mainly because he was worried that if he killed one, more would appear, which would be troublesome.He would first digest what he had obtained, it would be best if he could advance to Grade 3.If he couldn't ... Then he would find a way to kill a Yin Chi. The other party had a Dao accumulation crystal in its body, which was also full of energy. To him, it was also a tonic.This Dark Demon Ridge was a good place!Li Hao soon disappeared. He found a quiet place and covered himself with divine runes. Dark power spread out, and the divine runes turned into a domain. He wanted to try and see if he could block the tracking of the dark swirls.

2667 Chapter 443
If he blended in with the environment, he might be able to avoid being attacked by the other party.The premise was that the energy emitted by his "dark" character must be the same as the fluctuations of the dark power here. In Li Hao's opinion, the dark Yin swirls were not only made by sound, but also by the fluctuations of Taoist connotation."I hope I can enter stage three ... Otherwise, I'll have to kill again."Li Hao muttered in his heart.Now that he had entered rank three, he could be at ease. There was still a rank five venerable sovereign here.They would meet sooner or later in this place.Currently, Li Hao really didn't dare to casually borrow the power of this place. If he borrowed the power of a darkness-type expert, regardless of whether the other party would lend it or not, if he really did ... He would probably lose his life.It was too dangerous!He sat cross-legged and began to practice his cultivation technique. Now, he was still using the five birds technique as his Foundation, but it was no longer a simple technique. Instead, it was a breathing technique that Li Hao had improved on.Swallowing and spitting the power of 10000 DAOs!He had borrowed the cultivation techniques of many people, including the cultivation techniques of some strong neo martial artists, including "Yuanping Chronicles" and "Zhang family education record". Li Hao had also integrated these neo martial arts secret techniques into it.The long river was like a living creature. In the river, holes appeared one after another, swallowing and spitting out the dark crystals.Some impurities were filtered out again.The energy of a second stage venerable sovereign was not of much use to Li Hao. Under normal circumstances, the power of a venerable sovereign was already very pure. However, in Li Hao's opinion, perhaps it was because he had seen many strong people, but he always felt that the purity of the energy was not satisfactory and was too trashy."Tier 3 ... As soon as possible!"Now that the battle between new martial arts and Crimson Moon was about to break out, the tianfang great world was eyeing them covetously. It seemed that many great worlds in the tianfang region were also ready to make trouble.The war between neo martial and Crimson Moon had already involved the thoughts of all the big worlds in this chaos.Following this, there might be a series of battles between the seventh step.As for himself ... It was not difficult to reach the third level now, but to enter the middle level, he might need the other two extreme powers. Yin and yang were his plans, but if he could not comprehend yin and yang, he could only take a step back and choose Nirvana and recovery, or the five elements of water and fire, or simply choose darkness and light.He had come into contact with some of these great DAOs.As for yin and yang ... He didn't understand them at all.Even though neo martial was famous for its yin and yang!"If you want to participate in the neo martial arts battle and repay the favor, you don't have the ability to do so without the power of an intermediate venerable sovereign. Even if you enter the intermediate level, you're just a slightly stronger cannon fodder."The true paragons were the type 7 and type 8 powerhouses!No matter if it was the tianfang region or the Hongyue region, there were no ninth-rank venerable sovereigns. Perhaps there were no ninth-rank venerable sovereigns in the other regions nearby. The eighth-rank was heaven. The neo martial human King was considered talented, but he had not entered the eighth-rank yet.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  "A neo martial human king who only cultivates yin and yang can step into the seventh tier ... It's already very terrifying." Li Hao thought about this as he built the bridge between life and death.At this moment, the savage reappeared. However, this time, he did not attack Li Hao directly. Instead, he hovered near the territory formed by the word "dark", as if he was judging and sensing something.It was possible that the energy of the "dark" character was almost the same as the energy in this place, which caused some interference to the other party.The Barbarian stayed where he was for a moment. Then, as if he had received a new order or heard some other movement, he disappeared. Li Hao watched him for a while, his eyes flickering.This thing seemed to have fused with the energy of this place.He had become an existence similar to the spirit of heaven and earth in this Dark Demon Ridge.More importantly, there was more than one such dark Mantis here."That eighth-rank Dark Envoy's Dao of darkness is very insidious ..." Li Hao thought to himself as he sat cross-legged and continued to train.In the river, dark crystals were devoured one by one. In the blink of an eye, eight bridges of life and death had appeared. At this moment, there were 228 bridges, which was more than what he had consumed before.As his realm and power increased, his energy consumption also increased.This time, Li Hao didn't care about what was happening in other places. He just focused on his training.He was actually the same as the neo martial human King. He would use whatever he had gained and would hardly keep anything. Perhaps he had been affected by his travels in the neo martial world, or perhaps it was Li Hao's original intention. Even though he knew that Silver Moon needed resources, he did not keep them and was prepared to bring them back.The key was to strengthen himself first!Furthermore, Li Hao believed that even though Silver moon's men might not be as strong, they were probably thinking of a way to save themselves.Li Hao was well aware that someone was after Silver Moon.There might be people searching in the nearby void.However, he believed that he could take care of the Silvermoon people himself. It shouldn't be too difficult for him to escape and hide.……This was Li Hao's second seclusion training here.This time, it didn't take long.It had only been two days.In two days, Li Hao had devoured all the energy of a rank two venerable sovereign, and the number of bridges of life and death had reached 238. It was quite frustrating. It was just a little short of Li Hao's expected 240 bridges.Most importantly, a second stage venerable sovereign had only provided him with the energy to Form 18 bridges. Previously, a first stage venerable sovereign had built 50 bridges.Maybe it was because he was stronger, and his consumption was greater, or maybe this rank two was too much of a fake!

2668 Chapter 443
"Almost ..."Li Hao exhaled and smiled. It was normal. It wasn't that perfect.A little bit less was nothing.There were not only the dark Mantis but also the venerable sovereigns.At most, he could kill another venerable sovereign or a Yin Chi. It should not be a problem for him to reach rank three.Last time, he had agreed to a one year deadline with venerable sovereign Yi. It had only been a little more than ten months since then. It had been almost a year since he left this place. It shouldn't be a problem for him to reach rank three.To be able to advance from level one to level three within a year was already very terrifying.……Just as Li Hao was about to set off again ...In front of the Dark Temple.The three venerable sovereigns gathered.One of them was a rank five mi han, while the other two were rank three venerable sovereigns.At this moment, there were still three venerable sovereigns who had not arrived. One was at the third level, and two were at the second level.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  Tuo han had been waiting for two days. At this time, he frowned slightly. In two days, only two people had come. Although the dark Demon Ridge was difficult to walk through, it was not very big. To venerable sovereigns, it was actually very small.If it wasn't for the gathering of the power of darkness, which made it impossible to determine the direction and speed up the journey, such a short distance would only take a few teleportations.At this moment, he looked back at The Dark Divine Palace and then at the looming dark vultures around him. He said in a deep voice,""I can't wait any longer! In these two days, more and more dark swirls gathered, I even discovered the type 4 swirls that attacked me previously! This place ... He couldn't stay for long! Since those three aren't here yet, let's enter the dark Shrine first. They should know that we've entered ..."The remaining two venerable sovereigns also nodded slightly.This was not the time to wait."Drought-killing King, why are there so many dark Yin puppets this time?" one of the venerable sovereigns asked.Chuhan looked at the dark Shrine and frowned,""It might have something to do with the darkness shrine. I've sensed that the dark power overflowing from the darkness shrine has become slightly restless! Such a disturbance might have caused the dark Yin swirls to be restless. "It was a bad thing, but it could also be a good thing.If there was an unforeseen event, perhaps ... There would be quite a big chance.The dark Demon Ridge had existed for countless years, and no one had ever obtained the key treasure that existed in the dark Demon Ridge. Perhaps this time ... Was their chance."Go in!"Pi han did not say much, he would know once he entered.In fact, The Dark World had some understanding of The Dark Divine Palace. Some people from The Dark World had even entered it before, but it was said that there was nothing inside, and they didn't gain much after entering.However, everyone knew that the key to the dark Demon Ridge was in the dark Shrine.Back then, the level eight secret agent of the Outlander world had cultivated here. He was extremely terrifying.Mi han also knew some secrets that even the Hui long Emperor didn't know. It was said that when the dark emissary was cultivating here, even the master of Tian Fang had come many times to have a few exchanges with him.Even the dark Demon Ridge might be related to the master of Tian Fang. This place ... Was not ordinary.The only reason why the venerable Emperor had been able to take over the dark Demon Ridge was that the Lords of some major worlds could not easily enter the tianfang world. Even if they did, they would usually keep a low profile and would not easily expose themselves.Of course, there was another crucial point. There might be another top venerable sovereign standing behind the venerable Dragon Emperor.Although the tianfang region was named tianfang.However, powerhouses had disappeared for many years in the tianfang region. There were more than a dozen great worlds in the tianfang region, the most famous of which were the light and cloud divine regions.These two worlds were said to have sector Lord level 8 strength.The reason why it was said to be ... Was because these world overlords rarely took action, even red Moon master. Advanced venerable sovereigns might have some idea, but other venerable sovereigns could only judge based on rumors.This time, there might be a powerhouse of the eighth step standing behind the dragon Emperor. As for whether it was the radiant God or the cloud Lord, it was not clear.That was why the venerable Dragon Emperor was able to rule a place with Taoist connotation like the dark Demon Ridge, and no one had come to find trouble with him.Even if it was just a rumor ... The major cosmos absolute beings would be more wary.The other experts would find it even more difficult to match this rank six venerable sovereign."Go in!"Dark Demon Ridge was the key to whether he could enter level six, whether The Dark World could recover, and whether the great Dao universe could appear again!This was his chance!He quickly stepped forward with the three venerable sovereigns. The huge door of darkness silently opened as they approached.It was like a huge mouth of darkness!Mi han was a little nervous, but he did not look back. He entered directly, and the two rank three venerable sovereigns quickly followed.The three of them entered the dark Shrine.Soon, the door of the hall closed, as if no one had ever been here.……Dark Demon Ridge. Li Hao wandered around and soon stopped at a place. He crouched down and touched the ground. Some blood that was suffused with dark energy splattered.He judged and sensed for a while.It was a pity.The second level two venerable sovereign of The Dark World had been killed!Yes, he had been killed.The blood contained some aura of death. Others might not be able to sense it, but Li Hao could clearly sense it. The level two venerable sovereign had been killed by the dark puppet.What a pity!Previously, he had his eyes on this second stage venerable sovereign.

2669 Chapter 443
Second level venerable sovereigns were at the same level as him. He was at the peak of second level venerable sovereigns, so it was easy for him to kill those dark venerable sovereigns. But now ... He was killed by the dark puppet.It seemed that it would be a little difficult for him to enter the 3rd rank."Venerable sovereigns ... It's not safe either,"Li Hao was touched. How many venerable sovereigns had died since he came to the tianfang world?He had already killed seven of them!He had killed five venerable sovereigns in the Tianhe zone, one at the Coiling Dragon Well, and two more here. In less than a year since he came to the tianfang world, he had seen nine venerable sovereigns die!In addition, there was the third level venerable sovereign who had been killed by Hong Yue and the second level venerable sovereign who had been possessed by Black Panther.It had only been a year, and he had seen 11 venerable sovereigns die with his own eyes.He was not even a trash venerable sovereign like Shi Gu."The chaos is indeed dangerous!"He muttered in his heart.What he didn't know was that in the past year, nine venerable sovereigns had died in the entire tianfang world, including this one ... Yes, they were all related to him. Other than him, not a single venerable sovereign had died!Under normal circumstances, when one reached the level of venerable sovereigns, unless they encountered great danger or a fierce war broke out, there would not be so many venerable sovereigns who would die.So many venerable sovereigns had died only after he had arrived.Li Hao, on the other hand, had an illusion. It was possible that the new martial human King and the new martial human King had destroyed a great world, leading to the death of many venerable sovereigns. Li Hao felt that venerable sovereigns were dying all the time in the chaotic universe!However, if it weren't for him and the new martial human King, there wouldn't be so many battles between venerable sovereigns.At least the new martial artist human King knew that he was a killer.Li Hao, on the other hand, was completely unaware.He had always felt that he was a refined man who rarely initiated a war or killing.He was fighting for justice ... Perhaps, Li Hao had taken Liu Long's hypnotizing words seriously, and had always thought so."The other venerable sovereigns from the Dark Universe might have left or died. It's too difficult to find them. Why don't I ... Kill a Yin Chi and enter rank three?" he thought.Li Hao's mind moved, and he immediately put his thoughts into action.At that moment, the "dark" word disappeared, and the dark domain that enveloped him disappeared."Cough cough!"Li Hao coughed slightly.Very quickly, there was some movement in the surroundings. The dark Yin Chi that had not come to find him before began to appear.A moment later, a sharp claw appeared in the darkness. It was unknown if it was the old acquaintance from before, but it looked similar. A Savage appeared, and his eyes were lightless, only endless darkness.He directly charged at Li Hao!……At the same time.Back to the Dragon Temple.The venerable Emperor looked at it for a while and frowned.Two venerable sovereigns had died.The other three had already entered the darkness shrine, and he could no longer see the light spots. He could see some light spots outside the darkness shrine, but he could not see the inside. At this moment, it seemed that Supreme Emperor Hao Yue was fighting with the dark ghastly puppet.He couldn't see much of a change.He didn't cover the entire Dark Demon Ridge again. This dark Yin swirls only had the strength of a 2nd rank spiritual beast, so it shouldn't be able to defeat Haoyue."There's also a third rank venerable sovereign ..."He looked at a spot of light not far from Li Hao. They weren't too far apart.He didn't know if the two of them would meet.He still wanted to test Li Hao again."Even if they don't meet now ... Mai han and the others have entered the darkness shrine. These two people might meet in front of the darkness shrine ..."Supreme Dragon thought to himself and looked at the spot where Li Hao was.This venerable Emperor Hao Yue ... Was he hiding his true strength, or was he really blessed with countless opportunities?Why did he feel that the strength of his light spot was almost at the level of the third rank? it was not even weaker than the third rank venerable sovereign from The Dark World.Strange!Previously, it was said that venerable sovereign Hao Yue was only at the first rank. But now, he felt that he was almost at the third rank. Was it because there was no one around, so he revealed his strength?Otherwise, no matter how fast an ordinary person cultivated, from level one to level three, it couldn't be that fast, right?"Is he hiding his strength?""Maybe it was Tier 3 from the start?"He couldn't believe that this person was really a first level venerable sovereign when he came. Otherwise, his progress would be too fast. It had only been a year. To a venerable sovereign, it was like the blink of an eye.It was normal for a closed-door cultivation to last for ten to a hundred years.  BEst novel online free at ռOʋɛʟɮɨռ  In the nearby area, the neo martial human Kings had made rapid progress. Even the venerable sovereigns of neo martial were the same. They had stepped into the seventh level in a thousand years.As for the other seventh level venerable sovereigns, which one of them was not ten thousand years old? even a hundred thousand years old was considered young."Let's see!"The venerable Dragon Emperor thought to himself as he continued to stare at the disc.……Meanwhile, in the dark Demon Ridge.This time, Li Hao used his swordsmanship.A hundred stars gathered, and with a slash of the sword, life and death appeared.The power of life and death was powerful and difficult to deal with for ordinary venerable sovereigns. However, the dark Yin puppet did not seem to be a living creature. It had neither life nor death. When the power of life and death burst out, it could neither extract vitality nor kill the opponent through death Qi.The power of life and death ... Didn't have much effect on the dark Yin Chi.The technique that he used to kill a level two venerable sovereign was useless against this Savage.Li Hao's heart moved.Undead creatures!Or rather, this thing was not a living thing.Li Hao only realized that it was quite difficult to deal with after fighting it.The power of life and death was useless. Even if the power of other great DAOs injured the other party, the surrounding power of darkness would quickly gather and heal the other party's injuries. If this continued, the other party's power would be almost endless. He would not be injured or weakened.
