        the star dynasty is finished! Don't you see that the world is in chaos? Montenegro bandits, tornado stronghold, Starlight Pirates ... Father, I can't live like this anymore! Those superpowers, those martial masters, they were overbearing, they couldn't live anymore ... So what if they rebelled! The White Saint Army should at least give us something to eat. At this time of the year, we can't farm, and our grain has been robbed. The officials and bandits are one ... If we don't rebel, are we just going to wait for death?"
         Li Hao heard some noise and vaguely heard someone say,""The bandits of the Montenegro are extremely vicious. They wouldn't just Rob and burn down the village without killing anyone ... I think ... It's the White Saint bandits who pretended to be bandits of the Black Mountain and forced us to go up the mountain!"
         "Who cares? there's no way out for us. Out of all the bandits, only the White sage Army treats us as humans ... We'll surrender if we want to. We're all skilled. If they're interested in us, then we'll do it. At least we'll be able to fill our stomachs and raise our children!"
         "That's true! Let's go and find the White Saint Army ..."
         "Old Zhang's second son is the White sage Army's ..."
         "F * ck, it might be this B * stard who brought Saint White's military uniform with him and the Montenegro bandits ... Forget it, I don't care anymore!"
         “……”
         In the distance, Li Hao's expression changed when he heard the voice.
         Was the world ... In chaos?
         This was a province in the North that was close to the eastern continent. It was called the dual-continent province, meaning that it spanned two continents.
          From the tone of the crowd, it seemed that the Montenegro bandits, the White Saint Army, and the Starlight Pirates were all running amuck, but the officials seemed to be unable to encircle and suppress them. Or perhaps it wasn't that they were unable to do so, but that they were just sitting by and not doing anything!
         They've even started to pull people up the mountain and become bandits!
         Suddenly, Li Hao's eyes flickered. He rode the Black Panther and quickly crossed the forest. A moment later, he saw several supers in white.
         Those few people were peeking at the village in the distance.
         "It's all burned ..."
         "Alright!"
         "Second brother Zhang has gone over, right? With a little guidance, these guys would all join the White Saint Army. The men of this village were all proficient in swimming. With a little training, they would become an elite Navy! Guide them into becoming supers, and 90% of them will become extraordinary and become Water-type supers ..."
         "Well done!"
         “……”
         A few men in white were celebrating. Li Hao frowned, feeling indignant. He burned down villages, stole food, and forced people to become bandits ... He deserved to be killed!
         Just as he was about to end these people with a sword strike, he heard another person say,""Hurry up and take the people away. If we don't leave now, once the Montenegro bandits arrive, I'm afraid that not even a blade of grass will grow in this village!"
         "That's right, those guys are too brutal ..."
         The sword in Li Hao's hand suddenly stopped.
         After a long time, he sighed in his heart and rode the Black Panther away.
         Right or wrong?
         Where was the right and wrong!
         The officials were incompetent, and bandits ran amuck. None of them were good people. The White sage Army was no good either. But when they were comparing who was better, the White sage Army didn't kill anyone. From their tone, once the Montenegro bandits arrived, all of them would die!
         At this moment, if he acted bravely and killed these people from the White sacred Army, not to mention the Montenegro bandits, even if the White sacred Army found out that they were dead, they would probably come to take revenge on these villagers. Li Hao couldn't possibly have sent them so far to Hong Yitang.
         "Right and wrong ... It's hard to tell!"
         "Seeing may not be believing!"  At this moment, Li Hao had a deeper understanding.
         Cultivation, cultivation, why travel the world?
         Just for these.
         Sometimes, it might seem like a sin to you ... But if you meddled in it, it might be an even greater sin.
         But Li Hao didn't get the root cause wrong.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "The root cause is that the authorities are incompetent! "They didn't clear out these bandits, didn't do a good job in defense, and didn't do a good job for the people ... We can't think that they're good people just because they didn't kill anyone. We can only say that they're one of the better types of bandits ..."
         Thinking of this, Li Hao smiled. He took out a pot of wine and took a sip.
         The world was going to be in chaos.
         At the bottom, there was already a feeling that the building was about to collapse. No one knew how much longer it could last. Those overlords and ambitious people were probably looking forward to this day.
         "Black Panther!"
         Woof! Woof! Woof!
         "It's said that it's better to be a dog in peace than to be a man in chaos ... Do you think that being a dog is sometimes more carefree?"
         Woof! Woof! Woof!
         "AI!"
         Li Hao sighed. He was just a dog that couldn't speak.
         "Trees can speak, snakes can, birds can ... But you can 't. If you can' t, you can use your spiritual energy to communicate. You can't even do that ... You ... Are so stupid!"
         The Black Panther felt wronged. It wasn't stupid. It was just that they were of different breeds. Who knew?
         "Do you want me to teach you how to read?"
         Li Hao suddenly laughed."If you can read, and sometimes you can 't, you can write it out ... I saw that you can input words and send messages on the communication Jade. If we can make a two-way transmission, similar to the message input in a communicator, we can communicate with each other. In this case, we don't have to guess."
          Woof! Woof! Woof!
         At this moment, the Black Panther seemed to be terrified. No!
         In his bloodline memory, he seemed to be very afraid of reading.
         "You agreed? That's great, Heibao is great, I'll teach you later!"
         "Woof woof woof woof ..."
         The Black Panther barked madly."You've misunderstood, I didn't agree!"
         Li Hao laughed and ignored him.
         I said you agreed, and you agreed.
         If you have the ability, then say something!
         After taking another sip of wine, Li Hao stopped teasing and talking. He closed his eyes and began to cultivate. This time, he didn't cultivate the five Forces, but filled up the Super Lock.
        
         He was very curious. If his heart was filled, but his limbs were not, would his battle prowess be unsealed?
         Southern Fist and the others would fill up their limbs first.
         Of course, after they were filled, their combat strength increased.
         Take the southern Fist for example. Under normal circumstances, it was at the mid-stage of the rising light realm. The southern Fist had reached the saturation point of five super locks, four for the four limbs and one for the five organs.
         If he had six blood vessels and two blood vessels in his heart, he would be at least at the late-stage or even peak of the rising light realm?
         The light sword had mentioned that she seemed to have unlocked two of her five organs 'super locks. Under normal circumstances, she would only be at her peak.
         If Hong Yitang didn't unseal the sword, he could deal with a metahuman of the rising light. Li Hao knew this. It was the same in the mountain last time. There were at least three or even four earth-covered swords!
         "It will take at least a day to reach Dingbian province ... Perhaps the heart lock will be full in a day ..."
         This Super Lock had absorbed a lot of energy.
         The energy absorbed by the Super Lock seemed to be endless. More importantly, it was hard to tell how much it had absorbed. It could only be seen from the consumption. From this perspective, Li Hao had used thousands of divine power stones.
          Li Hao wanted to try and see if there would be any abnormalities if he saturated the five organs superpower lock first.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com With treasures like the spring of life and sword energy, he was not too worried about any problems.
         At worst, there would be signs of it breaking, but he should be able to suppress it.
         Perhaps, he could become more powerful.
         Right now, he was only sewing the five Forces together, not fusing them. However, fusing them was too difficult. Li Hao felt that he didn't have the talent to do so. Fusing them in one or two days wasn't something that a human could do.
         If that was the case ... He would first saturated the superpower lock.
         A large amount of sword energy, mystic energy, and elemental energy began to surge into the SuperLock.
         In his heart, the restrained Tiger was throbbing.
         It was shaking non-stop.
         The chains that bound the Tiger seemed to have materialized.
         Li Hao didn't care about this and continued to absorb energy.
         Within his body, a series of superpower locks began to appear.
         His limbs, internal organs, forehead, belly button, and spine.
         A total of 12 superpower locks appeared.
         Yes, 12.
         Currently, there were only nine of them. However, everyone knew that there was one in the head. For some special powers, many people thought that the one in the head was broken.
         As for why their superpowers were different ... It might be due to the mutation.
         Therefore, everyone knew that there were ten sets of super locks.
         At this moment, 12 super locks appeared on Li Hao's body.
         The spine was the bone, and the divine Palace was the body.
          Li Hao didn't care about this. The human body might have more than 12 superlocks. In fact, when he tried to break through to the next level, he had a feeling that he could see more things through his inner sight. The human body had more than 12 superlocks.  Perhaps he didn't have enough potential, or he was still too weak, and the rest had not been revealed.
         If superpowers could continue on forever ... It was still very scary. Breaking one was a realm. Breaking 12 meant breaking 12 Realms. And now, the strongest seemed to only have five broken.
         Li Hao wasn't sure if there were any experts above sunguang, but since Hong Yitang and the others were so low-key, Li Hao didn't care too much about them.
         At this moment, Li Hao was absorbing energy, but he was thinking about something.
         If one was filled in, it would break.
         Should I ... Try to break the superpower lock and unseal my combat power?
         Even if he couldn't advance a major realm or a minor realm, he could still kill late-stage cultivators now. If he broke down, it would be good if he could kill peak-stage sunrise cultivators.
         Of course, not all of it was broken, just a part was enough.
         He had his sword, so he wasn't afraid of this.
         Of the 30000 divine power stones that Silver Moon had given him, 10000 had been given to little tree. Almost 10000 had been used up, and the remaining 10000 were all with Li Hao. In fact, Li Hao had more than that.
         After killing so many people, he had also gained a lot.
         In fact, the money spent in those two days was from Hong Yitang and the light sword. Li Hao didn't spend much money himself. He only absorbed the processing fee.
         In the middle of his cultivation, a huge mountain range appeared.
         It was like a line that separated the entire Eastern continent from the northern continent.
         This mountain range was called Mount kui.
         Li Hao didn't know why it was called that. It was written in the books, but he didn't care too much.
         Even the Cang mountains, where Silvermoon lived, had great demons. In Mount kui, the East was powerful, so there might be great demons as well. Li Hao opened his eyes and became more careful. He warned,"Be careful. If you encounter a big demon, stay away. Your nose is sharp, so you should be able to smell it!"
         Woof! Woof! Woof!
         Black Panther nodded and was somewhat looking forward to it.
          It had never seen a big demon before.
         What kind of big demon was he?
         Were there any dog demons like him?
         Li Hao had seen one before, but this was the only dog demon he had seen.
         ……
         Kui Shan was like a long snake.
         It was curved and winding for thousands of miles.
         From the map, Mount kui did not appear Grand and majestic. In fact, Mount kui was still very tall. Compared to the people, it was quite magnificent.
         The Black Panther flew up and leaped into the air. It did not take an ordinary path.
         To a great demon at the level of Black Panther, there was no mountain path in front of him.
        
         He directly crossed over!
         There seemed to be people at the foot of the mountain, possibly villagers from nearby. Li Hao seemed to hear human voices in his ears."Father, immortal!"
         "What bullsh * t God, don't fart ..."
         "Run!" The next moment, a shrill scream rang out."Run! It's a demon!"
         “……”
         Li Hao was mentally exhausted. He had shouted so loudly. What a demon! He had been eaten in one bite.
         He was too lazy to care about all this. At this moment, he wasn't afraid of being seen.
         Of course, this was only limited to ordinary people.
         An ordinary person would probably never be able to cross one continent and enter another in their entire life.
         ……
          At the same time.
         In Mount kui, a giant snake with horns on its head was transforming into a flood Dragon. At this moment, it suddenly opened its emotionless eyes and revealed a cold expression.
         Its huge body shuttled through the mountains, quickly circling towards a place.
         He kept moving forward.
         The speed was extremely fast!
         After crossing the mountains and precipitous ridges for a while, the giant snake seemed to have seen something. It was a dog that was running at high speed.
         Black Dog!
         At this moment, Li Hao didn't pay much attention to it at first. A moment later, he suddenly opened his eyes and looked into the distance. His eyes glowed, and the next moment, he cursed in his heart!
         Heibao, this idiot!
         Was his nose disabled?
         Not far away, a giant snake even bigger than the one on the Cang Mountain was circling there like a small mountain. At first, Li Hao really thought it was a small mountain, but when he took a closer look, he vaguely saw a dazzling radiance.
         It was exactly the same as the great demons of the Cang Mountain!
         A great demon in the transformation stage!
         Instantly, Li Hao understood and felt his teeth ache. How could he have directly intruded into someone else's territory?
         The Black Panther seemed to have seen it as well. It looked over with some doubt in its dog eyes.
         This was the first time he had seen it. He was really curious.
         It was so big!
         Comparing such a big head to her own small head ... She suddenly felt that Li Hao's words about losing weight were all nonsense.
         It wasn't afraid at all, only curious. Not only did it not retreat, but it even took the initiative to run in that direction for a while."Woof, Woof, Woof!"
         It called out!
         Just as Li Hao was about to curse, the giant snake suddenly retreated. It looked at Li Hao and the Black Panther with its huge eyes."Mount kui is my territory. Which ancient demon descendant has entered my territory?"
         Li Hao was stunned!
         I'll go!
         What was going on?
          There were also those who took the initiative to greet him. Last time, the four great demons of the Cang Mountain didn't even say a word, let alone greet him. They only became obedient after being beaten up by Hong Yitang and the others.  Now, this great demon actually took the initiative to greet him.
         "I'm just passing by! I'm going to the eastern continent. I don't mean to disturb you!"
         Li Hao's mental waves were also ancient.
         It wasn't on purpose, he promised.
         It was just that his spiritual fluctuations usually only communicated with existences like the small tree, gold-tier and silver-tier Warriors. Therefore, it had a habitual ancient charm to it. As for the huge snake, its huge eyes seemed to be trembling.
         He was indeed a descendant of an ancient demon!
         Could this human be from an aristocratic family of inheritance of the ancient humans?
         The Python looked at Li Hao, then at the Black Panther. Suddenly, it said telepathically,""You are from an ancient family? This little demon dwelled on Mount kui, but my inheritance is incomplete. Now that I want to shed my skin and transform into a Dragon, I have no clue ... Can great senior give me some advice?"
         Even Li Hao was stunned!
         What was going on?
         A snake had blocked his way and asked him if he could guide it to transform into a Dragon ...
         I'll go!
         He's about to transform into a Dragon?
         I've never even seen a Dragon before, so how am I supposed to guide it?
         Also, you're asking me this when we meet ... Is it appropriate?
         Li Hao felt a little strange. He glanced at the Python. The Python seemed to have guessed Li Hao's thoughts and sent out a mental wave again."Does great senior feel that this little demon has offended you? I don't mean to offend you, but in the past, I was taught by a great senior that he didn't know how to transform into a Dragon either. He said that only those who have been passed down from ancient demons and ancient families know how to do it. As for him, he's not familiar with the demon race and doesn't know how to transform into a Dragon. I think that great senior and the descendants of ancient demons ..."
         Li Hao was stunned."You ... How many years ago did you meet that person?"
         "Many years ago!"
         Nonsense, I know that it was many years ago. I'm just curious how many years ago the person you speak of happened.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Superpowers had only been around for twenty years.
         Someone actually knew about it long ago. It was the inheritance of the ancient demon.
         Of course, ancient aristocratic families were all nonsense ... In fact, Li Hao could be considered an ancient aristocratic family. But now, there was only Li Hao. How could he be considered an aristocratic family? he didn't have any inheritance, only a sword.
         "I also don't know the Dragon Transformation technique!"
          Seeing that the Python couldn't give a proper explanation, Li Hao could only say,""This Mount of mine received guidance from a top expert in heaven battling city, which helped it awaken its bloodline."
         "Heaven battling city?"
         "One of the eight cities of new martial. Do you know about it?"
         The Python felt that it was extremely profound and mysterious. It was a little confused for a while and only said after a long time,""I seem to have heard of it. In the past, that Grandmaster once mentioned that there are eight cities in the land of Silver Moon. Could it be ..."
         Li Hao was completely stunned,'you know about the eight cities? Who is that person?"
         "This little demon doesn't know its name, could it be that heaven battling city is one of the eight cities?"
         "Not bad!"
         The snake grew even more reverent as it looked at the Black Panther with envy."Activate the bloodline. The ancient Fey bloodline has been activated ... This ancient Fey descendant has a rich bloodline that we can not compare to. It's a pity that our bloodlines are weak. I'm afraid it will be difficult to activate our bloodlines ..."
         "Grandmaster ... Heaven battling city ... Can I ... Go?"
         Li Hao was still in a daze.
        
         ? He didn't know why this snake had suddenly run out, asked him to guide it the moment it saw him, and then left heaven battling city with no other choice. However, this snake seemed to be looking forward to it.
         What was going on?
         Also, who taught this snake back then?
         "I can ... But not now, heaven battling city has already been sealed!"
         Li Hao's eyes flickered, and he quickly said,"I'm the commander of heaven battling city's heaven battling Legion. I'm currently carrying out military affairs, so I'm afraid I can't help Brother Yao. However ... After I complete my mission, I might be able to bring brother Yao into heaven battling city ... Of course, I can't guarantee whether I'll be able to get help. The ancient city is currently sealed, and there's not enough energy. The powerhouses are barely resuscitating ..."
         "This little demon understands. This little demon is already very satisfied with great senior's intention ... In that case, I won't delay great senior's military affairs. I wonder if this little demon can be of any help?"
         Li Hao felt like he had seen a ghost!
         Why was that?
         This snake demon still had the intention of helping him.
         Li Hao's heart trembled, and he quickly said,"no need. I'm carrying out military affairs this time. It's an important military affair. I can't participate in anything outside of heaven battling city's system!" Of course, if brother Yao is willing, I hope that brother Yao can help me if I'm being pursued to this point after I complete my mission. However, the enemy is very strong, and brother Yao seems to be in the process of transforming. If you encounter a strong enemy ..."
          "If there's a need, I'll definitely do my best!"
         The giant snake was also extremely polite as it hurriedly transmitted a message,""This is Mount kui. I'm not alone. The soaring serpent lineage has several powerful experts. Although they can't compare to the ancient demon lineage, they can still stop some people."
         Feeling a little guilty, Li Hao didn't say anything else and quickly said,""I still have some military matters to attend to. Thank you for your help. I'll chat with you again after I'm done with my military matters!"
         "Many thanks, great senior!"
         The snake even lowered its huge head and watched Li Hao and the Black Panther leave.
         It wasn't until the man and dog left quickly that the Python looked in the direction they had disappeared in surprise. It thought to itself,"this ancient demon bloodline is so rich!"
         The ancient civilization had revived once again!
         Indeed, the Grandmaster was right. This world would be turned upside down sooner or later. However, his winged serpent body was not perfect. If he wanted to make the Great Leap, he had to find an ancient demon with a strong bloodline.
         He didn't expect that he would be able to pick up such a benefit from this sleep!
         He had actually encountered an ancient Fey and an expert from an ancient family clan so casually.
         He still looked very young.
         "Heaven battling city ... One of the eight cities ... Is it from the land of Silvermoon in the North?"
         The snake thought to itself. It was said that the Silver Moon land was filled with experts and was extremely xenophobic. In fact, it also knew of the Silver Moon, but it had never dared to go there. Now, it had actually met the descendant of the Silver Moon's ancient family, and he was so easy to talk to ...
         The Python was ecstatic!
         Was there hope for him to become a dragon?  ……
         And Li Hao, at this moment, was also confused. He couldn't help but send a message to Black Panther: "This demon is so stupid? Or is this snake an idiot? it didn't even understand the situation and wanted to help?"
         In fact, he was also a little confused. Of course, he didn't dare to let the Python follow him. What a joke. It was so big. Although it was powerful, it was still in the transformation stage. It was not impossible to kill it. He was careful not to be discovered immediately.
         However, Li Hao was still a little confused. Who had guided this giant snake?
         In any case, with the snake's guarantee, if he were to be exposed and be hunted down, he could run here. Li Hao had also said that he couldn't do it during the metamorphosis stage, but the snake still agreed. Perhaps there were still powerful demons in Mount kui.
         Heibao did not respond, nor could he respond.
         In fact, Black Panther had a vague idea. Perhaps it was because of him. Yes, it was because of him!
         Last time, that old turtle seemed to have said that his bloodline was noble, that he was the descendant of a demon subduing envoy, and that he was in charge of all the great demons in the world!
         If they encountered some greater demons with some ancient demon bloodline, the stronger they were, the better. The stronger they were, the more they would be able to sense it. They would know that they were passing by, and most greater demons wouldn't dare to provoke them, let alone pay their respects.
         The giant snake had obviously sensed it, but it did not know why, so it did not dare to provoke it. It was just extremely polite.
         "You Took Advantage of Me ..."
         Heibao thought to himself,"it's a pity that I can't say it out loud. It's also a pity that I'm not very literate. Otherwise, I'd have to write it to Li Hao and tell him that it has nothing to do with him. It's all my fault!"
         In this state, a man and a dog crossed Mount kui and entered the Great Eastern land.
         ……
          And at this moment.
         Only then did the powerhouses from the central region arrive at the vicinity of the Silver Moon one after another. A large number of powerhouses had gathered in the nearby Linjiang province.
         Linjiang governor's mansion.
         One by one, the experts toasted with the governor of Linjiang, fan Chang.
         "Governor-General fan, you've fought with the earth overturning sword and the radiant sword. What do you think of their strength?" someone asked.
         "Very strong!" Fan Chang said solemnly. Qian Feng and I fought against Hong Yitang two against one, but we were still defeated. Qian Feng died in the battle, and I lost an arm and luckily escaped!"
         Everyone was awed!
         It was indeed powerful!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "That Li Hao is now hiding in white moon City, and silver Moon has many experts. I'm afraid it'll be difficult to deal with him ... The governor is adjacent to Silver Moon, so do you have any good ideas to give him some advice?"
         The reason everyone had come here was because Linjiang and silver Moon were neighbors, so they had a better understanding of the situation. Perhaps fan Chang had a way to deal with them, and since the other party had lost an arm, he would share the same enemy as them and would not be able to get involved with Silver Moon.
        
         Fan Chang took a sip of wine and thought for a moment. He suddenly smiled and said,""It's difficult to deal with Silver Moon, but it might not be so difficult to lure Li Hao out."
         Everyone looked at him. Are you sure?
         She wasn't stupid.
         Now that he knew it was dangerous, how was he going to lure it out?
         "White shark Pirates!"
         Fan Chang took another sip of wine and said,"Li Hao killed two of the White shark Pirates" commanders. The White shark Pirates have been looking for an opportunity to take revenge. Li Hao also said that he would annihilate the White shark Pirates!" "Why don't we let the White shark Pirates enter the moon ocean and attack the South? although there are many Silver Moon experts, white moon City and yaoguang city are the core, so they need experts to guard them. This disaster was started by Li Hao, and with Li Hao's personality as a Silver Moon Martial Master, he will definitely take action ... Of course, I'm not sure if overpowered sword and the others will come. I can only say that we should reduce the number of Silver Moon martial masters around him as much as possible!"
         "If we can attract the Starlight Pirates to attack and threaten them, a portion of them will enter the other side of the moon sea from the West Sea and threaten the White moon City ... There will definitely be a large number of experts guarding the White moon City ..."
         He was also a bit of a cheater. Since he wasn't going to do anything, he wanted to use these people's strength to intimidate the Pirates and make a fool out of the Starlight Pirates and white shark Pirates.
         As for the sea demon Pirates that he supported, they might be able to get some benefits.
         He continued,"this way, Huang Yu and the others can't help Li Hao. Even though they know it's dangerous, the Silver Moon martial masters like to flaunt their righteousness and take responsibility for their actions. Li Hao has provoked the White shark Pirates, so he has to help. Otherwise ... Even the Silver Moon martial masters look down on him. Even if they know it's a risk, they won't stop him. These people are just so stubborn!"
          Everyone was deep in thought.
         This was not impossible.
         Of course, the premise was that the Pirates agreed.
         However, would the Pirates dare to disagree?
         It's not like I'm the one doing the work.
         The Pirates were only there to intimidate him, and they were not really going to attack him. However, he could not afford to take Silver Moon lightly, because if he did, the Pirates would really charge in and cause a great deal of suffering.
         Everyone looked at fan Chang, who smiled and said,""If everyone is still worried ... I can also mobilize the governor's mansion's Army to approach the Silver Moon and conduct a military exercise!"
         He also gritted his teeth!
         The earth overturning sword had cut off one of his arms. Although he had also obtained a drop of the spring of life and recovered his arm, his arm was obviously much weaker than before. This made him extremely resentful!
         Everyone's eyes lit up when they heard that.
         On land, Linjiang was threatening.
         At sea, Pirates were a deterrent.
         If that was the case, he could restrain the power of a large number of powerhouses. If Li Hao dared to come out, he would die without a doubt. It all depended on whether Li Hao dared to take the risk.
         However, if he did not come out, and the White shark Pirates really took the South ... Li Hao's reputation would be completely ruined in Silver Moon!
         Even some of Silver moon's older martial masters would probably feel ashamed to be associated with them!
         People like Huang Yu would consider the big picture, but some of the older martial masters, who were relatively pure, believed that even if they died in battle, they couldn't lose the dignity of a Silver Moon Martial Master. They would definitely think that Li Hao wasn't trustworthy.
          Even if it didn't work out, Li Hao would probably be abandoned by Silver Moon martial forest!  "Governor fan is really far-sighted!"
         Everyone raised their glasses and smiled.
         As expected, fan Chang was a ruthless man to be able to suppress all the major organizations in Linjiang.
         If they were defeated in the South, it would be good for Linjiang. They had stolen the limelight in Linjiang and this involved great benefits. This guy was not just seeking revenge. It was said that one of the eight great pirate groups was his.
         Thinking of this, everyone laughed. They roughly understood what this person wanted.
         ……
         Li Hao didn't have the time to care about this.
         If he was in Silver Moon, regardless of whether it was dangerous or not, he would definitely head south after fan Chang's actions. As a Martial Master, or rather, as a member of Silver Moon, he would definitely head south.
         However, he wasn't there at the moment, so he naturally couldn't care about this.
         As for the White shark Pirates, in order to get the Windchaser's boots first, Li Hao put them down.
         The current him had already stepped into Dingbian province.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com In order to cover his tracks, Li Hao no longer rode on his dog. Instead, he gave Heibao a dog chain and held it in his hand. Using some star coins he stole from God knows where, he bought a small car and started driving to the ding Bian province.
         Eastheart city was the capital of Dingbian province, where the Xu family was located. The name of the city was given by the Xu family, which meant that it was the core of the East.
         At this moment, Li Hao was also driving at an extremely fast speed.
         Tomorrow would be the seventh day of Xu Zhen's life.
          Along the way, Li Hao was also barging in and out ... As for what he hit, there was no need to worry at all. Before he hit anything, Li Hao's sword energy would burst out and crush everything in his way. Therefore, for him, the road ahead was smooth.
         Who dared to say that they couldn't drive?
         The current him could even fly by driving a car!
         After driving from morning to night, Li Hao finally set foot on the boundary of eastheart city.
         Windchaser's boots, I'm coming!
         At this time, eastheart city was also particularly prosperous. Compared to the North, the East was indeed much more prosperous. At night, it was almost the same as going south.
         In the center of the city, there was a grand mansion that was also brightly lit.
         Li Hao had to pay 300 star dollars to get into the city as a foreign car. This was simply robbery!
         No wonder he was so rich!
         Li Hao found a hotel and parked his car. He asked for a room. This place was not far from the Duke dingguo's mansion. No one would have thought that he had spent two days and two nights flying from Silver Moon all the way to Dingbian, right?
        
         Fortunately, it was very chaotic at the moment. It was difficult to move around, and it was difficult to unify the system of the dynasties. He didn't need any identification, so Li Hao checked into the hotel smoothly.
         The Black Panther was also treated as a pet dog. Li Hao led it into the room.
         As he walked upstairs, Li Hao sighed with emotion. In the eastern land, girls were more open-minded. This place was much hotter than the North, and they even showed their long legs.
         After entering the elevator, a pretty girl even touched Black Panther's head. Li Hao was so scared that he thought Black Panther was about to explode ... But then he found that Black Panther was drooling while staring at his long legs ... Li Hao was speechless.
         In this day and age, even a dog would fall in love with a woman. It was no wonder that his teacher and the Azure light sword had run off together. Up until now, they had disappeared without a trace. There was no news at all.
         Poor me, I can only bring a dog with me when I go out.
         ……
         After entering the room, Li Hao tidied up and changed into a new set of clothes. He put on his glasses, looking more scholarly than ever.
         After having a full meal, Li Hao led the dog out in the night.
          It was said that in order to be close to the people, and with the restriction of imperial power, there was a Street in front of the Duke dingguo's house. It used to be the inner street of the Duke dingguo's mansion, but it was later opened to the public. Last time, the light sword had killed five generals here, and it was very close to the Duke dingguo's mansion.
         Li Hao didn't have the time to collect information, so the best thing to do now was to get closer and take a look.
         It was hard to judge a Martial Master, but no one could hide from him if he was a super!
         That night.
         Outside the high Duke's public house, on the bustling Street, Li Hao, wearing glasses and leading his dog, strolled leisurely. He even strolled all the way to the end of the street, which was only one or two kilometers away from the high Duke's public house.
         At the end of the road was a large square. Many people were in love and dancing. On the other hand, white silk was hung up at the public house.
         Li Hao also saw some experts coming and going. Unlike the people outside, the experts coming and going were extremely low-key and seemed to be in deep pain.
         All sorts of voices were heard.
         Soon, Li Hao also caught some sounds.
         "It's said that the high Duke's public house will be holding a Memorial tomorrow, and all the major eastern provinces will send important people over ... The high Duke's public house seems to have suffered a great loss this time, and the major eastern provinces are not very stable ... I don't know if it's to intimidate them ... Tomorrow, something big might happen. "
         "It's none of our business. That's the business of the big shots. Why should we, the little commoners, care about this?"
         "That's true!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com “……”  Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. The big shots from the eastern provinces?
         This was something he had to pay attention to. It wouldn't be good if he failed miserably in an easy task.
         At this moment, what was more difficult was how to sneak in.
         If he didn't sneak in, was he going to Rob it directly?
         Li Hao fell into deep thought. This was not an easy task.
         Soon, someone else gave Li Hao an idea. He heard the voices of others."The high Duke's public house will be very lively tomorrow. Brother Zhang, do you have any way to bring us in to take a look? I heard they're all big shots ..."
         "That's a Memorial. Do you think you can go in and watch the show? He was more like looking for death! "However, it's easy if you want to watch the show. Find a newspaper and stuff some money into it to get a reporter's pass. Tomorrow, the state Duke will have a meeting with the big shots of the major provinces ... It's said that the position of the state Duke's successor might be announced ... Now, it's probably time to build up momentum, and many newspapers have received invitations ..."
         "Is it expensive?"
         "Of course it's not cheap. It's at least eight to ten thousand. Otherwise, who would dare to take you in?"
         "Then forget it, it's too expensive!"
         “……”
          Li Hao touched his chin. Reporter?
         What the hell!
         Silver Moon did not seem to have such a thing.
         However, could they just spend a few thousand Yuan to sneak in?
         Was it that simple?
         Li Hao glanced at the majestic High Duke's public house in the distance, then at the noisy crowd, and laughed. In order to show his friendliness, the Duke dingguo had opened a Street in front of his house and brought a group of people over. He didn't know what he was thinking.
         "Let's go!"
         Li Hao shook the rope. Heibao was a little unhappy, but he still left with Li Hao. Before he left, he was reluctant to part with some dancing aunties ... Li Hao could only say that this dog's eyes were really blind!
         So, you're interested in a woman?
        
         Reporters, news agencies ...
         It was actually Li Hao's first time hearing these Terms, but he had a general idea of what they were after learning about them.
         A product of the evolution of civilization.
         The self-proclaimed open and just Duke dingguo pushed out the newspaper office in the East. In fact, it was a mouthpiece for public opinion and a way to brainwash the people.
         It seemed to have existed since the ancient civilization.
         However, there seemed to be a slight difference between the ancient civilization and the present.
         After returning to the hotel, Li Hao read some newspapers.
         He was carefully reading some of the articles on it.
         "Duke dingguo issued a statement today: the central region is in turmoil. The 21 eastern provinces are willing to open their gates and welcome the central region's refugees to take refuge in the East and start a new life."
         "The high Duke's public house has made a decision today. The world is in turmoil and the people are uneasy. Tai 'an province has a disaster. The high Duke's public house is sad for the suffering of the victims and will distribute one million catties of white rice to the disaster area ..."
          "The dingguo Army is recruiting new soldiers. All Eastern citizens who are 16 years old and below 30 years old can sign up. One soldier, and the whole family is exempted from tax ..."
         "General Xu Zhen of the left road of the dingguo Army is inspecting the East Sea today to expel the Pirates. Seeing the People's suffering, I hereby order that the coastal residents are exempted from tax for three years ..."
         “……”
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com There were many newspapers in the hotel.
         They were all from a newspaper called Eastern people news.
         ,m To the public, this era was actually quite open to the public. However, they still did not know about some of the important figures 'situations.  Not to mention them, even the intellectuals of this era like Li Hao didn't know much.
         When he had been in the Silver City's ancient Academy, he had known of the existence of the nine divisions, but he didn't even know what they were.
         He was also one of the rare scholars in this era.
         It was clear that for others, the sources of information were even fewer. Today, these newspapers had given them a source of information. Perhaps there were not many people who could read, but as long as one person knew how to read, the news would quickly spread.
         "Not bad!" Li Hao's eyes twinkled.
         Between the lines, it reflected the Duke dingguo's mansion's compassion for the common people.
         But in fact, Li Hao thought that it was all bullsh * t.
         For example, Xu Zhen went to the East Sea for an inspection and said something about expelling the Pirates of the East Sea ... Was that true?
         If it was true, there were still a large number of Pirates in the East Sea. Where did they come from?
         For example, disaster relief. One million catties sounded like a lot, but it was only 500 tons. Was 500 tons a lot?
         A large province was affected, and the number of people affected was more than a million.
         One person could only eat half-full in a day. One million catties was only enough for a million people to eat for one or two days. However, could the disaster end in one or two days?
         Moreover, the Duke dingguo's mansion was still the ruler of the entire East in name, so this was what they should do.  But now, it had been published in the newspaper and spread throughout the East, making the people of the East grateful to him.
         "Newspapers ... Good stuff!"
         This was a sharp weapon to create public opinion.
         In this era, people couldn't get in touch with the people in the city once they were out of the city. Even the powerhouses could only spread the news through the communication Jade. Therefore, the existence of the newspaper could easily deceive the people and win their hearts.
         "Duke dingguo must have excavated some ruins ... And obtained some information about the ancient civilization."
         Li Hao came to a conclusion.
         He did not know much about the newspapers.
         In the ancient civilization system, what was most talked about was actually the television. It could directly project one's image in all directions and transmit it to the entire world. That was the true weapon.
         Of course, this era was actually very abnormal.
         Planes and cannons had been made, but these things had not been made. Perhaps the people in power did not care, or perhaps ... Someone deliberately did not do this. If they did, the news would spread too quickly, and the flow of information would be too fast. It would not be conducive to controlling the People's hearts.
         The more you know, the more you think, and the more you think, the more you want.
         When you live in a poor and remote place, you actually don't have any ambitions.
         However, when you see the outside world indulging in debauchery every day, you can't help but want to go out and make a living. You want to live such a life.
         "Duke dingguo ..."
         Through the window, Li Hao looked into the distance. It was the brightly lit Duke dingguo's mansion.
         This Duke of the East was quite capable.
         At the very least, this tactic of buying over the People's hearts was actually used quite well.
         Strictly speaking, the living standard in the East was not bad either. It seemed to be much richer than in the North.
          "An ambitious person ..."
         Li Hao gave him a new definition. There were probably many ambitious people in this era.
         So many sunguang from the Duke dingguo's mansion had died, but it seemed that there were still many left ... It could be seen that the Duke dingguo's mansion also had a lot of strong people. However, at present, it seemed that the East had not been completely unified by the Duke dingguo.
         Otherwise, there would be no need to involve some of the big shots in the Eastern Province in his son's seventh birthday. At this moment, he probably wanted to take the opportunity to intimidate and prevent some of the overlords in the eastern provinces from taking the opportunity to escape from his control because too many powerhouses had died.
         "Disguise as a reporter and sneak in?"
         It sounded simple.
         But Li Hao was also thinking. How could he sneak into the Duke dingguo's mansion so easily?
         Just spend a few thousand?
         At this time, there were not many people who were willing to spend thousands to watch the show. If there were ... They were probably people with bad intentions.
         "It's obvious that the high Duke's public house is controlling these news agencies from behind the scenes. They are their own businesses, so why would they let people join the high Duke's public house just by spending some money?"
        
         Li Hao pondered for a while and looked at the high Duke's public house in the distance.
         He suddenly laughed!
         Li Hao glanced at the Black Panther and suddenly said,""Gou 'Zi, when you turned into that big golden dog, you were huge and could eat people ..."
         Black Panther shook his head!
         I don't eat people, don't blame me.
         Li Hao chuckled,"rather than sneaking around, it's better to go in openly!" The more you sneak in, the more attention you will attract. The other party won't care too much about those who enter openly, but those who sneak in ... Will most likely be noticed at the first moment. "
         "How about the demons pay a visit to the high Duke's public house's grand ceremony?"
         Black Panther was confused.
         Li Hao explained,"aren't you a great demon?" "If you eat me up, you can't speak, but I can. I can use my mental energy, but my aura hasn't spread out. If I put some divine power stones in your stomach, the divine power will spread out and you can disguise yourself as a super demon. You're a Martial Master dog, so no one will be able to tell. How about I create some three yang aura for you? three yang demon?" Impersonating ... Impersonating the Great Serpent of Mount kui? Even though it's not a snake, there's no rule that says Mount kui can only have snakes. "
         "Let's go in openly ... But the Black Dog will be easily noticed. After all, you killed someone last time. If someone saw it, can you still turn into a big golden dog?"
          The Black Panther stared at him with its big dog eyes.
         Was there a need?
         It was so dangerous!
         "It's fine, great demon Mount kui. I don't believe that the eastern Overlord doesn't know of their existence. Duke dingguo's ambition is not small. He doesn't dare to provoke great demon Mount kui easily. Even if he's vigilant, he won't be too worried about a great demon who comes to visit openly ... The more openly he appears, the less attention he will attract. I feel that the Duke dingguo's public house is probably relaxed on the outside but tight on the inside ..."
         This was the intuition of a Martial Master, and it was also what he had observed.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com There were many powerhouses in the high Duke's public house.
         However, they were not concentrated in one place. Some places might be their hiding spots, but in Li Hao's eyes, they were all the same. As long as it was a superpower, they would show themselves.
         At the moment, he still didn't know the distribution of martial masters.
         Furthermore, there was an advantage to impersonating a member of Mount kui's lineage. The other provinces in the East would not dare to rashly fall out with Mount kui without understanding the situation.
         Black Panther blinked his eyes.
         At this moment, it did not understand. Was it safer to appear in public?
         Humans are so complicated!
         "Trust me!"
         Li Hao laughed."That's the only way you can get close to the ancestral hall. As an emissary, the high Duke's public house can't not let the demon emissaries get close. They even have to invite you to participate in the ceremony."
         As he said this, Li Hao touched his chin again."Of course, we can't rule out the possibility that the high Duke's public house has a grudge with the demon clan ... But the possibility is low. If they really have a grudge, they would have sent troops to Mount kui long ago. Anyway, even if they do, these ambitious people will probably let it go when they see the hope of cooperation."
          On Mount kui's side, there's a great demon in the metamorphosis stage. In addition, there might be many other great demons of the rising light.  Such a force, the Duke of dingguo would not dare to provoke it easily.
         The Black Panther scratched its head with its claws. It had learned this from Li Hao. It was a little confused, but it didn't bark. It did as Li Hao said.
         "Let's go. We'll go outside the city and fly in directly when the ceremony starts tomorrow ..."
         Black Panther didn't understand Li Hao's thoughts, so he could only let him be.
         Soon, the man and the dog left the hotel in their small broken car.
         ……
         At the same time.
         The high Duke's public house.
         At this moment, there were many people.
         The high Duke's public house's ancestral hall was bustling with noise and excitement. A group of servants were quickly making arrangements. Not only would the high Duke's public house hold a grand ceremony tomorrow, but many important people from the eastern provinces would also be attending.
         It was a grand ceremony, and it was also a display of strength to intimidate everyone.
         The deaths of many sunrises had caused the East to become unstable. Some people were no longer willing to obey the high Duke's public house.
         At this moment, Xu Xing was also very careful and conscientious as he patrolled the area.
         Very quickly, someone beside him quickly came to report,""Second young master, the people from all the provinces have arrived and have been properly settled! I don't know if the people in charge of the three major organizations in the East have come ... But they have given a reply that they will not interfere with the high Duke's public house's memorial service. "
          "Some of the people in charge of the nine divisions and the imperial family in the East have come as well ... But there are also some who have not come."
         "In addition, some people have sneaked into the newspaper office. I don't know if they're really here to watch the show or if they have ulterior motives ..." He said.
         Xu Xing nodded slightly and let out a breath."Watch them closely, and quickly investigate their background. Tomorrow ... We might need to use their heads to deter those guys!"
         "Understood!"
         After Xu Xing finished speaking, he pondered for a moment before saying,"Also, investigate the background of the emissaries from the various provinces. Be careful of assassins. Once you've found out their identities, place a super detector at the entrance of the high Duke's public house tomorrow ... However, be careful of martial masters sneaking into the group."
         "This subordinate will immediately make the arrangements."
         After they left, Xu Xing took a deep breath. This was the first time he was handling such an important matter as the Xu family's successor. He didn't want anything to go wrong, and he didn't want the eastern powerhouses to see him as a joke.
         He also hoped that this time would go smoothly and that he could complete his father's task beyond his expectations. For example, he hoped to reach some agreements with the leaders of the other 20 provinces in the East and even make some people willing to be loyal to him.
         That would be the best result!
         He was still thinking about something when the communication Jade in his pocket vibrated.
        
         He hurriedly took out his communication Jade. Usually, he wouldn't use it unless it was a big deal.
         He picked it up and was slightly stunned.
         "Urgent report. At the border of Dingbian province, a Golden Demon is flying in the air. It did not hurt anyone. A three-Sun Expert went up to investigate and the demon sent out strange fluctuations. It said that it came from Mount kui and was the Dragon envoy of Mount kui. It came to the East to meet the Duke and discuss important matters!"
         “……”
         Even Xu Xing was stunned.
         Kuishan!
         At this moment, a monster came. He quickly replied,"Immediately have someone clear a path for Mount kui. Avoid the crowd and avoid everyone's eyes and ears ..."
         After sending the message, his expression changed for a while before he hurried to the backyard.
         He could not make the decision on this matter.
         A great demon!
          Ordinary people didn't understand these great demons at this stage, but the top figures knew that the demon race was rising and becoming a terrifying force.
         Among the seven divine mountains, heavenly Peng mountain and Phoenix Mountain were both demonic forces.
         There were also demon experts in the four Seas.
         In addition, the demon race was also rising rapidly in the square Mountain range.
         Mount kui was the boundary between the northeast and the North. Of course, he knew about it. He also knew that there was a huge snake there. It was extremely powerful. According to the scouts, it was at least at the transformation stage.
         They were both in the transformation stage, but the other party's body was extremely huge. It was said that he was about to transform into a Dragon!
         Once it became a legendary dragon ... It would be extremely terrifying. Even his father had said that if this great snake successfully transformed into a Dragon, he might not be able to match it even if he unsealed it.
         Dragon envoy!
         Upon hearing this form of address, Xu Xing knew that there was a high chance that the other party really came from Mount kui. This was because it was impossible for ordinary people to know that this great snake was about to transform into a Dragon.
         ……
         Very quickly.
         In the backyard.
         When Xu Qing saw his son rush in, he knew what had happened. He glanced at his son and wanted to hear what he had to say.
         Xu Xing quickly said,"father, we've just received a tip-off from the front. A great Golden Demon has arrived at Mount kui. He's roughly at the three suns realm and claims to be the Dragon envoy of Mount kui!" He said he came to the East to visit father and discuss important matters ... Father, what do you think ..."
          Xu Qing glanced at him and said without changing his expression,""What do you think?"  Xu Xing hesitated for a moment, but he still quickly said,"Father, the demon race is a foreign race. Everyone is on high alert now. The demon race is rising rapidly. At present, other than heavenly ROC mountain and Phoenix Mountain, no other demon power has officially established itself. The demon race is also looking for a breakthrough and seeking more benefits ... But the nine divisions and the imperial family dare not say that they will cooperate with the demon race. It will easily become a huge stain on their reputation ..."
         Yes, a stain.
         "I think ... We shouldn't offend him or provoke him. We should secretly bring him to the high Duke's public house and make him leave after a perfunctory conversation ..." Xu Xing said hesitantly.
         "That's it?"Xu Qing nodded slightly and smiled.
         Xu Xing didn't know his father's thoughts and wasn't sure what he was thinking. He could only force himself to say,""I'm slow-witted, so I'm here to ASK FATHER for advice. "
         Xu Qing laughed and said slowly,"the demon race has sent someone here now, and it's a great demon of Mount kui. This is interesting."
         "Mount kui has always been the boundary between the northeast and the northeast. There are many great demons of the rising sun in Mount kui, and not just that one. According to our intelligence, there are no less than five of them!"
         "We've always stayed out of each other's way. They're in Mount kui while we're in the eastern continent. Therefore, we don't have too many interactions with them ..."
         "However, Mount kui is a strategic location. If we are willing to side with the eastern continent, we don't need to care about Mount kui. However, if we want to head north and invade the Silver Moon ... There are too many accidents along the sea and there are also many demons in the water. If the Army turns from the East Sea to the North Sea and then enters the moon sea ... It may not be as safe as the land."
         Xu Xing glanced at his father. He roughly understood what his father meant, but he was still a little hesitant."But, colluding with the demon race, once this crime is confirmed ..."
         "Foolish!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Xu Qing frowned,"what do you mean by colluding?" I told you to read those ancient books, didn't you? When the ancient civilization was still strong, the demons were also ruled by humans. The ancient king suppressed the demons, and the demons guarded the sea and the rivers for the humans. The demons 'surrender was a sign of the emperor's will!"
         With that said, he was a little puzzled."This great demon of Mount kui has never had much interaction with my Xu family. Why is he looking for my Xu family now?"
          He hesitated for a while and said,""Right now, the high Duke's public house has lost too many powerhouses, causing instability on all sides. If we can come to an agreement with Mount kui, it would be great news and could shock some people. At the very least, the provinces that are connected to Mount kui would not dare to have any other thoughts!"
         It was a good thing. If they could really reach an agreement, they could even intimidate the Heroes of the East!
         He was only afraid that ... This kui Shan did not have good intentions.
         "Also, the snake tribe of Mount kui is the leader. This time, it's not the snake tribe that has come. Is it because they don't value it or is there some other reason?" he asked.
         This time, the big Golden Demon came suddenly.
         He was also a little puzzled.
         After thinking about it again and again, he still said,"how about this? first, get someone to quickly bring this big demon to the high Duke's public house. I want to talk to it ... Forget it. You go and talk to it!"
         It was better for him not to appear at the first moment and just listen.
         It would be bad if the negotiations failed.
         At this moment, Xu Qing was also very puzzled. He thought about it again and again, frowning slightly. Suddenly, he thought of something. "It's not like there aren't any people keeping demons now. We still have to be careful ... How about this, get general Tian to make a quick trip to Mount kui ..."
        
         He was a little hesitant, so he went to ask them directly,"did you send an envoy?"
         This ... If it was true, how awkward would that be?
         They've sent an emissary, and you're all so suspicious. The demons are hot-tempered, so it's easy to offend big demons.
         Xu Qing was also in a difficult position.
         However, he was also an experienced and astute person. He was indeed a little worried. Could it be that some people had deliberately ordered the demon race to harm him?
         "Ask general Tian to make a trip to Mount kui. Tell him that he has received orders to return the favor. The emissary has arrived safely at the East heart city. The high Duke's public house is committed to the coexistence of humans and demons ..."
         Xu Xing hurriedly nodded, understanding his father's meaning.
         However, he felt that ... He was making a mountain out of a molehill.
         He was too cautious!
         He was only worried that the cooperation between the humans and demons would cause some people to be hostile. His father, on the other hand, still had to confirm whether he was the real envoy of Mount kui.
          ? However, after thinking about it carefully, he didn't say anything.
         If he wasn 't, it would indeed be easy to become a big joke.
         It seemed that his father wanted to meet this great demon tonight in advance to prepare for tomorrow.
         ……
         And at this time, Li Hao really did enter the Black Panther's stomach.
         The Black Panther didn't look big, but in reality, its stomach was quite big. Li Hao finally understood why this fellow could eat so much.
         As for the Black Panther, it was no longer black, but golden.
         Li Hao had originally wanted to dye it.
         In the end, the Black Panther shook its head. It didn't do anything but shake its body, and its fur turned golden.
         Of course, no one had seen the Black Panther transform into a golden dog and eat the white-haired old man except for Li Hao and the others. At that time, Qian Feng, who was in the metamorphosis stage, had died and fan Chang had fled. Those who had been observing in secret had long fled in all directions.
         The Black Panther had transformed into a big golden dog at the last moment.
         Thus, Li Hao wasn't worried that someone would recognize him in his current Black Panther form.
         As for the Duke dingguo's visit to the great demon of Mount kui, Li Hao had not considered it. He expected that the Duke dingguo would either be happy or expel the great demon after knowing that a great demon had come to Mount kui. He would definitely not dare to offend him.
         As for going to Mount kui to check if it was true ... In Li Hao's opinion, he was too bold. He wasn't even afraid of being eaten by the great snake.
         And this was something that Li Hao had not thought about.
         He was too young and too inexperienced.
         It was also his first time doing such a thing. He didn't have much experience and left a big loophole. If he were an experienced person, he probably wouldn't take such a risk like Li Hao. Although it wasn't easy to find out about the internal situation of the demon race, it wasn't impossible. If he was exposed, he would be a sheep entering a Tiger's Den!
         At this moment, Li Hao was still feeling proud of himself, thinking that his scheme was not bad.
         In front of him, there was always someone helping him clear the way.
         Li Hao couldn't see it, but he could sense it. He had also been pretending to be a Black Panther, but he was very cold and didn't speak much. Great demons also had their own pride, even if it was just a three yang great demon.
         Just like that, Li Hao returned to eastheart city.  And this time, there was no charge.
         After entering eastheart city, Li Hao was soon picked up by an expert from the rising sun.
         "Welcome, Dragon envoy of Mount kui. I am the second general manager of the Duke dingguo's mansion ..."
         Li Hao's divine will swept over without any restraint and saw the person's true appearance. He was a middle-aged man with a slightly feminine appearance. He was quite strong and was at the middle stage of the rising light realm.
         All sunrise realm experts were strong.
         However, there were quite a lot of them in the high Duke's public house.
         "Where's that Duke?"
         “……”
         The second-in-command of the high Duke's public house frowned slightly and quickly disappeared. He cursed in his heart,'demons are indeed vulgar!'
         Do you think that a mere three yang lesser demon like you would be personally welcomed at the city gates?
         Did he really think of himself as the master of Mount kui?
         "State Duke, you are ill ..."
         "What?"
         "The Duke is sick ..."
         "So weak? He could get sick? Are you going to die?"
         Li Hao was extremely uncouth. In any case, in his impression, even great demons and Xuguang were like this, not to mention three suns. He felt that he had not been reckless enough.
         The second-in-command was slightly surprised and quickly said,"Emissary, you've misunderstood. It's just that the Duke's son was unfortunately killed by an evil person. The Duke's mood has been slightly up-to-date recently. Emissary, please come with me to the Duke's public house. The second young master is already waiting for you ..."
         "Is second young master powerful?"
         The Black Panther followed the other party, looking left and right. Li Hao was in charge of communication.
         "That ... Second young master is a strategist and is very powerful ..."
          The second-in-command smiled and led the Black Panther forward. Instead of the main road, they took the smaller roads and avoided some crowded places.
         As he walked, he probed,"tomorrow is the high Duke's public house's grand ceremony to offer a Memorial to the eldest young master who was murdered by a villain. I wonder if the reason for your visit today is related to this matter ..."
         "Oh, oh, oh, a sacrifice. I know. Lord Dragon God said that it's just a person's death. What's the sacrifice for? if he's dead, he's dead. When we demons die, we eat him directly. Are you going to eat your eldest young master tomorrow?"
         The second-in-command felt nauseated and cursed again. 'What a vulgar demon!'
         You only know how to eat!
         Unfortunately, he did not manage to find out anything. He was not in a hurry and continued to walk forward with the Black Panther. Not long after, they arrived at the high Duke's public house.
         At this moment, the back door of the high Duke's public house was open, not the main door.
         The back door was heavily guarded, and there was not a single person there, unlike the main door, which was full of people.
         The back door was wide open, and Xu Xing was waiting in the backyard.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Seeing the Golden Black Panther, his eyes brightened slightly. This demon race, from its appearance, was quite domineering. With one look, one could tell that its bloodline was extraordinary. However, its strength was slightly weaker. From the energy it was exuding, it seemed to only be around the middle stage of the three yang realm.
