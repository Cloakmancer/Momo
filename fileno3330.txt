When the body dies, the Dao will disappear.What if his body was split?Li Hao wanted to try.As a result, he had everyone tear him apart and turn him into a grid of existence. He had the Dao chess pieces carry him and bury him under the pillars of lightning."Ripping apart and burying ... You can't just casually bury them. You need a Dao body and a Dao Meridian! I'm now in charge of a thousand worlds and know a thousand DAOs, so ... For now, I'll use a thousand DAOs as the foundation ... In addition, the chess pieces can correspond, but the lightning pillar is not easy to judge the orthodoxy. If something goes wrong, it'll be very dangerous. "Li Hao looked at them, and finally at Black Panther."Black Panther, you need to sense the lightning pillars as well. You have a keen sense of smell and can even distinguish the specific DAOs ... Take senior Dao Qi and the others to find the corresponding lightning pillar!""As for seniors Wu Shan and Thunderlord, I'll have to trouble you to help me break through the threat of the lightning pillar and resolve the suppression of the lightning.""Brother Kong Ji, I'll have to trouble you to provide some recovery power for a portion of my scattered body so that it won't be completely destroyed,""Er Mao," he said,"you and the blood Emperor will have to bear with it. Help me control Time and Stars. Use the Dao of time to guide the power of the lightning pillar!"These two people ... A human and a cat, were both somehow related to Shi Guang.Perhaps, only they could control time and act as a guide for themselves to draw out the Dao in the lightning pillar.Let him clearly comprehend it!He wanted to understand what these DAOs had in common.Who could have such treatment?Two eighth rank venerable sovereigns and many seventh rank venerable sovereigns were all at his service. There was also a ninth rank sovereign weapon and the help of the time and star sphere. Such an opportunity was unprecedented.Since that was the case ... Why not give it a try?At this moment, all the venerable sovereigns looked grave. Was it worth it?He did not know.Li Hao wanted to explore new DAOs and the essence of DAOs. He didn't even take risks to become stronger. He simply wanted to take a look, so he took the risk!At that moment, the blood Emperor was silent.Li Hao, the Silver Moon King, was a junior in the eyes of the new martial artists!At this moment, he somewhat admired this person ... But he could not bring himself to like him. His emotions were a little complicated. Perhaps, he still liked Fang ping more. It was not because Fang ping knew him earlier, but ... Li Hao, the great Dao was truly heartless!A human King was a human, so he was a human King.And this person ... In his eyes ... Seemed to really be the Daoist master.It wasn't because he wanted to strengthen himself, deal with strong enemies, or anything else. He simply wanted to see the future of the Dao, the true essence of the Dao, and what it was. Therefore, he didn't hesitate to take the risk. In this extremely dangerous Thunder region, he actually wanted to split himself into pieces to comprehend the Dao.Many people didn't dare to take such a risk.Li Hao asked those he could persuade to stay. Who among the people present dared to say that they could persuade Li Hao?In the end, Kong Ji spoke."I don't have a problem with that. Where do you need it? I can go there to help you recover your body. But ... How long do you need?""I don't know. Maybe a while, maybe a long time. I just want to see and feel it for myself ..."Li Hao laughed."The Thunder Zone is a good place. It's quiet and safe here. The Thunder tribulation is the greatest enemy. But here, with the Thunder Emperor and senior Wushan, I have some free time."“……”The lightning zone, which everyone regarded as hell, was the safest place in Li Hao's eyes.Everyone was also filled with emotions.Dao Qi couldn't help but say,""The way the space doctrine and the Tribulation lightning doctrine are formed might not be the same ... Once there is a mistake in the correspondence ...""There must be something different. That's why I asked you to bring Black Panther with you. If there's any slight deviation, I can let Black Panther sense it.""Black Panther!"At this moment, Heibao felt a little dejected and did not utter a word.It was afraid that its perception was wrong. If its perception was wrong, what would the consequences be if its Dao corresponded to the wrong thing?A part of his body had become nourishment for the lightning pillar?Or was it ... Affecting the whole?Li Hao didn't say. Perhaps Li Hao himself didn't know."Then ... Let's try!"At that moment, the blood Emperor, who had been silent for a long time, said,""Let's give it a try. Since my young friend Li Hao has such an idea ... We can only fulfill it! Second cat, let's control time together and project the lightning territory!"Second cat wagged its tail and glanced at Li Hao. It suddenly said,""He's a teacher. When he was alive ... He actually liked to research and take risks. In this aspect, you're actually somewhat similar to him ... Don't worry, you won't die. If you really die, we'll try to reverse time to resurrect you ..."Li Hao laughed. Are you cursing me?He didn't say anything more. At this moment, Li Hao's body seemed to be in a state of collapse. It wasn't a bloody mess, but li Haos walked down from his body one after another, as if they were reborn from a drop of blood.One Li Hao walked out, holding a little realm. One Li Hao after another walked out, each holding a little realm.At this moment, Li Hao was so used to tearing apart the world and the Dao net that he even tore himself apart.These li Haos were very small.As if they were carrying the universe, they carried, hugged, and dragged the small world ... please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Some were unruly, some were wooden, some were cunning, some were overbearing, and some had a bad temper ...This was a different path, a different person, and a different Li Hao.There were a hundred forms of life and ten thousand DAOs. Each Dao corresponded to a different personality and different attributes.

At this time, the game of Go turned into a chessboard with 9999 squares on it.These li Haos walked into the grids one by one, corresponding to the different DAOs and entering different grids. Li Hao's voice sounded like thousands of people speaking in unison."The search for the pillar of lightning is also a problem. I'll have to trouble you all with this matter. I won't go search one by one ...""In addition, if there is a big movement in the lightning territory, it may arouse the curiosity of some experts and cause them to enter to observe ... It's fine if they don't get close to the lightning pillar, but if they do, I'll have to trouble you all to help!""You can rest in peace!""Don't worry, don't say so much,"Kong Ji said with a sigh.“……”"Hehe!" The one thousand li Haos laughed at the same time."It's so hard to hear that!"The next moment, the chess piece circled the void and disappeared to find the corresponding lightning pillar. This was also a difficult task. Before this, no one had tried to actively find the lightning pillar, and it was a different lightning pillar.In their eyes, it was all the same. The closer they got to the lightning pillar, the more dangerous it was!Soon, a chess board was placed under a lightning pillar.As the life force approached, the lightning quickly struck near the lightning pillar.The two grade 8 experts blocked him at the same time.This was hard work.After dealing with the lightning, they had to dig a hole to bury Li Hao. In fact, they had to break the lightning pillar and bury a part of Li Hao's body in it. Ordinary venerable sovereigns couldn't do this!……Today, the Thunder in the Thunder region continued to roar!The powerful power of the lightning tribulation covered the entire lightning territory. It seemed to have been triggered again and was somewhat angry.The Thunder region had been quiet for countless years. Usually, even if they passed through it, they would go in and out quickly. Who would dare to delay here?However, today ... The sound of thunder continued. Bolts of lightning seemed to have gone crazy as they spread in all directions.……In the outer region.At this moment, many venerable sovereigns were observing. The Thunder region had quieted down, and the battle in the square region seemed to have stopped. Many people actually had some ideas and wanted to go in and take a look.It was said that a battle between hundreds of Level 7s had broken out in the four-direction region.This was a Grand scene that had never been seen before in the outer region!At this time, there were experts from all directions in the Thunder region.There were eighth level venerable sovereigns, seventh level venerable sovereigns, and some spies sent by major forces. Even the ninth level venerable sovereign, who had been the most popular in the outer region recently, had sent people over.Tianfang world was the most famous place in the four-sided region.Many people in the outer region knew this.It was left behind by a rank nine venerable sovereign! Some of the older venerable sovereigns had even seen the Lord of Tian Fang before. He was unparalleled in the world and had traveled everywhere. It was said that the current rank nine venerable sovereign had met him a few years ago ...Of course, whether it was true or not, there was no way to verify it now. No one would ask that person if he had really seen it.However, just as the venerable sovereigns were about to enter, they noticed the changes in the lightning territory. Countless Thunderbolts burst out, and the lightning pillars outside even burst out with extremely powerful lightning power.It made some of the eighth level venerable sovereigns 'hearts palpitate.In the Thunder region.Outside.An eighth-level venerable sovereign was watching silently in the void. His eyes were a little gloomy. It was the eighth-level venerable sovereign who had escaped from the four-direction zone, the other eighth-level venerable sovereign from the Twin universes.The Twin universes were actually quite famous in the outer area.Although the two eighth rank venerable sovereigns were not at the peak of the eighth rank, it was rare for a world to give birth to two eighth rank venerable sovereigns, especially when two eighth rank venerable sovereigns were twin brothers. This was unheard of!However, at this moment, this level eight venerable sovereign was not in a good mood.His brother was dead!He died in the square domain.They had even lost two seventh rank venerable sovereigns. One had to know that the brothers had entered at the same time to fight Tian Fang. They wanted to reach the ninth rank. Even if they couldn 't, they wanted to reach the peak of the eighth rank. The peak of the double eighth rank would be enough to fight against the ninth rank who had dominated the chaos.The other party was currently unifying the chaos.A few days ago, he even killed a level eight, which made many people feel threatened. Although it was still far away from here, and the square domain was considered a remote area, but ... They still had to prepare for a rainy day.However, who knew that in the end, he was the only one who escaped.New martial!He was resentful. His brother's death was most likely related to neo martial.And now, the Thunder region had suddenly erupted again ... He didn't know what was going on. What were these bastards from the square region trying to do?Clearly, the eruption of the lightning territory might be related to the guy who had summoned hundreds of Level Seven lightning tribulations, which was the Silver Moon King of the new martial world.In that case, was the change in the lightning territory today related to the other party?While he was still thinking, a seventh level venerable sovereign suddenly appeared nearby. He looked at him with a smile,""May I ask if it's the sky sun path master or the earth Sun path master in person?"Heaven and earth dual Suns, twin universes.The Twin universes weren't extreme yang universes. However, this sun meant that the sky had two masters. One controlled the sky, and the other controlled the earth. They were the two suns of the sky and earth."Earth Sun!" Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  The eighth level venerable sovereign replied coldly. He seemed to have guessed who the other party was."Greetings, earth yang path master. I'm firmament dust ..."The seventh level venerable sovereign introduced himself and chuckled.""My master values the two Dao Masters very much and has wanted to discuss Dao with them several times. Unfortunately, he has no time for other matters ...""Thank you for your kind intentions, huntian Supreme Emperor!" Thearch di yang said coldly. It's just that ... Us two brothers have lived at the border for a long time and are used to peace and have no intention of going west!"

Huntian!He was the level nine venerable sovereign who had recently attained Dao. He had come from the West and conquered many worlds. Of course, many worlds had taken the initiative to join him because he was a level nine venerable sovereign.And now, they were extremely powerful!The other party's speed was not fast. Instead, he stabilized his territory bit by bit, gathered a universe, and slowly integrated it into his own system. Then, he led all the universes and advanced step by step. He fought steadily and steadily, making it difficult for others to even resist.,m It was like a Nebula. The territory they were in was surrounded by countless worlds. Although it was not as convenient as carrying a world with a Chaos Beast, a group of great beings could still slowly shift worlds and head over.At this rate, it might take thousands or even tens of thousands of years to reach this place, but the other party was not in a hurry at all.What was a thousand years to achieve such a great achievement as the Grand unification of chaos?It's better to be more stable!Otherwise, if they left the rear alone, they would be easily breached. This newly advanced level nine venerable sovereign wanted to take advantage of this time to stabilize his realm. It was a good plan.Now, they had sent people here again. Obviously, they had been keeping an eye on the square domain.Emperor Xiaochen wasn't annoyed and laughed, "That's fine. Xiaochen still has one more thing to ask of you. Very few advanced venerable sovereigns have crossed the lightning territory to enter the square territory. I heard that senior di yang had entered it a few days ago ... Can you tell me some information ... Of course, if Dao master has any requests, please do tell!"Thearch di yang laughed coldly,""You want to ask about the high-level battle a few days ago?""This ... Is also one of them."Xiao Chen didn't deny it. He asked curiously, "It's said that tianfang world might have recovered. Dao master, do you know if it's true? It was said that this Great War was caused by the recovery of Tian Fang ... In addition, I have a presumptuous request ... May I ask Dao Lord, are there many experts in the four-sided region? So what if he was at the eighth rank? How about the seventh rank?""Eighth-ranked?"Thearch earth yang laughed."Not many. The square region isn't too big. There are only three to five rank eights, and a few might have died ... The strongest now should be the Dragon Lord of the Dragon region, the light of the tianfang region, the human King of the Redmoon region, and a new rank eight, Wu Shan. Oh right, I don't know if Hongyue is dead or not ... That's all."Was he lying?No.However, he laughed again."The four-sided region's overall strength is average ... There are only about a hundred or so Level Seven venerable sovereigns. Today, a large number of them have died, so there might not be a hundred left. This is the full strength of the four-sided region. If huntian path master is interested, you can go in and take a look. Once level nine is reached, all the experts in the four-sided region will be annihilated in an instant!"Thearch Xiaochen laughed but did not say anything. He was actually more curious about something ... Where was Thearch Skysun?He actually had some sources of information, but he could not be sure.There were two level 8s in the Twin universes, so ... If one of them died, the outside world might not be able to sense anything. In fact, he had heard that Tian Yang might have been killed.But ... Was it true?Even in the outer region, the Twin venerable sovereigns were not unknown.The two brothers had gone to tianfang together, and it was said that they had even joined forces with a local Overlord. How could they be killed?  Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  However, he had only seen Supreme Emperor di yang recently.He didn't ask directly. Instead, he looked at the lightning territory."Earth yang path master, there's a riot in the lightning territory ... Do you know why?""Perhaps the Dragon Lord is chasing after the Silver Moon King?"Thearch earth yang smiled."A few days ago, Silver Moon King Li Hao ambushed the Dragon field and killed many thearchs. He triggered the chaos lightning tribulation and annihilated a group of experts. Since the Dragon Lord has come out, he will definitely hunt him down ... The two sides may have fought in the Thunder field. This is a good opportunity. If we go in, we may catch him off guard ... And eliminate the biggest threats in the square field ...""Silver Moon King?""That's right. The Kings of the subsidiary worlds of neo martial aren't too strong, but they can trigger the primal Chaos lightning tribulation. That's the real problem. However, it doesn't matter whether they can trigger the lightning tribulation after entering the lightning territory."After speaking for a while, Supreme Emperor di yang laughed and disappeared.I've said everything I need to say.If you're interested, go take a look for yourself."It would be interesting if the Dragon Lord is really fighting the Silver Moon King. I'll let you guys go in and see if the people from the four-sided domain are strong or not!"It would be good if a large number of people died!Emperor firmament watched the other party leave without saying anything. After a long time, he muttered,"Did Tian Yang really die there?"If that was true, then the Twin universes would no longer be a threat if one of the twin brothers was missing.Otherwise, if the two brothers were to guard the Twin universes together, even huntian path master would have to consider whether or not to attack them.Of course, the Twin universes were still far from their territory.However ... It was still good to plan ahead.At this moment, many people were observing the lightning territory. There were even some bold people with ulterior motives who took the risk and entered the lightning territory.……Four regions.The fluctuations of the lightning territory were also sensed by some of the nearby experts.On the side of the Dragon field, the Dragon Lord had also sensed it.At this moment, he looked into the distance. Over there, the sound of thunder and lightning reverberated through the world.The Thunder region was the natural barrier of the square region.It was a cage that trapped the four-sided domain, but it was also a barrier that protected the four-sided domain. No matter how strong the foreign venerable sovereigns were, they could not bring a world in. In this way, even if a rank nine entered the four-sided domain, the Dragon Lord would not be too afraid.

He, who controlled the dragon world, was completely qualified to fight with the other party.As for the Thunder World, it might be the only world that allowed him to move around in the Thunder region. Therefore, it was very important for him to take down the Thunder World. He could attack or retreat at will. Unfortunately ... He had planned for a full three hundred thousand years!In order to completely take over the Thunder World, the opportunity had already come. In the end, all his efforts fell short at the last step!"Li Hao ... Thunderlord ..."He mumbled to himself. What were these people up to in the lightning territory?Triggered a lightning explosion?He had been to the outer region and entered the Thunder region, but not many people knew about it. In fact, he had some dealings with the outer region, which was not completely sealed off.He knew that the lightning territory would not usually be so violent.Why was it like this today?Did someone touch the lightning pillar?The lightning pillar ...He thought to himself,'that's the foundation of the lightning territory. It might be a Dao net left behind by a top-notch existence. It's very powerful. The lightning pillar is most likely an existence in the Dao net system.' He had once thought of trying to comprehend it, but it was a pity that he would face a lightning tribulation as soon as he got close.On one hand, he had to deal with the lightning tribulation. On the other hand, he had to comprehend it. It was very, very difficult.After all, he was not a lightning venerable sovereign."The lightning territory appeared more than a million years ago, right after the master of Tian Fang disappeared ..."As he thought about it, he looked into the distance. He didn't enter it, as it was meaningless to investigate or do anything.A person appeared beside him.Phoenix Flames.​ At this moment, his eyes were burning with anger as he looked into the distance with hatred."Do you hate me?""Hate!"Feng Yan seemed to have grown up and matured in a day. Back then, he was like a child in front of the fire Phoenix, but now, he was much gloomier.Li Hao!That person had caused her mother's death, killed countless venerable sovereigns of the fiery phoenix realm, and exterminated the fiery phoenix Clan. The world was gone, and those people of the fiery phoenix Clan would obviously die!"It's only right to hate, but it can't change anything. "The Dragon Lord said softly,"you've reached Level Seven, but you've only barely managed to do so. You didn't reach Level Seven through your Dao domain. You've only forcefully devoured the power of Level Seven and reached Level Seven. You can't compare to true Level Seven itinerant cultivators. Level Seven itinerant cultivators form their own system through their Dao domain. You ... Can only be considered a level Seven Dao under a multiverse!""You're my child, do you know that?"Feng Yan was silent for a long time before he nodded.""I know,"She might not have known in the past, but after her mother repeated some things, she actually already knew. The Dragon Lord smiled."I have many children ... But they can't be considered many. And the one who entered the seventh step ... You're the only one. Even though there were some coincidences within, this was also something your mother fought for you!""If you want to become a true top-tier expert, this is definitely not enough. Seventh-tier ... And you've forcefully entered the seventh-tier, you're too far from Li Hao!""If he can kill a Tong Bao with one strike, you ... Will also be killed with one strike!"Thearch Phoenix Flame was silent."You've signed a great Dao agreement with him ... So far, you're probably the only expert who's still involved with him. Li Hao probably doesn't care about that, nor does he care about the level-seven lightning tribulation. Even if he'll be attacked by the lightning tribulation if he attacks you, sometimes, such nonchalance can be an opportunity!""Dragon Master ... I ..."The Dragon Lord interrupted her, not giving her a chance to speak. He said softly,""You're my child. I want to give you a chance ... But I don't know if you can grasp it!""I hope that you can give Li Hao a surprise ... Because I can sense that Li Hao is a very cautious and well-planned cultivator from his schemes. He's not a quick-witted and decisive person like the human King."Human Kings liked to adapt to the situation, and they were more flexible.The Silver Moon King, on the other hand, preferred to plan ahead. For example, he had snuck into the dragon field to make arrangements."He knows me well. So, it's actually very difficult for me to kill him ... Even if I'm stronger than him, I might not be able to catch him or kill him!"  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Thearch Phoenix Flame fell silent.The Dragon Lord continued."In his eyes, you're a fire-element cultivator. Back then, when we signed the agreement, you were the main guide, and he was the one being guided. So, you can actually sense him. He might not be able to sense you ..."The Dragon Lord turned to look at the dragon world and smiled."Take a look!"Feng Yan turned around and looked at the dragon world, a little confused.What was he looking at?"The dragon world is huge, right?"Feng Yan nodded."Is he very strong?""En!"Feng Yan nodded again, a little envious and yearning.""He's very, very strong!""No, not strong,"The Dragon Lord laughed,"this world was not actually created by me. I merely seized it!" We, the primal Chaos race, are actually not good at constructing our own Dao universes. There are only a few who truly have the ability to construct a Dao universe!""Ninety-nine percent of the great worlds today are snatched from the hands of the human race!""Feng Yan, do you think ... If I give this Dragon World to you and you inherit the position of Dao master, you'll be able to reach level eight?"Feng Yan was stunned. He thought that the Dragon Lord was joking and was testing him. He hurriedly said,""Fengyan definitely didn't mean that!""No, I'm serious."The Dragon Master looked at the dragon world."Actually, I've already understood. To us, the chaos race, the world will actually become a burden in the later stages! We, the chaos race, are free and unfettered. We don't have any worlds, and we didn't lose much of our combat power!"

"Moreover, it's more free and mobile!""This time, a large number of experts from the chaos race were killed. This has something to do with their motivation. If there was no world, your mother and the rest would not be so passive ... Qing Qiu and the rest would not have given up on some experts for the world.""And I ... It's time to abandon the world!"The Dragon Master sighed."At my level, if I want to go further and become a true tier 9, actually ... Even Tian Fang might not be able to give me such an opportunity. I want to seize Tian Fang not so that I can devour Tian Fang and enter tier 9, but to verify and compare some things I want to help me construct a Dao domain that belongs to me!"Feng Yan didn't understand. The chaos race didn't have a clear perception of the Dao.Moreover, she was only a seventh-rank venerable sovereign.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ The Dragon Master continued,"I've controlled the dragon world for many years. As for you, you're my bloodline. The difficulty of inheriting my position as the Dao master will be much lower. I won't reject you. However, you ... Might not be able to reach my level.""Of course, even if he can't reach my level ... It's enough for him to reach level 8. The current Li Hao doesn't have the strength to deal with level 8!""If you can reach level 8 before he does, Li Hao, you're probably the only one who can kill him!"Feng Yan was a little shocked and glanced at the Dragon Master.At this moment, under the illumination of the dragon world ... He suddenly felt that his unfamiliar father was so great!It was truly magnificent!The dragon world at the peak of the eighth rank was actually ... Just a burden to him?"As my descendant ... You will have some advantages, but it may also be a reversal!"The Dragon Lord continued,"you know how tier 7 and tier 8 are, but you don't know how they are!" You lack real stability. Even if you force your way into the eighth rank, you might only be able to stay at this level for the rest of your life!""Of course, in the days to come, if you can sense and comprehend more DAOs, you might still have a chance. I'm just afraid that you'll completely lose yourself after entering level eight!""Phoenix Flame ... I'll give you the dragon world. Do you want it?"He asked again. Feng Yan trembled a little, not knowing if it was out of excitement or fear. For a moment, he was speechless.The Dragon Master said softly,"there's no need for this. That Li Hao dared to let the Thunderbolt master enter the eighth stage. That new martial Supreme dared to let Wu Shan enter the eighth stage ... I, long Zhan, am not inferior to them. Even if I am inferior ... You are my direct blood. They can even give it to outsiders, let alone me, who is only giving it to my daughter!""They're not at level eight. Even if the human King has reached level eight, it's only for now ... As for me, I'm at the peak of level eight!" The Dragon Master sighed."Perhaps I should have done it long ago. Whether I handed this world to your mother or to someone else, perhaps my chaos race already had an additional tier 8 ... Or I was not broad-minded enough and too narrow-minded. I only thought that a tier 8 like me was enough ..."At this moment, he felt a little regretful.Actually, I should have given up on Dragon World long ago!If the fire Phoenix could control the dragon world, it might have reached the eighth-grade long ago!If she was an eighth-rank, then the previous incident would not have happened. These days, he had been thinking and thinking, and finally made a decision. He should let go.What do I want this Dragon World for?"The current me should prepare my own Dao domain in the true sense ... No, it's no longer a Dao domain. To him, if he wants to reach level nine, he might need to construct a true Dao world!"Dragon Lord, I ... I ..."At this moment, Feng Yan was so nervous that he was trembling.The Dragon Lord suddenly stretched out his hand and Feng Yan jumped in shock. The next moment, he saw the Dragon Lord stroke her head and smile.""What are you afraid of? What was there to be afraid of? In this chaos, no one can make us so afraid! The race of chaos is not as barbaric, rude, and crazy as everyone thinks ...""Humans eat demons, demons eat humans, humans eat beasts, beasts eat humans ... I'm not asking you to become humans by letting you learn the culture of the human race. Humans are defined by the human race. No one has stipulated that the chaos race can not be humans!" "If I'm strong, no one will object if I say that the chaos beings are humans and humans are beasts and food!"The Dragon Lord said indifferently, then continued,"the four-sided domain is very small, and might not be our end!" Even if neo martial and silver Moon are currently our biggest problem ... They might not necessarily be the problem we need to solve now! The key is to strengthen yourself and not let yourself fall behind. ""To the outside world, we'll show that we're seeking revenge, but to the inside, I have to tell you ... They're very difficult to kill and deal with. They're even more difficult than you imagined!""Therefore, I must work hard to become stronger!""The secrets of the chaos are far from just the four regions. Where did the master of the square Sky Go? Where did Tian Fang's people go?"In the primordial chaos, over the course of countless years, where have all the other class nines gone? Was there only one newly-advanced rank nine in the entire primordial chaos? I've actually seen this so-called newly advanced rank nine and so-called huntian Supreme Emperor before ... But he's just so-so!"He was in charge of everything, and even if he was defeated for a moment, it did not make him depressed.At this moment, as he was talking to his daughter, a universe entrance appeared in front of him. "Let's go. We don't need to care about what Li Hao and the others are doing. It's nothing more than comprehending Dao, constructing Dao domains, and perfecting orthodoxies. There's not much point in stopping them. It might be a good thing to have a strong enemy and hatred on our side. It gives us more motivation. Black Tiger is about to reach the 8th rank. This is the power of hatred!"

At this moment, Feng Yan only felt that his father was a magnificent man!He ... Seemed to have never been afraid of anything."The Dao of the dragon world focuses on the Dao of the physical body, which strengthens the physical body. This is our Foundation and is very compatible with the chaos race, which is why I'm staying in the dragon world and not in other realms! Strengthen your body. You've inherited both my bloodline and your mother's bloodline ... An existence like you is actually very rare ...""When your fleshly body is so strong that it can resist worlds, primordial chaos, and tribulation lightning ... You can even use the fleshly body of a member of the primordial chaos to enter the internal universe ... That's the true limit of the Dao!""The human King Forged an inner world, but he is still a human. Li Hao has constructed the integration of the thousand worlds, but he can only release it externally ... Humans have their strengths and weaknesses, but the chaos race's greatest advantage is our physical body!"“……”The Dragon Lord was constantly teaching his daughter, but he was also reviewing his own orthodoxy.He guided his daughter on how to refine the dragon world bit by bit. As for himself, he was also stripping away his own orthodoxy bit by bit, leaving the dragon world to complete an incomparably smooth handover!He was also the first person in the four-sided domain to hand over a world to someone who didn't die on his own.A level 8 great world!None of the rank eight overlords dared to say that they would hand over their own world. The light Thearch's son was also very outstanding, but he had never mentioned that he would hand over his world to his son.If he didn't let go, how could he gain anything?He had to let it go. The Dragon Lord felt that he might have been a little late to realize this, but it was not too late. Perhaps only by letting it go could he enter the ninth-rank.He wasn't sure if huntian Supreme Emperor had let it go.However, could such a person really let go?Perhaps, he had taken a shortcut."Li Hao, Fang ping ..."He muttered in his heart. Fang ping had not let go of neo martial, but he had walked his own inner world Dao. He did not place as much importance on yin and yang as he had imagined.As for Li Hao ... He didn't even control the Dao universe. Instead, he had been creating it on his own ...Although these people were weaker than him and younger than him, they were all very bold.This time, he had chosen to let it go, perhaps because he was influenced by them.At this moment, the Dragon Lord had truly let go of the Dragon Realm and his obsession with the great Dao universe. Bit by bit, he constructed a Dao domain that belonged to him in his body. The Dao law descended bit by bit and entered the chaos Dao bit by bit, constructing a small realm.One thousand, two thousand, three thousand, four thousand ...The laws of the great path continued to gather.The Dragon Lord stopped cultivating when it reached over 6000.According to the division of Dao chess, more than 6000 Dao paths were actually only at the level of a sixth stage venerable sovereign. However, to construct a Dao domain on one's own, it was already extremely rare!Li Hao, a stage six, had only constructed 1000 world Dao domains so far.On the other hand, the great DAOs of Sword Saint and the others were very weak. They had at most 3000 to 4000 Dao laws. Dao domain was the embodiment of a realm, not a manifestation of one's strength.Being able to construct a Dao domain actually meant that one had the qualifications to enter the seventh rank. To these people, the seventh rank was just the beginning.A new starting point!Anyone who had constructed their own Dao domain was a genius and qualified to reach rank nine!At this moment, the Dragon Lord felt as though the entire world and chaos had become clearer. It was as though he had seen a new world. At this moment, he looked towards the lightning territory in the distance and muttered,""Lightning territory ... How many Dao laws are there to construct a Dao territory?"Only those with more than 9000 traces could reach the ninth step?If that's the case, I'm still far from it."As for that huntian Supreme Emperor, if he can't overpower me and kill me easily ... Then he's not a true ninth rank.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Perhaps, only people like the master of tianfang could be considered a true grade 9?"Over six thousand ..."The Dragon Master looked pensively at the other parts of the four-direction region. 'Perhaps it's time for me to comprehend more Dao laws instead of just pursuing the improvement of my power. After all, there's still a limit to power.'​ ……At the same time.Time and Stars radiated across the heavens and earth, and thousands of rays radiated thousands of lightning pillars.Li Hao's shadow appeared on the pillars of lightning. At this moment, Li Hao seemed to have opened his eyes and saw the lightning tribulation and the lightning territory clearly for the first time!" 9300 ..." He said.Li Hao mumbled. It was much more than he had expected.More than 9000 lightning pillars!This was an expert who had fused more than 9000 DAOs. He was a peerless expert and the Lord of calamity!This ... Was probably not the master of Tian Fang.This meant that there was more than one rank nine in the primordial chaos."That's right ... Back then, when I turned back time, Coiling Dragon and Huo Yan said that Dao master Tian Fang had once gathered many rank nine Dao Masters ... A rank nine might be the true Dao master in their eyes, the master of a great Dao!""Many ... Perhaps, there will be a Lord of calamity!"Li Hao thought. At this moment, he saw the lightning territory. For the first time, he clearly saw the great DAOs, how they spread, how they combined, and how the chaos lightning tribulation was born!This was the first time he had completely seen the structure of the primal Chaos tribulation lightning.Moreover, to see and understand more than a thousand li Haos together ... It was a very unique feeling for Li Hao."So DAOs are all variable ... There are strong and weak DAOs, life and death DAOs, growth and growth DAOs ... Fixed changes are not the key to the success of these Dao Masters ..."

Chapter 3336 Time Is Difficult To Fix (3)
A series of thoughts instantly emerged in his mind.At this moment, countless thoughts appeared in the minds of the thousands of li Haos.The power of tribulation!The lightning tribulation here was only a part of the chaos lightning tribulation. It was not the true base of the chaos lightning tribulation. The entire chaos was filled with the power of ten thousand DAOs, which was why it could form chaos lightning tribulation at any time!"The chaos lightning tribulation comes and goes without a trace ... It doesn't appear from any place, but ... It's formed on the spot!"Li Hao finally understood!Why were lightning tribulations everywhere?You can meet them everywhere you go?This was because a certain mechanism was triggered in a place with Primal Chaos energy, causing the myriad Dao energy to instantly transform from Primal Chaos energy into Primal Chaos tribulation lightning!"That means that time and space are actually the same! The power of space is actually not really shuttling through space. It's just ... Changing the form of the chaotic force, causing Space Force to be everywhere you go ...""Is Shi Guang the same? Whether it's reverse or downstream, you've only changed the chaotic force to a certain extent, allowing the images of the past to reappear ..."At this moment, Li Hao was somewhat excited.At this moment, Li Hao even controlled thousands of pieces of flesh to forcibly block the transmission of some of the lightning pillar's power. The next moment, countless lightning bolts went out of control, and Wu Shan and the lightning pillar suddenly groaned!Kong Ji unleashed his power of recovery!Er Mao and the blood Emperor struggled to control the Time and Stars. They were confused as to why the lightning tribulation had gone out of control. Soon, they understood and cursed in their hearts.Crazy!What are you doing now?At this moment, Li Hao had some ideas and comprehensions. The next moment, the thousands of lightning pillars suddenly flickered, and a sword appeared in the void. It was the firmament sword!The firmament sword was trembling in fear!As it trembled, a powerful and explosive force of lightning emerged from the thousands of lightning pillars and gathered into the firmament sword. The firmament sword almost exploded in an instant. Even though it had reached level six, it still felt extremely weak!In an instant, a sword appeared. A sword of destruction appeared. Or rather, a sword of half calamity appeared!The sword slashed towards the sky!BOOM!At this moment, it was as if heaven and earth had exploded and the chaos had split open. The sword slashed out and destroyed the world!Li Hao borrowed some of the power of the lightning pillars and used his Dao to gather and construct the sword of Thunder tribulation. Even the level 8 Thunder Emperor and Wu Shan were shocked by this one strike!Don't play around!If they were to be slashed by this thing, they would be seriously injured!…… "Sigh, what a pity ..."At this moment, Li Hao's voice came out of the pillar of lightning.""It's a pity that I can't dig away these lightning pillars ..."When everyone heard this, they trembled a little. Don't make a fuss!  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  ……At the same time.Deep in the chaos.In the depths of the void, where countless Dao nets formed the corporeal Dao, a statue suddenly opened its eyes. In its eyes, it was as if the world was being destroyed, as if lightning was destroying the world, as if chaos was collapsing!Gradually, a lightning territory appeared in his eyes."Tian Fang!"At this moment, the statue suddenly opened its mouth, and its will fluctuated.In the distance, the statue that had opened its eyes a few times before suddenly opened its eyes as well. "What's the matter?""Someone in the four-sided domain fused with my Dao net and copied the Tribulation of the lightning domain ...""Oh!""What are you waiting for?""Waiting for the time King!""Time King ... Is there really someone who can cultivate time?""I don't know," "What a waste of time ...""You can choose not to wait!"“……”The thunderous statue chose to shut up. Gradually, its eyes began to close, but its will was still fluctuating."I saw time as well, when it was incomparably weak. And yet, back then, he wasn't able to achieve time. Will the juniors of today ... Really be able to? If the first generation can't succeed, then the second generation ... I think it's just empty hope!"In the distance, another statue said after a long time,""Then we'll keep waiting. We'll wait until ... Until the end of time and until the chaos collapses!"The Lord of calamity was too lazy to say anything more and directly fell into a deep sleep.Was it really that difficult for Shi Guang?Even Tian Fang was unable to achieve it?In this chaos, could there really be someone who could become time?

Chapter 3337 The Difference In Strength (1)
His body melded with the lightning pillar and he began to comprehend the Dao of tribulation.Although it wasn't complete, and he still couldn't fuse 10000 DAOs together ... Fine, in truth, he had fused over 9300 DAOs together, and that was only the power of 1000 DAOs. But at this moment, it was still shocking.The two rank eights were shocked by the sword.Strong!It was a very powerful strike. Of course, it mainly borrowed the power of the lightning pillar here. Otherwise, Li Hao's thousand DAOs sword wouldn't have been so powerful that it could seriously injure a level 8 cultivator.Li Hao, who had fused with the lightning pillars, even thought of gathering the lightning pillars together to reform his body.The thousands of lightning pillars trembled slightly!It was as if it was going to rise from the ground!The blood Emperor couldn't help but shout,""The owner of this lightning pillar might still be alive ... We can't move it rashly. Forcefully merging with someone else's Dao will easily attract trouble!"He looked around and frowned slightly.He was slightly solemn.The feeling of prying!Yes, he wasn't the only one. In fact, Li Hao had also sensed it. The two powerhouses of the eighth step had also sensed it, but they didn't say anything.He had actually experienced this feeling once before.In tianfang!There were many secrets in the square region.Tian Fang, the master of Tian Fang was probably still alive.As for this Thunder region ... If there really was a master of the Tribulation, there was a high chance that he was still alive. In this square region, there might be two level nine Masters that were known to be alive.At this moment, Li Hao's thousand incarnations gradually left the pillar of lightning and appeared in the lightning zone. They laughed at the same time. "I'm just trying. If he's really alive ... Alright, he's really alive. I'm just curious, why didn't he return?"It was the same for the master of tianfang and the master of calamity.,m If he remembered correctly, back then, Daoist huoyan had once mentioned the master of tianfang and invited many people, such as the master of life and death and the master of yin and yang. They all called him Daoist master!Dao Masters ... Even if they were human Kings who controlled yin and yang and had reached level eight, there was a high chance that they were no longer the Dao Masters he spoke of. Dao Masters might really be exclusive to level nine. Of course, it might be back then.Now, the Masters of the great Dao could be called Dao Masters.If that was the case, there were far more than just two stage nine experts back then. There might really be many. The five elements path master, the light and dark path master ... Might all exist.They were the most Supreme experts of the primordial chaos.All of them had reached the pinnacle of mastery over the great Dao.The chaos had existed for countless years, and level nine venerable sovereigns were almost immortal. How could they all be gone?Li Hao's thousands of bodies walked out and began to merge into one. Gradually, a complete Li Hao appeared. The power of Thunder appeared on his body, and tribulation lightning struck from the sky and earth. When it landed on Li Hao, it instantly disintegrated. The remaining power of the God tribulation lightning was directly swallowed by Li Hao into the world of destruction.It didn't cause him much harm at all.The Thunderbolt master took a deep breath at this scene. He looked at Li Hao and said,""You ... No longer fear the primal Chaos lightning tribulation?""It's not that I'm fearless. "Li Hao smiled."At the very least, a lightning tribulation of the seventh step won't cause me any harm. I can also partially resolve a lightning tribulation of the eighth step. In fact, it's just separating the lightning tribulation from the inside ... As long as you're fast enough, I can also split a lightning tribulation of the eighth step into the seventh step, and then into the sixth step ..."The power of tribulation lightning was not controlled by an owner and was born naturally. Now that Li Hao had seen the path of tribulation lightning, it was not difficult for him to dismantle it.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  Of course, if it really was a ninth-rank Lord of calamity, a casual strike from more than 9300 of them would be impossible to break apart.He was directly smashed into pieces!In the face of absolute power, some small tricks would not be of much use. However, such absolute power had not appeared yet.At this moment, even the Thunderbolt master was a little envious. He wanted to fuse with the lightning pillar and take a look.But ... Forget it.Although he was currently the master of the Thunder World, his expertise was mainly in the Dao of lightning. He was not like Li Hao, who would study every Dao. Moreover, he did not have a deep understanding of the combination of Dao, even though he was an eighth-rank Supreme Emperor and had a deep understanding of Dao domain.However ... If they were to be serious, they were probably not as good as Li Hao.He had too little experience.Even if he was at rank eight, he had little experience. At least, he had never seen any rank nine venerable sovereign's Dao. He had not even seen much of a rank seven Dao, let alone a rank nine one, let alone study it deeply.He had been dealing with beasts of primordial chaos all this time. How could those guys have any Dao to speak of?It was only brute force!At this moment, the Thunderbolts in the sky were still falling. As Li Hao rapidly reorganized himself, his strength didn't increase or change at all. This time, it seemed like he was just taking a look.But to Li Hao ... He had gained a lot.Not only did he see some of the characteristics of the path of calamity, but he also saw the direction of some level nine venerable sovereigns, which also confirmed many conjectures.It was good that 10000 DAOs were one, it was good that 10000 DAOs were one ... In the end, there was an order.Yes, order.Cultivation was actually a process of turning disorder into order. At this moment, Li Hao realized even more clearly that the power that existed in chaos was disorderly, and what cultivators had to do was to turn this disorder into order.The more you can organize, the more you can organize all of the DAOs, and in the end, all of the great DAOs within the primordial chaos into order ... You will be a Supreme existence!Zhan Tiandi had achieved this.Apart from the lack of energy, his realm and his Dao had actually stepped into the ninth level!Of course, if he really wanted to enter level nine, how many worlds would he have to swallow and how many people would he have to kill?

Perhaps ... Zhan Tiandi felt that this should not be the case, so he chose to self-destruct?If that was the case ... It would be a pity.If the time Dao master wanted to become a true Dao master and reach rank nine, he would probably have to devour a large amount of energy. Chaotic force was enough, but if he slowly sorted out chaotic force, he might need many, many years before he had any hope of succeeding."The devouring is still faster ..."Li Hao muttered.On the day he walked out of the chaos, he felt that devouring was a shameful act and that cultivators should not do it.However ... Today, he felt a little emotional.He didn't rely on devouring, but on his own accumulation ... If he wanted to get to where he was today, it would probably take thousands of years, right?At least, this was the case.Devouring the power of other worlds could save a lot of time. No wonder everyone was focused on devouring and annexing other people ... But this did not mean that devouring was right.At present, the entire chaos was like this.If you don't devour others, others will devour you.In all directions, it was like the big fish eating the small fish, and the small fish eating the shrimp. At this moment, if you didn't do it, others would. You were independent, but you also had to see if others would give you the opportunity.Order!This word appeared in Li Hao's mind. Chaos was still too lacking in order. He had thought of this a long time ago, and it was even more clear today. The level 9 Dao was actually the Dao that established order.Li Hao fell into deep thought.These type 9 powerhouses should also have some understanding. The chaos was originally chaotic. Currently, the entire chaos, including the great Dao, was in a mess. The great Dao universe was actually the foundation and the beginning of order.At level 9, this order would be deeply rooted in people's hearts. Powerhouses who had truly reached level 9 should all understand one thing ... Chaos, the ultimate goal for you to become stronger was actually order!Then where did these Grade 9 experts go?At this moment, Li Hao had a guess ... Did they ... Go to establish order?If that was the case, the rank nine venerable sovereigns would have something to pursue.If that wasn't the case ... It would be a little disappointing if he were to hide and fight somewhere else. A tier 9, at this point, was still pursuing fame and fortune, pursuing status. In fact, he was neglecting the essentials and pursuing the trivialities.To cultivate to this level ... He had actually already reached the peak.As this thought came to mind, Li Hao instantly let it go.He didn't have to worry about that for the time being. He couldn't even rival a powerhouse at the eighth step, let alone a powerhouse at the ninth step. He couldn't even rival a real powerhouse at the top of the seventh step, let alone a powerhouse at the eighth step. His top priority was still to continue perfecting his outer Dao.The outer path referred to these realms and realms. Li Hao had achieved a basic goal. At this moment, he was officially moving forward to establish order, but it was not enough, far from enough!To become a true peerless expert, there were more than 9300 Lords of calamity in front of him. Although they might not be as powerful as realms, if Li Hao wanted to use realms as his Dao, would he be able to match them without seven or eight thousand realms? Difficult!This was even if he had established his own realm as his Dao. Otherwise, if he wanted to match such an expert, he would have to have a similar Dao law. If the gap was too big, he would probably not be able to match him."The master of Tian Fang will definitely be stronger than the master of calamity!"This thought came to Li Hao's mind again. A peerless expert with 9999 Dao laws!Perhaps ... He was only one trace away from the true limit. As for whether time was equivalent to 10000 traces or was equivalent to space, it was still uncertain. Li Hao had no way of finding out.Then, he frowned. He had some guesses in his heart, but he didn't dare to think too deeply about it.The chaos was currently in disorder and chaos.The ultimate goal of cultivators was to establish order.Then, could the power of disorder in the chaos also give birth to a truly invincible expert? furthermore, because this Dao law was a disorderly existence, it would conflict with the existence of order to a certain extent?If there was ... The current chaos was still dominated by the lawless lands. Did that mean that the lawless lands still had the upper hand?Strange thoughts emerged in his mind.Was that even possible?He did not know.Perhaps there was such a possibility.For example, the new martial's Emperor Cang. In the past, the purpose of his appearance was to collect the filth. In fact, he was also a representative of the disorder. However, after Emperor Cang was born, his personality was a little special. He used a deep sleep to cover up the essence of the disorder.Otherwise, such an existence would have been the greatest Lord of annihilation in neo martial arts, not the heavenly Emperor."What are you thinking about?"At this moment, Kong Ji flew back breathlessly and complained,""You stirred up the lightning territory just now and almost killed us.""Thanks for the trouble!" Li Hao smiled."I'm still alright!""Did you get anything?" Kong Ji laughed."Yes, I've made some small gains."With that, he reached out and the firmament sword fell into his hand. With a casual swing of the sword, he actually opened up a passage in the Thunder region. It was a stunning sight."You ..."  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  "The power of the Tribulation was just resolved!"Li Hao wasn't surprised. However, at this moment, he looked around and thought for a while."At rank eight, some ambitious venerable sovereigns will walk their own Dao domain system ... In fact, they'll start walking from rank seven!""The great Dao universe is good, but at its peak, it's actually a restraint. Thus, the master of tianfang giving up the great Dao universe actually doesn't affect him much."

Chapter 3339 The Difference In Strength (3)
As he said this, he looked at Wu Shan and the Thunderbolt master."Both of your DAOs are a little lacking ... It's not that it's not good for one Dao to be dominant, but if one Dao is dominant, you'll have to dabble in a few DAOs even if there are 10000 DAOs. Otherwise, level eight is easy, but level nine ... Is almost impossible!"At this moment, both Wu Shan and the Thunderbolt master were somewhat shaken.Level eight was easy!Ninth-rank ... Hopeless?It was a bit strange for a level-six cultivator to say that. However, Li Hao couldn't be treated normally. He had seen time, calamity, and space. It could be said that the level-nine DAOs he had seen surpassed all the experts in the chaos.Li Hao continued,"of course, it doesn't matter if you don't pursue level nine. But if you do ... You'll have to pay an even greater price. Try to construct your own Dao domain. This is a necessary path for level nines, and it's also the path that several level nines are walking on as far as I know."Perhaps, if one path dominated, it could also become a ninth-rank?Who knows?In any case, Li Hao had never seen one before. The few level 9 paths he had seen so far weren't dominated by one.,m In the primordial chaos, the true geniuses all walked the Dao of fusion and the Dao of combination.Supreme Sword, human King, Supreme martial artist, Dragon Lord ...There were many new martial arts geniuses in the square region.In addition to neo martial, he had met the Dragon Lord once before, and the Dragon Lord was the same. Last time, Li Hao estimated that the Dragon Lord had at least five to six thousand fused Dao laws, which was probably true. If that was the case ... The Dragon Lord might be the one who had constructed the most Dao laws out of all the people Li Hao had met so far. Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ But ... Li Hao thought of the human King.What the human King was currently displaying was the power of Yin and yang. He seemed to be constructing his inner world, which was actually a Dao domain. At this moment, Li Hao was somewhat curious about how many Dao laws the human King had constructed in his inner world.This point, if the human King didn't mention it, no one would know.Perhaps not few!As for Li Hao, he only had a mere 1000 Dao laws. Although these Dao laws were filled with the power of great DAOs, making the 1000 Dao laws even more powerful, in terms of the structure of the entire Dao domain, he was inferior to those people.They were not even as good as those of revered sword or Lizhu.They had quite a few Dao laws.Li Hao looked at the blood Emperor curiously."If I may ask ... Senior, are you also on the Dao domain path, or is it based on the new martial arts ..."He actually couldn't tell!Yes, so far, he couldn't see if the other party had left neo martial. This was actually very strange.The blood Emperor smiled and glanced at Li Hao. After a while, he said,""It's still relying on neo martial for the time being. "Li Hao was surprised. The strong practitioners of neo martial arts and those with ambition had all left, such as venerable the sword and Lizhu.The blood Emperor was quite famous in neo martial arts. Strictly speaking, according to his understanding of neo martial arts 'history, human Kings and Supremes were the soul of the neo martial era. However, the blood Emperor and a few others were also considered the backbone of neo martial arts. They were much more important than venerable sword in the past.During the battle against the heavenly Emperor, these few people had played a huge role.Everyone else had left, but why ... Why didn't the blood Emperor leave?Was he not confident?It shouldn't be.Then why?While Li Hao was still thinking, the blood Emperor laughed. "It's not that complicated. It doesn't matter if you leave neo martial arts or not. How you cultivate is your own business. There are benefits to leaving and there are benefits to not leaving. The truth is that you can't leave if you don't break away from the Dao domain?"He shook his head."That's not necessarily the case. You, Silvermoon, also have a great Dao universe. You should know that ... Since that's the case, can't a branch Dao become more powerful? That's not for certain ... Do you know what Dao I'm good at?"Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"archery, saber, vitality ..."The origin of the blood Emperor was that his blood Qi was extremely strong, beyond imagination. However, at this moment, he looked ordinary and did not seem to have a soaring blood Qi."It's mainly based on vitality!"The blood Emperor explained,"the saber is the carrier. Qi and blood are the foundation. As for the archery Dao ... As long as you inherit the archery Dao of Zhan Tiandi, it's not a Dao you're good at. I can only say that it's very convenient to use.""Since qi and blood are the foundation, who doesn't cultivate qi and blood? Even the weakest person has qi and blood. Since that's the case ... I'll merge with the great Dao universe and comprehend more. Everyone has qi and blood, so if I touch the power of this great Dao, I'll be able to obtain a similar comprehension to the great Dao River and merge with my own qi and blood domain!""There's also the Dao of the physical body. It's actually the same. Who doesn't cultivate their physical body?"he added."Since he's cultivating the Dao of the fleshly body, he'll be cultivating the other DAOs. You'll be able to gain some enlightenment .... That's the use of the Dao River ...."Li Hao thought for a moment.These basic DAOs might seem simple, but it was actually very, very difficult to walk deeper and further.If he could use this as a Foundation to gain enlightenment of the myriad DAOs, it would also be a path.He didn't need to be independent and comprehend it by himself."I understand, Li Hao has learned a lot!""It's just an exchange, how can it be considered teaching ..."The blood Emperor laughed, but his smile was very gentle."Thunderbolt master, senior Wushan, and the others don't need to give up the great Dao universe at this stage. The great Dao universe is very tolerant! At present, I will gain more insights in the Dao universe. However, as Li Hao said, I can change my focus ..."
