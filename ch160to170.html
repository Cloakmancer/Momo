        Chapter 161: Master and disciple hurt, parting (3)
Translator: 549690339
He was too immature!

Li Meng and Wang Ming had both been injured in the first exchange, which made Liu Long want to cry but had no tears. If he had known that you were so noob, he would have run with Yuan Shuo!

“Retreat!”

He didn’t dare to delay any longer and shouted,””Break out of the encirclement with me!” He ordered.

At this moment, he was actually the strongest among them.

Wang Ming sobered up this time, feeling a little embarrassed and helpless ... He had only carried out some small missions to deal with some weaklings, but this was his first time fighting against a super like this.

He was caught off guard!

How embarrassing!

He couldn’t care about anything else. At this moment, he might need to break out of the encirclement.

At this moment, Liu Long held a short sword and shouted coldly,””The Li family’s sword is in my hands! If you want it, then come!”

With that, he jumped up, jumped out of the battle circle, and quickly ran in the direction of the warehouse.

This was one of the reasons why he wasn’t too worried about Li Hao’s safety. The Li family’s sword was on his side, and those people might need to be with the sword. Of course, it was also because he couldn’t get away.

The short sword in his hand was exuding a faint and mysterious energy.

All of a sudden, the four supers ‘expressions changed. Under their ghastly faces, they were all shocked. The sword was with Liu Long?

“Chase!”

Reading on Mybo xn o vel. com ,Please!

The four of them quickly abandoned Wang Ming’s group. Killing these people was just a side effect; the Li family’s sword and Li Hao were the key!

At this moment, the rain had already turned slightly blue.

Thunder and lightning intertwined!

The rain would turn blue, and that would be the time to deal with Li Hao. At this moment, they didn’t delay any longer and quickly chased after him.

As for the three people behind them, they really didn’t care too much.

In terms of combat experience, they were stronger. If they were to be divided into three levels, apart from being slightly weaker than Liu Long, the three of them were just noobs, not worth paying attention to.

Behind them, Hu Hao flashed through the air, grabbed the two of them, and chased after Liu Long.

Wang Ming’s face was unsightly.

“I’ve embarrassed the night patrolman!”

An unfavorable start!

It was embarrassing that he and Li Meng were injured in the first exchange.

He then thought of the thing that had just hurt him and felt a lingering fear. He reminded,””Be careful of the monster hiding in the dark. I don’t know what it is, but I can’t feel it at all. It burrowed into my body in an instant. Not only did it burn my internal organs, but even my mysterious energy was shaken to the point that it couldn’t condense!”

It was too dangerous!

If not for Liu Long, he might have been killed by this group of people.

At this moment, the few of them no longer dared to underestimate others.

When they thought about how Liu Long and the others had been able to hold on until now in such a dangerous situation and even kill those people, Wang Ming and the others felt a little strange.

Were martial masters really in decline?

In terms of vitality, a Martial Master like Liu Long, who had over 100 martial masters, was inferior to them.

The destructive power of the inner strength was not as good as the mysterious energy.

Although they were on the same level, in reality, supers were faster and stronger than martial masters.

In the end, Liu Long was able to kill a few supers!

“Martial masters are different,” Hu Hao said in a low voice.”We’re too young and inexperienced! Martial masters were all trained in real combat. Liu Long had trained in martial arts for many years and had killed many people! An old Martial Master like Yuan Shuo had killed more people than anyone else in the past! He fought every three days and ten days!”

Wang Ming didn’t say anything else, but glared at the people in front of him and gritted his teeth!

He had been underestimated!

As for the monster in the dark, he thought of Liu Long’s previous method to deal with it. He didn’t know if boiling his mysterious energy would be effective. At least he had some experience.

And his battle experience was rapidly increasing at such life and death moments.

If the three supers did not die in today’s battle, they would not be as helpless as they were today, not knowing how to deal with danger.

……

“Cough, cough, cough ...”

Yuan Shuo vomited blood, and his face turned paler. He looked up at the sky. The rain was too heavy.

Don’t play!

If I go any further, my hair will turn black. The grayish-white color on my face ... Is it an act or is the dye falling off ... Yuan Shuo was too lazy to distinguish.

This rain was really heavy!

“Do you have it? If not, I’ll go back and kill that Thunder super. It’ll be worth it ...”

He was trying to determine if there were any stronger people.

Based on the current situation, the other party still had the upper hand, but it wasn’t too obvious. If that was the case, the other party might not be able to take down Li Hao easily, let alone hold a ceremony to unseal the Li family’s sword.

“That Thunder superpower is still fighting Huang Yun.....So I’m afraid there are more!”

With his many years of experience and the perception of Martial Master douqian, he judged that there must be more powerful people hiding in the dark.

It was hard to say whether it was the sun glory or above it.

This time, the enemy’s target was Li Hao. They couldn’t be wrong about the core. Therefore, if they had, they must be waiting for an opportunity to take down Li Hao. As for the night patrolman, he wasn’t their target.

A moment later, Yuan Shuo saw the warehouse.

In the next moment, his expression changed.

Damn it, he really thought too highly of Li Hao. The secrets of the eight great families of Silver City might even be beyond his expectations ... What level had they come to this time?

Peak of the sunlit realm?

Or ... Even stronger?

It can’t be!

Even Yuan Shuo felt a little guilty. After he advanced to the warrior chieftain level, he felt that riyao was just so-so and did not take him seriously. He had been practicing martial arts for more than 60 years. His combat experience and instincts were not something that those supers could compare with.

Chapter 162: Master and disciple hurt and parted ways (4)
Translator: 549690339
Hence, he said that only three to five people in Silver Moon province could defeat him.

Those three to five people were all existences that surpassed this level.

Among them, the boss of the Silver Moon province’s night patrolman was 100% at this level. Whether there was a second night patrolman at this level was still unknown.

Would such an existence come to the Silver City to kill Li Hao?

If that was the case ... Then there would be some trouble this time!

Yuan Shuo felt the abundant inner strength in his body, as well as the extremely sharp saber energy ... Feeling a little guilty, he gritted his teeth and hardened his heart. ‘So what if it really came?’

This is the first time I’m going all out. I’ll bet that you’re not prepared to meet an old man like me here!

……

Outside the warehouse.

Li Hao was also feeling uneasy.

When he reached out and caught a drop of rain, the raindrop entered his body ... His blood began to boil slightly. Li Hao knew that trouble might be coming.

There was something wrong with the rain.

He didn’t feel anything before. He didn’t feel anything the night Xiao Yuan died, but he vaguely remembered that the rain outside was a little blue that night.

Of course, in the dark of the night, not many people would care.

Water would naturally show different colors in different environments.

Reading on Mybo xn o vel. com ,Please!

The blue Rain didn’t seem to be a problem.

However, this time, Li Hao felt something different. The rain entered his body and made his blood boil.

Li Hao thought to himself.

Was this the time and opportunity that the other party had been waiting for?

Let his bloodline be in a boiling state, then burn him to death, collect all the power of his bloodline, and unseal the starry sky sword passed down by his ancestor?

He thought to himself, but he was also a little puzzled.

Why did this rain have such an effect?

Also, is this rain only within the Silver City?

Otherwise, why wouldn’t the other party allow him to leave the Silver City?

“Is it because of their arrangements that caused the blue Rain to appear? or is it because the Silver City is different? is this rain natural?”

Li Hao looked around as he thought about this.

In the darkness, he saw it!

At this moment, Li Hao’s heart was pounding!

More than ten miles away, he saw two streams of energy that were as bright as the sun.

At this moment, he saw an even more powerful, more dazzling, and more piercing light in the distance!

“Like the sun!”

Li Hao’s face turned pale.

It was even more powerful than the two sunlit experts. Moreover, the ball of light was approaching them at an unimaginable speed.

They were coming for him!

In order to kill him, this superpower organization actually sent someone who surpassed the sunlight ... Or even the peak of the sunlight to kill him?

He was unable to determine the strength of the other party. He only knew that this person was stronger than the previous two sunlit.

Before he arrived, Li Hao felt something strange again.

In the darkness, a huge red shadow was flying towards him at full speed. It was huge!

A red shadow!

This was Li Hao’s first time seeing such a huge red shadow. It was ten times larger than the one he had killed before, and was at least 20 meters tall. Li Hao’s mouth was wide open.

It can’t be!

When Xiao Yuan died, he was at the scene. If he remembered correctly, the red shadow that killed Xiao Yuan was about the same size as the one he had killed before.

But this one ... Was too big!

He could see it from so far away.

20 meters high, that was the height of a six or seven-story building.

More importantly, no one could see it, except for Li Hao. At this moment, his heart was about to stop beating. Teacher ... Can you do it?

This was the first time he had doubts about his teacher!

He felt that his teacher ... Might really not be able to do it!

At his feet, the Black Panther was also trembling. The Black Panther, which had felt that it had become stronger, was now tucking its tail between its legs and was so scared that it could not move.

A red shadow!

Super, super big!

Previously, when Li Hao had a good time sucking, it also had a good time licking.

But now ... Oh my God, the Black Panther only had one thought in its mind,”I won’t be able to finish licking it even if I lick it for a long time!”

“Sister!”

At this moment, Li Hao was certain that Liu Long’s arrangements were useless.

The one that was about to arrive was not someone that Liu Long and the others could deal with.

Liu Yan looked at Li Hao. Li Hao’s face was a little pale, but he still smiled.”Retreat! “The danger is almost resolved, and the powerhouses are entangled. You guys go and help the boss. There’s no use guarding here ...”

Liu Yan frowned as she looked at him.

“Really,” Li Hao said.”It’s a waste of manpower here. I’d rather go and help boss. I won’t go. I’ll wait here!”

“Li Hao!”

Liu Yan looked at him and said coldly,””If you have something to say, just say it!”

Li Hao laughed, but his smile was a little ugly. He joked as if he didn’t care,””I saw the sun falling! Sister, we’re like the light of a Firefly. Do you think we can still deal with the sun?”

Liu Yan’s expression changed.

She looked into the distance at the rumbling Thunder and Hurricane and said impatiently,””You mean that side?”

“No, it’s even stronger than that!”

Liu Yan’s breathing stopped for a moment.

She was a little distracted and a little dazed.

Even stronger than sunlight?

What kind of expert had Li Hao provoked?

Surpass sunlight?

Liu Yan couldn’t imagine it. She was only at the tenth realm, the weakest Starlight master. Above her were Dark Moon, sunlight, and many other smaller realms.

It was already difficult for them to kill a backfired Dark Moon, let alone an existence that surpassed the sun glory.

Translator: 549690339
“Let’s go!”

Li Hao smiled.”Hurry up! I’m the target, not you!” You must believe that justice is eternal. Sister, please thank the boss for me!”

“Li Hao!”

Liu Yan still wanted to say something, but she couldn ‘t.

Yunyao’s face was also ugly as she said softly,””Can you escape?”

Could he escape?

Li Hao smiled bitterly. How could that be?

The other party was getting closer and closer!

At this moment, Yuan Shuo’s figure appeared.

At this moment, Yuan Shuo’s face was covered in dust and dirt. His shoes had run off, and his face was gray and black. He was in an unsightly state.

He quickly ran over. When he saw Li Hao, he heaved a sigh of relief and revealed his white teeth, which were particularly dazzling in the rain.”Little Hao, it’s good that you’re not dead!”

Li Hao looked at him.

“Teacher ... You ...”

Wasn’t this too tragic?

This ... This act was a little too much.

Reading on Mybo xn o vel. com ,Please!

You’re an expert of the thousand-warrior level, and you’re in such a miserable state?

Thinking of this, Li Hao looked into the distance. The huge ball of light was less than ten thousand meters away from him and felt that it was getting closer.

At this speed, the other party would arrive soon.

He was a little anxious. He stepped forward and helped the teacher who seemed to be falling down. He lowered his voice and said,””He’s much stronger than the other two. He’s as dazzling as the sun in summer! Teacher ... If it doesn’t work out, let’s just accept our fate! If you don’t want to accept your fate, you can take me and run. Can you run faster?”

“Who are you underestimating?”

Yuan Shuo also lowered his voice, but he felt a little guilty.

I haven’t tested it!

As for whether it would work or not ... He actually didn’t know.

“Also, that thing in the dark ... It’s bigger than I thought,” Li Hao added.

“There’s another one?”

Even Yuan Shuo was about to gasp. F * ck!

Two?

If there was one, he could still try, but if there were two ... Could it be that there was a difference in strength?

“How big?”

“At least 20 meters high!”

F * ck!

Yuan Shuo knew how powerful it was just by thinking about it ... In the next moment, he seemed to feel it. After all, he was at the thousand warrior level. He could feel the special energy fluctuation.

It was similar to a spiritual rank existence!

This time, it was really troublesome.

Even Yuan Shuo wanted to turn around and leave. This student of his, even if he was his last disciple, F * ck you, the trouble you’ve gotten yourself into is too big.

This time, even if the boss of the night patrolmen in Silvermoon province came, he might have to give in.

You want me, an old man, to block it?

Of course, who would know if they had never tried!

If he really solved this problem, the other party would probably suffer a serious injury. If he killed this one and then sunlight, there would not be many of such existences even in the three major organizations. At that time ...

Even though he thought about it, Yuan Shuo still said in a low voice,””You can see it?”
“En!”

What was there to hide at this moment?

He could see it even more clearly than Yuan Shuo!

It was because of this that he was even more frightened.

He could still try to sneak attack Yue Ming, but he was afraid that his magical hands wouldn’t be able to break Yue Ming even if he tried to grab him!

And that red shadow, it was so big. Was he standing under its feet and scratching its toenails?

Yuan Shuo took a deep breath and seemed to have made a decision. He looked at the people behind him and suddenly said,””Get out of here. I’m going to die with Li Hao. I don’t have long to live anyway. Get out of here. I’ll die with my students!”

These few burdens should leave as soon as possible!

As for Li Hao, if he left, there would be no more fun.

“Elder Yuan ...”

“Get lost!”

Yuan Shuo’s tone was unfriendly. Why aren’t you getting lost? are you staying here to wait for death?

As for Li Hao, Yuan Shuo glanced around and saw the cargo container blocking the door. He seemed to have noticed ice crystals and said in a low voice,””You can stay here and defend yourself against some superpowers ... Otherwise, you’ll die if you’re not careful! “Of course, I’ll go in as well. We’ll go in together. If that guy wants to devour your bloodline or something, he won’t kill you so easily. In his eyes, you’re less than an ant and too easy to kill ... As long as he suppresses his mysterious energy, we still have a chance!”

Understood!

Li Hao nodded. I can act.

Even you, teacher ... Don’t worry, teacher is better at acting than him.

This time, let’s see if we can act well!

If he was lucky, his teacher might be able to finish off his opponent.

However, it was a one-on-two battle. If that big red shadow also attacked his teacher ... Then it would be troublesome.

“Teacher, do you think that if I stab that thing into my heart, it can really unseal me?”

Li Hao thought of the Jade sword. The Jade sword had never been unsealed, and the red shadow that had escaped before had appeared. What if it was unsealed?

Could he hack the red shadow to death?

If he could kill the red shadow, his teacher would be more confident in dealing with the Super.

Yuan Shuo considered for a moment and said,””There’s hope, but it’s not a hundred percent ...”He said.

At this point, his eyes flickered as he looked at Li Hao.

He seemed to be asking if they had arrived.

He couldn’t see the red shadow, but he could sense it.

Li Hao, on the other hand, nodded stiffly with a pale face. At this moment, a red figure that looked like a skyscraper landed about a hundred meters in front of him.

It was extremely huge!

Yuan Shuo also smiled stiffly. It was really ... F * cking speechless.

This is the first time I’m going all out. I won’t fail, right?

“Get lost!”

Yuan Shuo shouted again. Liu Yan and the others didn’t say anything at this moment, for they had also seen the change in Li Hao’s expression.

Even after killing Yue Ming, Li Hao had never been so pale.

Liu Yan gritted her teeth and dragged Wu Chao away.

The Black Panther also wanted to sneak away, but when it saw that Li Hao had suddenly stopped moving, its eyes were filled with fear, but at the same time, it also had a little anticipation.

Chapter 164: Master and disciple hurt, parting (6)
Translator: 549690339
Who knows?

Maybe I can stab that incomparably tall red shadow to death. At that time ... How many benefits can I get?

I’m not leaving!

Liu Yan and the others quickly retreated.

They had gone to intercept Liu Long so that he wouldn’t run into them head-on. That would be a big problem.

Meanwhile, Li Hao and Yuan Shuo had entered the container.

Yuan Shuo was holding a large knife in his hand. He didn’t seem to have seen or felt anything. At this moment, he sighed and said,””Li Hao, this old man can’t take it anymore. After this, I’m probably completely finished! You still have a chance ... That RI Yao might not be Huang Yun’s match ... The night patrolmen are still very strong, and Liu Long is still alive. As long as we deal with those guys, you’ll be safe!”

“After you’re safe, live well ... Don’t stay in the Silver City!”

Yuan Shuo looked like he was on the verge of death as he warned his student.

Li Hao, on the other hand, looked sorrowful.”Teacher ... You’ll be fine. I know that supers can heal injuries. I’ll use the mysterious energy to treat you. I believe you’ll be fine!”

“Children ... Always think too much!”

“Cough, cough, cough ...”

Yuan Shuo coughed again, blood flowing out from the corner of his mouth. He sighed,””In my life, the most regretful thing is that I didn’t manage to become a warrior of thousands, become a super, and sweep the world ... Otherwise, how could a mere Dayao be my opponent?”

At this moment, he panted and looked uncomfortable. He grabbed Li Hao’s arm and panted heavily.””The breathing technique of five birds that I taught you ... You must remember it well! This is the foundation ... I’ve compiled it using countless ancient civilization books ...”

At this moment, a figure silently landed on top of the red figure’s head outside the container.

Reading on Mybo xn o vel. com ,Please!

The sound from the cargo container entered his ears.

The breathing technique of five birds!

At this moment, even the powerhouses who surpassed the sunlit division stopped in their tracks. They had planned to capture Li Hao and burn him to death, but now, he had restrained his mysterious energy and remained still.

Yuan Shuo’s five birds breathing technique!

There were countless people watching him, but the old fellow had never revealed anything. Yuan Shuo was going to die tonight, and so was his student. If the breathing technique of five birds were to be lost ... It would most likely disappear completely!

“Perhaps ... We can kill Li Hao and capture Yuan Shuo?”

At this moment, such a thought appeared in the mind of the figure above the red figure.

Treasures moved people’s hearts. Ordinary treasures could no longer move him, but ... The breathing technique of five birds could!

What they were most concerned about was not Yuan Shuo’s Martial Master cultivation. Martial masters had declined, but what they were most concerned about were the countless ancient civilization books in his mind. This old man had also destroyed countless books!

In order to protect himself, Yuan Shuo had destroyed countless ancient civilization classics, all of which were stored in his own head!

His figure floated silently and instantly appeared outside the cargo box.

Yuan Shuo and Li Hao were completely clueless!

Yuan Shuo was still leaving his last words, while Li Hao was in so much pain that he lowered his head and was on the verge of tears.

“Teacher, I’ll treat the breathing technique of five birds well!”

Yuan Shuo coughed up blood.”Hmm, that’s good. Not only that ... I still have many treasures that I’ll leave for you ... There are also some ruins of ancient civilizations. Even if others don’t know, I’ll tell you ... Don’t tell anyone! That’s the foundation of your rise. Once you get it, it won’t be difficult for you to become above the solar brilliance realm ... The ancient civilization is stronger than you can imagine!”

“Teacher, don’t say anymore!”

Li Hao was in great pain. Stop talking. Besides, the other party couldn’t help but come in to capture you!

“I’m ... I’m fine ... I’m at the peak of the 100-plus cultivation realm. I can still hold on for a while ...”

As the master and disciple were talking to each other, Yuan Shuo suddenly lowered his voice,””Come closer, I’m afraid someone might hear you ...”

Li Hao moved his ear closer.

Outside the container, the figure glanced at Yuan Shuo. He could only see his mouth moving, but there was no sound.

The mysterious energy couldn’t penetrate it either, because it was made of ice crystal.

After a moment of consideration, the huge red shadow was suddenly compressed to the size of a normal person by him. The next moment, the red shadow directly passed through the ice crystal cover and entered the cargo box.

It was not good for him to eavesdrop, and it was the same for the red shadow to eavesdrop.

Kill after you hear it!

It would also prevent him from forcing Yuan Shuo to tell him. If that were the case, he might not be able to obtain the secret.

At this moment, Li Hao’s eyes were red as he nodded.

Yuan Shuo revealed a satisfied smile. He understood now. The red shadow had entered!

But you ... Can you hold on?

Forget it, I don’t have to kill you now.

Everything is under my control, all supers are fools, how can my secret be so easily known by you?

At this moment, the master and disciple both revealed a mournful expression!

“Teacher ... Take care!”

“Little Hao, protect yourself well ...”

The master and disciple were crying!

Outside the container, the figure was a little impatient.”If you want to die, then die quickly. Tell me the secret!”

At this moment, in order not to attract Yuan Shuo’s attention, he suppressed his mysterious energy to the lowest level. He was afraid that Yuan Shuo would sense it. His original plan to strike like a Thunderbolt and wipe out all his enemies was completely extinguished at this moment.

Hurry up and tell me, I’m getting impatient!

Chapter 165: Old demon Yuan’s revival_ 1
The top-notch experts outside were getting impatient.

The master and disciple parted in life and death, making it seem as if Yuan Shuo was going to die in the next second.

Just as he was controlling the red shadow, trying to listen carefully to what the two were talking about, whether there were any traces of ancient ruins or secret techniques such as the breathing technique of five birds ...

He leaned his body slightly and listened carefully, even if he couldn’t hear anything.

And at this moment.

Inside the container.

Yuan Shuo held a large saber in his hand and coughed non-stop.”Little Hao ... Re ... Recite the breathing technique of five birds again. I’m afraid you’ll forget ...”

Li Hao lowered his head and said in a low voice,””The human body has 38000 apertures. One aperture is for breathing, and one aperture is for exhaling. The technique of the five birds exhales by gathering the essence of the five birds. Flying, burrowing, running, agility, strength ...”

He was reciting.


The eyes of the person outside flickered, and he was a little excited.

I’m the only one who can use Yuan Shuo’s breathing technique from today on.

Just as he was about to hear more, Yuan Shuo made his move.

The opportunity had come!

Without a sound, Yuan Shuo wielded his saber as his blood Qi burst forth, forming a blood Qi Dragon that shot into the void!

He didn’t hold back at all and went all out. In front of such an expert, holding back was courting death.

Reading on Mybo xn o v el. com ,Please!

The divine decree erupted!

Like a furnace, he shattered all the ice crystals with one strike!

These ice crystals instantly turned into a cage. Under the control of the divine decree, it enveloped the powerhouses outside.

This was combat experience!

At this moment, Yuan Shuo had shattered the ice crystal, effectively hindering his opponent’s counterattack. Even if he could not completely suppress his opponent’s mysterious energy, in a battle between powerhouses, a slight moment of suppression was enough to change the outcome of the battle and determine life and death.

The blood-red qi and blood Dragon instantly evaporated the surrounding rain!

One slash!

BOOM!

A deafening sound rang out, and Saber Light illuminated the heavens and earth!

At this moment, the top-notch expert was revealed to the two of them. He was a middle-aged man who did not cover his face. His eyes were arrogant, and he had long hair. He looked even younger than Liu Long.

At this moment, the other party was indeed a top-notch expert.

Even though he was blinded by greed, he still reacted immediately.

When Yuan Shuo’s blade came, the other party did not surrender. Instead, he roared and raised his hands up into the sky. A transparent shield appeared on his hands.

The shield instantly burst out with a brilliant light.

It was an existence that surpassed the level of the sun glory!

Sunlight was the peak of what ordinary people knew, and the other party had surpassed this level. In any organization, he would be a giant.

A shield appeared in his hands. The next moment, the other party roared again and stomped his foot. The ground cracked and shook in all directions!

This chapter is updated by .

“You’re looking for death!”

BOOM!

A deafening sound reverberated through the sky. The expert roared in anger, but his shield was broken by Yuan Shuo’s saber. Blood flowed out of his mouth, but he was still unyielding. He stomped on the ground, cracking it, and his body sank into it.

This way, the ice crystals “obstruction to him would be reduced to the minimum.

Not only that, the moment the shield shattered, a golden long sword appeared in the opponent’s hand. It was a long sword made of extremely sharp mysterious energy.

“Yuan Shuo!”

The man shouted and thrust his sword at Yuan Shuo. The best defense was to counterattack. He couldn’t let Yuan Shuo, a martial artist, break through his defense easily and come to his side.

Thousand combat!

He could feel that Yuan Shuo had advanced to the universe realm!

“Roar!”

At this moment, Yuan Shuo also let out a roar, like a ferocious Tiger descending from the mountain and roaring at the forest!

The sound wave struck, and the surrounding raindrops were instantly jolted out, turning into water arrows that shot out in all directions.

Behind them, even though Li Hao wasn’t their target, he was still bleeding from all his orifices.

The red shadow once again stood in front of Li Hao, becoming his protective umbrella ... At this moment, the top-tier expert didn’t think that he would lose. Since he wouldn’t lose, Li Hao couldn’t die now.

If he died, the plan to gather the eight branches would no longer be complete.

“You’re courting death!” Yuan Shuo roared. His roar shook the surroundings, causing the mysterious energy to fluctuate.

Yuan Shuo’s hair instantly turned black, and his face regained its youth.

In an instant, the long saber slashed out countless shadows.

“Martial arts can connect with the gods!”

With a loud roar, his qi and blood transformed into a long Dragon, and the air around him burned like a furnace. The surrounding air seemed to have been set on fire. At this moment, the long-haired expert could feel an extremely hot flame burning.

It wasn’t flames, but qi and blood!

This was a top-notch Martial Master!

The fusion of the divine intent and qi and blood was like a furnace of heaven and earth.

“Kill!”

Yuan Shuo stomped on the ground and rose up, slashing out countless blades. The long blade shattered, but he held the hilt and no longer used the blade. Instead, he swung his fist and struck out, his fist quelling the mountains and rivers!

BOOM!

After a series of attacks, Yuan Shuo was unbelievably strong.

This top-notch existence that surpassed sunlight had no time to fight back. He was forced to retreat by Yuan Shuo’s dozens of punches.

With a loud bang, the figure was sent flying.

Blood splattered through the air!

The long-haired expert was sent flying, and a clear fist mark appeared on his chest.

Yuan Shuo was unforgiving!

He took a step in the air and kicked out, causing the void to explode!

At this moment, the battle between the two of them had only just begun, but it had already surpassed the battle between the two sunlit realm cultivators in the distance. The rain had stopped, and the sky had turned white, illuminating the surroundings.

“Yuan Shuo!”

“Die!” The long-haired powerhouse shouted coldly. Mysterious energy surged out, and all the metal objects in the surroundings began to move. In an instant, the metal turned into tens of thousands of swords and attacked Yuan Shuo!

Chapter 166: Old demon Yuan’s resurrection (2)
It was too fast. The two sides had only fought for a moment, but they had already exchanged many blows.

At this moment, Yuan Shuo was like a brown bear. He stomped on the ground, causing the earth to shake. With a loud boom, the ground collapsed, leaving behind a trail of destruction. He stomped on the ground and punched out!

The countless metal swords that flew over were all shattered.

“So what if he’s a super?”

Yuan Shuo was like a god. He kicked out again, sweeping through the void and shattering the metal swords that were attacking him.

BOOM!

The two of them closed in again at an unbelievable speed. Li Hao couldn’t understand it at all, or even see it.

……

He only knew that his teacher had the upper hand.


The long-haired expert spat out blood and was sent flying. He had probably suffered a loss, but he didn’t know how much he had suffered.

……

At this moment.

In the distance, the battle at the radiant sun realm suddenly stopped.

Huang Yun was in a state of shock. His entire body felt as if it had been burnt to a crisp. At this moment, he was not in the mood to care about himself. Instead, he was looking into the distance in shock.

Yuan Shuo!

Reading on Mybo xn o v el. com ,Please!

The other person ...

Huang Yun looked at the person in front of him with shock and anger,””So it’s you guys! That’s Divine Master Duan Tian?”

God tier master!

It was not a state, but a title for the priest blessed by the heavens. It meant that the moment their powers were awakened, they were already supers. They were born supers, and there was no need for them to become supers.

Supers like that were usually top-tier.

It was said that Divine Master Duan Tian had become a super the moment the superpowers were resurrected. It had been 20 years since then, and he was one of the oldest and most powerful super.

It had surpassed sunlight!

On the other side, the Thunder powerhouse’s expression also changed slightly. He said coldly,””I didn’t expect Yuan Shuo to advance to the warrior tide ... No wonder you dared to interfere. You’re really bold!”

Master douqian!

This was almost impossible to see in Silver Moon province. Yuan Shuo might be the only warrior Qian master in Silver Moon province in recent years.

Of course, even though Dou Qian was terrifying, his opponent was God master Duan Tian!

Huang Yun gritted his teeth and did not say anything.

It was unexpected that Yuan Shuo had become a warrior Qian master.

However, he did not expect Yuan Shuo to be so bold and so unlucky. The first time he attacked with all his might, he actually encountered Divine Master Duan Tian.

This is troublesome!

Of course, Yuan Shuo had the upper hand. He had witnessed the series of powerful attacks that had caused the God tier master to cough up blood. However ... If he couldn’t severely injure the God tier master in a single strike, all of his advantages would be for naught!

……

“F * ck!”

At this moment, Liu Long was also extremely shocked.

This chapter is updated by .

“Qian Dou!”

His eyes were filled with shock, desire, and disbelief.

Yuan Shuo had advanced to the battle Qian realm!

Just a moment ago, when Liu Yan and the others arrived, the demon-hunting team gathered and worked together with three night patrollers, and they barely managed to stop the four supers.

However, just as they started fighting, an incredible battle broke out.

Yuan Shuo!

There was also a top-notch powerhouse who had surpassed the sunlight.

The small silver City actually had a battle above the sunbeams tonight.

Liu Long was still in shock as he suddenly roared,”Kill!”

He had to think of a way to kill the few people before him. Yuan Shuo ... He probably wouldn’t be able to stop an utmost powerful being like that.

Douqian was only comparable to sunlight.

……

In the air.

Once again, Yuan Shuo stomped on the ground and stepped into the air. He was extremely crazy, and he didn’t have the slow reaction of an old man at all. He waved his fists and punched again and again. There was even a small stone in his right fist, and he punched out again and again like a tiger.

At first, the long-haired expert didn’t pay much attention to the brass knuckles ...

But soon, when he was punched by the brass knuckles, the mysterious energy defense on his chest was directly pierced through by the brass knuckles. Yuan Shuo took the opportunity to smash his internal organs, and the long-haired expert was shocked.

What was this?

Extraordinary item?

It was actually able to break through his defense and injure his internal organs.

Moreover, a powerful surge of mysterious energy gushed into his body and broke through his defense.

As for Yuan Shuo, he continued to attack.

Since the Martial Master had the upper hand, he had to keep attacking until the other party was killed or completely lost the ability to fight.

Li Hao had learned from him.

Yuan Shuo had once said,”only when the enemy no longer stands up and falls down completely, unable to resist, will it be your victory!”

……

Li Hao seemed to be dumbfounded.

He looked into the distance with a stupefied expression. The two top-notch experts were fighting so hard that the ground was cracking. He was somewhat shocked. Was this something that could be done by human strength?

Was this a thousand-man battle?

This was the true battle of thousands!

That’s right. In his opinion, although douqian was strong, it was still a mortal body with limited destructive power. It might not be as destructive as some powerful hand grenades ... The facts proved that his vision was too low.

Yuan Shuo stomped on the ground, causing the earth to crack.

His qi and blood burned like a real furnace, evaporating all the rain in the sky and turning the place into a land without rain.

How could a frag grenade compare to this?

Even some cannons might not be as destructive as his moves, not to mention that he was a human, and an extremely agile one at that.

No wonder the Army’s restraint on supers was getting weaker and weaker!

The existence at Yue Ming’s level made Li Hao feel that as long as there were a dozen or twenty people with powerful experts, it wouldn’t be a problem to kill one or more than a Hundred Yue Ming.

However, Li Hao knew that even if there were a thousand of them armed with guns, they would not be able to do anything to them unless they were stupid and decided to fight them head-on.

On the contrary, as long as the other party was careful and found an opportunity to break through one by one, even a thousand-man army would be defeated!

Chapter 167: Old demon Yuan’s recovery_ 3
“Terrifying!”

Li Hao muttered to himself. At this moment, he looked at the red shadow in front of him.

The red shadow actually helped him block the aftermath of the attack ... Great!

This red shadow was also very powerful.

It had actually blocked the aftershock of the battle between two top-notch experts.

Li Hao touched the small sword in his hand and smiled bitterly. The small sword had not been unsealed, so it could injure the red shadow and even force it to reveal itself, but this ... Probably wouldn’t work, right?

The small sword’s damage was limited, so he probably couldn ‘t.

On the other hand, the teachers were very powerful!

He had been attacking aggressively and had the upper hand, but Li Hao knew that his teacher was probably weaker than his opponent. Otherwise, he would have injured his opponent first with a sneak attack. If his opponent was on par with him, he would have taken him down long ago!


In a battle between true powerhouses, unless they were evenly matched, the battle would usually end very quickly.

At this moment, Li Hao saw the red shadow move. It seemed to be leaving.

Yes, the red shadow seemed to be preparing to join the battle, not protecting Li Hao.

With the help of the red shadow, the long-haired expert would probably make things difficult for his teacher.

It was obvious that the fellow had already sobered up and knew that he had to get rid of Yuan Shuo as soon as possible.

“Let’s go ...”

Reading on Mybo xn o v el. com ,Please!

If the red shadow left, that would be a big problem.

Li Hao was afraid of death, of pain, and of stabbing himself to death.

However, at this moment, he didn’t hesitate at all. The Jade sword in his hand pierced into his heart with a pfft!

Blood from the heart!

His teacher said that it might be able to help the small sword unseal, but as for whether it would work or not ... Wouldn’t he know after trying?

Intense pain came!

Li Hao felt that he might have stabbed too deep and might have punctured his heart. Would he die?

I don’t know!

Who cares!

However, he had to make this red shadow stay. No matter what, he couldn’t let the red shadow participate in the battle.

Could the small sword do this after it was unsealed?

Who knows!

Bet!

It was a gamble. Yuan Shuo was betting that he could deal with that person, and Liu Long was betting that he could deal with supers.

At this moment, Li Hao was also taking a gamble.

He was betting that this ancestral sword could unseal and deal with the red shadow!

“Kill!”

Pulling out the small sword, Li Hao slashed at the red shadow. Under normal circumstances, he couldn’t touch the red shadow.

So the red shadow didn’t care about him at all.

However, when the small sword was pulled out of Li Hao’s chest, it emitted a faint radiance and stabbed into the depths of the red shadow!

“Ah!”

Li Hao vaguely heard the scream of the red shadow. Was the red shadow alive?

He didn’t know!

He only knew that he had to kill this thing. So, in the next moment, Li Hao drew his sword and stabbed again!

At this moment, the red shadow moved. As if Li Hao’s stabbing had driven it mad, it was no longer under the control of the long-haired expert. The red shadow turned into smoke and rushed into Li Hao’s chest.

A flame-like energy instantly exploded in Li Hao’s body!

It was extremely powerful!

At this moment, Li Hao roared and activated the five birds breathing technique. Starlight energy surged. He knew that the red shadow was going to burn him like it did to Xiao Yuan.

But ... I have the starry sky sword!

When the power of fire exploded in his body, Li Hao felt like he had seen a different world.

In that instant, Li Hao knew what Xiao Yuan had seen.

He also knew why little Yuan wanted him to escape and why he knew that he would be the next person the other party wanted to kill.

At this moment, Li Hao saw a different world.

His line of sight could penetrate all matter!

In the sky above the Silver City, there seemed to be a huge Eight Trigrams floating in the air!

This gossip covered the entire Silver City.

As for the eight trigrams, the eight corners corresponded to eight directions. Each direction seemed to have a line that connected to a certain place. One of the lines was directly connected to Li Hao, while the other seven lines ... Were not in the Silver City!

They were all in the same direction!

It was as if someone had forcefully pulled away the other seven threads.

At this moment, Li Hao understood.

What little Yuan had seen that day should have been the same scene. Of the eight lines, one of them was for little Yuan, while the other was for Li Hao.

Little Yuan might not be smart, but after seeing this scene, he should have understood that the next person the other party wanted to kill was Li Hao, who was connected to the eight-trigram line.

“So ... This is what you saw?”

Such a thought emerged in Li Hao’s mind. At this moment, he no longer thought about anything else. He operated the five birds breathing technique crazily and absorbed a large amount of Starlight.

The Starlight energy and the red shadow’s energy exploded in his body at the same time!

His internal organs were shaking and shattering. Soon, the red shadow energy shattered his meridians, but the Starlight energy quickly repaired them and extinguished the power of the red shadow.

……

In the distance.

The long-haired expert’s expression changed slightly.

He had been suppressed by Yuan Shuo’s strong attacks.

He had originally planned to call back the red shadow to assist him in killing Yuan Shuo. As long as Yuan Shuo was restrained by the red shadow for a moment, he would be able to catch his breath and recover his true combat strength before killing Yuan Shuo.

But ... The summoning failed!

The red shadow did not return.

Damn it!

What was happening?

He didn’t have the time to watch. Yuan Shuo’s attack was extremely overbearing.

This warrior Qian’s inner strength was not as strong as a warrior Qian ‘s. It was full of extreme destructive power, which was not something an ordinary warrior Qian could have. In terms of level, this destructive power had already surpassed the inner strength by a lot.

At this moment, Yuan Shuo let out a violent roar as chains suddenly appeared on his body.

Chapter 168: The resurrection of old demon Yuan
He wanted to break the superpower lock, advance to a superpower, and kill the strong enemy in front of him.

BOOM!

A superpower lock exploded. Yuan Shuo, who was more powerful, punched out, changing the color of the sun and moon!

His qi and blood were like a huge Dragon, surrounding the long-haired expert.

As for the long-haired expert, his body burst out with a dazzling golden light. He was filled with killing intent, and the qi and blood Dragon was constantly shattered.

The eyes of the two were also red from the killing. At this time, they didn’t care about the method of mutual destruction.

After breaking a lock, Yuan Shuo seemed to have become even stronger.

However, in the next moment, Yuan Shuo’s expression changed slightly. Suddenly, he gritted his teeth and let out a violent roar. The mysterious energy that had just been born in his body was blasted out by him with a violent roar and exploded!

The powerful mysterious energy exploded outside his body, causing the long-haired middle-aged man to spit out blood again!


“Are you crazy?”

The long-haired powerhouse was shocked. Yuan Shuo had just given birth to a mysterious source, which meant that he had hope of becoming a super quickly.

However, in the next second, Yuan Shuo actually exploded the mysterious source. This was the source of the mysterious energy. The destruction of this meant that Yuan Shuo had given up the chance to become a super.

If he wasn’t a lunatic, what was he?

Yuan Shuo’s face was pale, but a smile appeared on his face as he looked at the other party. However, his smile quickly turned cold.”How can a Sparrow know the ambitions of a Swan?”

That mysterious source was actually eroding his inner strength.

Reading on Mybo xn o v el. com ,Please!

One had to know that the foundation of a Martial Master was inner strength.

Once his inner strength was corroded, it was not from an external source but refined from his body, blood, and five viscera. This meant that his body would be severely injured if his inner strength was corroded.

Although the mysterious energy could make up for it ... It was only an external object.

At that moment, Yuan Shuo realized that there might be a problem with his advancement to the superpower realm, which could turn his many years of hard work into dust.

Of course, he was also extremely decisive.

He didn’t lose anything from this mysterious source.

At the very least, he had managed to severely injure the other party again.

“I’ll Still Kill you even without the mysterious energy!”

Yuan Shuo roared and instantly transformed into a giant bear. He did not really turn into a bear, but from his aura, he really did look like a brown bear.

He held the stone saber ... Yuan Shuo had also noticed that the stone saber’s ability to break through defenses was extremely powerful.

To be able to suppress this guy all the time, this saber skill was indispensable.

Even though he hadn’t fully developed the saber and hadn’t even unsealed it, the saber energy within it was enough to be his greatest trump card to break through this top-tier powerhouse’s mysterious energy defense.

BOOM!

The bear-like Yuan Shuo stomped on the ground once more, cracking it as he rose into the air and began killing the long-haired expert.

From the beginning to the end, he had been attacking!

Saber energy surged out in waves!

Bang! Bang!

The long-haired expert was sent flying once again. He was actually completely suppressed. From the start until now, Yuan Shuo had not given him any time to adjust or counterattack.

This old Martial Master Dou Qian was too good at seizing the opportunity and giving him all the fatal attacks.

Although he was stronger than Yuan Shuo in terms of vitality, mystic energy, and defense, all of this was like bubbles when he was unable to attack Yuan Shuo.

“Yuan Shuo ...” He said.

“Yuan Shuo, we can ...” He roared again.

BOOM!

Yuan Shuo’s huge kick exploded the air. His foot carried saber energy and was extremely destructive. With a kick, even a small hill behind the long-haired powerhouse was instantly crushed into pieces.

“Kill!”

“Blood Dragon!” Yuan Shuo roared again. A Dragon of blood and Qi floated above his head.

The Dragon was boiling in an instant!

Not enough!

With his strength, even with the addition of saber energy, he had the upper hand in sneak attacks. However, he had not been able to kill this guy. What did this mean?

It meant that he, Yuan Shuo, was not strong enough to deal a fatal blow to the other party!

Yuan Shuo was not convinced!

Countless ancient books appeared in his mind, and the next moment, an ancient book was fixed in his mind!

[Blood Blade technique]!

This was an ancient book that combined Qi, blood, and mentality to form a blood saber that dealt a fatal blow. According to the ancient books, some martial masters in the ancient civilization used this as a last-ditch attack!

It was extremely lethal!

Of course, the side effects were huge.

‘Bloodblade technique’ fused Qi, blood, and divine intent into one. It could unleash a destructive power that exceeded one’s realm. The price was that one’s body would rapidly weaken, and it could even be crippled to death!

The ancient books also recorded that in the ancient civilization, some old martial masters would specially cultivate this technique to fight against strong enemies. At the critical moment, they would risk their lives to kill, and it often had miraculous effects. However, it was later banned because most martial masters died after using it.

However, Yuan Shuo still cared about this at this time?

Moreover, didn’t his student have a sword?

Can’t you still save people?

Who said I would die?

It wasn’t like he would definitely die if he used it!

It was also recorded in the ancient records that there was a solution to this cultivation technique, but the solution ... Yuan Shuo found it a pity that he didn’t get to see it.

“Melt!”

Heaven and earth were like a furnace, divine intent erupted, momentum!

At this moment, Yuan Shuo’s momentum was unstoppable. In an instant, he transformed into a demonic existence. The Dragon of qi and blood above his head merged into his body, and in the blink of an eye, Yuan Shuo had refined a blood saber!

The blood-red long saber instantly burrowed into the stone saber.

The small stone blade in his hand had actually grown bigger this time. Yuan Shuo held the stone blade and slashed out. This slash turned the sky blood red!

“Superpowers are nothing!”

Yuan Shuo roared.

On the other side, the long-haired powerhouse’s expression also changed greatly. With a roar, the mysterious energy exploded. At this moment, it was really like the sun shining on the earth. Not to mention the entire Silver City, at least the entire suburbs were turned into light.

Chapter 169: Old demon Yuan’s resurrection
It was like daytime!

“Yuan Shuo, you forced me to do this ...”

“Force your mother!”

Yuan Shuo did not wait for him to finish his sentence and had already slashed out!

With a loud boom, the mysterious energy gathered by the long-haired powerhouse was directly shattered by this blade. Not only that, this blade didn’t stop and continued to fall towards the long-haired middle-aged man!

The other party’s face was ashen, and his eyes were filled with disbelief!

How was that possible?

He had gathered all his mysterious energy, but it was actually shattered by a single blade ...

“The Zhang family’s saber!”


At this moment, he thought of something.

With disbelief, Yuan Shuo ... How could he possibly use the Zhang family’s saber? this was impossible!

Even if Yuan Shuo were to obtain the Zhang clan’s saber, he wouldn’t be able to use it.

The Zhang family’s saber was not the only one who could use it. The other families ‘weapons could only be used by their own bloodlines. Even if the organization took away the weapons of those families, they were in fact empty frames and could only be used for a short while. There was no hope of truly using these weapons unless all eight families were gathered and Li Hao’s bloodline was used to activate the starry sky sword and break the seal of the Eight Families.

However ... Yuan Shuo didn’t possess the bloodline of the eight great families!

Not to mention the Zhang family’s bloodline, how could he use the Zhang family’s saber’s ability?

Reading on Mybo xn o v el. com ,Please!

No one could give him an answer.

At this moment, the blade was faster than he had imagined. It fell in an instant and split the other party in half.

In midair, Yuan Shuo landed on the ground and spat out a mouthful of blood.

This time, it was real.

He felt weak all over!

He didn’t say a word. He waved his saber again and instantly cut the other party’s body into thousands of pieces!

If he didn’t die even after this, he would really be convinced.

Without looking back, he soared into the sky like a bird, ignoring Li Hao.

He covered a thousand meters with a single step, and his speed was unbelievably fast.

Yuan Shuo had also exhausted all his energy. Taking advantage of the fact that the effects of the bloody blade technique had not completely disappeared, he quickly rushed towards the radiant sun battlefield.

Since he had already made his move ... He would kill them all!

On the way, he casually slashed the sky!

Puchi!

Four heads fell off almost at the same time.

Liu Long and the others looked at him as if they were looking at a demonic god. They looked up at him in awe, disbelief, fear, surprise, happiness, and fear.

Yuan Shuo!

A man like a devil!

As for Yuan Shuo, he didn’t care what they thought. At this moment, that Thunder powerhouse was about to escape. Yuan Shuo’s voice was like a great Bell,””Huang Yun, stop him. Otherwise ... I’ll kill you too!”

This chapter is updated by .

BOOM!

Hurricane explosion!

Huang Yun’s heart was pounding. Won?

Yuan Shuo’s blade had cut a heavenly god tier master into two!

God, Silver City ... No, Silver Moon province was going to change. A top master who surpassed sunlit died here, and the person who killed him was a Martial Master!

“Wind, come!”

With an angry roar, the wind mixed with the rain and collided with the Thunder.

Yuan Shuo was here to kill!

He had to stop this person!

This time, the Thunder powerhouse revealed his true appearance. He was a young man. His face was pale as he growled,””Huang Yun, you dare to stop me! If you stop me, the red moon will not let the night patrollers go! The difference between the night patrollers and the three major organizations is obvious. Do you want the red moon to start a war with you?”

Huang Yun suddenly laughed,”kid, the three major organizations are strong and the night patrollers are weak, but ... If the three major organizations dare to come here, then don’t even think about going back alive! It’s only not as good as you guys in the wilderness. If you really dare to attack ... Do you really think our Army is weak?”

In the wilderness ... He really couldn’t win.

This was a fact that couldn’t be refuted.

However, would the three major organizations dare to attack the city at a critical moment?

At most, they would be finished together!

Both sides were restricting each other!

“B * stard ... Let me go ... Huang Yun, let me go. The Crimson Moon will provide you with 3000 ... No, 10000 cubic meters of mysterious energy!”

Huang Yun’s heart was moved at first, but he didn’t say a word and continued to attack madly!

Don’t mess around!

The guy behind him was here, Yuan Shuo!

This ruthless man from 20 years ago had actually stepped into the thousand warrior realm today ... No, he might have even surpassed the thousand warrior realm. Just the thought of it was terrifying.

I don’t dare let you go!

Otherwise, this guy would really dare to kill me.

The night patrolman had suffered a lot working with him over the years. Now that the other party had surpassed a hundred, he did not dare to provoke this former Big Shot!

At this moment, Yuan Shuo had arrived!

He was like a demonic god!

The saber slashed across the air, and the blood-red Saber Light reflected the void. With a slash, the Thunder shadow was shattered!

“Yuan Shuo!” The thunderous man roared. Let me go, kill me, you will definitely die, my father is ...”

“Ying Hongyue?”

Yuan Shuo laughed coldly,”kid, you’re too inexperienced!” I know your father, the leader of the Crimson Moon! Twenty years ago, he was also a Martial Master with over a hundred martial masters, and I once beat him to the point where he knelt and begged for mercy with one punch! All these years, I have been avoiding him. Otherwise, I would have left Silver Moon province! The two of us have a deep hatred! You look like you’re carved out of the same mold as that bastard. I didn’t expect his son to come here in person!”

Huang Yun’s expression changed!

Ying Hongyue’s son?

As for Yuan Shuo, he swung his blade again and split open the other party’s head. He had a smile on his face.”Idiot! Your father wanted to kill me and has been watching me for decades. I’m still alive, aren’t I? What can he do ... If I kill you? Let’s kill the night patrollers first!”

“……”

Huang Yun was speechless.

What are you saying ... Although there was enmity between the two of you before, it was only old enmity. Good fellow, you ... Now that you’ve killed his son, aren’t you making a deadly enemy?

Yuan Shuo didn’t even turn his head back and flew away like a bird. His voice came from afar,””All the spoils of war are mine! I’m going to visit my students, and I’ll send everything I have to the yuan family of the ancient academy. Unless ... You want to take a stab from me as well!”

Chapter 170: Old demon Yuan’s recovery (6)
Huang Yun’s expression changed.

He did not say anything.

What a terrifying fellow!

When a martial artist reached this stage, it was too terrifying.

“You ... What realm are you in?” he couldn’t help but ask.

A warrior of thousands?

Could Dou Qian kill Divine Master Duan Tian?

He had just killed Ying Hongyue’s son as if he was cutting vegetables. This was too terrifying.

“He’s only at the peak of the Dou Qian class!”


Yuan Shuo’s words came from afar and shocked everyone.

The peak of the thousand warrior class!

……

The next moment, Yuan Shuo returned to the warehouse, which was already broken.

He glanced at Li Hao, who was still bleeding, grabbed Li Hao, and instantly fled into the darkness. His face was somewhat flushed, and the next moment, he spat out a mouthful of blood, which was instantly evaporated.

“I can’t hold on any longer ... What’s wrong with you now ...”

Reading on Mybo xn o v el. com ,Please!

He could feel that Li Hao’s sword was transmitting energy. At this moment, he couldn’t take it away by force, so he could only absorb some energy to repair his broken internal organs.

He thought to himself, this time, I’ve really gone too far!

He didn’t have any peak of the Dou Qian class.

However, it wasn’t that far off.

Most importantly, his injuries were too severe. If he had left any later, he might not have been able to maintain his image as an expert. He would definitely have vomited blood.

“Cough, cough, cough ...”

He coughed continuously, and this time, he was really coughing.

This time, Yuan Shuo’s face was no longer ashen, but ghastly pale.

He grabbed Li Hao and quickly fled.

It was better to run first!

Otherwise, if someone else came, or if that idiot Huang Yun suddenly wanted to test him or kill him, he would not be able to resist.

“Let’s run and hide first ... We’ll come out when everything’s fine!”

As Yuan Shuo thought about it, he thought about the scene just now. He thought about the moment when he opened the Super Lock and his eyes were a little strange.

.

My dream of becoming a superpower is shattered.

What super Lock?

That was not the way to activate superpowers, it was the defense system to protect himself. Damn it, what exactly was superpowers?

To give up the inner strength that he had worked so hard to accumulate in order to obtain a superpower ... This was like drinking poison to quench his thirst!

It seemed powerful, but it was like a castle in the air.

There might be a problem with the superpower recovery!

“Cough, cough, cough ...”

Yuan Shuo spat out another mouthful of blood. Just as he was about to evaporate it, he suddenly realized that the blood was gone. When he looked again ... He saw that there was a dog following him, and it had swallowed the blood.

Yuan Shuo recognized this dog. It was Li Hao’s follower.

He frowned slightly and asked,’are you also going to become a spirit? After swallowing my blood and Li Hao’s blood ... Once a dog that has seen human blood becomes bloodthirsty ... It’ll be a great disaster!”

He really wanted to kill this dog!

That’s right, it was because this dog actually swallowed blood!

Just as he was about to make a move, the Black Panther suddenly spat out his blood in disgust. It looked at Yuan Shuo with a disgusted expression. This blood ... Was really disgusting!

Yuan Shuo was stunned. He looked at Heibao and suddenly laughed,””So it’s for energy ... Your nose is really sharp!”

Li Hao’s blood contained a special energy.

This dog wasn’t bloodthirsty. It was just trying to devour that energy.

“Forget it!”

This was Li Hao’s dog. He couldn’t be bothered and quickly disappeared into the darkness.

No matter what, run, run far away.

‘I’ll hide for a few days. Besides, it’s good that the dog is following me. If I can’t come out after a few days, I’ll have nothing to eat. I’ll kill the dog and eat its meat. With a moving ingredient following me, I won’t have to waste my energy. ‘

The Black Panther did not know what he was thinking. At this moment, it was following him obediently.

……

The departure of Yuan Shuo and the others caused a huge commotion.

The news was instantly spread to various places through various channels.

The blizzard Silver City battle!

Divine Master Duan Tian had died in battle, the son of Ying Hongyue, the leader of the red moon tribe, had been killed, and 10 moon nether superhumans, a group of martial masters, and over 100 martial artists had died.

And all of this was caused by Yuan Shuo!

He was the old devil who had run amuck in Silvermoon province twenty years ago!

And now, this old devil had actually advanced to the peak of the thousand warrior stage and killed Divine Master Duan Tian in adversity. At this moment, the news even began to spread from Silver Moon province to other regions.

For the first time in 20 years, a master who surpassed sunlit died in Silvermoon province.

In an instant, the entire place was in an uproar!

The heavens had really changed!
