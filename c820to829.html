s around!
 Three months ... Forget it.
 The next moment, Li Hao accepted the reinforcement mission.
 "The new twelfth Regiment, immediately rush to the battlefield, follow the command, and resist the enemy! For the human race, for heaven battling city, fight!"
 A sonorous and powerful voice, which seemed to have more emotion, sounded in Li Hao's mind.
 At this moment, a voice sounded in Hong Yitang and he Yong's minds.
 "New twelfth Regiment, attack! Kill the enemy!"
 Behind them, the two red hou seemed to know that they had accepted the mission. In the next moment, they saluted again and hammered their chests, producing a clanging sound!
 Not only that, at this moment, everywhere, including where the soldiers were, seemed to have heard the order.
 Knowing that another army was about to enter the battlefield, clanging sounds could be heard in the next moment.
  Wherever he saw, all the soldiers were bowing and sending him off.
 "He's so hot-blooded," Nanquan mumbled."It's like he's letting everyone down if he doesn't return in triumph ..."
 This feeling was so weird!
 The people outside were modern people, and they ... Were actually one of them. Could they be considered ... Traitors of the era?
 At this moment, the members of the southern Fist gang, including Li Hao, actually felt a little strange.
 Are we ... The traitors of this era?
 He had joined the Army of the ancient civilization and was now under military orders to deal with the modern human race ...
 Alright, this feeling disappeared in a flash.
 I don't care!
 However, this feeling was a little different. Li Hao said as he walked,""When I set off from the Wei Wu Army, no one else sent me off ... If I were to do the same, perhaps ... I'd be a little excited too!"
 That was the truth.
 Sometimes, some unintentional small actions could indeed be unforgettable.
 At this moment, wherever they went, the soldiers they could see saluted them. Even when they could no longer see them, the soldiers still watched them leave, as if they were sending off heroes on a campaign ... Li Hao felt very satisfied just by this.
 A moment later, the three of them arrived at the place where they had entered.
 At this moment, there was an additional red silk guard.
 When he saw the three of them, he quickly opened the railing and slammed it on his chest. If it wasn't for the fact that he couldn't speak, he might have said something loudly.
 The three of them had actually felt that feeling.
 The three of them walked out of the military camp in this strange and hot-blooded atmosphere.
 It wasn't until they walked out that Nan Quan let out a sigh of relief."I feel like if I stay in there for too long, I'll be assimilated by them. It's so scary!"
 It was a feeling of constant brainwashing and the constant transmission of thoughts.
 It was even more terrifying than what Hong Yitang had said before.
 As for Hong Yitang, he sighed and said,"this is why these soldiers are so powerful!" "We have our own way of thinking, and we're not even from this era. But after joining this Army, we've only been in it for a short while, and we already feel a sense of solemnity, responsibility, and heavy responsibility. It's not hard to imagine that after three months of military training, we'll probably feel even more ... Terrifying places!"  Li Hao didn't say anything. At this moment, he received another order and said,""Let's go. I don't know if it's an order from above, but we have an hour to get to the battlefield. If we're late, we'll be punished by military law!"
 This place was not far from the East Gate, so an hour was more than enough.
 It was obvious that they were rather lenient with their new three-man team.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, flew up quickly. At this moment, he felt very good flying without any obstruction. For a moment, he was somewhat proud.
 The two people below looked at him and didn't do anything.
 The three of them quickly rushed toward the East Gate. Hong Yitang transmitted a message from below,""Don't be too ostentatious. Your strength is about the same as a silver-tier master who hasn't awakened. However, once a silver-tier master awakens ... You're not qualified. Be careful that you'll be attacked by the powerful rays of the rising sun. Having a high silver-tier might not be a good thing!"
 After saying that, Li Hao's body changed color. The next moment, it turned black. He chuckled,"As a silver-ranked Captain, I can disguise myself. This is my privilege. What are you afraid of?"
 This was something he had seen last time.
 At this moment, he had only figured it out and put it to use. Li Hao laughed and gritted his teeth."This is great. I'll definitely kill more people from the three major organizations later! They'll have to bear the consequences!"
 This guy had finally found an opportunity to kill the enemy head-on.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The two people below didn't say anything. At this moment, they both had their own thoughts.
 Becoming the heaven battling Army of heaven battling city was actually beyond their imagination. At this moment, they didn't know how to carry out their next plan, so they could only take it one step at a time.
 They were clearly here to snatch the treasure, but now, they had become one of them.
 Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't think so much.
 There was another gold-tier warrior in the city. In addition to the one in the military camp, there were actually two gold-tier Warriors.
 This time, even if they didn't cause trouble, those people might not succeed.
 After flying for a while, Li Hao suddenly looked into the distance and was a little dazed. Was my vision blurry? did I see a Black Dog running?
 Strange!
 Black Panther?
 The Black Dog instantly reminded him of Black Panther, but ... What nonsense. Black Panther had run away long ago. If he hadn't run, he wouldn't have appeared here.
 He didn't think about it anymore. Maybe he was wrong. He couldn't see anything now ... He had to go to the East City first.
  ……
 At the same time, at the East Gate.
 The battle had temporarily come to an end. The supers retreated and left the city gates. They gathered in the square far away. The noise was endless. All of them were sad. What was going on? they came here and a battle broke out first. They didn't even get anything.
 In such a short time, 300 to 400 supers had died!
 A battle like this was rare even in the central region.
 In the midst of the commotion, the large organizations and experts frowned. This time, it was different. It wasn't like the last time. This time, the black-armored warriors seemed to be more difficult to deal with.
 They didn't split up!
 It felt like he was more intelligent than before. Was it because someone was commanding him?
 The Golden-armored warrior in the city?
 As for the hundreds of people who died, no one cared too much. They were not their people. Most of them were independent cultivators. If they died, so be it. They were not on the same side. As for themselves, of course, they would observe the situation first.

 (Happy Mid-Autumn Festival. The basic VIP has given out their monthly votes. Brothers, don't forget to vote!)
 The speed of the newly formed twelfth Regiment was not bad.
 Not long after, in less than an hour, they arrived at the East Gate.
 At this moment, a silver-armored warrior was waiting for them.
 When he saw that they had arrived, there was a loud boom. It was solemn and dignified!
 The armored warrior pounded his chest with his right hand, and a ripple appeared in Li Hao's mind."Reserve guards, 9th Division, 7th Regiment commander Jiang shixun, welcomes the brothers 'reinforcements!"
 "Your troops are not satisfied, so a new army has been formed. Combat preparations are not complete, so assist the 7th, 8th, and 9th regiments in battle!"
 "There is an order in the Army. If we die in battle, remember, the 3rd Regiment of the 9th Division will follow your orders! Similarly, the 12th Regiment's commander, Li Hao, has died in battle. We will take over your division!"
 The armored warrior announced a Military Order.
 The next moment, he looked at Li Hao with a solemn look in his empty eyes."Defend our homeland and resist the enemy! No retreat, no escape! Behind us is a Pure Land. If the city exists, we will live. If the city is broken, we will die! The military command is still there. Guard the East Gate, and do not retreat without orders from your superior. Do you understand?"
  "Understood!"
 Li Hao beat his chest. The silver-tier warrior was looking at him with hollow eyes as if he was an idiot.
 You're wrong!
 Forget it, it's just a new army. It looks like they haven't even participated in military training. Forget it, forget it. It's already rare for the new army to be willing to help. What else can I ask for?
 Just don't disrupt the battle formation!
 How many years had it been since a new member joined the 9th Division?
 It had been countless years!
 It was so long that they had forgotten how long it had been.
 After countless years of silence, he had finally recovered some of his scattered memories. This was already a rare thing for these silver-tier Warriors. With the addition of new people, he had added some new blood to the heaven battling Army. The commander of the seventh Regiment seemed to be in a good mood.
 ? "Your troops will be the mobile Force and assist the third Regiment in defending the East City. After the battle, your military merits will be doubled! The new army is a special case, cherish it!"
 "Military merits?"
 Li Hao was stunned. What military merits?
 The silver-tier warrior was already used to the idiotic questions of new recruits. He did not say much and said again,""The enemy has temporarily retreated, but they will attack again soon. There are some powerhouses among them ... It's a pity that our souls have been destroyed long ago, and we don't even have one-tenth of our strength left. You are weak, so be careful and don't act rashly!"
 He had less than 10% of his strength left ...
 Li Hao was slightly shocked.
 In that case, these silver-tier Warriors might have been even stronger back then, even stronger than when they were resurrected!
 It was so terrifying!
 This was only the regimental commander. There was still a division commander, a division commander, a regimental commander, and a regimental commander. Above the regimental commander was the Supreme Commander of the heaven battling Army ...
 One could tell just by looking at their tokens.
 This was only the reserve force of the ninth Army of the heaven battling Army!
 This meant that the heaven battling Army had at least nine legions, and each Legion might have a First Army, Second Army, or something of the sort, followed by a division ...
  Just thinking about it was terrifying!  At its peak, didn't the heaven-battling Army have millions of people?
 A Legion of 100000 people was not considered a lot, right?
 How glorious was the ancient civilization?
 Li Hao found it hard to imagine!
 This Regiment commander seemed to be very busy. In the next moment, he no longer paid any attention to Li Hao. With a flash, he went up the city wall and appeared on the tower at the city gate.
 Li Hao's eyes flickered, and in the next moment, he also jumped up.
 There were still two silver above him. Including this one, there were a total of three silver.
 Including Li Hao, that made four.
 ……
 At the same time.
 Outside.
 On the square, someone's eyes suddenly moved and he hurriedly said,""Look, isn't there an additional silver on the city gate tower?"
 As soon as these words came out, it caused a commotion.
 They all looked over. Some could see it, while some couldn 't. Those who saw it were all shocked.
 "One silver represents 1000 black Vatican!"
 "This ... Doesn't this mean that there are another thousand black flames?"
 "Oh my God, we're finished!"
 "Why is there another one? didn't they say that there were only four guards in total? Could it be that there were five other guards? How many black armor soldiers are there in the city?"
 The crowd discussed animatedly. Some were worried while others cursed.
 What the hell!
  They were only here to earn money, not to die. Hundreds of them had died when they entered, and now there was a new silver.
 ……
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Hou Xiaochen was frowning.
 Yet another silver-tier warrior had actually come. This made them suspicious, and even overturned some of their previous thoughts. There might not be only the four armies guarding the city, but also other legions.
 Each Garrison was not weaker than the Wei Wu Army and would only be stronger in the city.
 One could only imagine how terrifying it was.
 Over the years, hou Xiaochen had only managed to train a thousand soldiers. However, in such a short time, thousands of soldiers had appeared here. And this was only a small army that had been left behind during the ancient civilization.
 At this moment, King Pingdeng, Green Moon, and elder crimsonbright all walked over.
 At this point, these people were also having a headache.
 King Pingdeng frowned and looked at hou Xiaochen."Minister hou, this situation is beyond our expectations. How many black armor soldiers are there in the city? "If this continues, even if we continue to drag this out ... It doesn't seem to be of much use. The other party is increasing in number! But we don't have much time, only three days. If we don't leave after three days, it seems that no one can stay here for a month ... We won't be able to wait until the next opening!"

 Therefore, in these three days, they had to either give up the inner city or ... Attack!
 Break through the defense!
 Now that they had seen and waited, it was time to come up with a plan.
 Should they attack or what?
 Give up ... Everyone had waited for a month and made ample preparations. It wasn't easy for them to get in, so why would they give up?!
 Besides, there were so many rays of light, and no one had made a move yet.
 It was just a few thousand Black Phoenix. If those silver-tier Warriors did not go all out ... It was actually not a big deal.
 He was only at the peak of the three yang realm. There were many three yang realm experts present.
 The more this was the case, the more everyone felt that there were many treasures in the city. Even if there weren't any, if they could really take down this Army, thousands of black banners would be a huge treasure. One or two hundred of them were nothing.
 However, if one gathered thousands or even tens of thousands of them ... It would be enough to create the most elite army!
  Everyone had the defensive power of the sun glory. If tens of thousands of people charged at the same time ... It would be a terrifying scene. Just like now, thousands of black armor soldiers charged at them. In a short time, hundreds of supers were killed even with powerhouses around.
 "What are your thoughts?" hou Xiaochen asked calmly.
 "Let's join hands!"
 The king of equality did not beat around the bush."We've flattened this Black Phoenix Army. Now, another silver-tier warrior has arrived. There are four of them in total." It just so happens that the three great organizations and the Silver Moon officials will each deal with one person. As for the black armor Army, we'll leave it to everyone to deal with it together!"
 "It shouldn't be too big of a problem. Even if the silver-tier Warriors were to awaken and erupt, their combat power would only be around that of a late-stage Sunrise Warrior. Our side wouldn't be unable to contend against a late-stage Sunrise Warrior and collapse directly ... So, we don't have to be afraid of the other party's awakening!"
 Yes, they knew that the silver resurrection was very powerful, but they also had the confidence.
 The three great organizations were confident that they could deal with a late-stage sunrise expert. One had to know that Green Moon herself was at the late-stage sunrise, so what was there to be afraid of?
 As for Black Phoenix, there were many superpowers here.
 Black flames were at most at the early stage of the radiant sun realm, but most of the superpowers here were the radiant sun, and there were also many three suns. There were also some idle Sunglow, such as Xu Feng and some powerful martial masters.
 At this point, elder chiming from the flying heavens sect said,""Who saw the southern style? That guy is gone. Did he sneak into the city?"
 Nanquan was in a clamor, but that guy didn't appear in this battle, so everyone was still a little unaccustomed to it.
 "He died in the second passage, right?"
 "Who knows!"
 “……”
 No one had seen where the southern Fist had gone.
 However, there were still some people who died in the second passage. In addition to the many people who died in the chaotic battle earlier, the team that was close to 2000 people now only had about 1500 people left.
 A large number of people were missing!
 Of course, it was survival of the fittest. Those who died were fools, idiots, and weaklings.
  If they came in without any preparation, without checking any information, without making any strategy, who would die if not these people?  Knowing that there were divine power stones all over the place ... Everyone would think that it was a good thing for such people to die. The rest would be wiser.
 Hou Xiaochen didn't say anything. Southern Fist?
 It wasn't just the southern Fist.
 Li Hao and Hong Yitang were also gone!
 After thinking for a while, he nodded and said,"alright!" We're in charge of one silver, but there are many of them, and the others might not be able to work together ..."
 As they were talking, someone representing the wandering cultivators came from afar.
 It was Xu Feng!
 At this moment, this elegant young man was extremely carefree as he walked over.""Seniors, I'm fortunate to have been acknowledged by all parties. I'm here on behalf of the wandering cultivators to discuss with you how to deal with the current trouble ..."
 Hou Xiaochen chuckled, but didn't say anything.
 Lu Yue glanced at him, her face full of disdain.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The flying elder crimsonbright didn't say anything, but a smile appeared on King Pingdeng's dignified face.""I've been discussing with Minister hou. We'll deal with the silver-tier Warriors, while the secret practitioners and some of our men will deal with the black armor Army. Without the silver-tier Warriors, the black armor Army is actually easy to deal with. As long as they leave the ground for a minute, these black armor soldiers will lose their combat power!"
 "Some of the bronze puppets are slightly more difficult to deal with. However, the itinerant cultivators have a Sunglow like young master Xu. They won't have a hard time dealing with a sunbeams like the bronze puppets. Do you have any objections to this distribution?"
 The number of black phoenixes was a little high, but they were not strong enough. Strictly speaking, the silver-tier Army was more terrifying.
 Xu Feng laughed when he heard that,"of course!" The few seniors have obtained the troublesome silver, so leave the rest to us!"
 Of course, there was no problem!
 In fact, it was even better than expected. Those freelance martial artists were worried that these guys would continue to watch from the sidelines.
 ……
  At the same time.
 On the city gate tower.
 Li Hao asked curiously,"commander Jiang, is our defense system unusable?" The air defense system is still very strong. If we can use it ..."
 "It can only be used passively!"
 "Insufficient energy!"
 The seventh Regiment's commander's voice was hollow."Heaven battling city needs energy. At this moment, the energy is seriously insufficient. The reason why we can recover a little is related to the number of people who have died here. There are many people who have died here, so some energy will be absorbed, which can accelerate our recovery. Otherwise ... We will usually remain in a dormant state!"
 Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. It turned out that absorbing energy from the ground could also promote the recovery of heaven battling city.
 "Then, they took the second passageway ... That small house with a net. Could they have avoided the air defense system?"
 "Yes."
 The leader of the seventh Regiment replied blankly again,""That's the guest-welcoming tower. Those who come are guests ... But these people don't want to be guests and insist on being bandits. However, the guest-welcoming tower has given them some special privileges. We don't have the authority to cancel them. The city Lord and army commander are not in the city, so the authority of the guest-welcoming tower is higher than ours ... Unless The Guardian revives, no one can cancel it!"

 Guardian?
 Also, the city Lord is not in the city?
 Who was that gold-tier warrior?
 Li Hao was dumbfounded. He was very confused.
 In that case, the gold-tier warrior in the city Lord's mansion was probably not the city Lord. Who could it be?
 Guardian?
 He wanted to ask more, but the leader of the seventh Regiment's tone seemed to be a little strict.""Regiment commander li, before the battle, let's have a moment of silence!"
 He talked too much!
 He couldn't quite control it.
 After all, they were already dead. It took a lot of mental energy to recall certain things. At present, they only had some instincts and pitiful memories. Every question Li Hao asked would mobilize some of their mental energy to recall the past.
  Over time, it would stimulate recovery, leading to an early recovery to the peak, and then he would die quickly.
 Li Hao was depressed, but he didn't ask anymore.
 From the looks of it, these people hadn't fully recovered and didn't have much memory. It was already good enough that they could answer some of his questions.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He walked to the side of the city wall. At this moment, two of his men were there.
 It was very obvious!
 At first, Li Hao had thought that he wouldn't be able to find them after they entered the black nightmare Army, but it turned out that ... The armor system was really awesome. He swept his gaze over them and saw that one of the thousands of black puppets was flickering with light.
 Looking at it carefully, some data gradually appeared.
 "New recruit of the 12th Regiment, first company, He Yong!"
 “……”
 Li Hao was both speechless and amused. In other words, officials like him could see through the black Vatican with a single glance. No wonder!
 As for the others, they did not have the authority to do so.
 Obviously, this authority was only given to some of the members of his own twelfth Regiment.
 "New recruit He Yong!"
 At this moment, a sentence suddenly appeared in He Yong's mind. He hurriedly turned his head to look at Li Hao. Sure enough, he saw Li Hao staring at him from dozens of meters away.
 He Yong was stunned.
 I'm hiding here, you can tell?
 I'll go!
 What was this?
 So, now that I'm wearing the armor, you'll have complete control over me?
 His Black Phoenix had pitifully little authority.
 The only authority he had was to call for the company commander of the first company ... Actually, this was because he was the only new recruit in their company, so his authority was not too bad. Otherwise, he might have to call for the squad leader.
  Helplessly, He Yong could only walk out of the black Phoenix team.  A moment later, Hong Yitang also walked over.
 The three-man army gathered on the city wall.
 "Why are you calling us?" He Yong was extremely depressed.
 "I'm thinking that we might not be able to resist ..."
 Li Hao glanced over and frowned.""To be honest, these people are still very strong. There are many sunguang and three suns, you have seen it. If we go all out, we may not be able to stop them, and these few troops of the heaven battling Army may not be able to resist them either. "
 "Then let's just run ..."
 As He Yong spoke, Li Hao shook his head.""No, I want to defend this city!"
 He Yong was stunned. Why?
 To be honest, he was quite excited when he was in the military camp, but he recovered when he came out. He felt that it had nothing to do with him whether they could defend or not.
 It was actually good that they couldn't defend it. Maybe they could take advantage of the chaos to gain some benefits.
 Even if they did, it might not be of much use.
 "Why do you want to defend this city?" Hong Yitang also asked in a low voice.
 You don't have any family or friends in this city. What's the point of guarding this empty city?
 The people outside were definitely not to be trifled with!
 "I don't want the three major organizations to gain any benefits, and I don't want anyone else to gain any benefits!"
 "I've thought about it carefully ..."Li Hao said calmly," perhaps this city should be mine!"
 “……”
 The two of them were speechless. What right did he have to say that?
 "Of course, it also belongs to the two of you! After all, wasn't it better for one person, no, three people to enjoy the benefits here alone than to share it with everyone? The soldiers here are all dead. They won't consume any resources and will only appear during battle to serve as our guards. Why do you want these people to die?"
 "Think about the fountain of life, think about the good things in the city. It's better to share it with the three of us than to share it with so many people."
  "This is an ancient ruin, and strictly speaking, it doesn't belong to anyone ... But it belongs to one of the eight great families, the Wang family. In terms of connections, I have the right to obtain it ... Of course, I don't care about this right now, but it's obvious that even if thousands of people share it, not many people will be happy."
 "But ..."
 Southern Fist wanted to say that he really couldn't block it!
 Even if the three great silvers were to recover, it would not work.
 Li Hao continued, this city won't be taken down so easily! There's still a gold-tier warrior in the military camp, and he might not be the only one. There's also the one in the city Lord's mansion, and there might be other gold-tier Warriors ... But at this moment, they seem to be unwilling to revive in advance, which might lead to their deaths. "
 "We might be able to take this opportunity to make a contribution and obtain some additional benefits. The Armory seems to be in good condition. When I was collecting the silver armor, a silver warrior went in to retrieve something. I feel that there are still a lot of treasures in the Armory ..."
 "What do you want?" Hong Yitang asked directly. It's almost impossible for us to fight against these people. "
 "Why not?"
 "This is our territory!"
 Li Hao smiled."Have you forgotten that I'm the regiment commander? As the Guild leader, I can enter the houses of the residents with a special status. Therefore, I can enter all the closed houses in the outer city!"

 "Not only can I, but I can also give you some authority to enter with me ... As long as we're in the outer city, we can carry out sneak attacks or even head-on battles. We'll hide in the houses of the residents, and they can only passively wait for us to attack them ... Have you forgotten that when those copper puppets entered the houses last time, we could only passively take a beating?"
 Last time, there was also a copper carriage that had entered the ancient house.
 In fact, the black-armored warriors could do the same. However, the black-armored warriors seemed to have lost their intelligence and could not move on their own. The bronze armor, on the other hand, still had some spirituality.
 The two of them were slightly stunned.
 Entering the ancient house and ambushing the experts from all directions?
 He could attack and defend!
 The ancient house was one with the ancient city, and it was forbidden to enter unless invited. Once anyone entered, they would be attacked by the entire defense system. This was what Li Hao had learned. Therefore, those who had entered rashly before were actually killed by the entire defense system of the ancient city!
 Killing bandits was not allowed, even if one had taken the second passage. This would have violated the rules of heaven battling city.
 Li Hao continued,"also, there are 30 bronze puppets outside. They also have such intelligence. I'll try to borrow them. I'll hide in the old house with you guys. We'll hide our auras and be like fish in water in the city. If we sneak attack them, it'll be easy to kill some experts as long as we succeed!"
 "The two of you are so powerful. As long as we can kill you in one strike and hide in the ancient house, even if the sunguang is here, he won't be able to do anything to you ... We have the initiative, so there's no need to fight head-on!"
  "The three regiments have their duties. If the city is destroyed, people will die. We are the mobile Force, so we can help defend the city. They must defend the city ... In addition, their spiritual intelligence is not as high as when they were alive, so they can only defend the city. We are different!"
 Nan Quan touched his beard ... It was a pity that he didn't touch it.
 After thinking for a moment, he said,"isn't that bad?" Li Hao, we're still on the same side as those people outside ..."
 "Do you think we should take on the Silver Moon officials as well?" he asked.
 “……”
 Li Hao was speechless!
 艹!
 You're acting like your Grandpa!
 Hong Yitang also laughed and transmitted his voice,""It's feasible, but I'm afraid that people will be suspicious! In everyone's eyes, the heaven battling Army is just an Army of undead. If we launch a sneak attack ..."
 "Didn't we have it last time? Last time, those copper puppets ambushed everyone. Have you forgotten?"
 Li Hao reminded him. This wasn't the first time.
 There was one last time!
 Besides, so what if he was suspicious?
 "Besides, you two are only three suns outside, who would think much about it? As long as most people are dead, no one will know, and it's useless to think about it!"
 Hong Yitang laughed and sent a voice transmission, then we'll deal with the government?
 "What do you think, martial uncle Hong?"
 "I think? Do I think it's important? You are the Guild leader. "
 Li Hao was speechless. You're saying this now?
 "Forget it. I won't deal with him. I'll deal with the authorities. Once I weaken the authorities, Silver Moon might end up in some trouble ..."
 "Do you care if silver Moon is troublesome or not?"
 Li Hao chuckled and said telepathically,"I'm not a pervert. Even if I don't care, I don't want any turmoil in Silver Moon. The stronger Silver moon's government is, the more stable it will be. Senior uncle Hong, even if I don't have the heart to help the world, I don't have the mood to create any turmoil. Aren't you overthinking things?"
  "I killed the three major organizations because they've done many evil things and have a grudge against me. I don't kill just anyone, do I?"  Did this person really think of himself as a Demon King?
 Even if I don't want to help the authorities, it's not to the point where I have to kill them.
 Hong Yitang couldn't help laughing.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He was wrong!
 "Then we'll listen to you, who asked you to be the Guild leader!"
 Come on!
 If there are benefits, then listen to me. If there are no benefits, then go to the side!
 Li Hao didn't say anything else. He quickly walked to the three silver and said through the waves of his armor,""Three captains, I would like to lead a group of Centurions and fight a guerilla battle with these guys! Annihilate the enemy outside heaven battling city! Don't let the enemy take a single step into the city!"
 "Three Regiment commanders, guard this place. Our twelfth Regiment doesn't have enough members, so we need some reinforcements ..."
 Annihilating the enemy and outside the city seemed to have hit something!
 The three guild leaders seemed to have some fluctuations in their emotions.
 Annihilate both the enemy and the outside...This was the tradition of the military.
 Unfortunately, the current reserve 9th Division was a disgrace to the military and could only defend.
 Li Hao's other words were actually all nonsense.
 He didn't know that the words "annihilate the enemy" had touched the hearts of the three Regiment commanders. Some of their lost memories were even starting to recover.
 A moment later, the voice of the leader of the seventh Regiment fluctuated.""Yes! "The third Regiment can support ten Centurions, but ... No more. Any more and the heaven-battling Army will lose some of its basic operation ability. The brothers of Black Phoenix have lost their spirit, and they can only be of some use under the leadership of the Centurions ..."
 Only 10!
 Li Hao thought for a while and felt that it was not bad.
 Yes!
 "Many thanks!"
  "It's what I should do. Be careful, Regiment commander li!"
 "Bang!"
 Li Hao thumped his chest. He was familiar with it.
 The three commanders thumped their chests as well, as if they were impressed by this new commander.
 A moment later, the 10 copper puppets appeared in front of Li Hao.
 At this moment, some information about them appeared in Li Hao's Silver armor.
 "Hu Xin Wu, commander of the seventh Regiment's third company, reporting to Regiment commander li!"
 "The commander of the eighth Regiment, ninth company, Wu Kai Fu ..."
 “……”
 Waves of fluctuations spread to Li Hao. He was slightly stiff, as if he only knew how to obey orders and had some basic instincts, but not as agile as the three silver-rankers.

 "Alright, everyone, listen to my arrangements!"
 "Yes!"
 A sonorous and powerful voice, this time with more emotion, appeared in Li Hao's mind.
 Li Hao found that the authority of the ten company commanders was now connected to his silver armor. He was even more impressed. With this armor system, it was easy to imagine how convenient and unified the heaven battling Army would be when they took action.
 He only needed to issue military orders through his armor, and everyone could hear it. Moreover, only people with higher authority could issue military orders to people with lower authority, which saved him a lot of trouble.
 In the next moment, Li Hao turned into black armor. However, it didn't affect the Warriors at all. They could still recognize Li Hao.
 "Brothers, move out. Three leaders, send out some people and start your daily patrol. The fishing activity has begun!"
 “……”
 The three Regiment commanders didn't really understand, but they roughly knew that they needed cover.
 Soon, teams of Black Phoenix began to move.
  There were a total of eight streets in the outer city. This was the first street, but no one dared to be active here.
 As for the black Phoenix, with 10 men in a team and 100 men in a Street, 800 Black armor soldiers were dispatched in an instant to begin their daily patrol mission.
 The commotion in the black armor Army was noticed by some of the supers in the distance.
 ……
 "The black armor is moving!"
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "What are they doing?"
 "They ... They seem to be patrolling the city ... Strange, they're still patrolling at this time. Sure enough, these guys have long become puppets and don't have much intelligence. Aren't they just delivering themselves to their deaths?"
 "It's hard to deal with them when they're all gathered together. Now that they've split into 10-man teams, each Street has a hundred people. If we can take down these 800 people ... It seems like it was the same last time. I'll be rich if I can take down quite a number of Black Phoenix!"
 “……”
 At that moment, the supers were in an uproar.
 It was the same last time.
 The silver-tier Warriors guarded the city gate while the black Vatican patrolled the streets. In the end, they were caught off guard, and many of the black Vatican were annihilated at that time.
 Moreover, it was also because of this that many people were able to collect black flames.
 At this moment, everyone thought that they would not have the chance.
 Whoever knew, it actually started again!
 Although there were more people than last time, the quality of the superpowers was not comparable to last time.
 At this moment, hou Xiaochen and the others were frowning.
 How could this be?
 The silver-tier warrior just now did not seem to have lost his intelligence. It seemed like he had some intelligence. However, hei Teng continued to patrol the streets. This was really an idiotic move!
 This would obviously give everyone a chance to take them down one by one!
 It was actually quite difficult to deal with a group of 3000 Black Phoenix.
 But now, there were 100 people on each Street, and each team had 10 people. If they were fast, they could quickly take them down.
  In this case ... Once these 800 people were lost, if the other party continued to be foolish ... Wouldn't they be able to eat them up bit by bit?  Otherwise, even if they could deal with the three thousand black Vatican, they would suffer great losses.
 Out of the 1500 supers present, at least 500 to 600 of them would die. Do you think you can take down the black armor Army so easily?
 This time, the wandering cultivators were the first to stir.
 "Let's move freely!" Someone shouted."We won't take the black Phoenix if we get it. How much can we sell it to the other clans for?"
 "That's right. We don't have the experience of fighting with a large Army, and our cooperation isn't good. It's better to move in small teams!"
 Before the three great organizations and the Silver Moon officials could say anything, the unaffiliated cultivators had already begun to cause a commotion.
 He didn't want to attack the ancient city like before.
 That would be too dangerous!
 Now, they could split up and form groups of three to five. If they were confident, they could attack and take down a 10-man team, which was also 10 black armors!
 If one could be sold for three to five divine power stones, he would get thirty to fifty divine power stones in one go!
 The ticket money was nothing!
 To them, thirty to fifty divine power stones ... That was thirty to fifty thousand cubic meters of mysterious energy. It was too terrifying!
 Even if 10 people worked together and succeeded once, they could still make a lot of money!
 At this moment, the three large organizations and hou Xiaochen's group were all frowning. However, the Rogue cultivators were chaotic to begin with, and it was impossible to refuse them from acting on their own.
 Hou Xiaochen thought for a moment before saying,"If any of you manage to get a black banner, sell it to the night patrolmen. One black banner can be exchanged for one divine power Stone."
 "You're too stingy!"
 "This is an extraordinary item. It's not like we don't know that it can resist the attack of the sunlight. You're offering one of such treasures?"
 "That's right!"
 “……”
 Hou Xiaochen didn't want to say anything else.
 "Sell it to Red Moon, three for one!" Green Moon said with a smile.
  As for whether you can get it or not ... It'll depend on your abilities!
 It was just an empty promise. It was still unknown how many of these people would be able to make it out alive.
 However, by offering a high price to disgust the night patrollers, he could also stimulate the individual cultivators to work. If these individual cultivators could really get rid of all the black Vatican, that would be a good thing.
 Without so many black phoenixes, it would be easier to deal with the silver ones.
 As for why the heaven battling Army was so stupid, did it matter if their intelligence was obliterated or if they were deliberately setting up a trap to kill the supers?
 If the Rogue cultivator died, then so be it!
 Besides, the wandering cultivators were quite powerful. Even if they died, they could still kill some of hei Teng.
 In fact, the few of them had noticed that there was one less silver-tier warrior.
 Perhaps it was hidden within the black Phoenix!
 However ... If a silver warrior at the peak of the three suns were to move out alone, it might give everyone a chance to defeat him.

 "Flying heavens is also willing to purchase them at the price of three!"
 "The Yama is the same!"
 The three large organizations had each offered a price of three.
 Hou Xiaochen glanced at them and chuckled. "I won't say anything. You're rich, but the night patrolmen are poor. Even if you give me an empty check, I won't be able to afford it."
 This time, the secret practitioners were excited.
 Once they were eliminated, they would get 30!
 The divine energy stone was not a mysterious energy.
 To them, many of them had never even seen a divine power Stone before. They were going to be rich!
 As for whether or not he could get out alive and obtain benefits, that would depend on his own abilities.
 "Do you want to pay on the spot?" someone hurriedly asked.
  "Of course!"
 "Even if we annihilate all of the black Phoenix," Green Moon said calmly,"three major organizations can still take down 3000 of them and 9000 divine power stones if they work together!"
 "Besides, it's impossible for you to take all of them. You'd be lucky if you could take half of them. 4500,1500 each. Do you think that we can't even take all of them?"
 1500 was not a small number, but it was a lot.
 However, the three great organizations could really take it all in!
 This time, they had prepared quite a lot and had many experts. Even if it wasn't enough, they still had a lot of mysterious energy.
 Besides ... So what if it was a little less?
 "Old hou, do you think ... They really brought that many divine energy stones?" Kong Jie asked through voice transmission.
 If it was true ... It was really tempting!
 Silver Moon was not that wealthy.
 Hou Xiaochen didn't reply. Instead, he sent a message,"Everyone, be careful and wait and see. I feel that something is not right! These silver-tier Warriors were previously well-commanded and had high morale, but they suddenly became foolish ... Although there have been such precedents, the situation is still not quite right. Everyone, don't rashly enter the outer city!"
 What was going on?
 At this moment, hou Xiaochen, who felt that everything had been planned out, furrowed his brows slightly. He was completely confused!
 Looking at the superpowers flooding into the outer city excitedly, he heaved a sigh of relief. Things were not looking good!
 Who knew how many of these guys were going to die this time.
 There were also some three suns who had also snuck in. It seemed that the divine power stones had also tempted these three suns. It made sense. With three pieces of armor, if one had a storage ring, it would not be too difficult for one three suns to deal with ten black Phoenix. After a round of transportation, they would get 30 divine power stones.
 To be honest, even he was tempted!
 It was really profitable!
 But was money that easy to earn?
 Some of the experts from the three organizations had also sneaked in. It seemed like they either wanted to find out more about the situation or wanted to seize the opportunity to capture some Black Phoenix.
 On Silver moon's side, Hu Qingfeng sent a voice transmission."Are we not going? Even if we don't go, we still have to send some people in to Scout the situation. It's not good to rashly dispatch the rising sun, but the three suns can still do it!"
  This time, there weren't many people from the government, but there were some from the three suns.  Were they all waiting here?
 Of course, Hu Qingfeng didn't want to go in either. Who knew if he would encounter the disappeared silver-colored. Although the other party was only at the peak of three suns and might not be able to do anything to him, he didn't want to take the risk.
 "Minister, I'll go!" Jin Jin gun said.
 His combat power was strong. Even if he encountered a silver-tier warrior, he was not in a state of recovery, so he was not afraid of anything.
 He was also a Martial Master, and his concealment ability was extremely strong.
 Since golden spear had already requested for permission, Mu Lin, who was originally prepared to play dead, could only follow suit and say,""Minister, I'll go in with boss!"
 Hou Xiaochen pondered for a moment. The forest's defense was strong, and the Golden Spear's combat power was powerful ... If they encountered any danger, they should be able to react. After some thought, he nodded,"Go on, be careful. Don't touch hei Teng ... We're only here to Scout the situation. Just pay attention and observe. The situation ... Doesn't seem right!"
 "Yes!"
 The two of them walked toward the outer city together.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The dark outer city was like a man-eating mouth at this moment. It was a little terrifying.
 Hou Xiaochen continued to frown as he looked at the inner city gates. He let out a soft sigh. At this point in time, he was also feeling quite helpless.
 Li Hao ... Was it you guys who did this?
 Or are you just searching for treasure in the city and not participating?
 At this moment, he held a key in his hand and fell into deep thought. As a guest with a key, as long as he didn't attack the heaven battling Army, could he avoid some unknown danger?
 After thinking for a while, she gently patted Chief Steward Yu, who was beside her, and the key fell into her hand.
 "Take it, don't throw it away, just keep it in your hand!"
 Chief Steward Yu nodded and did not say anything.
 The group of people watched as those people entered the outer city.
 In the outer city, hei Teng's footsteps could be heard. Just like the last time, he continued to patrol the streets.
 ……
  In a tea shop.
 Li Hao entered the teahouse. There was nothing in the teahouse except some tables and chairs. However, Li Hao found some divine power stones, but he didn't touch them at the moment.
 As a silver-ranked Captain, how could he be tempted by such a small profit?
 Besides, according to the heaven battling Army's rules, don't touch a single needle or thread of the common people ... I, Li Hao, am a man of rules!
 A moment later, Li Hao's eyes flickered. He looked outside through the door and felt like laughing.
 A ball of light was right in front of him.
 It was so fun!
 He could now hide in the ancient house and with this pair of eyes, it could be said that he was an invincible existence!
 I can see you!
 In everyone's mind, the ancient house couldn't be opened. Thus, Li Hao opened the door, grabbed a sunlit man at the door, and broke his neck in an instant!

 Without any hesitation!
 There was no need to even check their identities. There was no other reason. The government did not enter. The weakest person was the three suns. Therefore, there was no need to look at them. Whether it was the individual cultivators or the three major organizations, except for the government, there was no one who could not move.
 The moment riyao was caught, his neck was broken. When he died, he probably didn't expect that he would fall so soon after entering.
 "Recruit He Yong, there's a three suns outside. Quickly attack and capture him!"
 In the distance, in another room, He Yong was actually still secretly observing. When he heard the words in his mind, he was slightly stunned.
 She looked around. Li Hao was nearby?
 Strange!
 How did he know?
 Also, he couldn't see through the three suns now because they had entered the second passage. With their super power concealment, even if they were in silver armor, it would be difficult to detect them.
 But now ... Li Hao had directly pointed it out.
  However, since Li Hao had spoken ... He would attack!
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com In an instant, he opened the door, grabbed one of the supers, and punched ... BOOM!
 With a loud bang, the next moment, the three suns fell.
 He Yong quickly disappeared with the corpse and entered another room in the blink of an eye. When the next group of people came to investigate, they found nothing. They were all confused. Where ... Did the sound come from?
 At this moment, Li Hao was observing his surroundings. He could even see the neighboring streets and knew which old house his men were hiding in.
 As long as they got close and compared their strength, he would quickly give orders.
 The 10 copper puppets all had combat strength at the peak of the sunlit realm. In addition, there were two unimaginable powerhouses and Li Hao, who was at the peak of the three suns realm ...
 At this moment, the entire outer city became a battlefield!
 One by one, the sunlit experts disappeared.
 The three suns encountered Li Hao's group. Li Hao was a bit difficult to deal with, but the other two could easily deal with the three suns.
 In the blink of an eye, five or six three suns disappeared from the entire outer city, but the commotion was not too big.
 ……
 At this moment, on the square.
 Hou Xiaochen's brows furrowed as he replied,"Old Kong, go in ... Find the Golden spear and the forest of trees, and get them out!"
 Kong Jie was slightly stunned. I go in?
 Are you sure?
 Unless they encountered a great danger, there was no need to let him in. The Golden spear was not weak either. With the strength of sunguang, who could easily deal with it?
 "Old hou ..."
 "Enter!"
 Hou Xiaochen's voice was filled with anxiety. This time, things had gone beyond his expectations.
 Something was wrong!
 He sensed a weak situation. There were three suns that had disappeared in an instant!
 They didn't sense it through superpowers. The three suns that had passed through the second passage were now concealing their auras very well. This was actually a good thing, but it was also a disadvantage. For example, when they entered the outer city, if it was before, everyone would be able to sense the disappearance of the three suns.
 "But now, you've disappeared ... You've disappeared. Everyone can conceal their aura. If you disappear, who will know?
 In this way, even if all the powerhouses died, the outside world might not know.
 Hou Xiaochen glanced at the young man on the red moon. He was also a heavenly-eyed cultivator. At this moment, the heavenly-eyed cultivator was also looking towards the outer city. He seemed to have sensed something, but his brows were furrowed. He couldn't see anything more.
 Beside him, Kong Jie had no choice but to quickly enter the city.
 What was going on?
 Do you need me to personally enter the city to solve it?
 He quickly entered the city. Moments later, his expression changed. In the distance, the door of an ancient house opened. Before Kong Jie could react, a black banner appeared and grabbed a superpower. In the blink of an eye, the man and the black banner disappeared!
 At this moment, Li Hao's voice sounded in He Yong's mind.""Retreat! Hurry up and leave ... There seems to be ... An expert nearby ... If it's not hou Xiaochen, then it's Kong Jie. Hurry up and leave!"
 He Yong was stunned?
 艹!
 He could even discover this?
 How did Li Hao find out?
 Or was this the effect of the silver armor?  At this moment, he was extremely envious!
 He didn't even notice Kong Jie, otherwise, he wouldn't have made a move.
 The next moment, He Yong opened the door. It was not a good thing to be blocked here. He quickly crossed the street and disappeared in the blink of an eye under Kong Jie's dumbfounded gaze!
 As for Kong Jie, she was breaking out in cold sweat!
 The rising light!
 He definitely has the power of Dawnlight ... Eh, hei Teng is Dawnlight?
 What the hell!
 He could even enter the ancient house to launch a surprise attack ... He was finished!
 The guy who entered this time might not be able to survive.
 He couldn't care less about the strange Black Phoenix and hurriedly went to find the Golden spear and the wood forest. He didn't want them to suffer here.
 ……
 As Kong Jie left, He Yong, Hong Yitang, Li Hao, and the 10 bronze puppets also attacked.
 One grab, one hit!
 At this moment, a shriek was heard. "There's a copper miasma in the ancient house!"
 As soon as these words came out, some people outside let out a sigh of relief."What did I think? there was one last time. It seems that these black puppets are just using the same trick. The bronze puppets aren't weak, but ... They're just like that. They don't pose much threat to the three suns!"
 Their hearts, which had been a little tense, relaxed a little.
 The outer city became even quieter.
 From time to time, there would be some commotion. It was the sound of the battle between the superpowers and the black Phoenix. There were also some unaffiliated cultivators who ran out excitedly. Some of them were even dragging the black Phoenix with them. Some of the black Phoenix had been destroyed.
 Seeing this scene, some experts revealed a smile.
 It seemed that these wandering cultivators were still useful.
 The black Vatican that entered the outer city would be destroyed sooner or later.
 Some experts were also getting restless. Some of the three suns and even sunguang looked at the leaders of the three major organizations. Should we go in?
 As for the night patrollers, Jin Jin has already gone in, and there's still Mu Lin and Kong Jie ... Don't let them get any more benefits!
 Green Moon and the others looked at each other. A moment later, some of the three suns from the three major organizations began to move out.
 Capturing more hei Teng would also be beneficial to them.
 ……
 At this moment, Li Hao and the others were killing everywhere.
 He instantly captured people, dragged them into the ancient house, and quickly killed them!
 Being able to see the orbs of light was of great help to him. Unless he encountered a Martial Master, there were not many martial masters who were stronger than him.
 After killing another dazzling sunlight, Li Hao's Silver armor displayed a set of data.
 "Newly formed 12th Regiment commander Li Hao, military merits: 11 points!"
 "Commander Hong Yitang of the newly formed 12th Regiment, military merits: 14 points. "
 "New soldier of the 12th Regiment, first company, He Yong. 17 points!"
 This number had actually appeared a few times. Sometimes it appeared once after killing a person, and sometimes it appeared after killing a few people. It should be the kind that accumulated merit points.
 However, what did 11 military merits mean?
  Li Hao wasn't sure yet, but He Yong was a pretty good soldier. He actually had more soldiers than Hong Yitang.
 Li Hao calculated for a moment. Three sunsets might only give him one merit point, and one three suns might also give him one. He had already killed more than 20 sunsets and three early-stage three suns.
 It was only 11 merit points.
 It seemed like he Yong had killed a lot, and some of them weren't under his command. That guy would observe for a while and then move out. This guy said that it wasn't appropriate, but when he killed people, he was really cruel!
 Hong Yitang had actually killed more than him.
 These people ... They didn't mean what they said. As expected, martial masters weren't good people. They were all villains!
 He just didn't know what 11 military merits were for.
 Promotion?
 Or something good?
 It had to be said that the armor system was still impressive. It clearly calculated the military merits. During the ancient civilization era, there was no need for Meritorious Service examiners. Whoever designed it was really awesome!

 (I'm a little late)
 In the outer city.
 People were constantly dragged into the ancient house and quickly disappeared.
 p More and more people died. Gradually, some people in the square also felt that something was wrong.  It was still fine if there were fewer deaths, but the three great killing stars were ruthless and ruthless. The number of deaths gradually increased. In the blink of an eye, hundreds of people had disappeared, and the number of rogue cultivators returning was also decreasing.
 Previously, there were still people who brought back some hei Teng, but gradually, no one brought him back.
 In the city, there were still some explosions.
 However, the sound of his footsteps was getting heavier. Hei Teng's footsteps as he patrolled the streets seemed to be getting heavier.
 ……
 On the square.
  The powerhouses frowned and looked into the city. Someone said softly,""Is it because the disappeared silver is killing in the dark? why do I feel like the superpowers are getting less active?"
 Some people were restless, while others looked towards the inner city.
 The three great silvers were currently floating in the air, looking down as if they were waiting for something.
 A ray of light seemed to be a little restless.
 "Why don't we just directly attack?" someone said, feeling vexed.
 This pitch-black outer city gave off an ominous feeling at this moment.
 However, no one replied.
 The Rogue cultivators were in chaos!
 The wandering cultivators were in a mess, and no one from the 3000 black Vatican could stop them. They were confident in taking down the Great White silver Master, but if the 3000 black Vatican joined forces, they would not be able to break through. Even the rising light could be defeated by the human wave tactic.
 Money moved people's hearts.
 "As for the wandering cultivators, even young master Xu can't control them. When everyone needs you, you're a representative. When they don't need you, you're nothing.
 ……
 The people in the square were in a state of panic.
 In the outer city.
This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao's group of three, on the other hand, carried the copper miasma and killed wantonly!
 Li Hao's Silver armor also displayed more and more military merits. Southern Fist was still ferocious. This guy's military merits had always been in the lead. Even though Li Hao and Hong Yitang's military merits kept increasing, he was still ahead of them.
 In less than 20 minutes, that guy's merit points had increased from 17 points to 27 points. He had also killed many powerhouses.
 At this moment, a sharp cry was heard again.
 "There's an expert ..."
 BOOM!
 There was a loud noise, followed by a scream. The person who made the sharp scream quickly died. He was a powerhouse in the middle stage of the three yang realm.  But he still died quickly!
 At this moment, in an ancient house, Nan Quan smacked his head and cursed silently. What a mistake!
 With his strength, he could sneak attack someone who was one level lower than him without being called out by the other party. However, just as he attacked that person, Kong Jie, that B * stard, appeared nearby again. He was shocked and distracted.
 "Kong ... You're not weak!"
 Nan Quan muttered, his eyes flashing with an ominous glint.
 Li Hao said not to attack the officials.
 The southern style also went with the flow and didn't say anything. However, this Kong Jie seemed to be deliberately keeping an eye on him this time. She had met him several times in a row.
 In the black banner, his divine intent fluctuated.
 Soon, Hong Yitang received his message in an ancient house not far away.
 "Mr. Hong, are you interested in testing Kong Jie?"
 In the ancient house, Hong Yitang wiped his long sword and sighed with emotion. The sword of this copper armor wasn't weak, and the entire armor wasn't weak either. In fact, the current copper armor wasn't able to unleash its full combat strength.
 It might be because they didn't have much strength left.
 To test Kong Jie?
 Hong Yitang laughed when he heard the words of the southern Fist. He thought that this guy's personality had changed a little, but in the end, he was still very brutal. The northern and southern fists were both brutal in the past.
 It was just that the current Southern Fist seemed to be much easier to talk to than before. It was also a little straightforward, but in reality, it was not that simple.
 "I'm not interested! If you want to try, you can unseal it yourself. You have the divine power Stone anyway, and you also strengthened the Super Lock in the fountain ... You can test him yourself. "
 "Then forget it!"
 "If you don't make a move, I might not be his match," Nan Quan replied."Kong Jie was already an expert in the inspection Office back then. Before the Heavenly Star guards came to Silver Moon, it was this brat who led his men to suppress the Martial Master rebellion. It's been so many years, but she's not any weaker than you or me."
 Kong Jie's background was very clean.
 In the early years, she was an expert from the inspection Office. Back then, before the Heavenly Star guards were established, it was Kong Jie who took action to suppress some riots in the inspection Office. Later, when the Heavenly Star guards arrived, they took action.
  Gradually, the martial arts experts forgot about Kong Jie's existence.
 However, how could these people from the southern Fist forget?
 The two of them had fought before. Kong Jie was also very strong, but her reputation had been gradually overshadowed.
 Hong Yitang didn't say anything, and Nan Quan sent another message,""Old Hong, I have 28 merit points now, not bad, right? How much are you?"
 As Black Phoenix, he could see his own but not others.
 As a bronze dagger, Hong Yitang could actually see the southern Fist, but he couldn't see Li Hao 's. At this moment, Hong Yitang checked and found that he had 25 points, which was a little less than that guy.
 He didn't really care.
 Hong Yitang peeked through the crack in the door. He wasn't as bored as the southern Fist sect. He killed people just to kill ... In fact, he had been watching the red moon's people kill them mainly to obtain more Red Shadows.
 He couldn't see the red shadow before, but he could sense it.
 But now, after putting on the copper armor, he could even vaguely see the appearance of the red shadow. He had to admit that Hong Yitang also admired the expert who designed the armor. It was too powerful. Even the lowest level black armor was a treasure.

 It was not something that could be exchanged with a few divine power stones.
 The black armor that the Wei Wu Army and the three major forces had obtained had not been activated at all. It was in a dormant state and they were only relying on the defense of the armor. In reality, they could not experience the true benefits.
 The black Phoenix in the city was formed by a group of dead obsessions without any sentience. Even so, they were able to deal with the sunlit Empire. One could imagine that if there was really an expert who could completely control the black Phoenix, his strength would definitely increase by more than one level.
 If the Wei Wu Army, led by Li Hao, were to be equipped with the fully activated black armor, their strength would definitely increase by another level.
 His mind was filled with all sorts of thoughts and he wasn't in the mood to talk to Nanquan.
 At this moment, he had his eyes on an expert.
 It came from the Crimson Moon!
 There were many experts from the red moon who had come this time. The Blue Moon and the green Moon were the rising lights on the surface, but there were two other rising lights in private, one in the early stage and one in the late stage.
 There were four sunrise experts, and two of them were even at the late-stage sunrise.
 From this, it could be seen how important this place was to Hong Yue.
  As for the person in front of him, Hong Yitang had actually been watching him for quite some time. However, he didn't dare to make a move. After thinking for a long time, he still sent a message to Nanquan,""I have a big business deal here, I don't know if you want to do it?"
 "What?"
 "It might be Huang Yue! Late-stage sunrise. If I'm not wrong, she should be the heavenly Mountain goddess. Her Heavenly Mountain plum snapping hand is also extremely powerful. Although she's not among the 36, she's definitely not weak ... She's not an ordinary late-stage sunrise, she's even comparable to peak sunrise!"
 On the other side, Nan Quan seemed to be silent for a long time. After a while, he transmitted his voice,""Are you still human? No matter what, she's an old friend from back then. I was wondering why you haven't made a move for so long, and you actually have your eyes on her!"
 "It's not easy to kill Hongyue's people, especially these guys. If you kill them, be careful of Ying Hongyue's complete rage!" Ying Hongyue is very promiscuous, but she also pretends to be deeply in love. That fellow is very hypocritical. If you kill Huang Yue, be careful that he will personally come to take revenge!"
 Hong Yitang couldn't be bothered with this and continued,""First, killing her will definitely earn you a lot of contribution points! Second, although she didn't bring the blood God, as Huang Yue and Hong Yue's third-in-command, she must have many treasures! Third, we might be able to get a finished Blood God. After all, Ying Hongyue couldn't possibly ignore the women she took away back then ..."
 "What's the point of fighting on such a small scale?" Li Hao is weak and naturally doesn't dare to have any ideas. Are we going to learn from him?"
 At this moment, Hong Yitang only wanted to do something big.
 There was actually no point in killing some three suns, which made him a little unwilling to continue killing. As a powerful Martial Master, it was meaningful to kill strong people, people stronger than him.
 Of course, Huang Yue was probably not as powerful as him, but wouldn't it be more satisfying to kill such an expert than to kill those people?
 Nan Quan thought for a while and said,"wait a little longer!" If we kill her, we'll cause too much of a commotion. Kill some more and get more military merits. If nothing goes wrong, these military merits can be exchanged for many good things ... The ancient civilization values military merits very much!"
 "Then I'll wait for you!"
 Hong Yitang shook his head and didn't continue. He kept staring at the guy walking on the street.
 Obviously, this person was here to look for silver.
 Otherwise, a late-stage sunrise expert who was a Martial Master wouldn't be interested in those black flames.
 ……
 The massacre in the outer city was still ongoing.
 Although all parties had realized some problems, it did not concern them. Most of the people who died were rogue cultivators, so these guys still chose to remain silent.  Even if the three suns roared, there were powerhouses.
 However, it still did not cause much of a stir.
 At the same time.
 Heaven battling city, on the city gate tower.
 Three silver statues stood side by side.
 They couldn't see much, not even Li Hao's whereabouts. The 12th Regiment wasn't under their control, but they knew that this new recruit had killed many people.
