The thought appeared in his mind, but he didn't dare to say anything. This group of lunatics was a little terrifying.He quickly entered the void with the other three venerable sovereigns and headed straight for the level eight venerable sovereign who was running away. Wu Shan also realized that these guys were working together very well. They had scattered and were chasing after each other along the same route.As such, if the rank eight venerable sovereign didn't want to be held back, he could only escape to the lightning territory and survive!As expected, the rank eight venerable sovereign had sensed the aura behind him. He had wanted to stay in the square region and wait for his brother's return, but he didn't dare to stay any longer. He rushed straight to the Thunder region!Let's return to twin worlds first!The other seventh level venerable sovereigns of the conscripted realm were ready to enter this place again at any time to help his elder brother!The other party gritted his teeth. He had actually failed.Fortunately, I ran fast!He disappeared in an instant, burrowing into the surrounding lightning territory and escaping.Behind him, several venerable sovereigns arrived in an instant. They watched him enter and waited for a moment. Sun god laughed. "He's gone. It seems like the martial King left something on him again ..."Li Zhu nodded slightly. At this moment, he was extremely calm."The martial King's Dao is too complicated. He's quite similar to that Silvermoon kid ...""No, it's Silver moon's Li Hao. He's similar to him," he added with a smile.He didn't belittle the martial King. After all, the martial King came first.This clone Dao felt somewhat similar to the attachment Dao, and it was even more concealed. A martial King must have attached it to that fellow!After saying that, he narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice,""This guy has gathered thousands of avatars over the past thousand years. Every single one of them has become emperors and neo martial artists. How much power of the great Dao has he taken away? "When Fang ping returns, I want to impeach him!"Sun god picked his ears and didn't say anything.Venerable the sword looked at the sky and didn't say anything.You can go ahead and impeach!However ... It had to be said that old Zhang's heart was too black. Because neo martial artists could not enter the eighth-tier world, the world itself was still constantly absorbing the power of the great Dao, and it was still the yin-yang dual Dao universe.A level Seven world, two Dao universes ... In addition, many people in neo martial world had separated from the Dao universe. As a result, the martial King had silently extracted so much great Dao power and cast a thousand Emperor-level avatars for himself!This ... Black-hearted, he must have embezzled a lot!These 1,000 clones were enough to give birth to several rank seven venerable sovereigns ...Venerable the sword cursed in his heart. If he had the thousand avatars, he would have reached Level Seven long ago. Old Zhang was too evil. If Lizhu impeached him, he would have to report it to them!She was also a little envious. He was really F * cking amazing.He stepped into the 7th rank, he didn't dare to say that he was one of the strongest in the 7th rank, after all the time he spent there was too short. However, among the 7th rank, he was already a peak existence, he could even fight with a normal sector Lord.However ... Old Zhang could kill a rank-7 with one whip. It was hard to say who was stronger between him and Fang ping.……Just as the new martial artist killed the four level Seven venerable sovereigns ...In tianfang universe. Venerable sovereign Chi Yang was initially relieved because the four seventh rank venerable sovereigns seemed to have a significant advantage. The great Dao seemed to be very stable and showed no signs of being broken.He felt much more at ease, and his heart was also at ease. He was no longer too nervous, and was ready to draw out the power of the red sun at any time.Otherwise, they could still hold on, but once he extracted the power of the Crimson sun, causing the four tier 7s to fall, they would lose their tier 8 world and tier 8 great path universe.It would naturally be best if he didn't become a wandering cultivator.However, venerable sovereign Chi Yang still managed to protect his own territory. Other than what he had kept, the remaining power of the red sun could be extracted at will. As long as he could protect the red sun, everything would not be a problem!  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  Initially, everything was still stable ...However, it only lasted for an instant ....In that instant, he suddenly sensed that a star in the great path universe shattered. Before he could react, the second star broke, then the third, the fourth ...The entire Dao universe shook violently in an instant, and four level-Sevens died at the same time!He spat out a mouthful of blood, and a large amount of the red sun Power leaked out.His expression changed drastically!Instantly killing four tier 7 experts?What was going on?How was that possible?The four tier 7 experts, who were originally extremely stable, were even at their peak right now. How could they be killed instantly?He didn't have time to think anymore. It was over. Once the four tier-seven experts died, the great Dao universe would shake violently. At this moment, if he didn't escape, once the other party broke through the great Dao universe and destroyed his Dao origin, he would really be finished!"Bastard!"With a furious curse, he instantly withdrew the power of the Scarlet sun and was about to escape from it!F * ck!He cursed in his heart. 'I'm also going to become a rogue cultivator. Damn it, I was just laughing at Yunxiao, and now I'm the one being laughed at. Hong Yue and Yunxiao must be laughing to death!' How could neo martial be so strong?Even the four rank-7s and one rank-8 had collapsed. However, looking at the fellow beside him, his brother ... Was probably fine. Could it be that his brother had run away?Venerable sovereign Chi Yang couldn't help but doubt and curse again when he had such a thought.It definitely was!Otherwise, this fellow would definitely have sensed the death of his brother, and not the look of surprise on his face right now. From the looks of it, he didn't know what had happened either.Damn it!And at this moment, a look of joy flashed in the eyes of the human King. He had finally broken through Chi Yang. This old man had to kill Chi Yang as well. Otherwise, it would not be perfect enough. He instantly erupted and raised his blade to kill the other party!

Chapter 3301 The Heavens Changed In All Directions (3)
The rank eight outer domain expert roared. He couldn't let Chi Yang be killed. Chi Yang had just left the great Dao and was in a weak state!The two Grade 7 experts beside him also charged out at the same time!The human King let out a violent roar as his long saber carried the power of ten thousand DAOs. At this moment, not only that, it was as if another world had appeared within the saber. It was as if ... The saber had also nurtured a universe!It was extremely powerful!Even the outer region grade eight expert was shocked by this blade and couldn't help but roar,""A second universe?"How was that possible?Wasn't this human King the master of the new martial arts?Wasn't he the master of Yin Yang?Where would there be a second universe?It wasn't the yin-yang universe's dual-path universe. It was another universe in the true sense, like a new universe.This blade was even more powerful than before!This guy had been hiding his strength all this time. From the aura of the saber, this second universe also had the power of a seventh-tier universe. It was a seventh-tier universe on its own!It was impossible that the human King had secretly nurtured an independent universe!Also, he was already the master of Yin Yang. Was he guarding against Emperor Cang?Otherwise, why would he nurture it alone?These thoughts flashed through his mind. With a boom, the long blade descended. The type 8 expert was instantly sent flying as he spat out a mouthful of blood. So strong! The human King, this beast, was hiding his strength!Damn it!The human King's sudden outburst and the fact that he had sent an outer region tier 8 flying with a single strike caused the Dragon Lord to frown. He had already ordered the four tier 7 experts to attack, but at this moment, his eyes suddenly flickered and his expression changed. He changed his strategy in an instant."Go kill that level eight from the outer region ... Take advantage of his weakness and kill him. After killing him, kill those two level Seven!"The four seventh level venerable sovereigns appeared in an instant. The Dragon Realm appeared directly and suppressed the heavens and earth. The eighth level venerable sovereign was still in shock when suddenly, the top of his head turned black and a part of the universe came pressing down!The four seventh rank venerable sovereigns and the four chaos beasts that had never appeared before appeared in the blink of an eye.It was heading towards him!The outer region level 8 "s expression changed. Four level 7" s?They were all from the chaos race!Where did it come from?The dragon world was a tier 8 world, and the direct suppression caused him to feel extremely uncomfortable. The four tier 7 experts 'attacks were even more abrupt and boundless!It was not over yet. On the other side, the three giant Dragons beside the Dragon Master instantly charged toward the red moon Thearch!Red Moon sovereign's expression changed and he started to run away!The cloud heaven Thearch was also shocked and wanted to escape as well. However, in an instant, the Dragon Master beside him seemed to have changed into another person. He was extremely majestic and powerful. When he punched out, thousands of great DAOs appeared. One of them was a chaos great Dao in the shape of a Dragon. Its Dao domain was so powerful that it could even suppress a level eight!It was unbelievable!The sudden change was beyond everyone's expectations. Supreme Emperor Yunxiao was shocked!"You ..." "Trash, you're wasting the power of your great Dao by staying alive!" The Dragon Lord's face was calm. Now that things had come to this, there was nothing to hide.A punch was thrown!The power of his physical body exploded, and the roar of a Dragon resounded through the entire sky. BOOM!Even tianfang universe started to shake violently.BOOM!  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  With a loud bang, the Dragon Lord's fist pierced through the other party. The strength of the Dragon Lord was shocking at this moment!The punch pierced through the clouds and Thearch Yunxiao roared madly. The power of his great Dao surged and his roar resounded through the world."You dare ... If you kill me, neo martial artists will be unstoppable ... If he kills Chi Yang, he'll definitely be able to reach level eight ..."Dragon Lord, you're crazy!What was going on with the square region?Didn't he know that neo martial arts were the biggest threat?I'm just a wandering cultivator, and you still want to kill me ...The Dragon Lord did not say a word and punched out once more. This punch seemed to have tens of thousands of DAOs converging. BOOM!Bang! Bang!There was a loud noise, and the great path universe seemed to be shaking madly. The Dragon's Roar was heard again under the punch, and it made Thearch cloud heaven pale with fright. His body stiffened, and in an instant, his head disappeared!The power of countless great DAOs dissipated!A level eight venerable sovereign, one that had broken away from the great Dao universe and had almost fallen in realm, was killed by the Dragon Lord with just two punches!The Dragon Lord reached out and grabbed a cloud-like power of daosource in his hand!His eyes were incomparably cold, and in an instant, he crushed the cloud!"That's impossible ..."At this moment, the cloud Master was filled with despair and disbelief. It had been a million years!I've been in the square domain for a million years, and I'm going to be killed just like that?He became the first rank eight venerable sovereign to die in a million years!Ever since Tian Fang's disappearance, rank eights had been unparalleled existences in the four-sided domain. There had never been a rank eight expert who had fallen. In the millions of years of the four-sided domain, there had only been a few rank eight venerable sovereigns, and they were all true overlords of a region!But today ... He was the first level eight venerable sovereign to fall!He had thought that it would be Hong Yue, Chi Yang, or someone else ...However, he was the first rank 8 to be killed!He died at the hands of the Dragon Lord!On the other side, the human King's jaw almost fell off. Tsk, this grandson is so strong. He had indeed been hiding his strength all this while. How sinister ... As for me hiding my inner world, that's not sinister. It's just for self-defense.However, this dragon clan's grandson was already at tier 8, yet he was still hiding his strength. He was too shameless!He held his saber and no longer cared about the others. He roared,""Big cat!"The big cat opened its mouth wide and tried to devour venerable sovereign Chi Yang. Venerable sovereign Chi Yang was in a weak state. At this moment, his face changed dramatically. He looked around and his face turned even paler!

Chapter 3302 The Heavens Changed In All Directions (3)
Yun Xiao was killed, and Hong Yue was besieged by the three dragon clans. The three experts she brought, the level eight from the outer region, were besieged by four chaos beasts that she had never seen before. Two level Seven experts were suppressed by the level eight world and were unable to fight back.On the other side, the light Thearch's eyes and mouth were wide open in disbelief.Did an eighth-rank really die?And ... From the looks of it, there might be more than one today!The Dragon Lord was too strong!As his expression changed, he instantly realized that he was going to be in trouble and live!In an instant, he threw out a punch. The divine fist of light went straight for Chi Yang as he roared,""Human King, I'll help you. Quickly enter the 8th rank!"If human Kings did not enter tier 8, the Dragon Lord's side ... Was too strong, no one could restrict him.At that time, they would be in big trouble!BOOM!Venerable sovereign Chi Yang was in complete despair. Bastard, venerable sovereign of light, you're a fence-sitter, you bastard. You claim to be a bright person, but now, you're hitting a man when he's down ... I curse you!The human King was also laughing heartily!Previously, he had been trying to get close to the light Thearch. Now, he sensed danger. The light Thearch was going to join forces with him."Die!""Yin and yang reverse, blade fall!"Yin and yang seemed to have been reversed. All the Yang Qi in Thearch Chi Yang's body seemed to have disappeared in an instant, turning into Yin Qi. He seemed to have been frozen in an instant, and thousands of blade lights seemed to have appeared in the long blade!As the blade slashed out, the God of Light's fist landed on his back at the same time!BOOM!Venerable red sun's face was filled with misery. I'm ... The second level 8 cultivator to die? It was ... Really laughable!However, he soon turned his head with difficulty ... And suddenly laughed. On the other side, the eighth level venerable sovereign who came with him suddenly screamed. After killing Yun Xiao, the Dragon Lord didn't go to find Hong Yue, but instantly fell.One punch!It suppressed heaven and earth.A single punch had broken through the defense of a level eight venerable sovereign!With another punch, he destroyed his opponent's body. With three punches, the eighth rank venerable sovereign was torn into pieces. A touch of daosource power appeared, which he caught in an instant and crushed. The next moment, it swept in all directions and brought everything into the dragon world.He turned around and a tail suddenly appeared. The tail twitched!BOOM!The two tier 7 beings suppressed by the world were instantly crushed and turned into nothingness before being absorbed into the dragon world.The level eight sovereign from twin realms was killed, along with two level Seven sovereigns. At the moment of his death, the level eight venerable sovereign sighed."They say the four-sided domain is extremely dangerous ... I was ... Too greedy ..."Tragic!Twin realm was a top-tier great world in the outer region, and it had two rank eight venerable sovereigns!"But today, the Scarlet Sun City has been broken through. That brother of mine is probably still alive.But I ... I'm one step ahead.In the outer region, it had been many years since an eighth-rank venerable sovereign had died. It was only recently that the newly advanced ninth-rank venerable sovereign had launched a surprise attack and killed an eighth-rank venerable sovereign, starting the battle to unify the entire chaos.But here, in the blink of an eye, Yun Xiao died, and so did he ... Chi Yang was probably going to die, and that Hong Yue ...How many tombs of venerable sovereigns would this four-sided region become?As for the tier 7, their deaths seemed to be not worth mentioning!BOOM!The Dragon Lord's consciousness exploded. He looked at venerable sovereign Chi Yang, who had been cut in half, with an indifferent expression. His eyes flickered!The human King!Should he stop them?With the human ruler, Emperor Cang, and the radiance Emperor here, if they were to stop him ... He would be stopped as well.He only took one look before charging toward Hong Yue, followed by the four venerable sovereigns!As for Red Moon sovereign, he was already in a state of frenzy and had lost all color in his face. At this moment, he actually asked for help from the human King."Save me...Human Emperor...If I die, the Dragon Lord and the seven great sovereigns...You will die too ..."He then looked at the grade-7 cultivators who were running away and roared,""Save me! If I die, you'll be defeated one by one and all die ..."There were more than 20 Level Seven venerable sovereigns around them!If they didn't run, they could still fight together!I can't escape!However, in that instant, the rank eights had fallen one after another. The rank seven venerable sovereigns were on the verge of collapse. No one could organize themselves. Hong Yue was about to die, so who dared to stay?Red Moon sovereign saw the Dragon Master and shouted,""I surrender!"I surrender!I don't want to die. At this point, the only way to survive was to surrender.BOOM!In the distance, the sound of an explosion could be heard. The human King had killed venerable sovereign Chi Yang with a single slash. Countless Yang Qi burst forth and the human King devoured it madly. At this moment, his aura began to burst forth. He looked over there, at the Dragon Master!This fellow from the dragon clan was really ruthless!The human King was speechless."I've only killed one rank eight, but this guy killed two in the blink of an eye, and he's still killing the third ... There's such a ruthless person in the four regions."The light Emperor was also shocked!Three rank eights had died.Beside him, venerable red sun's will still remained. He seemed to want to say something, but the light Emperor casually punched his will and destroyed it. "Stop talking nonsense. You're already dead, so don't disturb us. I'm so scared now!"The human King couldn't help but cast a sidelong glance at him.Even the Dragon Lord couldn't help but turn his head to look at the light. It was a little strange. He had already died, and you ... Didn't even leave behind any last words?You are too black-hearted!You're called light?The radiance Supreme Emperor was stunned. He was speechless when he saw everyone looking at him. 'I just ... Hit him casually. I didn't mean anything else. You murderers don't think I'm cruel, but you think I'm cruel?'What ... What kind of person was this!He was also very helpless. As for Chi Yang, he was already dead, so what was the point of talking?It was meaningless!I'm just sending them on their way earlier!"Human King, do you want to save Hong Yue ..."The human King didn't care and instantly fled. He roared,""Grade seven experts of the three regions, quickly gather towards me. Let's open up a barrier and escape!"“……”Escape?The light Thearch couldn't help but curse. 'We can still fight, why are you running?'As for the Dragon Master, he took another look at the human King, and his eyes flickered.Escape?You're not thinking of killing the other Level 7 humans, are you?If that's the case ... Human King, you're really black-hearted!Red Moon sovereign, who was in front of him, screamed,""I'm willing to sign a great Dao agreement and submit to the Dragon Lord. Please spare my life!""If the human King, light, and Emperor Cang all enter the eighth stage, the neo martial artists will advance to the eighth stage as a whole, and their strength will increase greatly. There's only one dragon Master, and he still needs people to work for him ... I'm willing to submit!"He shouted loudly, sweating all over.As for the Dragon Master, he looked at him deeply for a long time before chuckling.""The Dao of desire is really interesting ... Is being afraid of death also a Dao?"He chuckled and nodded."You're really a smart person. I'll take you in. You've offended neo martial, and you're the first one to have your world broken, but you're still alive today. It's not simple. It's just that ... Why are you at the peak of the eighth rank ... So weak?"He had placed Red Moon last because he felt that she was at the peak of the eighth rank!But ... Why was he so weak?Red Moon Supreme Emperor was confused."I ... When did I reach the peak of the eighth rank?"The Dragon Lord sighed. It seemed that he had misunderstood.What an annoying fellow. If that's the case, why did you mislead me last time?If I knew you weren't at the peak of the eighth step, I would've attacked the human King realm.He thought to himself with some regret.He was delayed by the red moon!He was a little angry, but he quickly calmed down. Since that was the case ... He would let this guy be his Vanguard!To deal with the vanguard of neo martial!  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  "Let's go. Let's go out with them ... It seems that there's been a small change in the Dragon field."The Dragon Lord's eyes turned cold.Who was causing trouble in the Dragon field?After today, I will be the only one in the four-sided region!So what if the human King realm advanced to the eighth step?As for Red Moon master, at this moment, there was only fear and joy. She could no longer care about anything else. I ... Am still alive.Chi Yang is dead, Yunxiao is dead, and the eighth-grade powerhouse outside is dead, but I'm still alive ... I'm really glad.The four-sided domain had completely changed!The situation that had not changed for a million years was about to change completely.

Chapter 3303 Rain-Like Emperor Armor (1)
The rank 8 worlds were destroyed one by one.At the same time.Outside the Thunder World.Li Hao slashed out with his sword. Thousands of worlds gathered, and the giant elephant sector Lord roared madly!At this moment, its enormous body expanded to the size of a star. Compared to it, Li Hao was like a speck of dust. However, the dust-like sword left a bloody hole on its enormous body!His blood gushed out like a river or a fountain!The giant elephant Emperor roared and struggled again. At this moment, the powerful force directly destroyed the Thunder giant above his head. His body was covered in Thunder marks, but he finally escaped the slash of the Thunder tribulation.  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  These lightning Giants were divided according to the number of people. Each person would get one, which was extremely fair.If you kill one, the other Thunder Giants won't come for you in a short time.Of course, this was the first round.This time, it might not be just one round.When a large number of cultivators and venerable sovereigns were killed, perhaps the second round would begin.Li Hao didn't care about this.When the giant elephant Emperor killed the lightning giant, he finally had some energy left. Roaring angrily, he charged at Li Hao with his huge tusks, which seemed to be able to break the world!To be able to fight, suppress, defeat, and kill ...These were four different states!Li Hao wasn't a weakling at the moment. After merging with two universes, he wasn't invincible at the seventh-rank, but he was at least on par with a sector Lord. However, killing the giant elephant Overlord would be more difficult than killing the Earth Dragon and the two Dragon overlords.Even if the other party was injured, struck by lightning, or had one of its huge hooves cut off by his sword ...However, his opponent could still fight!It was only at this moment that he finally understood how powerful someone who could kill a seventh stage sector Lord in the home world of a seventh stage venerable Emperor was. At least, he was much stronger than his current state.The new martial human King had once killed the Master of Darkness.Seeing that this guy was still difficult to kill, Li Hao let out a sigh of relief. Damn it, it was really difficult to deal with this group of guys even after using all his means. It was too troublesome.He forced me to use my trump card!At this moment, he struck again. At the same time, a bright moon emerged between the sky and the earth. At this moment, when almost all the middle and low-stage venerable sovereigns were dead and the high-stage venerable sovereigns were struggling to survive, the bright moon showed the power of a fourth-stage venerable sovereign!Rank four venerable sovereign!What was the use?Although the giant elephant Emperor felt that something was wrong, he had no time to think about it at the moment. Li Hao's sword had suppressed him too much, and he had been seriously injured. At this moment, if he could withstand it, he would win.It couldn't care less about the use of the fourth-rank moon, even if it knew that the Silver Moon King wouldn't do something useless.The bright moon instantly turned into an illusory state. In an instant, the heart of the giant elephant Emperor trembled as if he had sensed a problem. At that moment, his Dao of chaos seemed to have cut off the transmission of energy, and even the connection with the great Dao universe seemed to have been cut off.It only took an instant!However, in a battle between experts, such a problem was already dangerous ... At this moment, it could be said that it was fatal. Last time, the Queen had used this move and almost killed the Earth Dragon. At that time, she was only a 2nd rank.This time, it was Tier 4!The effect was completely different.Moreover, the elephant was being suppressed by Li Hao and couldn't fight back. It was different from when Li Hao couldn't break the Earth Dragon's defense.At this moment, the giant elephant realized the seriousness of the problem!"This moon can fuse with my chaos Dao!" He roared. You've cut off my path!"The roar shook the world!It realized that it was going to be in trouble. The Earth Dragon monarch had also realized this last time, so he wanted to send a message, but he failed. At this moment, the other monarchs were nearby, and in an instant ... Those Primal Chaos monarchs were shocked!Fuse with the Dao of chaos?Cut off the path of a rank seven venerable sovereign?'This ... This is impossible! The white elephant should have been able to hold on for a while, but at that moment, the power of a thousand worlds burst forth as the sword slashed down, cutting the huge white elephant in half from top to bottom!The transmission of power of the seventh step had been cut off for a moment ... Without the power of a great Dao, how could he block Li Hao's sword with his physical body?In an instant ... The white elephant was directly slashed apart!The Queen, who had transformed into a bright moon, trembled and stumbled out. The bright moon had some cracks. It was difficult to stop it for a moment with the power of a 4th rank, but ... The Queen smiled!At this moment, he laughed smugly.It wasn't obvious when they killed the Earth Dragon last time, but this time, she directly cut off a rank 7's Dao of chaos and helped Li Hao kill another rank 7. She even reversed the situation!This time ... How about I, Empyrean God lingyue?BOOM!The enormous white elephant crumbled, the great Dao crumbled, and its body shattered. At this moment, the faces of the surrounding chaos thearchs changed completely.The black Tiger was fighting one against two, but it had killed one giant and injured the other.At this moment, it didn't care about the giant anymore. It let out a mournful roar that reverberated in all directions,""Tong Bao, Fire Phoenix, Bai Ling ..."These were the names of the three Type 7 powerhouses. At this moment, the black Tiger roared madly,""You guys ... Understand!""Qiang!"An incomparably sharp and clanging sound rang out. The Phoenix's cry resounded through the world at this moment. The fire Phoenix seemed to have exploded in an instant, sweeping through the entire world and actually suppressing the Thunderbolt Lord. It exploded again, flapping its wings and directly shattering the Thunder giant. Covered in blood, it no longer cared about anything else and went straight for the bright moon!

Chapter 3304 Rain-Like Emperor Armor (2)
It wasn't just her. The giant Golden Rat let out a shrill cry as its tail broke off. It turned into a beam of light and disappeared on the spot, heading straight for the Queen!The White Tiger allowed the six paths of reincarnation fist to land on it, and it used the force of the fist to fly towards the Queen.The black Tiger was also crazily coughing up blood, and it also flew over!Kill this guy, kill the queen, kill Li Hao!This was their only goal right now. Otherwise, the power of the moon would have been able to cut off the chaos Dao. The other party was a rank four and very weak. If they didn't give her a chance, the Queen wouldn't be a threat to a rank seven.  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  However ... For such a person to reach the seventh rank was a nightmare for the chaos race!There was even the threat of his entire clan being exterminated!Today, even if they had to die Here, they would shatter the moon and kill Li Hao. As long as they could kill these two, it would be worth it even if they were completely annihilated!At this moment, he couldn't care less about the Thunder giant or the threat.When the giant elephant sent a message through its death, telling them that the moon could cut off the Dao of chaos, they knew what to do. The giant elephant was dead, and the balance was broken.If this stalemate continued ... They might still die, and the other Seven Realms would not be able to come to their aid.Since that was the case ... He had to take a gamble before he died!Crazy!Take a gamble!Kill those two!At this moment, the chess pieces, the Thunder Emperor, and the emptiness all changed color ...They had not expected that at this juncture, the chaos race's venerable sovereign would be so valiant, so crazy, and so fearless of death!This ... Even many, many humans couldn't do this.When a great disaster was imminent, they would fly separately!If these people really wanted to escape, there was still hope for one or two of them to escape ... But at this moment, none of them escaped. They were all fighting with their lives. The four level 7 experts charged at Li Hao at the same time!They didn't care if the lightning tribulation struck them or if the Thunder monarch, Dao Qi, and Kong Ji attacked them from behind.It was as if ... He was willing to pay any price to kill those two."Stop!" Kong Ji roared.The six divine fists burst out crazily, no longer caring about anything else. As they burst out, they recovered crazily, again and again ... Even if the hair turned white and the foundation and longevity were consumed, he had to keep these guys here!The Thunder Emperor also let out a fierce roar. Hong long long, countless Thunderbolts frantically struck down from the sky. At this moment, the Thunder Emperor's expression also changed.These guys were all crazy.He was completely crazy!The others aside, if the Phoenix wanted to escape, there was a chance of it. He couldn't completely suppress his opponent. He was truly powerful.However, none of the seventh rank venerable sovereigns had fled.……Li Hao had just killed an elephant and was in a weakened state. The next moment, he felt an endless threat. The suffocating aura of death seemed to completely envelop him.As for the Queen, the moon she had transformed into had already begun to crack. The Queen, who had just been smug, could no longer be smug at this moment. Her illusory body appeared, and her eyes revealed a touch of despair.There was no way to escape!The four level 7 venerable sovereigns had gone crazy. They were even willing to risk their lives to kill her and Li Hao. She was even more valued than Li Hao. A level 4 venerable sovereign had attracted four level 7 venerable sovereigns to fight with her.Perhaps ... This would be recorded in history?Silver Moon history?Or the history of chaos?At this moment, the Queen laughed. She knew that she was done for. At this point, the four pressures had completely locked onto her. Even the three great Dao universes of the fire wind world, mighty tiger World, and treasure opening world were suppressing her and fixing her in place!The four powerhouses had not arrived yet, but she was already about to be killed on the spot by this powerful pressure!The moon was shattering! Li Hao was also locked on, but it wasn't as serious. The main target of the four great experts was actually the Queen ...Li Hao actually knew that the Queen's ability was a threat to everyone, no, to the Beasts of Chaos. But he didn't expect that it would lead to such a scene. The four great experts didn't care about their lives and only wanted to kill the queen.That day, the Earth Dragon Emperor wanted to send out a message even before he died ...At this moment, Li Hao completely understood that this group of Beasts of Chaos was different from the ones he had encountered before. They ... Had souls, goals, pursuits, and dreams.The Dragon Lord had given them all these.Race!That's right, for the sake of the race of chaos, to be able to truly establish themselves in the chaos and become the Overlord, these powerful beings of the race of chaos would eliminate a threat like the Queen, a threat to the future, even if it meant death!Only by taking advantage of her weakness could they immediately eradicate her!When a fourth rank cut off the seventh Rank's chaotic force, to the Queen, it was a success and an achievement. To the Chaos Beast, it was a huge threat, even threatening the Dragon Lord's life.If Grade 4 could cut off the giant elephant today, then what about Grade 5?What about the sixth rank?What about the seventh-rank?The invincible Dragon Lord might die in the hands of this nameless nobody!"Kill!""Kill!""Kill!""Kill!"With four fierce roars, a person seemed to have come out of the Christian Church. The chaos was frozen, and the moon was cracking crazily. Countless power of faith overflowed, but it still couldn't maintain the existence of the moon.The Queen wasn't alone. There were trillions of humans in the divine Kingdom.Once the Queen died, the divine Kingdom would collapse ... All of these humans would die.At this moment, Li Hao's eyes were cold as he looked around. He had thought that the battle was going smoothly, but these Beasts of Chaos had shattered his fantasies time and time again!

Chapter 3305 Rain-Like Thearch (3)
That's good, I've gained some knowledge."It also made me understand ... That the experiences in the three territories were not everything. Not all venerable sovereigns are afraid of death.What happened at the Crimson Moon could only be considered a fluke.It turned out that even a high level venerable sovereign had faith! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Naturally, he still had other methods. Be it time reversal or time freeze, the four tier 7 experts might be extremely powerful, but as long as they sacrificed one life, at the very most, they would exhaust their entire lifespan and just have to go through another life and death situation. He had gone through it four times, and his lifespan had already been reduced by 400000 years.Another 100,000 years less was not impossible.But ...Other than that, he still had other methods!Why did he have to go through a life and death situation?A debt was a little better than this.At this moment, Li Hao roared. Time appeared briefly, and the chess piece not far away disappeared in an instant and reappeared in Li Hao's direction in the blink of an eye. Li Hao could continue to pay a price to summon others, but that would be no different from freezing time.He didn't do that. At this moment, he smiled and looked at the Dao chess piece."I need to borrow senior's eighth-tier universe ..."“……”Dao Qi looked at him, and this moment seemed to last for thousands of years!Dao chess, understood.Dao Qi looked at Li Hao's River of Dao and really understood. This grandson wants me to integrate the power of an eighth-tier universe into his River and strengthen the power of a thousand worlds ...'This bastard doesn't want to go through time or life and death again. He wants ... Me to give up my true body and let him merge with the great Dao?'He really was a coward!The thought emerged in an instant. In the next moment, a chessboard appeared. The chessboard suddenly split open, and a long river of Dao emerged from the depths of the chessboard. A universe seemed to appear.Dao Qi didn't know what he was thinking. Had he been tricked by Li Hao, or had he been tricked by Li Hao ...At this moment, he had actually given up his main body universe.The universe instantly merged into the long river of Dao.The Qianjie was originally just a small Jie. However, at this moment, as one side of the universe was voluntarily integrated into it, the Qianjie seemed to expand instantly and solidified together, as if it had become a single Jie!The originally scattered power of the great DAOs gathered together at an incredible speed.A complete fusion!Just like the Supreme from before, the thousand avatars had gathered into one, and the thousand realms had turned into the universe of the great path, merging into the river and the river into Li Hao's body.Li Hao's aura suddenly became much stronger!He no longer had the firmament sword in his hand. His Tier 5 sword could no longer keep up with Li Hao.The chess board instantly transformed into a sword!It was only for a moment, as if time had stopped.Li Hao held his sword and slashed it toward heaven and earth!"The bright moon is in the sky!"The sword was drawn! This sword strike seemed to contain thousands of DAOs, as if thousands of worlds were crashing down, and as if the venerable sword had emerged. Its offensive power even surpassed that of the venerable sword ...At this moment, there were even some sword Venerables who had combined their bodies into one and killed a level Seven expert with a rod!Instant kill!The treasure-connecting mouse, who was the fastest, had just appeared and slashed down when it exploded with a bang. Its body was instantly destroyed!The longsword rippled, and in the next second, a large circle appeared. Just like the earth-covered sword of the past, it defended in all directions!At the same time, the remaining three venerable sovereigns had arrived. With a loud bang, they crashed outside the sword circle.Behind them, Thunderbolt master and Kong Ji charged over at the same time. Er Mao also tried to swallow the black Tiger!Li Hao mumbled and instantly disappeared from his original spot. He walked along the river of time. A huge River seemed to have descended from another void. He instantly appeared behind the fire Phoenix Sector Lord.The sword slashed down!At this moment, a look of despair appeared in the eyes of the flame Phoenix World Overlord.Li Hao instantly appeared behind her.As for the others, they had already caught up, but the assassination ... Had failed.As the treasure-connecting mouse was killed, she knew that she had failed.She smiled sadly, and a hint of helplessness appeared in her eyes. She looked into the distance, in the direction of Tian Fang ... When ... Will you come back?His eyes glowed with a golden light!In the next moment, all of its power seemed to have been exhausted, and it no longer wanted to fight back. The fire Phoenix cosmos shook violently, and its Dao source disappeared. In the distance, the Phoenix Flames, which were still resisting the lightning tribulation, suddenly trembled!The Dao origin of the fire Phoenix World entered her great Dao and left the fire Phoenix cosmos instantly.The blood essence in his body started to burn crazily.His mother's voice rang in his ears,""Go to the sky and use the flame technique to escape to the sky ... Find the Dragon Lord and tell him everything that happened today. Tell him that the Silver Moon King is a big problem, and tell him ... That we ... Have failed! "However, we wish to see the future of the chaos race ..."A flash of flame shot into the heavens and earth!The eyes of the flame Phoenix realmlord turned cold. At this moment, with a loud boom, his gigantic body directly turned into a blazing inferno, burning the entire heaven and earth, the entire void, everything!The power of the peak of the seventh rank burst out in an instant, burning himself!"Black Tiger, protect Feng Yan and leave!" She roared. The black Tiger had been one step behind because of the two level-seven lightning tribulations. At this moment, it was also the furthest away from Li Hao and the others. The black Tiger Imperator's eyes were blood-red, and the fire Phoenix Imperator roared again,""Go! Phoenix Flame!"Phoenix Flame!The black tiger's blood-red eyes instantly became clear.Phoenix Flame!The Daughter of the Dragon Lord.He was defeated.A crushing defeat.The Four Realms had joined forces, but they had also suffered a crushing defeat.The next moment, the black Tiger disappeared. In the blink of an eye, it had gotten rid of the two cats. A star appeared above its head and instantly shattered, blocking the two cats from devouring it. That was a star of the great path, but it no longer needed it!

Chapter 3306 Rain Of Emperor Armor (3)
 It instantly left the battlefield. It wasn't afraid of death, but at this moment, everything was destined. It had already been defeated. The fire Phoenix burned itself to stop the powerful enemy ... It had to take Feng Yan away.This was the most outstanding descendant of the Dragon Lord."Roar!"His roar resounded through the world. Imperator Black Tiger instantly appeared in front of Feng Yan. He carried Feng Yan, who was burning his blood essence, and turned into a black wind, flying straight to Tian Fang. Behind him, two cats wanted to chase after him, but Li Hao roared and completely destroyed the Phoenix with a BOOM!"I won 't!""Surround and kill The White Tiger!" Li Hao roared.Many powerhouses attacked one after another and charged straight at The White Tiger!The White Tiger Supreme Emperor, on the other hand, revealed a smile at this moment. He turned his head and looked at the direction where the black Tiger had disappeared.It was a good thing!If you kill me, you won't have time to chase the black Tiger.The black Tiger had escaped, but ... It had escaped well!"The chaos race will rise to power. No one can stop it!"The White Tiger roared madly as it charged toward the void behind it.He burned everything, including himself, the great Dao, and the universe ...The Four Realms had been defeated, but the strongest being of the chaos race had not died. He was still alive and would return. The Dragon Master was not around, but he was. He was invincible!BOOM!Along with the loud sound, the world became quiet. Kong Ji flew back, his body cracked, and the power of recovery surged wildly, again and again ... Finally, he stopped collapsing.Li Hao, however, couldn't care less about this. He shouted,""The empty silence swallows an entire world ..."With a shake of his body, two people appeared. The two Dao Masters were extremely weak."The two of you will devour an entire world!"He turned to look at the Thunderbolt master and said,"you swallowed two worlds ..."The Thunderbolt master was stunned.What did that mean?Li Hao instantly divided the four worlds. Without saying anything, he shouted,""Second cat, follow me!"Time appeared, and a long river appeared. Li Hao took ermao and crossed time and space."After you've finished devouring, come and help us quickly. Thunderbolt master ... You must reach level eight and eliminate the experts of the seven Worlds ... Otherwise, when the Dragon Master returns, he will definitely hunt you down endlessly!"At this moment, Li Hao had no time to care about anything else.He would let them devour the world of the four directions first.As for Tian Fang ... After the Crimson sun World was broken, he had already sensed that the Tian Fang world might be broken soon. Once the Dragon Lord returned ... He even had a slight feeling that the Dragon Lord was coming out!Void devouring, he would definitely reach Grade 7!Even if the two Dao Masters were not at the seventh stage, they were at the peak of the sixth stage. After fusing them, they could truly fight a seventh stage. If the Thunderbolt master could reach the eighth stage ... He might have a chance to eliminate all the experts of the Seven Realms! Li Hao brought along second cat and moved extremely fast. At this moment, the chess piece appeared with an extremely weak aura. "Where's mine?" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  “……”Li Hao ignored him.Yours?I've devoured your main body's universe ... Just wait.Now is not the time to pay your debt.At that critical moment, swallowing the eighth-tier universe of the Dao chess might have been the best choice. In this way, he could still fight, and his power had reached a peak. Although it was still the power of a thousand worlds, it was completely different from before!His speed was extremely fast. If he were to chase the black Tiger, there was a high probability that he could catch up, but ... What was the use of chasing a seventh-grade?What was the use of chasing a level-seven who had given up on the Dao universe?He wanted to go to the seven world region!Realm seizing!Killing a tier 7!The river of time extended, and Li Hao's speed reached its limit. In the distance, the battle was still ongoing. At this moment, the 17 venerable sovereigns were fighting fiercely!The iron eater Emperor was still thinking about how to help the Silver Moon King.But the next moment, Li Hao's voice resounded through the world."I am Li Hao, the king of the Silver Moon ... The four worlds have been defeated, and the fire Phoenix has fallen! Demon clans of the five directions, please don't misunderstand ..."Before he could finish his sentence, the long sword slashed down. The devouring power of the two cats burst out, swallowing the heaven and earth. A seventh grade venerable sovereign, who was in the middle of a fierce battle with the demon clan, suddenly froze. The power of the great Dao in his body was flowing out wildly!The power of yang and steel erupted from his body, Vajra!This was the Lord of the Vajra world that he had considered before the new martial arts. The Vajra beast was like an orangutan and had an extremely strong yang and unyielding power. However, at this moment, the power of Chaos flowed out and the sword fell!The king Kong beast roared madly, but it knew that there was no way to escape. There was still a seventh-level demon in front of it!At this moment, he roared,"retreat!" All realms retreat ... Go to Tian Fang ... Quickly go to Tian Fang!"Originally, they were evenly matched.At this moment, there was one more Silver Moon King, and one more rank 7 cat that looked like Emperor Cang. Suddenly, there were two more rank 7 cats ... The situation was reversed. He roared, and in his madness, his body exploded with a dazzling power of extreme yang. With a boom, the sky and earth exploded, and the rank 7 barbaric bull's body was directly blown apart. Its body was covered in blood, but it continued to roar,"Once the demons of the five regions leave this world, they're nothing! Do you dare to chase?"It was a deterrence and a threat!As long as the demons of the five regions were not willing to leave this world too far, there was still a chance.The iron-eating venerable sovereign wanted to say something, but the expressions of several seventh-rank venerable sovereigns among the demons changed. In an instant, the chaos beasts fled!The Qingqiu Fox transformed into a huge heavenly Fox. One of its tails was broken, and the entire world, the entire chaos, was turned into a land of fog!"Retreat!" A shrill cry resounded through the primal Chaos. To Tian Fang ..."One by one, the chaos thearchs retreated and devoured the world. The thearchs joined forces and drove the world away, escaping toward the distant Tian Fang!

Chapter 3307 Rain Of Emperor Armor (3)
As for Li Hao, he was also blown away by the king Kong beast!He turned his head and saw the giant panda holding the metal rod. At that moment, he roared,""Chase! Bastards, chase them!"However, two or three of the seven seventh level venerable sovereigns from the demon clans of the five realms were hesitating. Any hesitation would delay the opportunity. The iron-eating beast was furious!Bastard!There was a chance to annihilate all these chaos beasts!Idiot!The giant panda was extremely furious and couldn't care less. Three iron-eating beasts instantly appeared in front of Li Hao. The iron-eating Thearch quickly shouted,""Silver Moon King, use the method you just used to bring us with you. We'll chase after them ... We have to kill a few more ..."Li Hao was a little surprised. Without saying anything, he disappeared with the three behemoths. The river of time appeared and chased after the fleeing chaos behemoths at an extremely fast speed!At this moment, one kill meant one less!In front of them, there were still eight Level Seven venerable sovereigns in the seven ... No, the six realms. The leader was the Qingqiu Fox, who had lost a tail. Unexpectedly, it could not stop Li Hao's group.The Qingqiu Fox turned around and saw that there were only five rank seven venerable sovereigns chasing after them ... Li Hao was also a rank seven venerable sovereign.Could he still fight?It could!However ... Once she was entangled, the few venerable sovereigns who had hesitated before might come after her. Her expression changed slightly as she suddenly looked at a seventh rank Fox clan member in the realm. There were nine seventh rank venerable sovereigns in the seven dozen realms, and two of them had two seventh rank venerable sovereigns each.At this moment, he couldn't lose the realm or the great Dao universe.Someone had to bring up the rear!These non-Dao Lord Grade 7 experts were the best targets to cover their backs.The grade 7 Fox didn't say anything. When he saw the green Hill Fox look over, he rushed out of the world and looked into the distance. He roared,""Green snake!"A gargantuan green snake appeared between heaven and earth and walked out of the cloud snake realm.This green snake was not a Daoist master either.Obviously, he understood the other party's intention. He appeared instantly and laughed at the Azure Fox. The next moment, a mysterious light appeared in his eyes and he shot toward Li Hao's group!The Azure Fox's tail broke off one by one, and the entire chaos turned into a mist!The other six Primal Chaos emperors didn't say anything. They just devoured the realm. The six great emperors all shrieked and fled into the distance. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 The Dragon field had lost this battle!They could only save more kapok and more experts to meet up with the Dragon Lord ... If the Dragon Lord didn't come out, the Dragon field might be completely destroyed this time!The six venerable sovereigns were extremely fast.Behind them, the two level-seven Chaos Demons unleashed their full power fearlessly. Two level-seven Chaos Demons blocked Li Hao's path while the three iron-eating demons attacked and tore the green snake into pieces!Li Hao and second cat had also cut the Azure Fox into pieces! The iron eater Thearch roared and wanted to continue chasing ...Li Hao, however, stopped in his tracks and looked into the distance. The next moment, he turned around and shouted in a low voice,""Go, go back, tianfang boundary is open!"The iron eater Thearch instantly froze!The Dragon Lord is coming out?Li Hao had actually sensed it?Li Hao said nothing and quickly returned to his original spot. At this moment, he saw that the venerable sovereigns who had stayed behind were gathering in the diamond Realm. His expression changed slightly, and without saying anything, he waved his hand, and a chess piece appeared. "Let's first devour the diamond World! We'll recover a bit and use a rank 7 world to replace it ..."Dao Qi was a little depressed!Everyone had profited, but now ... I'm losing? However, at this moment, he couldn't care about that anymore. He would just recover as much as he could. Besides, the previous level eight world was already very empty. The diamond Realm had sufficient energy and didn't suffer too many losses. It was just that its upper limit had been lowered.The venerable sovereigns of the demon race wanted to say something, but Li Hao ignored them.At this moment, an aura burst out in the distance. A destructive force covered the sky and earth. Six divine fists suppressed the sky and earth. A roar came from the distance across the void!The speed was extremely fast!Behind them, the two Dao Masters controlled their great Dao worlds and shot over at high speed ...Even further away, lightning erupted, and the lightning Lord's aura instantly reached a peak, showing signs of transforming into a level 8 being. He was also rushing over in a frenzy ...Seeing this, the monster venerable sovereigns fell silent.Moreover, the three venerable sovereigns of the iron-eating clan had not said anything.Li Hao wasn't familiar with these demons. At this moment, he didn't care too much. He looked into the distance and said quickly,""Are you ... Going to retreat on your own or what? We have to leave immediately. The Dragon Lord has come out. At this moment, he might not dare to attack rashly ... But once he understands the situation, he will definitely fight us to the death ...""There are more rank Sevens under the Dragon Lord's command. There are more hidden ones ... We originally planned to enter the three regions and rely on the rank eight worlds of the three regions, whether it's light or cloud ...""But now, it seems that the clouds are gone, and the red sun is also gone ... The light side ...""Where are you guys going?" the iron-eating behemoth looked at Li Hao."Lightning territory!"Thunder region?All of a sudden, the iron-eating Thearch hesitated. The lightning territory was too dangerous.He had actually wanted to leave with these people. These people were also extremely terrifying characters. They had actually broken through the Four Realms, but now ..."I ...""We're going to enter the Thunder World. It's too far. Your world is too far away. Unless you leave your world behind and come with us ... It'll be too late!"Li Hao said directly,"from your side, enter the lightning territory. It's nearby. You don't have to go too far or join forces to resist it ... I can't take care of you right now. This time, everyone has their own needs ... The Dragon Lord might not attack you rashly ..."

"The mountain is high and the road is long, we'll meet again if fate allows! Everyone ... Farewell!"Li Hao did not say anything. When the chess piece swept across the world, including the diamond World, Li Hao controlled the river of time and instantly escaped with the chess piece and ER Mao.Very quickly, he caught up with Kong Ji, the two Dao Masters, and the Thunderbolt master, who was still erupting with lightning energy. Without any nonsense, he went straight to the point."The Thunder World has recovered. The heaven's path has opened. Immediately bring the thunder World and escape into the Thunder region!"The Thunderbolt master's expression changed slightly, but he was soon moved. "I'm about to reach level 8. It's about time. Give me some time. If I join forces with the demon race, I can fight ..."At this moment, he was rather bold."No!" Li Hao shouted in a low voice."Dragon Lord, you must be at the peak of the eighth step!"Eh? The peak of the eighth rank?Li Hao knew how terrifying the Dragon Lord was!The other party could sense time. That was the most terrifying thing.He didn't have time to say anything else. He controlled time and quickly arrived at various places. He took away the venerable sovereigns of Redwood who had provided him with the route to the river of time. Soon, he arrived at the Thunder World.The group of people rode on the Thunder World and headed straight for the Thunder region!He didn't stop at all!This time, it was going to devour the five realms!However, Li Hao was still extremely solemn. The chaos was much stronger and more United than he had expected. How many Level Seven venerable sovereigns had they killed?On the fire Phoenix's side, only one black Tiger managed to escape out of the seven grade-7 experts.He had killed six of them!Over at the Seven Realms, they had joined forces with the iron-eating clan and killed three of them, One Earth Dragon and one longxuan ...He had killed a total of 11 rank-7 powerhouses!Logically speaking, it should have completely collapsed long ago.In the end ... He didn 't. The other party actually escaped with the six worlds. This was the most terrifying part!Out of the 12 large chaotic worlds, five of them were destroyed this time. The main force of the other party was almost still there. Six sector Lords, no, including Black Tiger, seven sector Lords, plus Dragon Master, that meant eight sector Lords were still alive!This was the most terrifying thing!This time, Li Hao's side had tried many methods, but they still couldn't completely eliminate them. The demons of the five directions had also fought with all their might, although they didn't follow them in the end.……Tian Fang.At this moment, the universe of the great path split open.In an instant, all the grade 7 experts scattered.In the next moment, light, human King, and Emperor Cang also gathered and fled towards the world of light. Behind them, Dragon Master LED red Moon sovereign and seven seventh rank venerable sovereigns out of the great path universe.At this moment, the Dragon Lord had a smile on his face. He had killed Yun Xiao, a rank eight sovereign from the outer region, and two rank seven venerable sovereigns. He had also subdued Hong Yue and dealt with three rank eight sovereigns in one go!The trip to Tian Fang could be said to have allowed him to take a huge step forward in his hegemony!From then on, in the entire square region, only the Alliance of new martial and light would have a trace of pressure. The entire square region had been completely reshuffled, and there were only two major forces left! He was very satisfied, even though something had happened in the Dragon field!Two Type 7 Dragons had died.However, compared to the harvest this time, everything was worth it.However, the moment he walked out ... His expression changed.He looked at the Dragon field in the distance. His eyes were filled with killing intent. A terrifying killing intent spread out from his body. The entire world seemed to be frozen!Many things appeared in his eyes.In the distance, the six major worlds and the six chaos behemoths were frantically fleeing in this direction.On the other side, the black Tiger Supreme Emperor was carrying the Phoenix Flame and running toward this side desperately.As if sensing something, the Qingqiu Fox in the distance suddenly let out a shrill cry that shook the universe. The power of the great Dao spread in all directions as it wailed,""Fire Phoenix, White Tiger, King Kong, Green Fox, giant elephant, Earth Dragon, long Xuan, Long Ye, green snake, fire Swan, Tong Bao-eleven venerable sovereigns have fallen! The Silver Moon King Li Hao, proficient in special techniques, ambushed the Monarchs, and caused chaos in the Dragon field ..."BOOM!A Dragon's might shook the entire world!At this moment, a huge Dragon was hovering between the sky and the earth, and a powerful and boundless pressure radiated in all directions!The Dragon Master didn't say anything. He controlled the great Dao universe, took the world, and instantly disappeared from the spot!The killing intent even covered the entire chaos.The Silver Moon King!At this moment, there was only coldness and killing intent in the dragon's eyes!I've miscalculated.I know that long Xuan and Long Ye have fallen one after another. I thought that the Thunder Emperor and the monster race were restless. I thought that there would be some danger in the Dragon field. I also thought that there were a large number of venerable sovereigns of the chaos in the Dragon field, who were extremely powerful!'Even if there's danger, I can still resist it. I can bear some losses for the great cause of the chaos race!'However, at this moment ... He was in so much pain that his heart ached!It wasn't just one or two, it was 11 Level Seven venerable sovereigns who had fallen.The chaos race had suffered heavy losses. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  "Li Hao! Even if you flee to the outer region, I will kill you!"His roar echoed throughout the square domain. He was roaring and burning with the Dao of life, telling everyone that he would kill Li Hao!Li Hao, do you know who you've offended?Silver Moon King?New martial!A cold glint appeared in his eyes, shooting towards the light realm in the distance. They were on the same side!And in the distance, the human king who had just arrived at the light ... Was slightly stunned. He looked at the Dragon Master's side and was slightly helpless. He roared loudly,""Don't look at me. I didn't kill him. It has nothing to do with me. You can take revenge on Li Hao!"Why are you looking at me?

Chapter 3309 Rain-Like Emperor Armor (3)
I didn't do anything!Moreover ... Damn, was Li Hao really that crazy this time?He had killed 11 Level Seven venerable sovereigns?Tsk tsk!This was eating a big piece of meat!The next moment, he suddenly laughed and patted the light Thearch beside him."Brother, I'll borrow your realm as my base. Otherwise, you're finished! I'll call our people to gather here. Otherwise, the Dragon Lord will definitely attack light ... Are you afraid?"Was he afraid?Light Emperor's body stiffened.F * ck, I'm scared.I can't live like this anymore. Not only because I helped the human King, but also ... Because of my son!My son is with Li Hao!He killed 11 Level Seven venerable sovereigns under the Dragon Lord's command ... It would be strange if the Dragon Lord didn't burn his son's bones into ashes!He looked at the human King, and after a long time, he said stiffly,""Can we ... Match them?"On the Dragon Lord's side, there were two level eights and 14 level Sevens, all of whom were sector Lord level existences. The Dragon Lord was even at the peak of level eight. This time, he had even killed Yun Xiao and an outer domain level eight. With the power of two level eights, he wouldn't be able to vindicate level nine, right?Even if he couldn't reach the ninth level ... Even if he gave it to his subordinates to absorb, perhaps ... He could create a eighth level!Then ... Three level 8 existences?One of them was at the peak of the eighth rank!On their side, the human king and emperor Cang seemed to be on the verge of breaking through to level eight. It seemed like they had already entered level eight, but it also seemed like they hadn 't. Even so, there were only three level eight cultivators, including himself ... The key was that they were no match for the Dragon Lord!No, Wushan ... Perhaps he had entered the eighth step!​ En, in that case, they still had the strength to fight. A tier 8 might not be able to defeat the Dragon Lord, but if Emperor Cang and the human King joined forces, they would be able to match the Dragon Lord, right?He felt much more at ease after hearing this."How did they do it, Silver Moon King?"How was it possible to kill 11 rank-7s?Moreover, it seemed that these beasts of primordial chaos were working together. At this moment, there were seven of them gathering in this direction.Many of them were sector Lord level existences, yet they were killed by Li Hao's group just like that?He couldn't even imagine it!The human King rubbed his chin, shrugged his shoulders, and smiled.""Who knows! Otherwise, if the Dragon Lord had 11 more tier 7 powerhouses on his side ... Hehe, we would have suffered!"Luckily!Otherwise, he would have to run away from the four-sided domain.……And at this moment, the Dragon Lord's voice that was filled with killing intent even travelled into the Thunder region.Li Hao even heard it!He did not make a sound either, so it would be strange if the Dragon Lord was not angry. Dao Qi was still a little depressed. My eighth-tier world has become a seventh-tier universe. I ... Have suffered a loss!How tragic!Everyone profited, but I suffered a loss. Even if Li Hao swallowed his eighth-tier universe ... How could I suffer a loss?Er Mao has reached the seventh rank, Kong Ji has reached the seventh rank, Silver Moon has reached the peak of the sixth rank, and the Thunderbolt master is about to reach the eighth rank. All of the powerhouses who participated in the battle have gained great rewards ... But what about me?He really wanted to cry!As for Li Hao, while absorbing and digesting the eighth-level universe, he exclaimed how powerful it was,""Senior's eighth-tier universe is a little empty, and there's almost nothing good left ... I owe senior a seventh-tier universe, and I've paid it back this time. I'll owe you another eighth-tier universe ..."Well, I'll continue to owe you!It didn't have much of an impact on the strength of Dao Qi, just that he hadn't recovered to his peak."However, at that time, I really had no choice. I can't be allowed to go through another life and death situation. Otherwise, I'll really suffer a loss. It's still fine now. I only owe a seventh-tier universe, but it has become an eighth-tier universe."The human King and the others should have completed it ..."Li Hao suddenly laughed."The Dragon Lord's side is very strong ... But the human King's side should still be able to resist. I just don't know how Red Moon, cloud sky, and Chi Yang are doing."The situation in the four-sided region should be completely clear after this upheaval. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  The Thunder monarch, who was standing at the side, said solemnly,""We're still in the lightning domain. The primal Chaos lightning tribulation is very powerful ... And it seems to be targeting us ... We can't stay here for long!"In fact, he wanted to ask if Li Hao had raided the lair of the chaos lightning tribulation.Outside of the lightning tribulation, there was at least enough lightning energy to destroy several level eight venerable sovereigns. This was crazy!If he had not devoured the two great worlds, the Thunder World would have been destroyed by now!Li Hao raised his head and looked at the sky. The whole world seemed to be covered in lightning. He sighed with emotion."This Primal Chaos lightning tribulation has always been at odds with me ... Sigh, how troublesome!"I didn't want to.Isn't it just to let everyone undergo the Tribulation with me?Why are you targeting me?He could also feel that if he stayed in the lightning territory for too long, he might really be able to gather a ninth-grade lightning tribulation to strike him to death!"Focus on digesting what we've gained this time ... We'll talk after we've digested it ... Thunderbolt master, we'll have to trouble you to help us deal with the trouble ..."The Thunderbolt master was helpless, but he had nothing to say.This time, he was extremely polite.

I ate two worlds in one go!This was the craziest time in three hundred thousand years.Thunder tribulation ... Then let's go with the Thunder tribulation!It'll help me digest it!The Thunderbolt master thought to himself as he looked at the group of people in front of him ... He was speechless.
