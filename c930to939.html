        tes are running rampant, and the rebel army is also causing chaos. The official Army of the three northern provinces is also somewhat out of control. After the death of the North-guarding general, the three provinces fell apart. No one could control the power of the three provinces ... The time of chaos has come!"
         Hou Xiaochen said in a soft voice. Chief Steward Yu nodded, not saying anything.
         "Do you think ... I was responsible for kolon's death?"
         Chief Steward Yu did not say anything.
         Whether or not it was ... Who knew.
         "If it was me, do you think killing koulong and causing the three provinces to go into chaos was right or wrong?"
         "Whatever the Minister does, he naturally has his reasons ..." Chief Yu said.
         "No, you're a human. You should have your own thoughts. Don't just follow what others say!"
         "As a human, you should have your own ideals, your own dreams, and your own thoughts!" You are Yu Luosha and also Yu Fuyao. My thoughts do not represent your thoughts. What ... What do you think?"
         Chief Steward Yu frowned slightly and said after a moment,""Although kou long was brutal and suppressed the rebellions in the three provinces, I have to say that because he was alive, the people in the three provinces could barely survive even if it was a little difficult ... Now that kou long is dead, the three provinces have completely gone out of control. This is only the beginning. Winter is coming, and it's too cold in the North. Once the snow seals the city and the North Sea, I'm afraid ... Corpses will be floating for thousands of miles!"
          "The three provinces have a large population of more than 300 million people and more than 100 cities. By now, the chaos has already swept through one-third of the area ... The death of a thousand people in a city is not a small number. "
         "So, you can't kill koulong, right?" hou Xiaochen nodded. At least for now, you can't kill kolon. "
         "Kolon also has his own way of seeking death ..."
         Chief Steward Yu still followed his words and said a few words,"He has been in the three provinces all these years, suppressing them and killing people at every turn. The soldiers under him are also a mess, and he often kills good people to claim credit ..."
         "That's not important!"
         Hou Xiaochen shook his head,"the important thing is that he shouldn't die now. Even if he does die, someone should take over the three provinces. He shouldn't be like this, killing koulong without a leader and causing the three provinces to go out of control!"
         Chief Steward Yu was dumbfounded. What do you mean?
         After a moment of silence, hou Xiaochen suddenly said,"They all thought that Huang Yu and I killed him ... We didn't bother to explain anything. In fact ... We did come here that day, but we didn't come to kill him. We came to protect him."
         "What?"
         "The imperial family sent someone to kill him."
         "Ah?"
         Chief Yu was stunned. What did he mean?
         Hou Xiaochen sighed and shook his head. He didn't say anything else and just leaned back in his seat, deep in thought.
         After a long time, he suddenly said,"I know who came that day, the king of the plains!"
         The imperial family had nine Kings and thirty-six Dukes. The Xu clan was also a Duke, but they were not part of the imperial family. The imperial family and the Dukes were all members of the imperial family.
         The king of the plains ...
         Chief Steward Yu thought for a moment, and his eyes changed slightly."The one who founded the star military back then?"
         "Yes,"
         "My old superior!" Hou Xiaochen laughed. Huang Yu and I joined forces to fight him ... But we lost. "
         Yu Luosha's expression changed drastically!
         He lost?
         It was simply unbelievable. Yu Luosha had always felt that even if hou Xiaochen wasn't invincible, at least at the current stage, no one could beat him, unless they were people like the earth overturning sword who had unsealed themselves.
         However, he and Huang Yu had joined forces ... How could they lose?
         Hou Xiaochen chuckled."Don't look like that. It's normal. He was the one who founded the star Army, and he was a top-tier Martial Master back then. The royal family has been dormant for many years, so it's only natural that he's improved."
         "But ... That shouldn't be the case!" Chief Steward Yu said in a daze.
         Kolon was a great general conferred by the royal family!  A powerful supporter of the royal family in the North. Killing kolon ... Has the royal family gone mad?
         He didn't have much power to begin with, and now he had killed a Royal general who had supported him. Was he crazy?
         Who would believe that?
         Even Chief Steward Yu didn't believe it, not to mention the others. No one would believe it even if they told others.
         "That's right,"hou Xiaochen replied calmly," is he crazy? Who would believe that! But we ... Believe it! If the world wasn't in chaos, how would the imperial family reorganize and rule the world again? how would they raise their divine might and help the country? "Kolong's death and the chaos in the three provinces prove that the ninth Bureau is incompetent and they're also fighting for power. For the sake of power, they're even willing to assassinate the generals. In order to limit the imperial family, they even took action against the general who guards the border ... No matter how many people die in the three provinces, the responsibility is still mine and the ninth Bureau 's. If the imperial family can suppress the chaos, the common people will only be grateful ..."
         "The people are sometimes just following the masses. They are foolish and can only see what's in front of them ... They can't see too far into the future. There's nothing we can do about it. After all, if everyone is a wise man, then the world wouldn't be like this."
         "They will only see that because of kolon's death, the days that were originally still bearable can no longer be bearable ... Sigh!"
         He sighed and shook his head.
         Everyone in the world thought that he was omnipotent. However, who knew that he would suffer such a huge loss several times in a row?
         "The royal family ... Is too crazy!" Chief Steward Yu was in disbelief.
         "Crazy? No, it's just confidence and ambition. "
         Hou Xiaochen laughed,"after killing koulong, the royal family is seen as pitiful and sorrowful in many people's eyes. Even the general who supported them was assassinated, winning the sympathy of the world and having already abdicated. Why are you still forcing the royal family?"
         "The king of the plains actually didn't lose anything this time. The three northern provinces aren't too important to begin with, so why not fight for some opportunities for the royal family to make a comeback?"
         Chief Steward Yu frowned and said after a long while,""Then the battle before ..."
         "The king of the plains is also injured. It's a pity that we didn't manage to keep him here."
         Hou Xiaochen felt a bit regretful,"if he died, it would be the real big news that day. What's the big deal about kou Long's death?" After killing the king of the plains, kou long knew that the king of the plains would definitely rebel against the imperial family if he went to kill him! The nine divisions will definitely be on high alert. Let them fight within Heavenly Star City ... That will be the true peace of the world!"
         "It's a pity ... I failed,"he sighed.
         Others thought that the turmoil in the three provinces would be his chance to escape, but what they didn't know was that hou Xiaochen wasn't after this at all. He was hoping that the nine divisions and the imperial family would fight in stellarsky city. That would be his real chance to escape.
         It would not be like this, where the unrest in the three provinces could implicate Silver Moon at any time.
         Going to the central region was his last resort.
         If he killed the king of the plains ... That day would truly shake the world, and the royal family would probably not be able to hold back. However, he and Huang Yu had both underestimated each other. Although they had injured each other, their injuries were more serious.
         Chief Steward Yu was a little dazed now. After a long time, he said softly,""We didn't manage to keep that person. I guess no one will believe the Minister even if we tell them?"
         Even I haven't thought about the royal family.
         Not to mention outsiders!
         The crowd's words can melt gold. Even if it wasn't you, it was you.
          "It doesn't matter," hou Xiaochen chuckled,"I'm going to the central continent to visit my old superior as well. "
         "But ..."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "It's fine. "
         Hou Xiaochen shook his head,"I'm now a member of the nine divisions. If I go there, he won't dare to act rashly!" This time, we have entered the central region and stellarsky city for two purposes. The first is to eliminate the members of the three great organizations, and the second is to deal with the imperial family as one of the nine divisions!"
         Chief Steward Yu did not speak.
         Any one of these two points was an extremely dangerous task.
         And the Minister had actually gone to the capital with such thoughts ... That Tian Xing city was really a Dragon's pool and a Tiger's Den!
         "I'm telling you all this to let you understand that you shouldn't learn from the green peacock and the others. Ying Hongyue's thinking is different from mine ... I've let you be in charge of the night patrollers all these years because I hope you can think independently. You've done ... Well, right?"
         Chief Steward Yu revealed a faint smile that bloomed like an ice Lotus.
         As for hou Xiaochen, he didn't pay much attention to him. He simply closed his eyes in deep thought. Chief Steward Yu was speechless and didn't say anything else. The carriage fell silent again.
        
         In the darkness, a ship was traveling on the surface of the sea.
         It was like the kun Peng entering the sea.
         Some light appeared in the distance. Li Hao looked from afar. It should be flowing Cloud City, one of the three coastal cities. Further ahead was fenghai, and finally, Nandu city.
         He was going south and was close to the North Sea.
         At the bow of the boat, Li Hao walked out and looked into the distance. The lights were brilliant. The cities in the South of Silver Moon were more lively at night than in the North.
         In the distance, it seemed like he could see people on the beach.
         On the beach, there seemed to be a couple who went out at night and didn't return. He didn't know if they knew that the coastal cities could be attacked by Pirates.
         Perhaps, he did not know.
         A moment later, someone also walked up to the bow of the ship. Liu Long was very normal, but Wang Ming was a little dizzy, as if he was seasick. Walking out of the cabin, he looked into the distance. When he saw the lights, he said with a little dry nausea, "It's really uncomfortable ... The speed is very fast, we've already reached the flowing Cloud City?"
         From the White moon to the flowing Cloud City, it was a few hundred miles away. It felt like he had arrived here in a short while.
          The ship beneath his feet was really fast.
         Li Hao didn't say anything. Liu Long sent a message through the communication device,""I did see a few merchant ships along the way, even at night. I've thought that there's no ocean transportation here at Silver Moon, but it seems that ocean transportation is quite prosperous."
         There were still some ships in the sea, but Li Hao checked and found that they were not Pirates. Under normal circumstances, there would be a superhuman guarding them, just in case. In reality, if they really encountered Pirates, they would be of no use.
         Li Hao didn't say anything. The boat moved quickly, and soon, the light fell behind them.
         Wang Ming was a little dizzy, and at that moment, he was also a little smug."Moving forward in the dark, it's like riding the wind and Breaking the Waves to break through the darkness in the novels to protect the people! These people probably don't know that there's someone in the middle of the night protecting them in the sea, right?"
         Liu Long laughed and sent a message,"don't be too arrogant. Be careful not to meet Pirates. They'll scare you so much that you can't move. Look at you, you can't even stand up."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Seasickness. It's a normal reaction. When I encounter an enemy, I might even get excited."
         The two of them chatted for a while, but Li Hao didn't say anything. He just stood at the bow of the ship and looked into the distance.
         Wang Ming's words just now were somewhat imprinted in his heart.
         At that moment, he thought of the heaven battling Army.
         They advanced in the darkness, braving the wind and waves, protecting the Silver Moon ...
         Was it?
         He didn't seem to have such a feeling before he set off, but when he saw the brilliant lights of the flowing Cloud City behind him, he couldn't help but feel a little proud.  Do you know that there is an Army patrolling and protecting you in the darkness?
         It wasn't a sudden impulse to go out to sea in the middle of the night.
         It was just that these few days, some thoughts kept rising in his mind. Some thoughts were influenced by the heaven battling Army, and also by Hong Yitang and the others ... He unconsciously thought of some things that he had never thought of before.
         If the Pirates really did come to the moon ocean ... Would it affect Silver Moon?
         It was better to go and take a look ... If Pirates really didn't know what was good for them and came to kill them, they would still have to fight.
         When he had such thoughts and even decided to take the initiative to fight, Li Hao realized that he had been somewhat affected. Naive or stupid, at that moment, when he led his team out to sea, he really had the idea of annihilating the enemy.
         He didn't deliberately control anything and just let nature take its course.
         Facing the sea breeze and the waves, the small boat continued to travel through the sea at an extremely fast speed.
         ……
         In the blink of an eye, another two hours had passed.
         Another city appeared before his eyes.
         It was lively.
          The further south they went, the more lively it became. At the end of the moon sea was the North Sea. To the star dynasty, the North Sea was the North, but to the Silver Moon, it was the end of the South. Entering the North Sea meant that they had stepped into the end of the Northern Land.
         "Feng Hai city."
         Next to him, Wang Ming had recovered a lot and knew a lot. At that moment, many people had gathered on the bow of the ship. Everyone had come out to take a breath of fresh air and also looked at Haihe city in the night.
         "Fenghai city is considered a big city with a population of more than four million. It's also relatively wealthy in the South ... But it's still not as good as Nandu city! Because it leads to the North Sea, the sea trade there is extremely developed. It's also a natural crossing, and some of the goods in the central region are first transported to the South, then spread to the entire Silver Moon. "
         "There are not many people going south, only about three million people. However, the annual tax revenue is second only to Whitemoon city, and even more than that of yaoguang city. It is an important source of income for Silver Moon."
         "Going south ... There's also some of the atmosphere of a small central region. There are all kinds of fun and novel things. White moon City might not have them, but going south definitely has them! I've been to the South a few times before, and it's not just the Silvermoon people there. There are also people from many cities in the North and even people from the central continent. They all gather there, and it feels like an open port ..."
         Wang Ming, as the son of a rich family, knew this very well.
         "There's a night patrolman division on the south side. They're pretty strong. There are two sunlit, more than ten Yueming, and thirty to forty Starlight Masters ... It seems that they're not that strong, but strictly speaking, their defense power is only second to white moon City and yaoguang city."
         Li Hao nodded slightly.
         This force didn't seem to be much now, but it should be known that before this, when the Silver City had established a branch, with Liu Long and a Qian Douluo, it was already a top-tier branch force.
        
         He had indeed taken the journey south seriously.
         "Not only that, there are also troops stationed there. There aren't many, but there are about 3000 of them ... To maintain order on the journey south."
         "This ship is really fast. I suspect that Minister hou and the others may have just crossed the South not long ago ... It's actually faster to enter the North Sea by this road, but it's not very convenient to transport by land."
         Hou Xiaochen's group most likely didn't take this path, but rather walked on land, so they wouldn't go south. However, from their location, if they went south and passed through the entrance to the North Sea, they would be able to directly enter the North Sea province, which was closer than on land.
         As he spoke, Wang Ming said with some anticipation,"If we don't find any Pirates by the time we reach the South ... Why don't we go there for some fun? How about I treat you? The food, drinks, and entertainment there ... Were all better than in white moon City. "Moreover, the atmosphere isn't oppressive. It has the feeling of a commercial capital, unlike Whitemoon city, which has the feeling of a political and cultural Center. It's too serious ..."
         Li Hao didn't scold him. Instead, he smiled and said,""Is it really that fun?"
         "Of course! "You haven't seen the leader before. He's feasting and having beautiful women everywhere. He spends money like it's nothing. He's rich and you can have whatever you want ..."
         As Wang Ming spoke, he became more and more excited."Why don't I bring you out to play? the girls there are very beautiful and famous ..."
         "Cough cough!"
         Liu Long coughed lightly and interrupted Wang Ming.
          The more he spoke, the more outrageous he became!
         This wasn't a one-on-one communication. Wang Ming was about to burst out laughing at this time, and they were having a direct conversation.
         Beside him, someone was looking at him with disdain.
         For example, Hong Qing and Liu Yan ... However, they were all wearing black armors, so it was hard to tell.
         Wang Ming chuckled and didn't care as he continued, "It's true, Regiment commander. I said that after the patrol is over, we can go and have fun. It's not like we're doing it now. Why are you all looking at me?"
         He didn't delay any important matters.
         "Shut up."
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He looked into the distance. As the boat moved forward, there seemed to be more merchant ships on the sea. He could even vaguely see some lights. Some merchant ships were also brightly lit.
         There was no such thing in the White moon City.
         The small boat avoided these boats, and the more it moved forward, the more prosperous it felt.
         It was already late at night, but the lights in the distance seemed to be getting brighter and brighter. In the distance, there was a city that seemed to never sleep, which was very new to Li Hao.
         Yes, he had never seen such a night view before.
         After 10 O' clock in the evening, there were almost no lights in Silver City.  White moon City, on the other hand, was relatively serious and quiet. However, Li Hao, who had sharp ears and eyes, seemed to hear some music from a distance.
         Li Hao, who came from a small city, looked like a country bumpkin.
         In fact, when Wang Ming said he wanted to go out and play ... Ahem, he was a little tempted, but in order to maintain his image, he chose to silently refuse.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com So many people are here!
         However, if they did not see anything by the time they reached the intersection of the moon and the sea, they could take a rest at the South. The North Sea was too big and they could easily get lost.
         As Li Hao thought about this, he was getting closer and closer to that place.
         The city was vaguely visible under the light.
         What a bright city!
         Even Li Hao was surprised to find a city that never slept in Silver moon's northern border. It was midnight, but there were still many lights on the distant beach, even bonfires.
         There was even singing!
         Someone snorted next to him. Li Hao turned his head and saw Hong Qing snorting,""It's said that the North is already in turmoil, and so is Silver Moon, yet these people are still singing and dancing in the middle of the night. As the ancient saying goes,'a merchant girl doesn't know the hatred of a fallen country, but she still sings of the backyard flowers across the river.'"
         Wang Ming wasn't convinced and quickly explained,"This is the capital of commerce. The North isn't in chaos yet, and even if it is ... Going south, which is famous for its Harbor business, will be useless without these songs. Do you know how much less Silver Moon will have to pay if it's useless? Going south is an important port, and it's even used as a channel for transporting resources. Without the prosperity of going south, at least thirty million of Silver moon's hundreds of millions of people would have no food to eat ... This is no exaggeration!"
          "Silver Moon is poor to begin with, and it doesn't have any local specialties. It's only by traveling South that it's been able to survive for half a year ... What do you know? the song is still here, so you can secretly be happy. If it's really gone ... Hehe, then we'll be in big trouble!"
         What the two of them said seemed to make sense.
         Li Hao also felt a little strange. He glanced at Wang Ming, who was trying to defend himself. Was it really as he had said, that the singing South represented Silver moon's prosperity, or was he just trying to make himself look good when he actually just liked this prosperous scene?
         Of course, no matter what, Wang Ming's words still made sense.
         As the outermost Southern port city of Silver Moon, the entire Silver Moon would suffer a great loss if the situation there were to deteriorate.
         Hong Qing, who was still snorting, was a little confused when he heard this.
         Was it?
         She actually didn't really understand, but she felt that this place was too prosperous and didn't fit in with some of the news she'd heard. Hearing Wang Ming say this, she couldn't help saying,"Can the bustling South really feed so many people?"
         "How can this be fake?"
         Wang Ming sneered."Read more books and read more newspapers. The taxes here are heavy. It's not just the people of the South who make money from business, but the annual taxes also feed more than half of Silver moon's official system. Our salary depends on these. The central region hasn't supported us in recent years and hasn't allocated any funds, so we can only rely on ourselves. This place is also in charge of transporting some important resources, such as food from the other provinces in the North and the central region ..."
        
         "The Silver Moon itself doesn't produce a lot of grain because the winter is too cold. It's not as rich as the South, nor is it as suitable for planting. Silver Moon still needed to import food, and even though it was not a lot, they could not cut off this route. On top of that, our basic needs, such as food, shelter, and many other things, need to be transported to the entire Silver Moon. If we travel by land, we won't be able to afford the manpower and material resources. Only by going by sea can we save a lot of manpower and material resources ..."
         The young man explained the importance of going south.
         Without travelling south, Silver Moon would be completely sealed off, and he could only rely on the neighboring Linjiang to give him some alms ... However, the neighboring Linjiang would sometimes impose some restrictions and sanctions on Silver Moon.
         Compared to Wang Ming, Hong Qing seemed to be a little lacking in knowledge. Although her father was extremely powerful, Hong Yitang generally didn't talk about politics and hadn't trained Hong Qing in this area, so she was a little ignorant.
         In fact, Li Hao was the same.
         When Wang Ming was done, Hong Qing was a little embarrassed."I see, I must have misunderstood ... Yes, it's good to be prosperous here. The more prosperous the better. The voice is so good!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Wang Ming had originally wanted to fight with her ... But she immediately admitted her mistake. Wang Ming was startled and felt a little strange."You ... Why are you so different from others?"
         "What?"
         Hong Qing was a little puzzled.
         Wang Ming was a little speechless."Even if my friends know they're wrong, they'll argue with me for three days and three nights in this kind of situation. They won't admit defeat no matter what, won't admit defeat, and fight me from all kinds of angles. You ... Are really strange."
          Why was the daughter of the earth overturning sword like this?
         Of course, Wang Ming didn't know how strong the earth overturning sword was. He only knew that it was three yang, or perhaps early three yang ... If it wasn't for the fact that he wanted to strengthen his Foundation, he might also be in the early three yang stage, so he naturally wasn't too afraid.
         If he had known the power of the earth overturning sword ... This fellow would probably only flatter Hong Qing and not say these things.
         "You've already said it so clearly," Hong Qing said, puzzled."Why are you still refuting?"
         “……”
         You're right, so she didn't refute him. This person ... Seems to expect me to refute him and scold him. He's really sick.
         Wang Ming was speechless.
         At this moment, the boat was already approaching the port, but Li Hao didn't get too close. He just let the boat get closer to the beach and listened to the noise from the beach.
         It was so lively!
         Li Hao's eyesight was good, so he saw some people eating barbecue and drinking wine. It was actually a little cold at night, and the beach was even colder, but these people didn't seem to feel it.
         He could also vaguely see some long-legged girls ...
         Li Hao looked in that direction a few more times, and the boat slowed down a little. On the bow of the boat, a group of country bumpkins were curious. They all widened their eyes and looked in that direction.
         Wang Ming was an old hand, but aside from him, the others had never actually gone far.
         The White moon City was bustling, but to the people from the inspection Office, the bustling white moon City had little to do with them. They didn't have any money to be happy about. At this moment, each and every one of them was watching with great interest.
          In the communication channel, someone said,""Leader, this place is great. How about we come here for a day when we come back?"  "We don't have any money, leader. Can we get an advance payment?"
         “……”
         Someone said. In the public channel, the voices of others quickly sounded.
         Obviously, this group of country bumpkins was attracted.
         Soon, someone else said,"I'm not going. But if I can get an advance payment, I want it too. The cost here must be high. If I save a bit, I can buy a lot of things and send them back ..."
         They must be from the swords gate.
         Hong Qing's voice also sounded in the channel,""It's not a big deal to spend a little. I support the Silver Moon tax! The sect is not that short of money now. My father is the third Sun, and he can earn more money by working once. It's everyone's first time out to earn a salary ... You can spend some!"
         “……”
         Li Hao was speechless. Old Hong, do you know that your daughter is going to sell you?
         Three suns earned more by working, if this news spread ... It would be laughed at.
         ? Obviously, this person seemed to be attracted by the excitement.
         The group of people didn't even feel anything when the ship slowed down.
         At this moment, Li Hao turned his head and looked into the distance. A ship was rapidly approaching. There was no light, only a weak light. It seemed to be a Water-type super. He was not very strong, probably at the early stage of Dark Moon.
          From a distance, Li Hao saw something unusual ... The man seemed to be stained with blood.
         Pirates?
         It didn't look like it.
         He was a little puzzled. After thinking for a moment, the small boat quickly sailed in that direction.
         In the blink of an eye, he was close to the other party.
         At this moment, he could clearly see the face of this person and the fear on his face.
         It was a Water-type superhuman who was steering the boat toward them. It was as if he didn't see Li Hao's group at first. A moment later, he only saw the boat when they were less than a hundred meters away ...
         In the next moment, his eyes suddenly lit up and he hurriedly shouted,""Are you the Wei Wu Army?"
         He seemed to have recognized the ship.
         Without waiting for Li Hao to speak, the man roared,""Didn't the Wei Wu Army leave? Not bad, there's a pirate attack up ahead. A small town near the river has been massacred, and they're coming towards us. The merchant ship I was on was completely destroyed by them. It seems to be the White shark Pirates ... I was just about to go south to report, and you're finally here ..."
        
         He was terrified and uneasy, but when he saw the ship, he seemed to be much more at ease.
         Li Hao stepped on the air and quickly flew out to grab the man. The man saw that Li Hao was wearing armor, but he was not worried. Instead, he felt more at ease.
         "Pirates?"
         After throwing the other party at the bow of the ship, the man saw many black banners and felt more at ease. He hurriedly said,"Yes, Pirates! The White shark Pirates! Over at Linjiang, a small town was massacred, with tens of thousands of dead ... There are quite a number of Pirates, I saw at least 500 to 600 of them from afar, all supers, and some of them are strong. I saw a Shark Flag, that's the symbol of their leader on the ship. "
         The man was panicking and somewhat frightened.
         "Our merchant ship was not as fast as the enemy. They caught up to us and destroyed it. Luckily, I have a water superpower. I dived into the water and escaped. I immediately came back to report. I didn't expect to meet the Wei Wu Army ... This is great!"
         This person was both afraid and happy.
         On the ship, the atmosphere instantly froze.
         500 to 600 superpowers!
         So many!
          The White shark Pirates!
         As for this person, he was happy at first, but after looking at it for a while, he was a little puzzled."There are rumors that the Wei Wu Army has already left Silver Moon and followed Minister hou to the central region. They might have already reached the North Sea. You guys ..."
         He looked around but did not see many people. His heart skipped a beat.
         Only this few people?
         The Wei Wu Army had moved out together. There were thousands of them, so he was happy just now because they were not afraid of the Pirates.
         But ... How many were there here?
         The Wei Wu Army was a secret to many people.
         However, to the merchants who traveled by sea, this was not the case. This was because the Wei Wu Army had some reputation in the sea.
         "This general, you ... You are the Wei Wu Army?"
         "Yes, the Wei Wu Army's demon hunt squads!"
         "Are you sure it's the White shark Pirates?" Li Hao asked in a deep voice.
         "Um ... You ... You didn't leave with Minister hou?"
         "Yes, we're the ones who stayed behind to defend."
         Li Hao looked into the distance and frowned.
         He only wanted to meet some small Pirates, but the moment he arrived, he met one of the eight great Pirates, the White shark Pirates, and 500 to 600 supers, and the leader ... This was the real problem.
         "How many ... Are you guys?"
         "Just as much as you've seen."
         "We're finished!"
         The man was suddenly terrified."Let's go, run quickly. Inform the people on the south side and ask for help!" Otherwise ... After we're done with the South, I suspect they're here for revenge. Two years ago, the Wei Wu Army defeated the White shark Pirates "third commander, and their reputation skyrocketed. The great Pirates also gave the Wei Wu Army some face and did not dare to cause trouble at Silver Moon. Now that the White shark Pirates are heading in this direction, they must be thinking of taking advantage of the Wei Wu Army's retreat to take revenge on Silver Moon!"
          "Any later, it's too late. Those guys are inhumane. Once they go south, blood will flow like a river ..."  There were only a few of them, but the man's joy from before was instantly obliterated, leaving only fear and helplessness.
         Hurry up and run!
         Five to six hundred supers, ten times the number.
         Li Hao fell into deep thought. After a moment, he said,""How's their strength?"
         "What?"
         "I mean, do they have many three suns and rising lights?"
         "This ..."
         "If we escape now, how long will it take for them to reach the South?"
         "I'll definitely be there within three hours. They're not too fast and they're not in a hurry. There are even pirates enjoying themselves ... I rushed back with all my might, so I'll take three hours at most, maybe even faster."
         "Three hours to the South. Can we evacuate?" he asked.
         "This ... Definitely won't work!"
         This person was also an experienced person and immediately shook his head,"However, let's try to escape as much as possible. Three hours ... As long as we command them well, at least half of the population can be evacuated. Otherwise, even though there are only a few hundred of them, they are all supers. There are only three thousand troops in the city. Even if they all move out, they won't be able to hold them back for long. With top-tier powerhouses, firearms will be completely ineffective ..."
         "Three hours ..." Li Hao exhaled."Five to six hundred superhumans? you must be an expert in the sea, right?"
         "General, I ..."
         "Answer me!"
         "Yes!"
         "Then what do you usually see and hear? out of these five to six hundred people, will there be more than ten three suns? Will there be more than three people in the rising light?"
         "I won 't!"
          This person hurriedly shook his head."It's just one of the White shark Pirates. How could they have so many strong people? according to our experience, these 500 to 600 people could be the team of one of the three great commanders of the White shark Pirates. There's a high chance that they're the sea shark Pirates. He has a grudge against the Wei Wu Army. Two years ago, he was the one who brought people to the moon sea, but they were repelled by the Wei Wu Army. If it was him, he would be the cruelest, but the strength of his subordinates is about three to five people of the three suns, dozens of People of the Sun glory, and the rest are all below the sun glory ..."
         Li Hao exhaled. That's good.
         "He's the only sunguang?"
         "The probability is ... I can't guarantee it. General, you ... You ..."
         p Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"the port on the south side is an important one. We can't alarm it. It's easy to evacuate, but it'll be difficult to rebuild it!" When you get ashore, go and find...Forget it ..."  Li Hao looked at Wang Ming."Go south with him. Inform the night patrolmen's branch here. Inform them ... Send a message to white moon City. You ... Find chief Kong of the patrol officer and have him make a trip South!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Me?" Wang Ming hurriedly asked.
         "Right. You're familiar with this place, and your status is high enough. You're also strong enough."
         Li Hao looked into the distance and smiled."I'm just getting a pillow when I'm sleepy ..." He said."I'll go meet them!"
         "Those are the White shark bandits. There's a rising light expert ..." Wang Ming was very anxious.
        
         "I know, it's just a sunguang!"
         Li Hao smiled and took out a token."Take my token over. If they don't believe me ... Then we'll deal with them! Let the coast be under martial law to prevent any problems, and inform director Kong to come over. If he doesn't come ... Inform the entire city. If I have any news, immediately evacuate with your men. We can contact anyone within a thousand miles. "
         Wang Ming didn't want to go, but after careful thought, he realized that apart from himself, perhaps only Liu Long could do it. He gritted his teeth."Alright, I'll go! Be careful, if you can't do it, retreat. Don't act rashly, we only have a few dozen people ..."
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He threw the other party and the water-type super onto the small boat. The next moment, the giant venomous ship shot out like an arrow.
         At this moment, in the water, the Water-type superpower saw the boat leaving and was a little nervous.""General, that ... That was ..."
         Wang Ming Ming glanced over and was not in a good mood. He said gloomily,""Demon hunt squads! You will know sooner or later, with the demon hunt squads present, any danger is not a danger, so why are you so flustered? later, when we enter the city, don't give me a look as if your dad died. It's fine, the White shark plunder.......What kind of plaything are you!"
         Seeing him gnash his teeth as he spoke, this person didn't dare to ask any further, but still had some doubts in his heart. Demon hunt squad?
         He didn't know much about the Wei Wu Army.
         And what were demon hunt squads?
         But seeing the small number of Wei Wu Army charging forward despite knowing that it was dangerous, he was slightly excited and nervous.""General, will you be fine?"
          "I won 't!"
         Wang Ming answered sullenly and impatiently,"Hurry up and enter the city. What are you waiting for?"
         He was not of the water element, so it was difficult for him to display his full power in the sea.
         The water Esper didn't dare to say anything else and quickly moved forward. Not long later, they were close to the coast.
         Wang Ming had originally planned to go directly to the night patrollers 'branch on the shore, but when he saw that the nearby beach was full of people, he suddenly felt a burst of energy. He took off his black armor and put it into his storage ring. The superpower next to him was nervous, and there was a commotion all around.
         Wang Ming revealed his true face and snorted coldly. "It's the middle of the night. Why aren't you going back? are you waiting for your death? Get lost, I'll buy all the shops nearby! I'll be entertaining the guests tonight. No one else will be entertained near the beach!"
         "On what basis?"
         "That's right!"
         "So what if you're a superhuman?"
         “……”
         At this moment, some people were dissatisfied, while others said angrily,""We're going south. Where did this wild brat come from? so what if he's a superhuman?"
         In the blink of an eye, several auras appeared in the distance. A moment later, a team of superpowers appeared and looked at Wang Ming with some vigilance.
         Someone shouted,"it's good that the night patrol is here. This kid is so overbearing. He's here to cause trouble. Quickly take him down ..."
         The night watchmen seemed to find Wang Ming a little familiar, but for a moment, they were afraid of his powerful aura, so they hesitated. A moment later, a sunlight cultivator quickly approached.
         When the other party landed, Wang Ming couldn't be bothered to talk nonsense and threw out a token."Take me to the branch. Also, this place is under martial law. I have to entertain guests!"
         The person who came was one of the two sunlit experts who were in charge of this place.
         When he got the token, he was slightly stunned. He looked at Wang Ming and couldn't help asking, "It's ... Department head ... Department head li?"  Li Hao!
         The order was only given during the day, and the other party actually came to the South at night?
         "Shut up!"
         "There's a secret mission, so cut the crap. Hurry up and have people clean up the coast and close the port. Just say that the Wang family's eldest young master is having a banquet tonight ..."
         Wang Ming!
         This riyao also recognized Wang Ming at this moment, and his heart skipped a beat. Closing the port ... This wasn't a small matter.
         However, at this moment, he didn't dare to say anything.
         The Deputy Minister's token.
         Even though Li Hao had just taken office, no one dared to look down on him. He was a powerhouse who had killed six three suns in one battle. He quickly made arrangements, and before long, several Nightwatchers began to take action.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The singing on the shore quickly disappeared. Some people were waiting to see a joke, but in the end, the night patrolman came personally ... Some people were helpless and a little depressed, but they left quickly.
         Unlucky!
         It seemed that he had met some Big Shot. He was really bored. Why did he come here in the middle of the night for supper?
         He was speechless!
         However, in this day and age, in the eyes of others, it was not intolerable for big shots to do something with special privileges. The current star dynasty had a high tolerance for big shots who made mistakes.
         It was just a late-night snack, not murder or arson. No matter how dissatisfied he was, he could only hold it in.
         In a short while, the beach near the port became quiet.
          As for Wang Ming, he had already said something to that sunlight martial expert, whose face was deathly pale. White shark Pirates!
         Minister li had brought his few new members of the Wei Wu Army to fight against the White shark Pirates!
         She simply ... Did not dare to imagine the consequences.
         In an instant, there was only fear and worry. He couldn't help but transmit his voice,""Wang Ming, why didn't you try to persuade them ... Even if they're evacuating the people going south ... How could you let Minister li and the others risk their lives to fight an enemy ten times their number!"
         This was crazy!
         He was courting death. There was still sunguang.
         "Go south ... Retreat. The losses are too heavy."
         Wang Ming was a little dejected. Yes, he knew that it might have something to do with what he had said. He had exaggerated a little when he said that going south would feed tens of millions of people. Li Hao's decision to fight now might have been influenced.
         It's all my fault for having a big mouth!
         He regretted his words.
        
         Otherwise, if going south wasn't important, Li Hao wouldn't have taken the risk. Even if he was willing, he wouldn't have risked the lives of dozens of martial masters. Five to six hundred supers ... And the three suns of dawn were too dangerous.
         Wang Ming was a little anxious and a little regretful; he couldn't talk nonsense again.
         If something were to happen this time ... It would all be because of his own nonsense.
         "Hurry, go to the branch and contact Director Kong ..."
         He didn't say anything more and sped up his pace.
         At this moment, he still didn't know that Li Hao had already killed Xu Guang. The only person who knew was Liu Long.
         ……
         At this moment, Li Hao sped up.
         The small boat rapidly shot into the distance.
         Li Hao stood at the bow of the ship and communicated internally.""Everyone, keep your spirits up. Don't be afraid of anything. I'll take care of Xuguang, and three suns ... Leave them to commander Liu! It's time for you to form the ten ring Mountain-sealing formation. Also, one group is not all of you ... Be careful to avoid attracting more bandits. "
          Li Hao took a deep breath."After we defeat and kill all the enemies, I'll invite everyone to go south and relax for a day. It's my treat!"
         "The captain is mighty!"
         Someone shouted through the communicator, as if he knew no fear.
         Ten times the enemy.
         So what?
         If their leader wasn't afraid, what were they afraid of? if three suns and rising light were stopped, even if the enemy was ten times their number, with black armor, the sunlight wouldn't be able to break through their defense. What was there to be afraid of?
         As for Li Hao, he touched the Black Panther beside him and said in a low voice,""If there's only one suguang, you don't have to worry about him. Go and check around. I'm worried that there are other commanders here as well ... That'll be a real problem. "
         Woof! Woof! Woof!
         The Black Panther nodded, as if it understood. As for Li Hao, he wasn't too worried about the ambush. He could see it, but he was afraid that there was a powerful Martial Master nearby.
         Liu Long glanced at Li Hao. Ten times the number of enemies ... Li Hao chose to fight.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com There were still two to three hours before the other party would arrive at the South.
         If he waited, maybe ... He could wait for Kong Jie to arrive.
         An expert like that would be very fast.
         Even if it didn't work out, he could still make the people who went south retreat.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, chose the most low-key method and even told Wang Ming not to alarm the people going south.  At this moment, Liu Long's feelings were complicated. He glanced at Li Hao. This person who said that he wouldn't consider those things, was now also considering some things?
         Zhan Tianjun, Hong Yitang, and Liu Long himself all seemed to be constantly influencing this lone traveler who did things his own way ... Was it really good?
         For a moment, Liu Long didn't know what to say.
         "Advance in the darkness, protect in the darkness ... Protect justice, hunt demons!" He suddenly said.
         Demon hunting!
         In the team, Liu Yan and the others were slightly startled. It had been a long time since their Captain said such words. What ... Happened today?
         Even though they didn't understand, in the next moment, a few of the older members said,""Protect justice, do justice, and hunt demons!"
         At this moment, he suddenly felt a little excited.
         Aren't we ... Protecting that justice?
         In the demon hunt squad, the others had never heard of this before, and at this moment, they were also somewhat in a daze. Justice ...
         In the next moment, they were suddenly a little excited. Are we ... Justice?
         "Protect justice, do justice, and hunt demons!"
         A group of people suddenly shouted in the channel. After shouting, they suddenly felt refreshed!
         Li Hao, on the other hand, was silent.
          Justice?
         What was justice?
         I don't know.
         Am I protecting justice?
         Perhaps!
         In this era, there was no such thing as justice.
         Perhaps it was because he had heard that there was only one Xuguang that he had the courage to do so, or perhaps it was because he had heard Wang Ming say ... That that small city supported thirty million people in Silver Moon, or perhaps it was because hou Xiaochen had told him before he had left that the salary he was getting was the People's money ... He had to be worthy of all this!
         Perhaps it was the rule of the heaven battling Army that forbade retreat ... Or perhaps ... There were many, many reasons.
         However, the bullsh * t justice ... Could only fool children.
         He cursed in his heart, and after a moment, he added in his heart,""For the sake of justice ... Demon hunt!"
        
         In the darkness, a small boat was riding the wind and Breaking the Waves.
         In the distance.
         A large ship was brightly lit.
         Screams and cries of pain.
         All of this was masked by the maniacal laughter.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com On the ship, bloodthirsty Pirates were having fun. The swords in their hands were still stained with blood, but the cries of women kept coming from the cabin.
         The men were killed, and the young women were captured for pleasure. The old, the weak, the women, and the children were all killed. Sometimes, they would choose some children to join the Pirates. Under their influence, they were trained into bloody Pirates. They didn't want the big ones, but only the young children who didn't remember.
         In the ship, there were also some huge Thrones in the huge cabin.
         Hai Sha crossed his legs and placed them on the table. There was a bloodthirsty smile in his eyes as he watched the Pirates wantonly ravage the women who were wailing in pain. Hai Sha's smile became even more brilliant.
         Beside him, two women were massaging his legs while trembling.
          A choking sound was heard.
         Hai Sha smiled and was extremely satisfied. This trip had not been in vain.
         Of course, destroying a small town was not his goal. He laughed loudly and instantly suppressed all the other voices."Take it easy. We'll be crossing the South in a while. That's heaven. Don't be so weak that you can't stand up!"
         "Third master, don't worry. We brothers ... The Golden spear won't fall, hahaha!"
         Pfft!
         The man had just finished speaking when he was suddenly killed by a Golden Arrow on the spot!
         The surroundings instantly fell silent.
         Very quickly, a pirate with a fearful expression said hurriedly,""Third master, please calm down. This guy has sh * t in his head. Third master, you did a good job killing him!"
         The Golden Arrow was from hai Sha.
         "The Golden spear can't fall ..." As soon as the words 'golden spear' were mentioned, hai Sha lost control of his anger. In hai Sha's opinion, mentioning the Golden spear in front of him and even using words that he thought were a compliment ... This guy was simply courting death!
         Hai Sha laughed cruelly,"Drag him down and throw him into the sea! If you don't know how to talk, then shut your mouth!"
         No one dared to say anything, and soon, the laughter rang out again.
         It was just a guy who didn't know what was going on. To them, it was just a normal death.
         Hai Sha kicked away the two women who were massaging his legs. The two young women heavily hit the cabin and kept spitting out blood. Their eyes were filled with despair and emptiness. They looked like they were about to die.
         Hai Sha didn't care. He stood up and didn't care about the chaos in the cabin.  He walked out of the cabin and entered the deck area.
         At this moment, there were still many supers here, investigating the surroundings.
         "Third master!"
         One of the three suns quickly walked over and said in a low voice,""We'll be able to reach the South soon, but hou Xiaochen's group probably just arrived at the North Sea ferry. Should we wait until they've crossed the North Sea before we make our move?"
         Hai Sha sneered,"I did it while they were still here!" If they really entered the central region and destroyed Nandu, it would be a long time before they received the news. Now was the best time. So what if they knew? The North Sea was so big, would they chase him into the North Sea? I want to make them suffer and tell them that I killed them right in front of their eyes!"
         "If hou Xiaochen dares to bring so few people into the North Sea ... It's hard to say if he'll even make it out alive. He's delayed the night patrol's report, and there's been people who've been unhappy with him for a long time. Just wait for them to attack!"
         At this moment, he didn't show that his head was full of mush. Instead, he was organized.
         Yes, revenge. This was the best time.
         When they crossed the North Sea and entered the central region, it was no longer fun.
         Now, let them struggle and struggle whether they should enter the North Sea to seek revenge from hai Sha ... At that time, it would be interesting. If they really dared to come, the eight great Pirates wouldn't ignore the Wei Wu Army entering the North Sea. At that time, they might be able to take even greater revenge!
         All of the North Sea pirates would be mobilized to surround and kill this group of people, because hou Xiaochen was someone they feared.
         This was also the result that hai Sha had hoped to see!
         He couldn't wait for hou Xiaochen and the others to receive the news and rush into the North Sea. At that time, whether it was white shark or the other Pirates, they wouldn't be able to sit by and do nothing.
         "Third master is wise!"
          His subordinate, the three suns pirate, hurriedly flattered him. Hai Sha sneered,""Wise my ass! Don't give me that! It's better to kill more Silvermoon barbarians than to talk nonsense!"
         "Of course!"
         The surrounding Pirates hurriedly agreed.
         Hai Sha quickly revealed a smile."Silver Moon is poor, but going south isn 't. Two years ago, I went to the moon sea to go south. There aren't many cultivation resources, but there are many valuable things. After this deal, we can recruit more soldiers and buy more horses!"
         In fact, Pirates didn't lack cultivation resources.
         However, there were some things that were actually very scarce at sea and were more valuable. For example, armor, weapons, grain, vegetables ... These daily necessities were very expensive at sea. The great Pirates also had some means to Rob or trade in secret.
         However, small Pirates didn't dare to go ashore rashly. Robbing some merchant ships might not satisfy their own needs, but it was easier to obtain cultivation resources at sea. They were often willing to pay a high price to obtain these resources from big Pirates.
         The surrounding people started to flatter him again!
         Hai Sha's eyes revealed a hint of a smile. The White shark Pirates had over ten thousand members, and not all of them were supers. There were also some martial masters or ordinary people with special skills, but more than half of them were supers.
         Out of the three pirate commanders, he was ranked third and had the weakest subordinates. He only had five to six hundred supers. The big white shark had the most elite force and had three thousand supers under him. It was extremely terrifying!
        
         Therefore, even though hai Sha was extremely coveting and drooling, he did not dare to have any thoughts.
         Two years ago, he wanted to Rob the South and recruit more people, but he suffered a blow to the head. Hundreds of superpowers died and he was injured.
         Fortunately, he also had someone to support him.
         In the past two years, not only did he not fall behind, but the superpowers under him were also replenished, much more than before.
         One thought after another appeared in hai Sha's mind. He seemed to see a black shadow flashing in the distance, but when he looked again ... He didn't see anything. He turned his head and looked at one of the three suns beside him."Did you see anything?"
         "No, it's calm. Some of the merchant ships on the way have been destroyed. We'll be able to go south soon!"
         ……
         At the same time.
         Less than five thousand meters away from the ship, the giant chariot divine ship stopped.
         Li Hao had already seen it.
          He saw a ball of light.
         For him to be able to see it clearly from so far away, it was clearly an existence at the Sunglow level. Upon closer inspection ... It seemed that there was only one Sunglow. He couldn't see the other weak balls of light clearly, and he couldn't see how many of the three suns there were.
         This sunguang seemed to be only at the middle-stage of the sunguang realm.
         Li Hao took a look and felt much more at ease.
         A mid-stage rising light realm ... That would make the difficulty much lower.
         "Did you see that?"
         Li Hao asked in his armor. Soon, the captains replied,""I see it!"
         In the distance, the big ship was actually brightly lit.
         Pirates were generally more low-key. In the dark, they would normally turn off their lights. Of course, the White shark Pirates were powerful, so it was normal for them to be more arrogant. They felt that they were the overlords of the sea, so they were unscrupulous. This was why the big ship was brightly lit.
         "Get close to them now and find an opportunity to board the ship and fight! If you're defeated ... Jump into the sea and sink to the bottom of the sea. As long as you can hold on for a while, I'll find you after I've dealt with the bandit leader. Hei Teng is enough for you to survive at the bottom of the sea for a while!"
         50 against 500, a difference of ten times. Li Hao was prepared for his team to be defeated.
         However, the martial masters had strong defenses. Once they were defeated and jumped into the sea, Li Hao could find them as long as they weren't completely scattered or even thousands of miles away with the protection of the black flames.
         "Understood!"
         The captains responded one after another.
         Li Hao took a deep breath and let the boat continue to approach the other party. In the darkness, the boat was like a Hunter, rapidly moving forward in the ocean. The waves covered the weak movement.
         The group of black-armored warriors stood at the bow of the ship, nervous and expectant.
         Fortunately, Silver Moon and the others had fought many times before, killing the supers from the three large organizations. If this was their first time facing an enemy ten times stronger than them, these people would not be as calm as they were now.
         A small sword also appeared in Li Hao's hand. The small sword was no longer small and was about the size of an ordinary longsword. As it continued to absorb energy, the small sword seemed to be unsealed to a higher degree.  The closer he got, the colder Li Hao's eyes became.
         He saw ... A scene that he didn't want to see. There seemed to be many corpses hanging on the big ship, floating in the wind. Screams and wails could also be heard faintly.
         The smell of blood was also faintly carried by the wind.
         Li Hao sniffled. He was calm, but he couldn't figure out ... What was he up to?
         What do you want by killing ordinary people?
         Just to satisfy your desire to kill?
         He hadn't been in contact with superpowers or martial masters for a long time, but the superpowers and martial masters he had seen might not have had the chance to do so, or he might not have seen them ... But Li Hao had seen that no one would deliberately kill ordinary people.
         None of the three great organizations had it!
         Of course, it was said that the three major organizations existed in the central region and other places, or they would not have been named the three major Darksider organizations. However, Li Hao had yet to discover any massacres in Silver Moon.
         Thus, although he had heard people mention it before, Li Hao didn't pay much attention to it.
         However ... At this moment, he saw with his own eyes the corpses floating in the wind. The screams and wails continued to ring out. He even saw a corpse being thrown down from the cabin.
         These guys ... Were they all lunatics and animals?
         Ordinary people don't have much to do with our world. You can be high and mighty, or you can look down on all living beings. Why must you kill them?
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao still couldn't figure this out!
         Even if you were an elephant, why bother with an ant?
         No one provoked you ... But you gave them money and people, and you even had to kill them all ... Only then could you show your strength?
         The boat was still approaching.
          As he got closer, Li Hao raised his sword. He could even see the superpowers on the deck and the largest ball of light.
         It was a fierce bearded man, similar to Nanquan, but Nanquan wasn't so cruel.
         One thousand meters, five hundred meters ...
         The small boat was getting closer and closer.
         On the big ship, hai Sha slightly furrowed his brows. He felt as if he was being watched. He looked around and saw the waves rise and fall. He couldn't see anything, but vaguely ... He seemed to feel the same feeling he had two years ago.
         Back then, the people from the Golden spear clan were also martial masters.
         Just like this moment, it was silent.
         Of course, Li Hao's group had Black Phoenix, which concealed their auras and made them more concealed.
         "Did you see anything?" hai Sha looked at the person beside him.
         The man's eyes glowed with a golden light as he looked around. When he saw Li Hao, he seemed to have seen something, but it was unclear in the darkness. He wanted to take a look ...
        
         But the next moment, he didn't need to look anymore.
         When they were less than 500 meters away, the small boat suddenly accelerated. With a loud boom, it pierced through the waves and instantly arrived under the big boat.
         The speed was extremely fast!
         Hai Sha's expression changed. When he saw the small boat that seemed to have wings, he was first shocked as he recognized it ... Very quickly, his shock turned into anger and doubt. Wei Wu Army?
         How was that possible?
         Who knew how many people had been watching hou Xiaochen leave with the Wei Wu Army, so it was impossible for him to do anything behind their backs.
         Then why would the Wei Wu Army's familiar ship appear here?
         At this moment, a black armor soared into the sky. It was Li Hao's Black armor disguise. In the darkness, he didn't want to be too conspicuous. He rose into the sky and slashed at the deck!
         Hai Sha had also regained his senses. A huge saber suddenly appeared in his hand. His eyes were filled with doubt and madness. He suddenly roared and slashed out!
         BOOM!
          The auras of the saber and the sword collided instantly, and a loud boom rang out!
         A huge hole appeared on the deck and the blade and sword Qi flew around. The surrounding superpowers were instantly torn apart and the three suns quickly retreated as they were injured by the blade and sword Qi!
         Hai Sha soared into the sky, his eyes revealing a hint of ruthlessness.
         "Not a golden spear ... But a sword? You're not weak, I think I'm rich!"
         At this moment, he seemed to have guessed something. He revealed a fierce and ruthless expression."A Martial Master who uses a sword, the Wei Wu Army, and now they're in the lunar ocean ... Li Hao, right? I didn't go to find you, but here you are!"
         Yes, at this moment, he knew who the person was.
         The swordsman Li Hao.
         In the previous battle, it was known as the demonic sword.
         He knew that Li Hao was staying in white moon City, but he didn't expect that this guy would dare to come out and even take the initiative to come to him.
         Was he going to die?
         Although Li Hao's sword attack was powerful, it was only comparable to the rising light at best. He had improved quickly, but ... So what?
         "Hahaha, it seems like even the heavens are helping me!"
         Hai Sha soared into the sky and quickly charged at Li Hao. He slashed with his saber, and with a loud boom, a Golden Saber Light appeared in the sky. He was a metal-Elemental Expert and was extremely good at attacking.
         Just as he was flying away, several black figures rose into the air and jumped onto the deck that had just been vacated.
         "Kill!" Liu Long shouted in a low voice. Don't leave a single one!"
         More than 50 black-armored warriors quickly formed a team and charged out. In the blink of an eye, they were fighting with the Pirates who had just come out of the ship. The three suns experts appeared one after another. Liu Long roared and chopped down with his axe. The waves stacked on top of each other, and a loud boom was heard.
         One of the three suns that had been injured by Li Hao's sword energy didn't have time to react. Because he couldn't figure out how weak these people were, they were all the same. In the end, half of his head was chopped off by Liu Long's axe.
         "Kill!"
         Liu Long quickly charged towards the three suns. His black banner flickered with light and a rumbling sound instantly rang out from below.  Five small formations were quickly formed and began to fight against the endless stream of Pirates. The Pirates were all bloodthirsty people. Seeing their leader fly out and suppress the enemy's leader, they were not afraid at all.
         How many people were there here?
         They didn't think it was very strong. Looking at the destructive power, it was at most at the early stage of the glorious sun realm. They had five three suns. Although one of them died, it was enough to deal with this group of people.
         ……
         In the air.
         Li Hao's sword struck out silently. BOOM!
         The blade light reflected the void!
         Hai Sha was extremely violent. He swept his saber horizontally, and with a loud bang, Li Hao was forced to retreat again.
         "Little brat, you're still a little weak. Do you want to learn to be a hero?"
         Hai Sha laughed wildly,"he brought a few dozen martial masters with him. He knew we were here, but he didn't run. Instead, he took the initiative to attack us ... It seems that not all Silver Moon savages are as weak as hou Xiaochen!"
         At this moment, Li Hao slightly frowned.
         Very strong!
         Just now, he had merged the four forces, but he did not use the blood Blade technique. However, his combat strength was definitely not weak. He had improved a little these days, so his combat strength was still very strong. However, he was completely suppressed by this guy.
         This guy's killing intent, killing intent, and brutal degree were all better than Xu Feng 's!
         Mid-stage of the rising light realm, metal element as the main attacker, and a pirate who killed people like flies ... This guy was much stronger than Xu Feng.
         The Black Panther was not here. It seemed to have smelled something and disappeared.
         Li Hao looked into the distance. He seemed to see a ball of light, but it was too far away and he couldn't see it clearly. Perhaps it was just a Lighthouse on the coast. At this moment, he wasn't sure if there were Pirates or a Lighthouse.
         He was forced back by the big-bearded man's saber, and his eyes were a little serious.
          Intermediate stage of the rising light realm ... He had killed two of them before but this guy was much stronger than them. Was this a superpower that grew from killing?
         The sword instantly attacked!
         At this moment, Li Hao activated the bloody blade art. His essence, Qi, and spirit fused together as he stabbed out with his sword. With a loud buzz, the void seemed to shatter. A dark light burst out, and the waves below were shattered!
         Hai Sha slashed out again. BOOM!
         This time, it was different from before. Hai Sha's expression changed slightly. With a bang, he staggered and took a few steps back. Li Hao was also forced back by the powerful force.
         "Eh ..."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Hai Sha felt a little strange. After a moment, he suddenly laughed,"This is Yuan Shuo's famous art of the bloody blade?"
         It was obvious that some of Yuan Shuo's cultivation techniques were no longer a secret.
         The blood Blade technique was also well-known.
         "Didn't you say that you would die if you used this? You and your disciple are quite bold to use it as you please ... Perhaps ... It's related to the Li family's divine sword? Or is it because you have the divine saber of the Zhang family that you can use it without fear?"
