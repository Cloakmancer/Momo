        he had escaped!
         His cloak split open and revealed his face. He looked at Hong Yitang and laughed,""His Highness will avenge me ... You can't hide the earth overturning sword anymore!"
         "The king of the plains is strong, but he has to deal with the three commanders first!"
         Hong Yitang also coughed out blood and slashed down with his sword!
         BOOM!
         With a loud sound, Qian Feng exploded, but his voice still reverberated,""Hou Xiaochen and the other traitors ... They won't live for long!"
         The Wei Wu Army that the king of the plains had created had been stolen by these three traitors!
         As a loyal Minister of the king's residence, he hated the three of them, but there was nothing he could do about them. He only knew that a few days ago, the king had personally injured hou Xiaochen and Huang Yu, but unfortunately, he was unable to keep them.
         The battle between the three sides ended in an instant.
         In the distance, the white-haired old man sent the Black Panther flying with a punch and quickly fled. There was only fear in his eyes.
          Just as Li Hao and the others were about to attack, the Black Panther's eyes suddenly glowed with a fierce light.
         The next moment, a growl that did not sound like a dog's bark was heard.
         At this moment, a golden dog appeared. The Black Panther's bloodline was boiling, and it suddenly transformed into a huge golden dog. Its body expanded countless times, and it bit down at the white-haired old man!
         With a cracking sound, the void seemed to be bitten to pieces!
         A stream of devouring power came out of his mouth.
         The old man screamed in pain as half of his body was bitten off. The Black Panther's eyes were bloodshot, as if it was going to swallow the corpse. Seeing this, Li Hao hurriedly shouted,""Black Panther!"
         The Black Panther seemed to have sobered up a little. Its body shook for a moment, then it returned to its original form. It was a little confused, but it soon spat out the corpse in its mouth and quickly fell to the bottom of the sea. It sucked in a mouthful of seawater, washed its teeth ... And then popped its head out again. It looked at Li Hao innocently. What happened?
         I don't eat people!
         I don't know how this person managed to stuff himself into my mouth.
         Hong Yitang and the others were slightly shocked. Hong Yitang quickly transmitted his voice to Li Hao."This dog ... Should have the bloodline of an ancient demon! It must have been stimulated just now, and its bloodline is activated. Be careful, it seems to lose some consciousness after activating its bloodline ..."
         Li Hao slightly nodded and frowned.
         Very quickly, he revealed a smile.
         So what?
          At this moment, he looked around and felt a little regretful."Black Widow and that guy in the transformation stage actually escaped ..."  The light sword suddenly coughed up blood and gasped for breath. He said in a low voice,""I let her go on purpose!"
         Li Hao was stunned.
         "She's a Silver Moon Martial Master, and one of the thirty-six ... So I didn't go after her,"the light sword continued after a moment of silence.
         Li Hao frowned but didn't say anything.
         Hong Yitang tried to smooth things over."Even if we really chase after her, we might not be able to kill her. She was a Martial Master back then and knows our methods. Moreover, she's one of the people Ying Hongyue relies on the most. Her strength can't be underestimated. She might still have some trump cards that she hasn't used. On the other hand, that fan Chang fellow actually has such a powerful explosive treasure. I don't know where he dug it out from, but even an ordinary peak sunrise expert would be easily killed in an instant!"
         Li Hao was a little regretful."Actually, it's nothing. It's just that senior uncle Hong's strength ... Can't be concealed anymore!"
         Hong Yitang laughed."I don't care, and I don't want to hide it. All these years, it's just that no one can force me to use my full strength. Those who forced me to use my full strength were all dead, so no one knows about it. It doesn't mean that I'm afraid of anything!"
         In the distance, the Black Panther also swam over.
         Li Hao looked around and said,"forget it. It's all the same. In fact, there are still some experts nearby who are just watching from a distance. Some of them probably saw the result of the battle and have escaped ... The news can't be hidden!" Let's go and find a quiet place to treat your injuries. I also need to treat my own injuries!"
         "Your five sword forms ... Not bad!"
         Hong Yitang complimented him. Li Hao smiled and shook his head. "It's just a suture. "
         Hong Yitang instantly understood and nodded. Stitching ... Meant that Li Hao hadn't really fused successfully. Even so, he had the power to kill a late-stage rising light. It was clear that the five sword forms still had a lot of potential to be explored.
          "It's a good thing. It means he has great potential!"
         Li Hao was a little depressed at first, but he suddenly smiled and nodded.
         Hong Yitang was still the best at comforting people!
         The three people and one dog instantly disappeared.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Of course, the Black Panther didn't forget to collect the corpse. It was very worried at the moment. In fact, it vaguely remembered some things, such as its transformation ... And the fact that it almost ate people. It was afraid that Li Hao would drive it away, and then there wouldn't be any good food left.
         Therefore, he was particularly attentive when he did his work.
         It wasn't until the three men and the dog had disappeared for a long time that someone came to observe the battlefield. In the void, sword Qi was everywhere. Some of the light rays were even injured by the residual sword Qi.
         "The Silvermoon swordsman ... Is extremely terrifying!" Someone sighed after a long while.
         The sky was going to change again.
         One after another, Silver Moon martial masters appeared on the surface of the water, each stronger than the last ... It was a sight to behold.
        
         The news of the battle in the North Sea spread quickly.
         As soon as Li Hao's group left, all the organizations with communication systems received the news immediately.
         ……
         In the depths of the West Sea, an isolated island was floating. It looked like a celestial mountain was standing on the island.
         At this moment, an existence with a powerful aura was practicing fist techniques on the mountain.
         An expert quickly flew over and stood outside.
         The expert who was practicing stopped his movements.
         "Mountain chieftain!"
         The person lowered his head and a jade pendant appeared in his hand.
         The stupa Mountain Master looked at him and said calmly,""Red Feather is dead, right?"
          The newcomer's expression changed, and he didn't dare to say anything more. He lowered his head and said,""He's dead,"
         "The light sword has been unsealed for a long time, so I'm afraid it's impossible. Which Martial Master from Silvermoon has made a move?"
         "The earth overturning sword and the devil sword."
         The old man nodded slightly. The earth-covered sword ... Was not unexpected.
         But the demonic sword ... Was it Li Hao?
         The two swordsmen were going to rescue the light sword?
         "This group of Silver Moon martial masters ..."
         King Buddha shook his head. He didn't know what to say.
         After a long time, he took the jade pendant, looked at it carefully, and smiled.""Three people and a dog. They killed so many people that the North Sea trembled. That dog should have an ancient demon bloodline. This demonic sword Li Hao......He is indeed worthy of being Yuan Shuo's disciple. "
         As for his brother Chi Yu's death, he did not seem to care too much.
         "Mountain chieftain, Lord Red Feather ..."
         "You're too greedy. You're asking for it if you die. "
         "Do you think it's that easy to snatch the light sword's Windchaser's boots?" King stupa asked calmly. "I told him that the place was too close to the Silver Moon, and it was likely to attract some attention and cause a Silver Moon Martial Master to make a move. He didn't believe me, and he didn't listen. I knew he was going to die, but I couldn't persuade him otherwise, so I could only let him be!"
         The subordinate expert's expression changed slightly.
         The mountain chieftain had already expected this?
         King stupa did not say anything more. Instead, he sank into his memories. After a moment, he shook his head and erased the memories in his mind.
         Earth overturning sword, demonic sword ...
         Based on the information, the Earthcover sword had also reached its peak. The only thing he did not know was how many super locks had been added.
         Five?
         Six?
         Or more?
         Unsealing combat power was not something that everyone could do, and not every Martial Master could do it. First, one had to first fill up the Super locks, but it was hard to tell how many had been filled.
         The radiant sword, the earth overturning sword, hou Xiaochen, Huang Yu ...
         Many names flashed through King stupa's mind. They had all come this far?  Silvermoon's group was truly terrifying.
         Yuan Shuo had also disappeared.
         Yuan Shuo ... Where have you been?
         King stupa thought to himself and finally sighed.""There's no need to worry about it. Tell our disciples not to go to Silver Moon and look for trouble. If they aren't completely confident, don't cross swords with this group of people."
         "Yes!"
         The person quickly accepted the order, but after thinking for a while, he still hesitated and said,""Mountain chieftain, Lord Red Feather has been killed, we ..."
         He didn't even care about it?
         Wouldn't stupa mountain's reputation be tarnished then?
         "Yama, Fei Tian, and the king of the plains have all lost people. The most unlucky one is still the Duke dingguo's mansion. That old thing, his son and grandson were killed one after another, and five of the eight generals were killed. If we have to fight, he was the first!"
         "I don't know," King stupa said calmly."There are many undercurrents. Who would want to be the first to fight Silver Moon?" Silvermoon's group has long since been unwilling to become lambs for the slaughter and are all fighting back. Hou Xiaochen has entered the central region, Tian Jian has created sky sword sacred mountain, and BA Dao's whereabouts have already been revealed ... These people are all fighting with their lives. If they attack first, they'll just be asking for trouble!"
         A lamb waiting to be slaughtered, counterattack ...
         These words made the subordinate a little confused.
         King stupa did not say much.
         Those who understood, of course, understood. Those who didn't ... There was nothing they could do.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com There were too many secrets hidden in that land. The Masters were all eyeing it, but the Silver Moon Martial Master did not want anyone to step in. The previous test had cost thousands of supers their lives.
         This was indeed only the beginning, and it also meant that Silver Moon was unwilling to share this sacred land with them!
         King stupa had expected this. Silver moon's men were good at both internal and external conflicts.
         How could he be willing to hand over this Holy Land to someone else?
         The Silver Moon martial masters who knew the situation were all madly retaliating. The moment hou Xiaochen entered the central region, it was the start of the counterattack. They hoped to be able to set up the first line of defense outside of the Silver Moon clan.
         But ... How could it be that simple!
         As more and more powerhouses faced their bottlenecks, Silver Moon ... Would eventually break through this blockade.
         With the passage of time, superpowers were rapidly improving. Now, there were more and more powerhouses in the metamorphosis stage. Perhaps Silver Moon had a better way to help them take that step.
         As this thought came to his mind, King Buddha waved his hand.""Go down. The central region is your training ground for now. Silver Moon ... You can put him aside for now!"
          "Yes!"
         The person didn't dare to say anything more and quickly left.
         King Buddha continued to practice his fist art, but his heart was not calm anymore.
         In his mind, the Silver Moon and many people appeared again.
         As the leader of the Western Region of the martial arts world, he had stepped into the thousand warrior realm in the past and was known as the God of the land. He had swept through all the way and entered the Silver Moon martial arts world. He did not care about this so-called Holy Land of the martial arts world.
         But the truth was humiliating and unforgettable.
         No warrior from Silver Moon martial forest came out to fight him.
         Only the famous Yuan Shuo knew that the martial arts world's top dog of the Western Region had arrived. He was so excited that he challenged Yuan Shuo to a battle, but King stupa naturally disdained and even refused to accept the battle.
         In the end, that person took the initiative to look for him.
         After a fierce battle, he was no match for Yuan Shuo and his arms were broken. Because of the verbal conflict, Yuan Shuo humiliated him and shaved off his hair, making him a real Buddha and hanging him on the boundary stone.
        
         That day, he wanted to die.
         But in the end, he still managed to survive and ... Survive until now.
         "Yuan Shuo ..." He said.
         King stupa suddenly laughed.
         It's actually good that you're alive.
         He even hoped that Yuan Shuo would be stronger, stronger. 'As long as you're alive, I'll feel that the shame of my life will always be there, stimulating me to forge ahead. No matter how hard and tired I am, I'll never forget the shame and humiliation of that day.'
         The Buddha sacred mountain has become one of the seven great sacred mountains, and you, Yuan Shuo, have contributed a lot to this!
         I didn't expect that your disciple would be so restless after you disappeared.
         With the Li family's divine sword in his hand, I'm afraid he'll soon become like you, a Public Enemy.
         ……
          Buddha sacred mountain was extremely quiet.
         Central region.
         At the end of a bustling Street was a large royal residence.
         The plain Field King's mansion.
         80 years ago, the palace was a sacred place.
         Now, the Wang family's reputation was not as good as before. The nine divisions restricted the imperial family. Even the king of Pingyuan, one of the nine Kings of the imperial family, was extremely low-key. Other than the formation of the Wei Wu Army decades ago, there were no other big movements.
         In the king's palace.
         A dignified-looking middle-aged man was drinking tea and sitting on a wooden chair.
         After hearing the news from the intelligence Agency, he put down his teacup and sighed.""Qian Feng is dead ... I thought that he had entered the transformation stage, which might be a chance for him to break through. Unfortunately ... Damn it!"
         Unfortunately, Qian Feng, who had been loyal for many years, died.
         How hateful. Silvermoon and his group of evil creatures were getting stronger and stronger, and they were still alive.
         The king of the plains shook his head gently. After a long time, he said,""Go and tell Huang Yu to have Silver Moon send Qian Feng's body back and give it a proper burial!"
         "Your Highness!"
         In the hall, several generals stood still. Some of them were indignant."General Ying was killed, and we are unwilling ..."
         "Then endure it!"
         The king of the plains shook his head and said,"this is not the time yet. There are not just one or two silver Moon experts. There are many of them!" If the royal family were to initiate the war, the final outcome ... Might be the royal family's destruction. Even so, Silvermoon and his men might not necessarily die ... They could only wait! When more and more people enter the metamorphosis stage, they will all be looking for a breakthrough ... The news of a breakthrough in the Silver Moon land will spread, and that will be the time to destroy the Silver Moon martial forest in one fell swoop!"
         After saying that, his eyes turned cold," 30 years ago, I knew that the people from Silver Moon martial forest would be a disaster sooner or later!" I wanted to use barbarians to control barbarians, but I failed in the end ... And now, I've revealed the danger of the Silver Moon martial forest. "
         In the early years, he already knew that this group of people was a scourge.  Unfortunately, the imperial family's power was still suppressed too much. The nine divisions turned a blind eye to them clearing the Silver Moon martial forest. They didn't support or oppose it, but they didn't give them any convenience.
         Now, he wondered if Jiusi was regretting it.
         The king of the plains snorted coldly in his heart. He wanted to seize the land of the Silver Moon, but it would be difficult to take down the Silver Moon in a short time!
         However, if he wanted to rule the world, he had to first suppress Silvermoon.
         If he didn't suppress Silvermoon, how would he obtain those benefits, how would he advance to a higher level, and how would he re-establish the world?
         Hou Xiaochen, you people are still too naive.
         The overlords who had the ambition to fight for the throne would eventually charge into Silver Moon. If they did not pacify Silver Moon, how could they become human Kings?
         ……
         On this day, the three Swords of the North Sea struck, shaking the four directions.
         Hou Xiaochen, who had just stepped into the night patrollers 'headquarters, also received the news as soon as he could. He looked at the crowd in the middle of the welcome party and saw that many of them were looking down at their messages. He couldn't help but smile.
         There were quite a few department heads in the night patrolman headquarters.
         One official, nine Deputy.
         Including hou Xiaochen, there were a total of ten deputies.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com 11 Department-level experts.
         The most eye-catching of them all was the famous Huang Long, but hou Xiaochen didn't pay him much attention. Instead, he looked at the Buddha-like Chief Minister.
         On the contrary, this person's reputation was not as great as Huang Long 'S. He had never been well-known and had been suppressed by Huang Long.
         The night patrolman came from the inspection Division. Logically speaking, it was normal for the Minister to hold the position of Deputy Director of the inspection Division. However, if the Deputy Minister also held the position ... This was somewhat instigating a balance of power.
          It was obvious that Huang Long still had supporters behind him, perhaps from the head of the inspection Division.
         And the purpose was to suppress the Minister.
         Hou Xiaochen was still looking at that person when someone beside him spoke up,"Congratulations, brother hou. You've found a worthy successor. Yuan Shuo's disciple seems to be the deputy head of the Silver Moon Nightwalker. I've just received news that he's annihilated a group of bandits in the North Sea. Judging by his strength, he's probably not any weaker than those little fellows in the headquarters ..."
         Bandits.
         No one revealed the true identity of those people, and they all called themselves bandits.
         Even if Li Hao and the others died, they would still be bandits.
         However, at this moment, the extremely dignified Yellow Dragon sitting at the head of the table snorted coldly,""Lawless! It's one thing to exterminate the bandits, but I've received information that Li Hao, as a night patrol, killed Xu Zhen of the Duke dingguo's mansion! Although the imperial family had retreated behind the scenes, they were still nobles of the star dynasty. The Duke dingguo's mansion was also recognized as a noble by the nine divisions. Li Hao, like his master, was someone who had no respect for the law. The night patrolmen were established to deal with these people ... But in the end, he knowingly broke the law and ignored it! That Sword of Light entered the Duke dingguo's mansion as a slave and also betrayed his master to kill his master. Such a vicious person actually attracted the night patrolman to save him ..."
         In an instant, everyone turned to look at hou Xiaochen.
         It's here!
         Everyone knew that Huang Long didn't want to let hou Xiaochen gain a firm foothold. As expected, he had only just arrived at the welcome party, yet he was already being criticized by Huang Long.
        
         Huang Long looked at hou Xiaochen and said,"Deputy Minister hou, Li Hao knowingly broke the law. You're an old patrol officer and a veteran night patrol. How do you think we should deal with him?"
         "I'd better avoid suspicion and ask the Minister for his opinion,"hou Xiaochen said calmly. If it doesn't work, I'll ask for everyone's opinion ..."
         At this point, he smiled and said,"if it doesn't work out, we can just dismiss Li Hao. We can't go as far as to arrest him and bring him to justice, right?" I left that place, and no one is listening to me now ... Why don't Deputy Minister Huang send someone to capture Li Hao? I don't have any objections. These villainous people should be killed!"
         "What if Deputy Minister hou is sent to capture this person?" Huang Long frowned and said coldly.
         "Alright!"
         Hou Xiaochen laughed."Then I'll bring some people to Silver Moon to capture Li Hao, including overseer and the others. However, they're very strong, so the headquarters will need to provide them with some support. Give me a year, and I'll definitely capture them and bring them to justice!"
         “……”
         Silence.
         It wasn't easy to get hou Xiaochen here. If they asked him to go back ... Wouldn't that be like letting a Tiger return to the mountains?
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The old man who had been silent all this time coughed and said,""Alright, let's drop this matter! As for the Duke dingguo's mansion ... They haven't publicly admitted that the dead were their people, nor have they reported the case. We don't have the right to participate in it, so let them be. "
         The old man gave both sides a way out and said,""Xiao Chen has just arrived and doesn't know much about the situation here. In the Nightwalker headquarters, other than us, there are five other military governors who manage the North, South, East, West, and central regions. The northern military governor has always been Minister Huang Long ... Xiao Chen is from Silver Moon in the North and has just arrived. He doesn't know much about the other regions either. Minister Huang ..."
         He looked at Huang Long."Why don't we give the position of the governor of the North to Xiaochen first? he knows more about it, so he can have something to do. He won't have to do nothing and waste his talent."
         Huang Long's expression was cold.
         In terms of authority, the five military governors were naturally lower than the Deputy Ministers. However, in terms of real power, the positions of the five military governors were much higher than that of the ordinary deputy ministers.
         He was in charge of the night patrols!
         He had always been the northern Governor, but now that hou Xiaochen had arrived, that old fart had started to beat him down. He actually wanted him to give up his position.
         "Minister, isn't this a little inappropriate?"
         Huang Long was naturally unwilling and immediately said,'Minister hou is only familiar with Silver Moon, and I'm afraid he doesn't know much about other places. Furthermore, there's some unrest in the North now, so Minister hou probably doesn't understand the situation. If we change people rashly, the night patrols of the other 18 provinces in the North might not be satisfied. Governor of the central region, there's not much to do. Why don't you let Minister hou do it?"
         He replied,"the governor of the central region, his official name is the Heavenly Star Governor, in charge of the central region, but in reality, it is only in name. There are so many powerful organizations in the central region, the nine divisions royal family, a large number of King's houses, High Duke's houses, and all the major provinces are overlords. Who would listen to the Heavenly Star Governor?"
         That position was really nothing.
         The other four military governors could still be controlled. Even if some of them were disobedient, it was impossible for them to all be disobedient.  The old man looked at hou Xiaochen, then at Huang Long. He smiled and nodded,"Alright! "Then let's do it this way. Xiaochen has just arrived, and it's good for him to get used to it. Xiaochen will take over the position of the Heavenly Star military governor. I'll call the inspection Office later. It shouldn't be a big problem, and Minister Huang also supports it ... There shouldn't be any difficulty in this."
         Huang Long furrowed his brows.
         Did I support it?
         Alright, he was the one who suggested it. He just didn't expect the old man to agree so readily.
         He vaguely felt that it was not appropriate.
         The star military governor did not have much power, but he was the head of the five military governors in name. Furthermore, he had a lot of power and was in charge of all the matters regarding the supers in the central region. The old Minister had the will but not the power to do so, so he did not care much about it and had been hiding.
         If hou Xiaochen tried to take power by force ... It would be troublesome.
         However, when he thought about it, he realized that he might offend a large number of organizations. He laughed again. If hou Xiaochen really wasn't afraid of death and wanted to get involved, then it didn't matter. When the time came, he wouldn't need to do anything. There would naturally be people to teach him a lesson!
         "Okay, I will also communicate with the Secretary. It should not be a big problem."
         "Thank you," hou Xiaochen smiled,"I'm new here and don't know much. If I've done anything wrong, I hope you'll forgive me. "
         At this moment, no one was talking about the North Sea.
          The distance was too far for him to reach.
         Moreover, hou Xiaochen was also mixed in with them, so there wasn't much they could say about the Silver Moon Martial Master.
         After speaking, hou Xiaochen glanced at the old Minister, then at the other ministers. He chuckled and didn't say anything else.
         As for the old Minister's intention to have him fight against Huang Long ... Everyone could see and feel the old Minister's powerlessness, but hou Xiaochen would never underestimate this person.
         After all, he had been the Minister ever since the establishment of the night patrollers. He had been the Minister for all these years.
         One had to know that this person was a powerful expert back then. Otherwise, how could he have become the First Minister? and now, he had not made a move for many years and had been like a Buddha statue all along. Was he really a Buddha statue?
         Hou Xiaochen thought to himself as he thought about Earthfall sword and the others.
         These guys were crazy.
         It was fine if he didn't make a move, but now that he did, he killed so many powerhouses. What came next ... Might not be easy.
        
         Although everyone was afraid and unwilling to be the first to make a move, such a high-profile move ... Would also expose all their secrets.
         Hou Xiaochen sighed in his heart. As more and more Silvermoon martial masters revealed their true strength, the experts from all sides would be more prepared and understand Silvermoon better.
         Once they felt that they had more or less grasped all the information on Silver Moon, it would be time for them to make their move.
         Silver Moon ... There's going to be a great disaster!
         Give up Silver Moon?
         He thought in his heart and quickly denied all of this. That was the root, how could he give it up?
         It wasn't just him, the others were also unwilling.
         ……
         All parties were discussing.
         At this time, near the North Sea, a white-faced overbearing middle-aged man looked in the direction of the North Sea. He grabbed a person in his hand and said coldly,""Has the battle in the North Sea ended?"
          "It ... It's over ..."
         The person he grabbed turned pale and said hurriedly,""This ... This Sir, I was just passing by, I don't know anything ..."
         The middle-aged man with a pale face did not say anything. He searched the man's body and found a jade pendant. After checking it, he nodded slightly."Not bad. Earthcover sword ... This guy actually hid his strength."
         "Did the Black Widow escape?"
         He furrowed his brows slightly, but they soon relaxed. He said indifferently,""Forget it. There's no point in killing her. We'll talk about it when Ying Hongyue comes."
         The person in his hand started to tremble.
         After the man finished speaking, he casually threw the man, and the man exploded in the air.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The spies of the three major organizations were killed.
         The middle-aged man looked around. He had wanted to look for Yuan Shuo, but Yuan Shuo had disappeared. Then, he knew that a battle had broken out here. He wanted to come here to take a look at the light sword, but the battle had ended.
         At this moment, he was a little hesitant. Where should he go?
         After thinking for a moment, the man made a decision to play with the King of the North Sea!
         The number one Pirate of the North Sea pirates, the Starlight Pirates, whose leader was known as the North Sea King, seemed to be involved in this as well. They even sent an Archduke, but the King of the North Sea did not appear.
         As the man thought of this, he stepped into the air and disappeared from his spot.
         After the man had disappeared for a long time, a head emerged from the ground. It was trembling and mumbled,""Is that ... Blade Overlord?"
         BA Dao was still alive!
         No, BA Dao had always been alive. It was just that very few people had seen him. That seemed to be his photo. In fact, many people had seen it before. It was the core documents of the large organizations.
         BA Dao had actually come to the vicinity of the North Sea!
          The spy in the dark was a little shocked, and judging from his strength, he was very strong.  First, it was the earth overturning sword, then it was BA Dao, and then Silver Moon martial forest. How many more experts were hidden?
         He quickly started to type the words and prepared to send a message back. BA Dao had appeared nearby ...
         He had just used a trace of his superpower ... BOOM!
         With a loud bang, a burst of saber Qi exploded, instantly destroying everything, including the people underground.
         In the distance, the middle-aged man who had already left looked back with a cold look in his eyes. He couldn't be bothered to look any longer and disappeared in an instant. Who didn't know that the Overlord's blade couldn't be seen!
         At this moment, less than a hundred miles away from BA Dao ...
         A refined man raised his head and glanced in a certain direction. He seemed to have felt something. Very quickly, he shook his head with a smile and did not pay any more attention. Instead, he looked at the person in front of him who was retreating warily.
         "Miss Spider, I haven't seen you for many years. How are you?"
         Black Widow, who was wearing a mask, broke out in a cold sweat. At this moment, she was even more frightened than when she saw the Earthcover sword. She suppressed the fear in her heart."Fortunately, Red Moon has been looking for you, hoping to work together with you ..."
         "The girl isn't very honest."
         The refined man smiled."You just know how to scare me with Ying Hongyue. I didn't do anything. I don't like to kill innocent people, let alone an old friend." I heard that the light sword was besieged, so I came to take a look ... Did the girl besiege her? We're all old friends ..."
         "No... I didn't ..."
         "Sister, you're still not honest!"
         The refined man laughed again."I've already received the news. Look! I have this too!"
         He took out a jade pendant."Little sister, I heard that you're a fast runner. You were the first one to run. That's how I found out that you were involved. Otherwise, I don't believe that Spider Girl would have ganged up on the Silver Moon Martial Master with the others." "You can kill yourself, but others can 't. Have you forgotten? Ying Hongyue has led you astray all these years ..."
         "I was just watching and did not use my full strength. I was just surprised by the power of the light sword and wanted to test it out ..." Black widow's face was covered in cold sweat.
          "You, you're full of lies!"
         The refined man shook his head and sighed,""Forget it, I won't argue with you. We're old friends."
         Black Widow was shocked and hurriedly said,""Then I'll be leaving first, please come another day if you have time ..."
         "He left?"
         The refined-looking man laughed."Alright, but you've broken the rules a little. I'm a man who follows the rules ... I'll give you a punch so that you'll remember. Ying Hongyue killing Yuan Shuo was only done by an internal member of Hongyue. When did she gang up on him with an outsider ... How unruly!"
         "No..."
         The Black Spider was terrified and instantly fled!
         This powerhouse at the peak of the rising light was even more terrified than when he was being chased by the light sword. He rose into the air and instantly fled.
         As for the man, he sighed and punched!
         It was light, but Grand, without any complications.
        
         BOOM!
         A fist descended from the sky with a majestic aura. It was even more powerful than the sword of the earth overturning sword.
         BOOM!
         A huge boom rang out as the fist descended.
         With another boom, black spider was smashed to the ground. Her mask shattered, revealing her beautiful face. At this moment, she was spitting out blood. Her eyes were filled with shock. A fist mark appeared on her chest. All her bones were broken, and more than half of her internal organs were shattered.
         Most of his powers ... Had also dissipated.
         Black spider's face was filled with despair. In the distance, the refined man smiled."Alright, that's the rule. You won't die. Go back and eat more tonics. Next time, remember not to hook up with those people outside. In the past, I liked to hook up with people from the Silver Moon. Now, I'm even hooking up with outsiders ... What a loser!"
         "Gulp ..."
         Blood gushed out. Black Widow seemed to want to say something, but she could not. At this moment, she only felt that she was about to die completely. There was only fear and panic in her eyes.
         Northern fist!
         This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com She knew that the northern fist must be very strong, but she didn't expect that just one punch ... Would almost kill her. She didn't have the power to fight back at all. Just how far had the northern fist reached?
         Where had he been all these years?
         Why is it also appearing nearby now?
         The refined man no longer paid attention to her. He looked around and thought about it again and again before sighing,""Forget it. I won't go back to Silver Moon. It's not convenient for me to make a big fuss over there. I heard that Yuan Shuo has left the mountain, so I wanted to see him, but he's gone. BA Dao might be nearby as well ... I can't be bothered to make contact with him."
         "I heard that King Buddha is still alive, and he even made a sacred mountain or something ... Sky sword is the same ... I'll go and have a chat with them ... By the way, I heard that my younger brother He Yong has joined the royal family and become a Lackey?"
         "Cough cough ..."
         Blood gushed out, but Black Widow could not reply. On the other hand, North fist glanced at her and frowned slightly."You really have no rules. My ranking was higher than yours back then. I asked you, but you didn't even reply to me. Do you want to take another punch from me?"
         The Black Widow's Eyes were instantly filled with fear. Enduring the intense pain in her internal organs, she struggled and spoke with difficulty,""In ... The southern Fist ... The southern Fist is in the royal family ..."
         This was more like it!
         The refined middle-aged man nodded and smiled."Then I'll go and see my little brother. You send the news back and ask that pretty boy Hongyue to chat with me. I haven't seen him for many years. I want to see if he's still as handsome as before. Every time I see his face, I want to smash it. I hate people who are more handsome than me!"
         “……”
         Black Widow did not dare to say anything more and only nodded.
         Bei Quan didn't make things difficult for her. He smiled and waved his hand."Then I'll take my leave first. Sister, go back and tell that pretty boy at home that it's better if his powers are crippled. Why do you need to train in superpowers? it's a waste of time. Martial arts is the right path!"
         With that, he walked away. He didn't walk quickly, but he disappeared in the blink of an eye.
         Black Widow waited for a long time before she took out some pills and consumed them quickly. She felt like crying, but no tears came out. This punch had broken countless bones and her internal organs were seriously injured ... Without the water of the spring of life, her injuries would probably not recover.
         Fortunately, Northern fist only gave him one punch. If he were to receive another punch ... He would probably really die.
         He sighed in his heart. These people ...
         With an indescribable feeling, he eventually sighed and struggled to leave. It seemed that he would have to delay his visit to Silver Moon. Otherwise, given the current situation, even if Huang Yu and the others did not make things difficult for him, Li Hao might just kill him.
         The northern fist appeared, BA Dao appeared, sky sword, earth-covered sword, Yuan Shuo, Azure light sword, and the others appeared.
         Black Widow knew that the world was about to fall into chaos.
         With the appearance of these people, even if the other parties did not look for them, they might take the initiative to attack.
         ……
         At the same time.
         Li Hao's group of three also quickly disappeared into the North Sea.
         North Sea province.
         The three northern provinces were in turmoil. However, the capital of the Beihai province, the sea breeze city, was still peaceful.
         Sea breeze city, suburbs, in a large hotel.
         The Earthcover sword had reserved a small villa, which was close to the coast and had beautiful scenery.
         At this moment, divine power stones appeared one after another. There was also a huge divine power Stone that was taken out by the earth-overturning sword. At this moment, Hong Yitang couldn't help but sigh. There was only one stone left!
         The treasures he picked up in heaven battling city that day, one piece was given to the southern Fist sect, one piece was now used, and the spring of life was also used. The opportunity ... Was gone just like that.
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He simply stabbed his sword into the largest divine power Stone.
          If he wanted to give the earth overturning sword ... He had no choice.  Silver Moon paid him quite a number of divine power stones. As Li Hao absorbed the stones, he said,""For this rescue, the government has provided us with a lot of resources. I'm not in the mood to go to the North Sea to save people. It's all paid by the government ... I'll make it clear first, but the quality of the divine power stones given by the government is too poor, and the effect is average. So, count the one you took as the tip of the Sword of Light. I don't want to admit it,"
         He was direct and straightforward.
         As for the light sword, he did not say anything and only nodded slightly.
         Li Hao continued,"therefore, you don't need to remember my favor. The government paid for the suppression of the riot in your body. I also agreed to it when you threatened me that day ... After this matter is over, there is no longer any connection between you and me ... The matter of you deceiving me that day still counts!"
         The light sword was still silent.
         "It's just a small matter ..."Hong Yitang coughed lightly.
         Li Hao didn't reply. Sword energy gushed out, and the light sword began to absorb it rapidly.
         The three of them stopped talking.
         They no longer had the tacit understanding they had before. Cooperating to kill was killing, but the personal grudges would not be resolved just like that.
         While Li Hao released his sword energy, he kicked the Black Panther.
         Heibao looked at him innocently.
         Li Hao glared at it!
         That's enough. You're too much. He's about to die, but you're still absorbing the sword energy. This dog is really black-hearted!
         The light sword, on the other hand, opened its eyes and looked at the Black Panther. It coughed,""This big demon has saved me before. I'll pay for all the expenses and how much it absorbed ... I'm not as poor as you think ... I've worked for Duke dingguo's mansion for 20 years. It's not like I don't have any savings ..."
         Rich?
         Li Hao's eyes flickered. In an instant, a large number of swords surged toward the Black Panther.
         Sword of Light's mouth twitched and he closed his eyes.
         The Black Panther was also very happy. It quickly started to absorb the energy.
         An entire piece of divine power Stone was used up, but it was far from enough.
         This time, the light sword's Super Lock was broken too badly. Fortunately, this old man ... This old lady still had some connections and was protected by a special power of light. She also absorbed a drop of the spring of life. Otherwise, Li Hao might not have been able to save her.
         Even so, the consumption was huge.
         Other than absorbing a large divine power Stone, Li Hao kept breaking divine power stones. One hundred, two hundred, five hundred ...
         They were all crushed.
         Only after breaking about 3000 pieces did the light sword's absorption speed slow down.
         As for Li Hao, he continued to break. This time, he provided it to Hong Yitang, and Hong Yitang accepted it without hesitation. He absorbed as much as Li Hao appeared. It was like a bottomless pit.
         Li Hao himself was also constantly breaking and absorbing.
         On one hand, he had to heal himself. On the other hand, he had to rapidly absorb a large amount of sword energy into his body to replenish his superpower lock.
         His five viscera ultra-power lock was not full after absorbing tens of thousands of cubic meters of elemental energy from his heart. He took this opportunity to absorb some sword energy and try to fill it.
         The three people and one dog continued to absorb the energy without any limits.
         Gradually, more and more divine power stones were broken and absorbed by them.
          The divine power that was seeping out of the divine power Stone attracted some people's attention ...
         However, when one of the three suns received the news and approached this place, he felt the sword intent ... And instantly fled. In an instant, the entire world became quiet, and the nearby residents also disappeared.
         At this moment, the upper echelons of North Sea finally knew who was living here.
         However, no one dared to do anything.
         Many high-level officials had received the news of the Battle of the North Sea.
         If they didn't send more powerhouses in the transformation stage to deal with these people, there would be no hope at all. Even if North Sea emptied all their resources, they probably wouldn't be able to deal with these people.
         After this battle, the fame of the earth overturning sword and the Sword of Light had spread throughout the entire dynasty.
         Li Hao, on the other hand, was slightly inferior, but his reputation had risen again.
         Li Hao was able to kill a late-stage suguang. Previously, when he killed the second commander of the White shark Pirates, some people didn't believe it and thought that it was just a rumor or someone from Silver Moon had made a move. But this time, he killed Xu Zhen in front of so many people. No one doubted Li Hao's strength anymore.
         The only pity was that this time, his master did not receive any news. The ruins had cut off all communication.
        
         The repair this time took a long time.
         After a day and a night, the divine power Stone fragments around Li Hao had almost piled up into a mountain.
         In addition to Hong Yitang's big stone, Li Hao had also used up 8000 divine power stones!
         Yes, eight thousand!
         Previously, Li Hao had almost used up the 10000 gold coins that the officials had given him as a deposit.
         Including Hong Yitang 's, more than ten thousand divine power stones were consumed this time. This was a terrifying number. Light sword wasn't the only one who absorbed it. Li Hao and the others also absorbed a lot.
         Not only that, there was actually quite a lot of it in the small sword, so he did not have to replenish it every time before he could use it.
         In any case, he had spent it for the light sword to see.
         He wanted to let the light sword know how much they had spent on this. As for the official deposit, it was not enough.
         As for Li Hao, he had absorbed a lot of sword energy and integrated it into the heart Super Lock, but he still didn't feel full.
          This made Li Hao very tired.
         In other words, he couldn't unseal himself like the others to increase his battle prowess ... How frustrating. He wasn't weak now, and if he could unseal himself, not only would he surpass Xu Guang, but he would also be able to fight against those in the metamorphosis stage, right?
         What a pity!
         Everyone else could do it, but he couldn 't. Was it because he had too much potential, or was it because he just couldn' t?
         In order to unseal their combat power, they had to be at least saturated with one superpower lock or even more. It seemed like Nan Quan and the others had to fill up their four limbs 'superpower locks first, so they usually had at least four.
         Only in this way could the seal be undone.
         The light sword had unlocked five of her organs 'superpower locks, but that didn't mean that all five organs were full. Li Hao judged that it was possible to unlock the sword after one organ was full. The only difference was the strength after the unlocking.
         As for Hong Yitang, it should be quite full.
         Otherwise, it was impossible for him to be so calm every time. After unsealing, he should be able to suppress his strength more easily. The more saturated he was, the easier it would be to control his strength after unsealing.
         ……
         After a day and a night.
         The sky brightened again, and everyone opened their eyes.
         The Sword of Light exhaled a long breath that was mixed with blood. It looked at Li Hao and Hong Yitang and said,""I have to thank you both this time!"
         Hong Yitang didn't say anything, but reminded him,""You owe me three thousand divine power stones. Just remember ..."
         It was the same price as the southern Fist.
         He didn't raise the price.
         As for the portion he absorbed, he would treat it as a labor fee. He usually didn't count it in. It wasn't too much to ask for a labor fee after a battle.
         The radiant sword didn't say anything and took out a storage ring. "I'll remember the favor. These divine power stones should be enough. "
          Hong Yitang didn't stand on ceremony and took it directly. After examining it, he smiled. "It's only more, not less. Okay, then there's no debt. He's more reliable than He Yong. That guy owes money and doesn't want to pay it back. He's not a good person." This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao was also surprised. He was really rich!
         Three thousand, there was only more and no less. He gave it away just like that. This light sword was something that he had profited from the high Duke's public house.
         The Sword of Light saw Li Hao looking at him and said,""This is the storage ring that I got from killing the high Duke's public house's generals. The five of you have quite a bit of savings."
         The five powerhouses of the rising sun Peak were all generals.
         Just this point alone was enough.
         "The Silver Moon officials can deal with that," said the luminous blade."I'll make up for what you've just used up, but I don't have that many divine power stones on hand ..."
         Li Hao didn't stand on ceremony."Then forget it. As for the spoils of war this time ... You killed a few peak stage rising light experts. Just give me the storage rings!"
         In this battle, a total of 12 top powerhouses were killed.
         Other than fan Chang and black Widow, who had escaped, the remaining 12 powerhouses had all been killed. Along the way, Li Hao had also killed two Xuguang and several three suns. At this moment, he had a pile of storage rings in his hands.
         "That's what you deserve ..."
         Li Hao didn't say anything. He glanced at Hong Yitang, who had also killed several experts. Apart from the storage ring of the metamorphosing cultivator, he had taken the rest and given them to Li Hao.
         Seeing Li Hao looking at him, Hong Yitang said in a bad mood,""What are you looking at me for? The people I kill, give me their things, and the spoils of war are all mine. I'm raising a bunch of people now, and you still want to embezzle mine?"
         “……”
         Li Hao was embarrassed. I really did have that idea.
         The main thing was that this person had always appeared to be noble and unquestionable, giving things away as he pleased. He thought that since she didn't need it, she might as well give it to him.
         In the end ... He wanted it too!
         AI!
          Li Hao sighed and took out a storage ring.
         Out of the 12 experts who died, Li Hao killed five, Gou 'Zi killed two, Sword of Light killed three, and Hong Yitang killed two.
         But the people Li Hao killed were all weak.
         One of them was at the middle stage of the rising light realm, and the other four were at the late stage.
         The Sword of Light had killed two peak stage and one late stage.
         Gou 'Zi had killed one at the peak stage and one at the late stage. The one in the water had actually been killed by Gou' Zi's cooperation, but Li Hao counted it as his own kill.
         Hong Yitang killed one of them and one of them was in the middle of the transformation stage.
         In fact, battle merits were not calculated this way.
         Hong Yitang withstood everyone's pressure and was on the defensive. Strictly speaking, he deserved most of the credit for Li Hao's killing of these people. However, Li Hao wasn't too polite to Hong Yitang ...
         I've also fed most of the good stuff I got to your swords gate disciples.
        
         The 30 martial masters of swords gate had also consumed a lot of energy, and they were all relying on Li Hao.
         However, in reality, Hong Yitang had paid for it.
         Looking at the storage ring, Hong Yitang also rolled his eyes."This kid ... You're good at mathematics. Other than Qian Feng's storage ring, you really gave me a storage ring for a mid-stage Sunglow realm cultivator."
         He couldn't be bothered to argue with them and accepted them.
         She didn't say no, and Li Hao's plan failed.
         Hong Yitang laughed, and so did Li Hao."If senior uncle Hong is short of money, you can look for me anytime ... If you don't have money, you can Rob Pirates. You're not afraid of money."
         “……”
         Hong Yitang's smile disappeared.
         Li Hao was also very happy. He didn't count the gains this time, but they must be a lot. They were all big shots and extremely powerful. If they didn't have a thousand or so divine power stones, they wouldn't be called big shots.
         In total, apart from the two that Hong Yitang took, he still had ten storage rings that he had obtained previously, as well as the storage rings of the two great Pirates of the North Sea, the storage rings of the three suns ... How about it? obtaining 10000 divine power stones wasn't a lot, right?
          In addition, the government still owed him twenty thousand divine power stones and an origin god weapon.
         Li Hao didn't care much about the origin divine weapons. He had collected some of the corpses, so there should be some.
         He had really struck it rich in this battle!
         There were still 2000 divine power stones given by the officials, and Li Hao himself had nearly 2000 left ...
         Just a few days ago, he could not bear to use it because of a divine power Stone. Now ...
         Li Hao sighed in his heart. Only with strength could one have capital.
         Without strength, they could only become cannon fodder.
         Look, I'm out of money, but can't I just kill a few Pirates and earn some?
         Hong Yitang wasn't as emotional as he was. He said,""You, don't be too flamboyant! Silver moon's situation might not be that good, and I'm not too sure about the details, but I do know that he's a thorn in many people's eyes ... The more outstanding your performance is, the easier it is for you to be suppressed! Don't end up like your master. He was the one who danced the most back then, but was eventually suppressed in the Silver City and couldn't go out ..."
         Li Hao raised his brows."Speaking of this, I have to say a few words. Silvermoon isn't weak. How did Ying Hongyue manage to force my master to hide in Silver City all those years ago?" Minister hou and the others ..."
         Although hou Xiaochen seemed to have fought Ying Hongyue once for Yuan Shuo's sake, he had acquiesced to Yuan Shuo's cowardice and allowed him to stay in Silver City.
         To Li Hao, this was not in line with the style of the Silvermoon.
         To Yuan Shuo, that was too cruel.
         Everyone else could leave and walk around freely, but Yuan Shuo could not. It was equivalent to being in jail for more than ten years ...
         Hong Yitang rolled his eyes and didn't want to say anything.
         However, the light sword knew a little about the situation. Hearing this, it sighed."Your master ... Has offended too many people! For the sake of the bigger picture, Silver Moon had no choice but to agree back then, so he wouldn't have taken your master's life. Ying Hongyue is only one of them. There's also the mountain Master of Buddha sacred mountain, Yama of the Yama organization, flying sword immortal of the sky organization, and clear sky sacred mountain's clear sky Mountain Master ... At that time, it was impossible for Silvermoon to resist them. It was already not easy for him to fight for your master's survival. "
         Li Hao was startled, no way? Isn't it just Ying Hongyue?"  Don't mess around!
         According to what you've said, the three great organizations and the seven divine mountains have been offended almost completely.
         Two of the seven divine mountains and the three leaders of the three great organizations all have grudges against my master?
         You must be joking!
         Hong Yitang glanced at Li Hao and coughed.""Almost! There's still a lot of gossip about your master that you don't know about. What you know is only some internal martial arts matters of Silver Moon. Your master once went to the central continent and even traveled all over the world. When he was young, there was a period of time when he ran around for the sake of fusing the five Forces ... He really offended too many people. "
         "Then why don't you just kill them all ..."
         Li Hao couldn't help but ridicule!
         It was left behind by this mess!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Either he's protected by someone, or he'll be hard to explain if he's killed. Or he's the one who challenged him. Even if I can show mercy, I can't just kill him ..."
         Hong Yitang still explained. It wasn't that he didn't want to, but that he couldn't do it sometimes.
         It was fine if you took the initiative to challenge the other party and didn't hold back, but if you held back and still wanted to beat the other party to death ... That was truly demonic!
         Old demon Yuan was a demon, but that didn't mean he was completely crazy.
         However, in this way, he would naturally leave behind many enemies. Others would not be grateful to him just because he did not kill him.
         "In other words, my master has enemies everywhere. Almost all the big organizations are his enemies?"
         "Almost!"
         Hong Yitang laughed.
          "Then, why did my master dare to come out a few days ago?" Li Hao asked curiously.
         Since it was so dangerous, why did he come out of the mountain?
         This time, it wasn't as dangerous as he had imagined. He didn't encounter the siege of the three major organizations and the seven divine mountains.
         "It's almost time. "
         "Yes." Hong Yitang explained,"many people are currently facing a barrier ... Your master has come out. Perhaps he can help everyone solve this barrier. Therefore, at this stage, letting him out is also a tacit understanding among some people."
         Li Hao finally understood!
         Unsealing, five internal organs ...
         Some people were thinking about their master's Secret technique of five birds.
         He felt that Yuan Shuo had fallen behind the times, but he could let him out now. Perhaps he could figure out a way to deal with him.
         Li Hao snorted and frowned.""Why are you so confident in my teacher?"
        
         "Your teacher ..."
         Hong Yitang considered for a long time and laughed."Talent is one thing, but that's not the main point. The main point is that your teacher has mastered too many ancient techniques! You have to know that he might have been one of the first martial masters to excavate the ancient ruins in the Silver Moon land! "He has mastered too many ancient techniques, but he has always enjoyed them by himself and would never share them with others. Many ancient books have actually been lost when they reached his hands."
         "You might think that his secret skill of five birds is easy to cultivate, but it's the most suitable for people to cultivate. In fact, it's suitable for everyone. It's suitable for ordinary people, for anyone, for those with poor aptitudes, and for those with good aptitudes. There are no requirements, and anyone can cultivate it!"
         "Don't you think that it's easy to learn the secret technique of five birds? But you've also cultivated other cultivation techniques. Do you think it's difficult to cultivate them?"
         Li Hao thought for a moment and nodded.
         Be it the Shadowless Sword, the catkin sword, or even the ninth refinement, it was actually quite difficult to get started.
         If not for Li Hao's formidable strength, it wouldn't have been so easy to get started.
         On the other hand, the five birds technique ... Was really quite simple. A few years ago, Li Hao practiced it as a form of health fist. Later, he naturally learned the breathing technique of five birds, which was actually very simple. He just had to change his breathing technique and so on, and it was also very smooth.
         "Moreover, when the secret technique of five birds is cultivated to the extreme, one can comprehend five types of forces, which is equivalent to cultivating five great Dao of ancient martial arts at the same time ... And this is the same cultivation technique. You may not understand the things in it now, but the experts all know the difficulties."
         Li Hao looked at him and frowned."Isn't this the same as practicing five different cultivation techniques and comprehending five different forces?"
          "Of course it's different!"
         "No." Hong Yitang shook his head."You're the most obvious example. Haven't you realized that it's not easy to fuse your five types of Shi? If you didn't have a special sword essence as the primary instruction, do you think you could have combined five sword forms?"
         Li Hao shook his head. No chance!
         "You're comparable to sunguang, but you can't do it. You tried to force the integration, but your master did. Don't you think it's strange?"
         Li Hao was startled. He had never thought of this.
         "This is the benefit of a cultivation technique. A cultivation technique has five techniques, and the five techniques come from the same source. Otherwise, ordinary people would not be able to merge the five Forces. Let alone Five Forces, there is almost no hope of even merging two forces!"
         "When your master broke through the 100th level, he completed the simultaneous cultivation of five techniques. The fusion of five techniques is naturally not simple."
         "Yes." Li Hao nodded. After a long while, he said,"but teacher's strength ..."
         He was still too weak!
         "What's the hurry?"
         Hong Yitang laughed,'you might as well be anxious for your own fusion of the five Forces! What Yuan Shuo wanted to do was actually very simple. He just wanted to strengthen his five internal organs. During this process, he would look for an opportunity to improve his cultivation technique. Once the time was right, his five internal organs would definitely be completed! Once the five Forces are completely fused, he will complete the spirit accumulation realm. Soon, he will be able to step into the next realm ... What about you?"
         Li Hao was stunned.me?
         "Can you quickly complete the fusion of the five powers and enter the next stage of the spirit accumulation?"
         Li Hao shook his head.  Until now, he still hadn't found any clues. He actually didn't know much about the spirit accumulation realm, and only had a rough guess.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "So, why are you so anxious for him?"
         Hong Yitang laughed."If he enters the next stage of the accumulation of spirit, he might be above the rising light Stage, just like us after unsealing. So, there's no need to worry about him. You should think about your own path instead. At this stage, you can actually think about it!"
         "The fusion of the five Forces? You didn't walk as far as your master, and you didn't walk as well as he did. Think more about it. Otherwise, you might be able to quickly surpass your master in a short period of time, but sooner or later, he will catch up and shake you off again!"
         Li Hao nodded, deep in thought.
         On the side, the light sword said,""I see that your sword momentum is a little messy ... It's not organized. There are many sword stances, but just as you said, it's just a suture. At this stage, you can try to straighten them out and strengthen them one by one to complete the fusion. Perhaps that's a path. "
         "In addition," he continued,"you're walking the path of fusing the five Forces ... You seem to be comprehending force very quickly, so why don't you comprehend some more force? in terms of quality, you're not as good as your master, but you can surpass him in terms of quantity."
         "The Shadowless Sword is considered a type of dark energy swordsmanship. If you're willing, I can teach you the light sword technique, as well as the wind lightning sword technique ..."
         Li Hao was stunned. He looked at her for a while and then shook his head.
         I won't learn!
         What a joke, I don't want to learn the light sword.
         The light sword seemed to know what he was thinking and sighed."The light sword doesn't have much effect on men. I'm a woman. That's why there was a problem when I cultivated it back then. Yin and yang couldn't be balanced ... Actually, if I could cultivate Shadowless Sword to the extreme, I might be able to change it a little. Unfortunately, after Shadowless Sword died, the cultivation method was lost. It should have been taken away by Yuan Shuo."
         Because Li Hao would.
          "Yes." Li Hao nodded and said,"is this the result ... When the light sword is cultivated to the extreme?"
         Become a man?
         If that was the case, it would not affect men much.
         Also, the light sword's words also made him slightly moved.
         The fusion of the five swords was a little messy. It was not as systematic as master 's, but what if he continued to increase it?
         What about six, seven, or eight?
         However, where was the power hidden?
         Four limbs?
         Head?
         There were also superpower locks in these places. Strictly speaking, it was not impossible. However, Li Hao suddenly felt a little afraid. His teacher had done this before, so he was not afraid. However, if he were to open it himself ... He was still a little afraid.
        
         But soon, he had to think about it deeply.
         Perhaps, it was indeed a solution.
         He temporarily suppressed all of this.
         At the current stage, there were still many areas that he could improve on. For example, he could continue to strengthen his body, strengthen his five internal organs, and completely merge the five Forces. Every breakthrough was an improvement for him.
         He could try to fill up the Super Lock, or find a way to build the five bridges ... Li Hao was not at his wit's end yet. He still had a way ahead.
         The three swordsmen got together and talked about their experiences in cultivation.
         At the end of the conversation, Hong Yitang took the initiative to say,""Take out the Windchaser's boots while Li Hao is here. Maybe he can use them. Otherwise ... Even if you snatch them, you'll probably be wasting them!"
         In fact, Li Hao was also curious, but he had never asked.
         p At this moment, Hong Yitang took the initiative to speak. The light sword didn't hesitate and directly took out an item. It sighed,""I've stayed in the Xu family for 20 years for this ... Sigh!"  It was a green boot.
          It didn't show anything special, and just like Li Hao's starry sky sword, it looked very ordinary.
         Li Hao frowned slightly,'wind-chasing boots ... Is there a certain connection between your light sword and the wind-chasing boots? The dark attribute is suppressing your light attribute?"
         He felt that the boots had a wind-elemental feel to them.
         It didn't look like a dark attribute.
         The light sword shook its head,"no, these boots have the power of darkness!" Thus, I feel that it might be a dual-attribute of wind and darkness. The person who used it back then might have had the intention to create a pair of boots that could walk in the darkness. As for the wind attribute ... It should also be present. "
         Wind and darkness dual attributes?
         "So you want to extract the energy from it to suppress your light attribute?"
         "It's not suppression, it's fusion!"
         The light sword continued,"the light sword is suitable for men to cultivate. If women cultivate it, it's easy for some drawbacks to appear. The best way to solve it is to regulate yin and yang ... But my sword intent is too strong. Ordinary dark attributes are useless! Once it enters my body, it'll be instantly destroyed. Only the power extracted from this kind of ancient treasure can help me balance my power. "
         After saying that, he hesitated for a moment before continuing,""Xu Feng cultivates the water attribute. When the water is extremely cold, even ice has a dark attribute. He can extract some power from the wind chasing boots. So, if Xu Feng is alive and cultivates to the transformation stage, there is hope to extract enough dark energy to balance yin and yang for me."
         Li Hao thought for a moment and nodded.
         Perhaps!
         As for Xu Feng, he didn't even bother to think about it. He was already dead, and he rarely remembered those he had killed.
         At this moment, Li Hao curiously sized up the wind-chasing boots.
         There was only one.
         When he held it in his hands, it was also ordinary.
         There was nothing special about it.
         It was the same when he first got the Zhang family's saber.
          He activated the breathing technique of five birds ... A faint energy overflowed and poured into Li Hao's body. The light sword was shocked and couldn't help but say,""You can extract it?"  Li Hao glanced at her, making a fuss.
         However, it had to be said that the breathing technique of five birds was a little strange and special. It seemed to be able to absorb and extract any kind of power.
         Other breathing techniques did not have such an effect.
         "This means ..."
         Li Hao thought to himself, even without the bloodline of the eight great families, as long as one knows the breathing technique of five birds, one can also use these weapons?
         He hadn't thought much about it before that his teacher could use the Zhang clan's saber, but now that he thought about it ... Perhaps it wasn't that the Zhang clan's saber could be used by just anyone, but that the breathing technique of five birds was truly extraordinary.
         It felt like a universal version of a cultivation technique, absorbing and extracting all kinds of energy ...
         Of course, he might not be able to use the core of the weapon.
         However, Li Hao knew that these divine weapons ... Actually bullied the weak and feared the strong. If you were stronger than a divine weapon, there was actually no such thing as an owner. For example, the Phoenix spear had been threatened by Li Hao for a while, but it was also strange and frightening later on.
         Li Hao suspected that even if hou Xiaochen came, he might be able to take the Phoenix spear.
         He absorbed some of the energy from the boots.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The sword energy was gentle, the saber energy was domineering, and the energy in the boots gave Li Hao a gentle and dark feeling.
         The sword could nourish the body, and the saber could attack.
         What could this pair of shoes do?
         Li Hao considered it for a moment and chose to merge it with his body. In an instant, the energy seeped into his body, as if it had seeped into his feet. Li Hao vaguely discovered that a Super Lock had appeared in his legs.
         The energy was absorbed by the superpower lock.
         After absorbing the energy, Li Hao tried to circulate his inner strength ... But he didn't feel any special changes.
          "Only strengthen the Super Lock?"
         Li Hao thought to himself. He suddenly picked up his shoes, took off his own, and put them on.
         The light sword hesitated for a long time before it said,"The Xu family uses it for offerings ..."
         No one would really wear it!
         Hong Yitang, on the other hand, said from a tricky angle,""Aren't you afraid that the last person who wore shoes would have foot gas or stinky feet?"
         “……”
         Li Hao was speechless. He glanced at this person. Serious?
         This was a divine weapon, so where did the stinky feet come from?
         However, after he said that ... She really despised it.
         He didn't think about it. After putting it on his feet, Li Hao thought for a while, then used the breathing technique of five birds and instantly activated the deer expansion technique. With a jump, he disappeared.
