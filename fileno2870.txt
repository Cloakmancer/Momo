​ Li Hao also sighed with emotion."That's right. Every cultivator who can give birth to a Dao universe at level six is worthy of admiration!" Of course, it can't be separated from the hard work of generations of Senlan people to deduce the mantras to the extreme!"The advancement of a world also required the accumulation and comprehension of generations, which would then lead to an explosive point.For example, the Silvermoon great path universe might have been created long ago, but it also required some opportunities and a primer to induce the descent of the great path universe. The key to inducing the Silvermoon great path universe was the Dao Meridian, the divine text technique, and the domain.Li Hao and Yuan Shuo could not be modest about this. Without them, it would have taken many years for the Silver Moon people to discover the great Dao universe.When Ji Hao heard him say this, he smiled and did not say anything else.Soon, the two of them entered the hall.In the hall, there was no one else other than them.Ji Hao looked around and sat down at Li Hao's signal. He chuckled,""We're venerable sovereigns, and it's meaningless to waste our time here! Everyone knows why fellow Daoist has come here. ""My forest world has a peak rank 6 cultivator, the forest world's sector Lord! He's so strong that he can fight Grade 7 in this world!""Apart from my realm Lord, I, Senlan, also have a sixth stage venerable sovereign. His combat strength is unparalleled, and he's not weaker than any sixth stage peak of a great world.""There are also four fifth stage venerable sovereigns, six fourth stage venerable sovereigns, and twelve middle stage venerable sovereigns. It's not what the outside world thinks, there are only a few of them.""Other than the sector Lord, there are still Level 6?" Li Hao exclaimed.Ji Hao nodded,"yes, there's one more. However, he hasn't come out for a long time. Previously, he had been in seclusion. Now that Senlan is in danger, he has no choice but to come out. He's an expert who became a venerable sovereign in our world 500000 years ago."As soon as he arrived, he directly exploded Sen Lan's strength to deter and intimidate.Our realm still has 12 middle-stage venerable sovereigns!Of which, sector Lords can fight Level 7!As for whether or not there was any exaggeration, only he himself knew."My realm's Dao Lord was killed by a neo martial human King previously. This is my greatest regret ... But it is also an opportunity for me to officially step into the seventh-tier great world!"Ji Hao continued,"it has been two years since Dao master died. In these two years, our realm has basically stabilized the Sen LAN great Dao universe. In fact, if fellow Daoist is wise, you should know ... It's not that I'm weak ... But that someone wants to use me to make up for their losses. ""This is a battle between high-level venerable sovereigns. It's almost impossible for anyone who isn't a high-level venerable sovereign to profit from it!"Ji Hao shook his head,"even though Sen LAN has been destroyed, it's not a place where those rogue cultivators wandering in chaos can profit from!" There are many people who understand, but every venerable sovereign is full of confidence in themselves, thinking that they can pull chestnuts from the fire. ""However, there are many other great worlds around Senlan, such as Yueming, cangjiang, and tianlan. The Masters of Level Seven are only a few moments away from this place. Even if those below level Seven manage to seize the great path universe, can they achieve Level Seven out of thin air and leave the Crimson Moon region?" He looked a little emotional and sighed.He spoke in an orderly manner.Li Hao nodded."That's right. It's just that ... What we seek is not the universe of the great Dao."Li Hao smiled and said, we know our own limits! With a group of high-level venerable sovereigns surrounding us, how could we, who are only low-level venerable sovereigns, dare to try to reach the sky in a single step? It's just that ... The great Dao is in turmoil, the power of the great Dao is overflowing, the venerable sovereigns have fallen, the world is destroyed, the daosource is in chaos ... This is all we want!"Ji Hao was silent for a while before he nodded."Then ... If all of you were to die Here, wouldn't all your years of cultivation be for naught?" he asked slowly.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ "It's hard to be an itinerant cultivator, so I have to take some risks!"Li Hao laughed."Then what if I, Sen LAN, am willing to provide you with some opportunities that aren't too risky?""Please speak, senior!" Li Hao raised his eyebrows.Ji Hao spoke,"I, Sen LAN, swear to protect our homeland with my life!" In a few days, the internal problems of Senlan would be cleaned up! Even if we have to fight to the death, even if we have to destroy the world, we will not let the enemy invade our forest orchid realm!""Now, there are many venerable sovereigns in Senlan. Even if some of them have the backing of a mountain, they don't dare to express it directly. Killing them will be in vain!"Ji Hao chuckled,"Senlan has accumulated a lot of resources over the years. I still have some left. I don't lack Dao crystals!" Other than that, my Sen LAN also has several small worlds without people. Other than that, when a sector Lord reaches Level 7 and his world improves, I can invite you to watch! If fellow Daoist is willing, you can advance from rank six to rank seven, and you can have dozens of venerable sovereigns. You can then fuse with my Dao of the forest orchid and no longer have to wander the chaos. Wandering the chaos is very difficult, so joining the forest orchid is also a way out. "The moment the other party came, they paid a huge price.Wasn't this what wandering cultivators wanted?Great Dao crystals, small worlds ... If Senlan wanted to advance to the seventh level, it would indeed need the participation of venerable sovereigns. The advancement of the great Dao universe would allow it to accommodate more venerable sovereigns. At present, there were only 30 venerable sovereigns. Once it reached the seventh level, it would not be too difficult to accommodate 60 to 70 venerable sovereigns.Directly double!At that time, the opportunity for some itinerant cultivators would also come. Those who wanted to enter the Dao universe would have a chance.Every great world would expand and recruit a group of venerable sovereigns when they reached Level Seven.Wandering cultivators in the chaos were their best choice.Once he entered the Dao universe, he would not be afraid of you rebelling.For itinerant cultivators, with the great Dao universe, they could sort out their own great Dao and purify their great Dao power. The great Dao universe was equivalent to a filter for chaos. It could make their Dao techniques purer and easier to absorb the energy of chaos.

Chapter 2871 Fighting For Senlan (3)
This was also an opportunity for wandering cultivators.Now, the future, he had given it, he was very sincere ..... The prerequisite was that Sen LAN still had a future, and a sector Lord could really reach Level 7.Otherwise, it would all be for naught!"Then what do we have to pay?" Li Hao asked with a smile."It's simple, and we'll satisfy your request. Help us clear out some rogue cultivators ... All of the loot will be yours! As for you, fellow Daoist, you'll be able to obtain Senlan's support ... Including some local advantages!"Ji Hao chuckled."At critical moments, our forest great Dao universe and forest world can suppress our opponents. Even if the suppression isn't too strong, in a battle between experts, a slight difference can be life and death!"Suppression!This was also one of the strengths of a sector Lord."Is it considered an employment?""Fellow Daoist, if you think so, you can think so."Ji Hao nodded."Of course, it's not just a hire. Once a great world reaches Level Seven, not everyone can join it ... It's also considered an entrance ticket! This is considered a cooperation, and if we work together, there will be a future. ""Can a sector Lord enter the 7th rank now?"Li Hao spoke bluntly. Ji Hao smiled and said,""Why can't I? The master of our realm is already at the peak of the sixth level. After accumulating for many years, in two years, he has stabilized the great path universe. Once they are completely merged, the world and the great path universe will become one. Isn't the seventh level within reach?""Where's the opponent?"Li Hao added, I'm new here, and I'm not afraid of unaffiliated chaos cultivators! To put it bluntly, I'm a wandering cultivator myself, so I know the situation. There are almost no middle-rank cultivators. They are all scattered people. I can gather many venerable sovereigns, which means I know the situation of these wandering cultivators. The key is ... A middle-stage venerable sovereign ...""You don't need to worry about that, fellow Daoist!"Ji Hao laughed again,"we won't ask you to do anything that you can't do, we just need you to get rid of the Rogue cultivators, the real rogue cultivators!" Otherwise, wouldn't I be intentionally harming you?""Besides ... Not everyone among the itinerant cultivators is blinded by profit. If fellow Daoist is willing to help, there will be help at any time," he added meaningfully.A spy?This was also a warning!Many of you have already been roped in. Once you join forces, be careful of the people around you."I have a few requests," Li Hao said after some consideration."If you can agree to them, we don't mind which side we're on." "Fellow Daoist, please speak!""First, I need to control a few rifts ... I need Senlan's official authorization!"Li Hao looked at Ji Hao, who frowned slightly. Li Hao slowly said,""I'm afraid that Senlan will seal off the world after completing her advancement. She won't be able to escape and will be swallowed in one breath!""Dao friend, please continue." Ji Hao pondered."Second, I need a lot of great Dao crystals and small worlds. I even need ... Some of Senlan's daosource power."Ji Hao frowned."Everything else is fine. But regarding the Dao origin ... It's as difficult as ascending to the heavens. I'm sure Dao friend can understand this." Li Hao nodded and continued,"third, if an intermediate is to attack us ... Intermediate Senlan has to stop them. We can even join forces to kill them!""That's for sure!"Ji Hao nodded."Right now, I, Sen LAN, have also made my preparations. Dao friends, if you attack, you will definitely not be fighting alone!""Fourth, temporarily give us the right to enter some Dao universes ..."Ji Hao furrowed his brows and shook his head,"This is impossible!"This was equivalent to opening the great Dao universe to these outsiders.What a joke!In the great Dao universe, other than the sector Lords, ordinary monarch Senlan couldn't open it to the public.Take the Silvermoon universe for example. In the past, Li Hao could open it to the outside world, and later, the two Dao Masters could. The others were actually unable to open it to the outside world, and they couldn't even wander around the Dao universe.Unless the realm Lord brought you along or the enemy was too strong and directly split open the great Dao universe.Li Hao also frowned."We're not entering the great Dao universe. We're only opening up some temporary channels to support a part of the power of the forest great Dao so that the forest great Dao will no longer reject us!""This won't do!"Ji Hao shook his head again.Li Hao frowned and said,"then forget it!" If we can't agree to this, we don't have any advantage in Senlan. "Ji Hao sighed."Dao friend's request is too high. Everything else is easy to negotiate with. However, this is the only thing. Opening the great Dao universe to you ... Other than the realm Lord, no one can agree to that! Besides ... We don't know you that well. "Cooperation was fine, but Li Hao and the others could kill anyone. It didn't matter who they killed, as long as it wasn't monarch Senlan.Even if Li Hao and the others were from the Crimson Moon, what did it matter?If you want to kill, no one will stop you.However, if the people of the red moon temporarily opened the great path universe to them, through them, they could directly lock onto the specific location of the great path universe and even find a channel. The eighth-level Red Moon master might be able to sneak into the great path universe.He killed the sector Lord!It was not impossible.Li Hao's requirements were too high.In fact, Li Hao knew that it would be difficult for the other party to agree, so he had only mentioned it. Seeing that the other party didn't even ask their sector Lord, he understood that this was their bottom line.He would definitely not open the great Dao universe to the outside world!It's a pity that these venerable sovereigns aren't willing to take the risk. Maybe we're not bad people?In this way, Senlan's great path universe could be locked on at any time. At that time, the sword venerable and the others could enter by force if they wanted to. Perhaps they could take over Senlan smoothly.

Do I look like a bad person?Why are you so worried about me?Li Hao muttered in his heart, then said, "That's fine. If we can't agree to this ... Then ... We can change it. We need part of the world's control Authority."The world and the Dao universe were different.The authority of a world was like heaven's will. The Black Panther had such an ability. It had little influence on the great path universe, but it would have an advantage in the local world.Li Hao felt that he could give this to them.There wasn't much threat. The threat was the great Dao universe.It was just that with a portion of the authority over the world ... It would be of some help in closing the rift and opening the world gate.Of course, he could also borrow the power of the native world.Ji Hao was not in a hurry to reject this.Although this wasn't very good, it was much easier to accept than the authority of the Dao universe.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ "Then, my fellow Daoists, how much help can you provide us?" Ji Hao asked slowly.So far, how many venerable sovereigns have sneaked into Senlan?""It's not easy to judge. Some people may have hidden themselves ... Some venerable sovereigns may have hidden themselves with precious treasures, but it's hard to judge them clearly ... However, at least 50 venerable sovereigns have arrived at Senlan. Besides you, there are at least 40 of them, and more than 10 of them are at the intermediate stage."It was not considered little.The number of foreign venerable sovereigns in a world had actually exceeded the number of local venerable sovereigns. This also meant that Senlan had really lost control of the local world."We can help Senlan deal with at least five venerable sovereigns!""According to you, there are around 30 low-rank venerable sovereigns," Li Hao said. "We can pin down or even kill five or six of them ..."Ji Hao was not satisfied with this.Li Hao said slowly,"venerable sovereigns are hard to kill." Second, we'll be close to Senlan and represent Senlan. In fact, we'll be short of the threat of 10 venerable sovereigns ... We can still hold back five or six of them, which means that we'll have 15 or 16 venerable sovereigns!"As soon as he said this, Ji Hao fell into deep thought.This was true.If these people didn't get close to Senlan, they might become Senlan's obstacles and troubles. These people were also a part of Senlan's troubles."In addition, if you agree, you must first provide us with 50 million great Dao crystals ... For every venerable sovereign we kill, we will get 10 million for level one, 20 million for level two, and 30 million for level three! Senlan will have to pay another batch of great Dao crystals based on the number and strength of our kills. ""Outside, we can get more or less what we want by killing a venerable sovereign. If Senlan can't pay us enough, we can raid some small worlds and get the same benefits."Ji Hao frowned slightly.This price ... Was not too outrageous.But it was not low either.10 million was enough to exchange for a small world. Of course, when comparing a small world to a venerable sovereign, a venerable sovereign was more important. A small world was dead, while a venerable sovereign was alive."Although Senlan has some savings ..."He was about to say something, but after some consideration, he realized that if the other party promised to kill five or six of them, even if they were all stage three, it would only be 100 to 200 million great Dao crystals.Senlan had existed in a major world for close to a million years.He still had this bit of savings.He didn't lack this little bit."Alright." After thinking for a while, he nodded,"I can take this on behalf of the realm Lord, but I can't guarantee that I'll agree to it!""Fellow Daoist, if I, Sen LAN, agree to these conditions, how long will it take before you are willing to help?""Within a month!"This was not a long time."Then I'll go back and report first. If there's a chance, we'll work together!" Ji Hao nodded after some consideration."Of course!"Ji Hao did not say anything else and teleported away.Li Hao, on the other hand, frowned slightly but didn't say anything.……In the distance.Ji Hao instantly appeared on a mountain peak. On the mountain peak, there was a Daoist Rite temple. There were also a few venerable sovereigns here, and they were all from Sen LAN."The other party has some requests ... What do you think?" Ji Hao spoke.He passed on Li Hao's words to everyone.​ Soon, someone chuckled,"your appetite isn't too small. Of course, it's not too big either!" There are quite a few venerable sovereigns in this group, but most importantly, there are no traces of them. Whether they are rogue cultivators or some great world's cultivators ... It's hard to say!""If it were up to me, why agree to their request? It was just a group of low-level venerable sovereigns ... They weren't close to the other venerable sovereigns, so he might as well capture them all! It can also intimidate everyone!""Ji Hao, what do you think of this myriad DAOs sovereign's strength?""It's hard to say, but it's not weak. It's at least Tier 3!"Ji Hao replied."So what if he's a Tier 3?""Haggling with us after entering our Senlan world," someone said coldly."Do you really think Senlan can't handle a group of low-rank venerable sovereigns?" No matter how weak a great world is, it's not something they can covet!""You can't say that ... If these people kill each other ... It's a good thing if we can spend some great Dao crystals and let them kill each other."An older venerable sovereign smiled and said,""If we can really spend some money to make these people kill each other, they're many venerable sovereigns. If they really attack, it will inevitably cause some venerable sovereigns to be dissatisfied and even join forces to destroy them together! Right now, I'm still merging with the great Dao universe. If I can maintain peace for a while, I'm willing to spend some money. "

"Moreover, if the venerable sovereign were to die in Senlan ..."The older venerable sovereign smiled.""Senlan can absorb the power of a great Dao. Even if it's just a portion, it's a form of improvement for me!""Old Yan, you mean ... We should agree to their request?""Why not?" the old man laughed. Let's test the waters first. These people might be able to force out some hidden characters!""Where did these guys come from? I think they're quite bold! Have they not considered that if they make the first move, it will lead to other parties joining forces to exterminate them first?""Who knows!""Maybe they are trying to trigger a larger war ... After all, although it is urgent, everyone is waiting for an opportunity. Maybe they are here to create this opportunity!"“……”The venerable sovereigns began to discuss.Could he agree to these conditions?It wasn't too difficult.It was still possible ... As for taking tens of millions of great Dao crystals and running away ... That would depend on whether he could escape.If he could really use tens of millions of great Dao crystals to force the dozen venerable sovereigns away ... It would be worth it."Agree to their request!"At this moment, old Yan spoke,"Ji Hao, contact the myriad Dao sovereign and tell him that we agree!" As for the rifts ... If they want to control one or two, you can give them the two that Hong Yue controls!"Old Yan chuckled."Hong Yue is not in charge of the two places ... In that case, we can test their identity by giving them to them. If they were sent by Hong Yue, they would not act rashly. If not ... Let them bite each other!" "Alright!""Then, the authority of the world's energy ..." Ji Hao nodded."I can give it to you!"Old Yan said,"I'll talk to the realm Lord. He's the master of the world. Even if we give them a part of it, what can we do?" It can be taken away at any time. ""I understand."……Just as they were discussing.On Li Hao's side, a second cultivator arrived.He was also a fourth stage venerable sovereign!  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ The newcomer claimed to be a chaos itinerant cultivator named limitless. When he saw Li Hao, he went straight to the point."If fellow Daoist myriad Daoist is willing to join us, we'll think of a way to provide you with sufficient resources until you reach level four!" The elder said.This was the greatest need of a low level venerable sovereign.If it was just one, then there was no need to care.More importantly, Li Hao had more people on his side.There were more than a dozen venerable sovereigns, many of whom were at the second stage. If they joined forces, they could kill one or two intermediate venerable sovereigns, but they could still trap one or two intermediate venerable sovereigns."Fellow Daoist, the price you offered is not as good as Senlan 's," Li Hao said bluntly.The limitless venerable sovereign chuckled."I'm just making empty promises. You should understand that I'm already in my twilight years. Everything I've given you is just an empty promise. In the future, I don't even know if I'll still exist.""Daoist limitless, will your future be even brighter?""Naturally!" Wu Jiang pointed in a direction and smiled.""What do you think, fellow Daoist?"Was he from the Crimson Moon?Of course, it might not be true.However, it was not impossible that the real Crimson Moon had sent them."I'll consider it!" Li Hao nodded thoughtfully."I'll consider it!""I hope fellow Daoist can recognize the reality!""It's not convenient for me to make myself clear, but you're a leader, so you should understand what I mean!"Venerable sovereign limitless said again. The disappearance of Senlan was inevitable! "If there's a change in the sky, the new martial arts will shake up the red moon region. There will also be some changes in the red moon region. In that case ... I'm afraid it will be difficult for a rank six great world like Senlan to continue existing."The law of the jungle.If the leader wasn't strong enough and he had a Dao universe, he wouldn't be able to protect Sen LAN until he reached Level 7.This was the reality!Chaos was just that plain.Li Hao pondered for a moment before asking,"then, does fellow Daoist have the confidence to deal with sector Lord Sen LAN?.""Of course!"Wu Jiang was full of confidence."If I'm not sure, who would come here? to die?"Okay.Perhaps, he really had the confidence that a Grade 7 would personally come?Even if it was, it was probably not now."Fellow Daoist myriad Daoist, what you need to do isn't difficult. You just need to cooperate with some people and control all the low-rank venerable sovereigns in Senlan. There aren't many of them, and some of them don't want to fall out with us. Therefore, there's no need to fight. It's just a deterrence!"Li Hao nodded. It was possible to scare people.Deterrence meant money.He didn't say much and only said that he would consider it.Wu Jiang didn't say anything and left.……On Li Hao's side, people returned one after another.The unaffiliated cultivators were still wary of Li Hao's group and were unwilling to get in touch with them. They had attracted a lot of attention, but it was also because of this that many unaffiliated cultivators felt that Li Hao's group was too arrogant.After all, this was a large world.It was extremely inappropriate for them to gather together in such a large formation and not choose to enter separately.Being careful would become the fuse for the entire Senlan, and it would be eaten up by both sides.A group of low-level venerable sovereigns still wanted to dominate the situation ... It was simply a fool's dream!Once the two sides realized that they could not rope each other in, perhaps the first thing they would do was to get rid of this disobedient unexpected factor.……At this moment, Li Hao received a message from Sen LAN.

Chapter 2874 Fighting For Senlan (3 In 1)_6
They had agreed to Li Hao's conditions.Of course, he had only given Li Hao's side ten million Dao crystals as a meeting gift. If Li Hao's side could really start a war and kill one or two venerable sovereigns, the rest of the conditions would be fulfilled.Otherwise, Senlan wouldn't have provided more benefits.Ten million great Dao crystals in exchange for more than ten venerable sovereigns ... To Sen LAN, this was an extremely worthwhile deal.……In the hall.King Huai and Tian Ji didn't say anything, but Qian Wuliang shook his head and said, "That's wishful thinking on Senlan's part. 10 million great Dao crystals is a lot, but we have a lot of people. It's equivalent to 1 million great Dao crystals. Hiring a venerable sovereign to work for them ... This price is like cabbage!""If we really make a move and the other party reneges and is no longer willing to offer any benefits ... We might become the target of public criticism if we make the first move!"Li Hao, on the other hand, was deep in thought."Do you think the Senlan can be preserved?" he suddenly asked after a long time.“……”The crowd looked at each other. At this time, King Huai spoke,"Unless forest orchid master reached rank 7, she wouldn't have survived! In order to recover her vitality, Hong Yue will not let the Senlan continue to exist!""Moreover, even if she becomes a rank seven ... Forest orchid master might join the Crimson Moon. The Crimson Moon region isn't peaceful right now ... In my opinion, forest orchid is just showing her value. She doesn't want to become a complete vassal of the Crimson Moon. She wants to become a member of the Alliance more.""Yes." Li Hao nodded."Therefore, in the end, Senlan will most likely become a member of the Crimson Moon."The few of them nodded. This was the result.Senlan didn't have much chance to resist.Li Hao gently knocked on the table. After thinking for a while, he said,""What do you think about us joining Senlan?"“……”Everyone was stunned. What did he mean?Li Hao explained,"Senlan is powerless now. If we really join Senlan and become its members, it doesn't matter if sector Lord Senlan can reach the 7th rank or not. There's a high chance that we'll be absorbed by Red Moon!"At that time, will we become a member of the Crimson Moon world?"That's right." Hong Yitang muttered to himself."To join a world, the premise is that the great Dao must be integrated ... This is the key!"How can you resist when the great Dao has been integrated into you?The great world was not a fool.If you want to be a spy, you can try.It wasn't that easy to sneak into the Crimson Moon. It wasn't Senlan, which was riddled with holes.Even if the master of the red moon went to tianfang, the remaining rank-7 would probably still be in the red moon world.Moreover, they would not allow those foreign venerable sovereigns to enter the Crimson Moon as they pleased unless their great Dao was integrated into the Crimson Moon."Is there a way to completely separate your great Dao after integrating it with the Crimson Moon?" Li Hao asked.“……”No one said a word. King Huai and Heaven's Fate both shook their heads. It was not that simple."Then what about forging the great Dao?"They looked at Li Hao again, feeling that he was being delusional. Did they underestimate a rank 8 master?Li Hao explained, the so-called marks of the great Dao are just a manifestation of Dao! In fact, venerable sovereigns could also leave the great Dao universe, but the premise was to give up their power! What if you're willing to give up your power?"“……”No one said a word. This was fine as long as you were willing to!"We can merge with any world as long as there is a great Dao that matches us. That means that we can cultivate more than one great Dao. The great Dao can merge with a great Dao universe. At the critical moment, we can give up the power of the great Dao ...""Difficult!""It's hard to hide from the eyes of a level eight venerable sovereign," Tian Ji said."If we really give up the power of the great Dao, we won't be able to resist!""I can't hide it from the Crimson Moon, but can I hide it from the rank 6 forest orchid master?"Li Hao smiled."If I give everyone some external DAOs to become venerable sovereigns and integrate them into Senlan, can I hide it from them?" he asked.Using the realm!The power of a little realm!Of course, he was still weak and not strong enough.The crowd looked at each other. King Huai saw many people looking at him and was somewhat speechless. I'm an outsider who just came here. Why are you looking at me?Did I talk too much?"Then ... What the Silver Moon King means is ... We should integrate into Senlan, and then use Senlan's platform to integrate into the Crimson Moon?""Right!"Li Hao nodded.  King Huai didn't want to say anything. What if the eighth-rank world Lord didn't leave?He had been staying in the Crimson Moon!Then ... Wouldn't we really become Hong Yue's employees?Obviously, Li Hao was betting that the Crimson Moon Lord would leave sooner or later and leave the Crimson Moon world behind. This guy was also a gambler.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ He actually didn't like Senlan. From the sound of it, he wanted to enter the Crimson Moon and stir up trouble.He had a slight headache.If a human King could cause harm, this person didn't seem to be much worse.He was only at level four, but he had his eyes on a level eight great world."What's the final goal?"Li Hao said,"the power of the Crimson Moon's great Dao, the power of the world, the crystal of a great Dao ... I'm not hoping to destroy the Crimson Moon directly. That's not something I can do. What we need to do is to make a fortune and then run!"He had never thought of destroying the red moon. Without that ability, it was impossible to do it.As long as the Lord of the eighth step didn't die, he wouldn't be able to exterminate the other party.However, taking advantage of the other party's distance to seize the reserves of an eighth-rank great world ... As long as one was bold enough and not afraid of death or being chased by an eighth-rank great world for a lifetime, there was still hope of success."If that's the case ... There must be at least one rank-7 in the red moon ..."Li Hao grinned."That's right. But ... This isn't something I should consider. That person ... Should consider!"'Alright, I understand.'Sword Saint!When revered sword met the human King, he was almost killed a few times. You ... Are you sending revered sword to his death, or are you letting him advance again?Everyone didn't say anything else.Whatever you say!The Silver Moon people would not object. The neo martial artists thought of venerable the sword and did not say anything. The referee and the others did not have the right to speak, so it was useless to object.Li Hao's words were almost absolute, but he would only ask a few questions every time."Then let's do that!"Li Hao said,"we're really ready to join Senlan. We'll consider everything for Senlan. If Senlan can't do it, then there's nothing we can do. If it can ... We'll fight for Senlan ... And fight for a chance to join the great world!"Everyone nodded in agreement."That's right!" Li Hao smiled."We'll make our move when they get their first batch of Dao crystals!""Alright!"No one retorted and accepted the order.Li Hao, on the other hand, fell into deep thought.The others were still fine, but he was actually worried about the three of them ... If he had known earlier, he wouldn't have accepted them back then. Now that he had accepted them, he felt a little uneasy.If he had known that there weren't many spots in the Dao universe, he would have used them sparingly.This time, Li Hao had also stopped thinking about recruiting foreign venerable sovereigns.The quota was limited, and he didn't feel at ease accepting these outsiders. It was better not to accept them.After a moment of silence, Li Hao said in a deep voice,"I'll fight for Senlan!"“……”The venerable sovereigns looked at him in silence. Had this guy started to hypnotize himself?He was really ... Shameless!Despite their helplessness, they still reluctantly agreed when they saw Li Hao looking at them.In the hall, a sparse shout rang out,""Fight for Senlan!"Outside the hall.Venerable Emperor jihao, who was preparing to deliver the first batch of great Dao crystals, heard some sounds from afar ... And was a little stunned.In order to gain my trust, are these few people willing to throw away their faces?I haven't arrived yet!Even if you want to act, you have to do it in front of me.A group of outsiders who wanted to take advantage of Senlan now had the nerve to say that they were fighting for Senlan?Go to hell!Supreme Emperor Ji Hao cursed in his heart. 'Do these itinerant cultivators not care about their faces?

Do you want face?Li Hao didn't care about this. As for fighting for Sen LAN ... He was serious.Why didn't he fight for Senlan?On one side, it was only a sixth-tier great Dao universe. Could it be more fragrant than an eighth-tier one?Since that was the case ... When he said that he would fight for Senlan, he was being extremely serious.In the courtyard.Li Hao met Ji Hao again. At this moment, Li Hao's attitude and thoughts seemed to have changed. His face was slightly solemn, and the moment he saw Ji Hao, his voice was extremely solemn."We, the myriad DAOs Emperor Group, take people's money and get rid of their disasters for them!""Today, I've received tens of millions of Senlan's great Dao crystals. I'll definitely do my best to protect Senlan and fight for her safety!"Ji Hao was a little embarrassed.艹!This man ... Was really shameless.He said it as if it was true.What a joke.Ten million great Dao crystals in exchange for a dozen venerable sovereigns fighting to the death for Senlan ... Do you think I'm stupid or you're stupid?To put it bluntly, Senlan had given the 10 million great Dao crystals with the intention of patronizing a beggar.It's best if you take it and work.If you really don't want to work ... It's fine.Who would care?Even though he was thinking about it, Supreme Emperor Ji Hao was still smiling. "You're being too serious! Safety first, venerable sovereigns. If possible, please do your best!"As she said that, she felt awkward.I have to comfort you and tell you not to take it seriously.Li Hao, however, was extremely serious again, that's not true! In my world, if you take someone's money, you have to fight to the death, never give up! Today, I, the myriad DAOs, have taken the Senlan great Dao crystal. I will fight to the death until Senlan safely advances to the seventh step. Or ... Senlan will choose to surrender!"“……”,m Ji Hao was a little embarrassed and did not even know what to say.After a long while, he forced a smile."Then ... Then please do as you wish." He said."I still have some things to do. If you need anything, please contact me," he added.After saying that, he was about to leave."Senior, you said you would give us authority over two of the rifts ..." Li Hao hurriedly stopped him."You guys can go and take whatever you want!"Ji Hao couldn't wait for them to retrieve it, he turned around and smiled,"Now, other than the realm gate, there are 11 rifts in the entire great world. Five of them are under my control. The remaining six ... Are yours to take. If you can take them all, they'll be yours!"Li Hao smiled and nodded."Alright. Senior. Is it convenient for you to give me a map?" he asked."Of course!"Ji Hao really wanted to laugh. Are you serious?You're so serious ... I don't even know what to say.These ten thousand DAOs were either playing dumb or ... Had other motives! As for being really stupid, he wasn't that stupid.How silly, to reach the venerable sovereign level?How silly, how could there be so many venerable sovereigns under his command?Did he really take these venerable sovereigns for fools?He didn't say anything else and sent a consciousness map to Li Hao. Other than the five that they were in charge of, the remaining six were controlled by others.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ It was extraordinary!Ji Hao knew very well who was in control of these cracks.The Crimson Moon world controlled two places.Of the remaining four, one was tianlan, one was cangjiang, and one was dark Moon. Each of the three major worlds controlled one to make it easier for them to enter and exit. The last one was controlled by a peak rank six rogue cultivator, who was a true rogue cultivator.These forces that controlled the crack were the ones that really wanted to take over Senlan.Forced by the situation, Sen LAN could only pinch her nose and accept it.Just as Ji Hao was about to leave, Li Hao stopped him,""Senior, we're going to seize these cracks. What if the person behind this comes to kill us?"“……”Ji Hao was getting impatient.It's just a simple meaning!"I won 't, don't worry!" He said in a low voice. Everyone is in the dark. No one will express their attitude directly. The three major worlds don't dare to express their attitude, and the other side won't express their thoughts directly. After all, we came here for the Alliance. Wouldn't we be laughed at by the chaos if we attacked our allies? Therefore, unless it was a critical moment, unless it was the last resort ... These people would not show their faces! Now, it's the Rogue cultivators who are taking the lead, just like I, Sen LAN. Everyone is letting the Rogue cultivators take action for the sake of a name!""That's good!"Li Hao nodded."Is there anything else you would like to ask?" Ji Hao furrowed his brows."Not for now. If there's anything I don't know, I'll ask senior again.""Alright," he said.Ji Hao was too lazy to say anything else, this guy ... Was too bored.I don't care about you!After saying that, he teleported away at high speed.……Ji Hao left.Li Hao looked at the map and laughed."In that case ... Let's go. We'll attack the crack first! There were three venerable sovereigns in the crack I came to earlier. There are many venerable sovereigns in the crack alone. Kill them!"“……”Serious?Everyone looked at him and was speechless for a moment.Li Hao took a deep breath and said,"don't overthink it. I'm serious!" These venerable sovereigns, whether they're from the outside worlds or other people, are our enemies ... As for the itinerant cultivators, they're not!"Yue Ming, tianlan, cangjiang, Red Moon, and even Sen LAN were actually all enemies. Neo martial's enemies were Li Hao's enemies.Therefore, he didn't need any sympathy to get rid of these venerable sovereigns.As for the last place, the so-called level six itinerant cultivator in charge ... Could it be venerable the sword?

I'm not sure. Venerable sword might not dare to show his face. Maybe it's empty?Who knows?Or a true wandering cultivator?That was hard to say.Let's not worry about this side for now. We'll deal with the other areas first."Let's go!"Li Hao flew straight into the sky. The cracks were all above the barrier, and Senlan was still peaceful ... He would fire the first shot!……At the same time.In the forest great Dao universe.The forest orchid sector Lord was overseeing the great Dao universe and was currently devouring a core Dao origin in the depths of the universe. At this moment, the entire forest orchid appeared in front of him, and Li Hao's group was one of them.He also knew a little about this group of people.He collected the money and worked.It was the style of a wandering cultivator.However, he didn't charge much. It was okay, but he didn't know if there was anyone else behind it.There were quite a few venerable sovereigns, and no one knew where this group of people had come from.At this moment, looking at this group of people flying up into the sky, sector Lord Sen LAN laughed. He mumbled softly,""Are we really going to seize the crack?"If that was the case, things would be interesting.Now, those who seized the crack were all interested in Sen LAN. They came for the great Dao universe. Those itinerant cultivators wandered around the Sen LAN world and didn't have much thought. They were more interested in picking up scraps.Therefore, the people from the crack were not easy to deal with.Could it be that there was a force behind this myriad Dao sovereign?The 11 cracks had yet to disappear. This actually meant that there were still some problems with Senlan's Dao universe and great world. Otherwise, these cracks would have disappeared long ago.And now, some of the cracks could not disappear, which was actually related to these venerable sovereigns.He couldn't show his face easily!As a realm Lord, once he walked out of the great Dao universe ... It would be very dangerous. There might be a level Seven who would come to kill him. He had to stay in the great Dao universe and make it so that others couldn't figure out the truth.It was also in preparation for annexing the Dao universe as soon as possible and stepping into Level Seven.At this moment, he saw, he saw Li Hao and the others heading towards the first crack ... It was also the crack that Li Hao had entered for the first time. He was very clear on who was behind that crack.The Crimson Moon world!This was a crack controlled by a rogue cultivator in the Crimson Moon world. In fact, there was another crack that was also under the control of the Crimson Moon world. That crack was directly controlled by the Crimson Moon world's local Supreme Emperor!"You've got some guts ... So you're not from the Crimson Moon!"The realmlord thought to himself as his interest was piqued. These people ... Would they really dare to make a move?He knew about the three venerable sovereigns who were guarding this place. The three venerable sovereigns of the ox, dog, and mouse were in cahoots with each other. They were also a small group that was quite famous in the Redmoon region. The boss, Golden Bull demon Emperor, had the strength of a stage three.The second brother, venerable sovereign moonhowl, had stage two strength.The third one had a thousand rat kings and had the strength of a first stage.The three of them were not pure Beasts of Chaos. They were venerable sovereigns from worlds. Venerable sovereigns from worlds were different from primitive Beasts of Chaos. The three of them belonged to the demon race.The demons and the chaos beasts could not be mixed together.Sen LAN was very quiet. Up until now, no battle between venerable sovereigns had erupted. At this moment, the world Overlord's interest was piqued as he started to observe.In fact, many venerable sovereigns were also watching at this moment.……At the location of the crack.Among the three venerable sovereigns, Golden Bull demon monarch and the one who seemed to be a man of few words suddenly looked down the regional wall and frowned,"it's that myriad Dao venerable sovereign from before!"The third, a thousand-headed Rat King, was a little afraid,"what is this guy doing here? Could it have become the 300 Dao crystals?"It had only found out that Li Hao was the leader of a small team after he had entered.There seemed to be many venerable sovereigns under his command.It wasn't good to provoke him!"How could it be!""What?" the second dog-headed man's expression was grave."Are you here to find trouble or ... Are you going out of the boundary?"Boss didn't say a word and fell silent.,m After waiting for a while, he confirmed that the other party was heading straight for him and said in a low voice,""Be careful. There's no need to fall out with them. If he wants the great Dao crystals, return the 300 great Dao crystals to him! If you leave, don't stop me! If they find fault with us ... They may not know who is behind us. At the critical moment, they will point out our origins directly. If they still ignore us, then they will summon the red moon Emperor from another place ..."The Crimson Moon was in charge of two cracks.If these guys were looking for trouble, he would let Red Moon sovereign deal with them.There were many second stage venerable sovereigns in this group, and Wan Dao was most likely a third stage venerable sovereign, so they were not easy to provoke."I know.""Boss, don't worry!"“……”The three venerable sovereigns had a brief discussion and were also very vigilant, waiting for the group of people to come.……In less than a minute.A group of people flew over.The rat spirit laughed sneakily and hurriedly said,""It's the myriad Dao Emperor, what business do you have? My fellow Daoists, are you going out?"Li Hao bowed slightly and said seriously,""We are valued by the forest orchid world. The forest orchid realm Lord has recruited us as the Messengers of Peace. A crack has appeared in the forest orchid world and it needs to be repaired. I ask the three Dao friends to move to another place. I will take over this place!"  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ Even though he said that, he sent a voice transmission,'if these three don't leave, you guys join forces and kill them! Gou RUO, Chan Xiu, and Yan, you guys deal with the stage two Kobold. Senior Empyrean pole and King Huai, deal with the stage one rat spirit. Qian Wuliang, senior uncle Hong, Black Panther, and senior Empyrean pole's clone, you four deal with the stage three bull monster!"

2877 Chapter 474
“……”Heaven's Fate and King Huai looked at each other. There was suddenly an indescribable strangeness in their eyes.What did that mean?Although the celestial pole had been downgraded and was now at the second level, but ... But he and King Huai were still neo martial Supreme emperors. They were senior Supreme emperors and members of neo martial arts. Their combat strength was not weak.Good fellow!We're both at the peak of stage two, and we're going to fight a stage one rat monster together?'This ... Is looking down on us!The three of them were itinerant cultivators from small worlds. Venerable sovereigns like them were very weak.Although the two of us wanted to lie flat ... We didn't expect that Li Hao would make them lie down so thoroughly!Even his clone was more important than his main body, so he should at least let his clone deal with a rank three venerable sovereign.Tian Ji was a little speechless, and King Huai was also a little embarrassed ... He was probably just pretending. Of course, it was hard to describe the feelings in his heart.In any case ... It was very complicated.In new martial arts, if they really wanted to participate in a battle, it would not be like this. Although they were sent to Silver Moon for the first battle, it would be a disgrace to the title of venerable sovereign if the two of them were to fight against a first stage venerable sovereign."Fellow Daoists, are you going to give in or not?" Li Hao asked again.Li Hao said seriously,"this is the Senlan great world. You three occupy the Senlan territory and are Kings of the mountains. Senlan is not a nest of bandits. This is a great world with its dignity. If you leave now, I'll let bygones be bygones. If you don 't, I'll have to kill you as a warning to others!"The three venerable sovereigns looked at each other, and their faces were a little ugly.The Big Brother Supreme Emperor Golden Bull, who had been silent all this time, said,""We understand what fellow Daoist myriad Daoist has said. However, I'm afraid fellow Daoist doesn't know what we represent?""This place ... Is not for us to occupy, but ..." It said in a heavy voice.Li Hao looked at it, and it said softly,""The Crimson Moon is going to occupy it!"Li Hao was puzzled, really? Ask the red moon to issue a document, a document of the great Dao. Then, I will believe you and leave you two alone. "Bullshit!If the red moon really wanted to take it from him, she would have done it a long time ago. Why did she have to do it like this?Wasn't it just to establish what it was?And even gave you a book of Dao?You must be joking!Even the Crimson Moon's local Thearch would not say that he was from the Crimson Moon, let alone them."Fellow Daoist, you should know what to do!""Why do you have to go against them for such a small benefit?" Supreme Emperor Golden Bull said coldly. Senlan's leg ... Wasn't very stable! Be careful that you don't cling onto the wrong thigh and end up sinking with Senlan!""So you're not letting me?""You must be joking ..."Li Hao sighed."I gave you a chance!""Do it!" He chuckled.The three venerable sovereigns all thought that this guy might be crazy or joking, but he really dared to attack?I told you, we didn't come here of our own will. It's Red Moon, you know?A type 8 world!"Although a few rank Sevens died, it's still a rank eight world and a top force. You bastards, this place isn't far from the Crimson Moon. Li Hao's voice fell.BOOM!The sound shook the world!In an instant, the venerable sovereigns behind him attacked at the same time without any hesitation. These people seemed to not know what the Crimson Moon was and acted like puppets. They would do anything Li Hao said!In addition to the celestial pole clone, there were a total of nine venerable sovereigns even without Lin Hongyu.They attacked at the same time, and the great Dao shook the sky.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ The power of the great Dao swept across the world, shaking it.They really did it without any hesitation.At this moment, the three venerable sovereigns 'faces changed. The next moment, the three venerable sovereigns returned to their original forms at the same time. A huge bull that covered the sky appeared and roared,""You've got guts, you really dare to attack!"The three venerable sovereigns were shocked and angry.He shouted loudly to inform Red Moon sovereign in the other crack that he was under attack. Please come and help him!……"They really started fighting?""These guys, where did they get the guts?""That's crazy!"“……”At that moment, the venerable sovereigns in the Senlan realm were all shocked.This place was under Hong Yue's control, and everyone knew that.Where did these people come from?In an instant, the 12 venerable sovereigns were fighting.Li Hao didn't make a move, but just watched from the side. The 12 venerable sovereigns attacked at the same time, and the whole world seemed to be shaking. The power of the great Dao radiated in all directions.Boom! Boom! Boom!The three venerable sovereigns were completely suppressed in just a moment.Even the third rank venerable Golden Bull was the same.Four stage-two experts had joined forces to kill him. Even a stage-three expert would not be able to do so. The difference between stage-two and stage-three experts was not that big.……At another location.Ji Hao and the other venerable sovereigns also took a deep breath.Such courage!These guys ... Were really interesting.Someone laughed,'these 10 million Dao crystals are well spent! Regardless of whether they have other motives ... They're just a few itinerant cultivators. With the power of the Crimson Moon, they don't even put me in their eyes. It's not bad to suffer a little loss. I've finally vented my anger!""This group of people is quite bold, but I wonder ... If this is all an act by Hong Yue ..." Someone looked at Ji Hao and laughed.Ji Hao shook his head. He did not know either.However, it was still somewhat unexpected for these people to directly attack.He looked at the other crack. There were two venerable sovereigns there, but their strength was completely different. One was at the fourth level, and the other at the third level.

They were all from the Crimson Moon!"We'll know once we take a look,"Ji Hao said softly," I wonder if Hong Yue will care ...""I think so?""I'm not too sure. "As the Senlan Imperial Venerables were talking, the two red Moon Imperial Venerables in the sky also frowned."Damned thing!"A fourth level venerable sovereign frowned and looked at the third level venerable sovereign beside him.""You go and tell those guys not to meddle in other people's business! Tell them where we come from!"As a venerable sovereign of the Crimson Moon world, it was natural for him to be arrogant.We're venerable sovereigns of an eighth-rank major world!Were these itinerant cultivators crazy?Our homeland is nearby.He really ate the heart of a bear and the guts of a leopard!The rank 3 great Empress was also furious. She took to the air and said,""Do I need to be taught a lesson?""No need, just retreat!"The fourth-rank venerable sovereign shook his head. There was no need to get into a big conflict with another group of itinerant cultivators just because of a few of them. It would be enough to just let them retreat.After all, there were quite a few of them.It was still unclear who was behind them. If there was no one ... They wouldn't be so bold, right?……BOOM!A deafening sound reverberated throughout the world.The three giant beasts roared in anger. The rat turned into a thousand-headed rat monster, which was extremely horrifying.Li Hao frowned slightly.So ugly!If Heaven's Fate and King Huai joined forces ... It would be very difficult for a mere stage one to turn the tables.Li Hao was also observing the two's attacks.The celestial pole was still the same ... It relied solely on its physical body and did not seem to have any comprehension of the Tao techniques. It could blow up a head with a single punch, and King Huai ...Li Hao observed for a while and finally saw some clues.King Huai's forte seemed to be speed, but he also seemed to be a shadow. He was like an assassin, extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, he had cut off the heads of the rats."Kill!" The thousand-headed rat roared.This rat was also skilled in speed and the dark devouring Dao.However, when it faced these two ... It could barely hit them. The attacks of the great path were easily dodged by them. They were clearly only second level venerable sovereigns, and the difference between first and second level was not that big.But ... It couldn't even touch the edge."Big brother, save me!" The rat roared crazily. At this moment, it was a little scared. They were all venerable sovereigns. At first, it thought that these people might not really dare to kill it. But now ... It had more than a thousand heads, and hundreds of them had been cut off in just a short time.It was too horrifying!Over there, Golden Bull Supreme Emperor didn't say a word. Save you?How could he save her?It was surrounded by four stage two experts. One had to know that of these four, two were Dao Lords, one was a world Lord, and the last was the celestial pole clone ...If it wasn't for the fact that it wasn't appropriate to expose too much, the two Dao Masters could have killed it together.Now ... He could barely hold on, but he could still go and save people?Just wait!He would wait for the venerable sovereigns on Hong Yue's side to come.He just needed to hold on for a while. It wasn't far.At this time, it had even sensed that a third stage venerable sovereign was rushing over. It was the venerable sovereign of Red Moon.Supreme Emperor Golden Bull heaved a sigh of relief.This was good!BOOM! The loud noise sounded again, and the big rat screamed again and again. Its head was cut off one by one. Even if it didn't die this time, it would suffer a great loss."Stop!"At this moment, a Tier 3 great Empress flew over from a distance. She had a cold expression on her face. Without saying anything, she unleashed the power of the Crimson Moon and charged at Li Hao ...The reason why he wasn't strong wasn't to kill, but to display the power of the Crimson Moon.Tell Li Hao that I am the red moon Emperor!An eighth-rank great world, the Crimson Moon world, the power of the Crimson Moon. Who in the Crimson Moon region did not know about this?  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ Even a first stage venerable sovereign could easily withstand this force.Therefore, it was only to intimidate."Stop, give me some face ..."The third level venerable sovereign was about to say something as he tried to intimidate Li Hao.Li Hao, on the other hand, remained silent.At this moment, when the power of the Crimson Moon was approaching, Li Hao suddenly shouted,""How dare you attack the forest orchid Guardian? you're courting death!"The rank three great Empress was still in a daze.Are you blind?Can't you tell that this is the power of the Crimson Moon?Just as he was thinking, a sword light suddenly appeared like a flame burning the world. The long sword on his back was unsheathed and slashed down!BOOM!The void shattered!Heaven and earth split apart, and the world became calm. A black hole appeared, and a stage three great Empress was instantly sliced in half. A Red Moon appeared, and within the red moon, the great Empress was still in a daze.The next moment, the sword light rose again, and the flames burned the sky.BOOM!The red moon exploded, and the long sword devoured the red moon as if it were alive. In an instant, the red moon disappeared, and the world became quiet.In the distance, the rank four red Moon sovereign didn't care at first.But when he noticed it ... He was completely stunned.What was happening?He ... Died?A rank three red Moon sovereign was killed by a sword!How was that possible?"Impossible!"At this moment, voices of shock could be heard from all directions.This man ... Killed a venerable sovereign of a major world with one sword strike?What powerful strength!Such courage!Didn't he know that he was the venerable sovereign of the red moon?……In the Dao universe.Sector Lord Sen LAN was startled.He ... Really killed him?This person ... What was going on?He was also stunned.Even the experts of other macro worlds would not dare to kill the venerable sovereign of Red Moon rashly.Unless ... He was a new Martial Emperor?Sword Saint?Swordsman?Many thoughts flashed through his mind and he frowned. Could this be the new martial Swordmaster?

This ... Can't be?For a moment, they were all shocked.If it was the neo martial Swordmaster ... Then it would be troublesome. It was said that the death of the awakening God Emperor had something to do with the neo martial Swordmaster. Could this person be the neo martial Swordmaster?After killing a stage-three venerable sovereign of a major world with one strike, Li Hao's strength was actually only at stage-three.However, the power gathered was extremely condensed.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ The other party was not fully prepared, so he was killed on the spot.It was extremely rare for a fight between venerable sovereigns of the same level to be decided by one move.……The entire forest great world was shocked.Was there really someone who dared to kill Red Moon sovereign here?Even the native venerable sovereigns of Senlan were a little shocked. Where did this guy's courage come from?Although the realm Lord said that if he showed his strength now, Hong Yue would pay more attention to him.But ... When they thought of the eighth level venerable sovereigns, everyone's legs went soft.In the end, someone really dared to do it!In the void.The three demonic beasts were also stunned. At this moment ... With a loud boom, the celestial pole tore apart the level-one thousand-headed rat. It raised its eyebrows and glanced at Li Hao.He was a little puzzled.Li Hao could kill a stage three expert with one strike ... But ... Venerable the sword had just killed Xing Shen. As a swordsman, aren't you afraid that Red Moon would suspect that you're venerable the sword in disguise?He didn't really understand, but he was too lazy to think about it.It was too tiring to think about this."Third brother ..."BOOM!As Li Hao killed, everyone became completely relaxed. No one held back, including zhiruo and the other two. They were still worried before, but now that Li Hao had even killed venerable Red Moon Emperor, what was there to worry about?A great battle erupted once again!With so many venerable sovereigns, wouldn't it be easy to kill three venerable sovereigns?Almost in the blink of an eye, along with several angry shouts and screams, the world rumbled and the great Dao collapsed. Venerable Golden Bull and the dog-headed man followed in their footsteps at the same time!In an instant, four venerable sovereigns had fallen.At this moment, the void fluctuated and Hong Yue's level four venerable sovereign appeared, his face ashen!There was really someone who dared to kill Red Moon sovereign!At this moment, Li Hao looked at his opponent without fear. Even if he wasn't a level four venerable sovereign, a level four venerable sovereign wouldn't be able to take him down."What?" his voice was loud."Does this venerable sovereign also want to interfere in the affairs of my Senlan?" Senlan killed these people who disrupted the order. How dare you be so impudent in my Senlan world? do you want to take revenge for them?" "You're good!"The red moon venerable sovereign looked at Li Hao coldly with sharp eyes.This was crazy!And ... Swordsman ...Swordsman, was it related to neo martial?For a moment, he was a little hesitant.At this moment, Li Hao looked down from the corner of his eye. At this moment, Ji Hao, who was hiding in the dark, was a little hesitant. In the end, he came over and looked at Li Hao and the others, then at Red Moon sovereign. He forced a smile and said,"How could this be? You are all from the outside world, so you can't make a big fuss in my forest orchid world ..."Li Hao's face was gloomy."Supreme Emperor jihao, we have carried out Senlan's order. We took back the land of crack, killed the invaders, and guarded Senlan. Did we do anything wrong?""This ... Of course not,"Ji Hao was extremely embarrassed. F * ck, I thought you guys were just saying it for fun, but you guys were really ruthless.It's fine if you're ruthless, but you even killed Red Moon sovereign? are you crazy?Also, you're a swordsman ...Before he could say anything, Red Moon sovereign suddenly said in a deep voice,""You're a sword Xiu? I've never heard of the red moon region having a powerful sword cultivator ... Only neo martial arts has a powerful sword cultivator. Wan Dao, are you a neo martial fanatic?"The venerable sovereigns were shocked by his words!Li Hao sneered,"what? you want to frame me?" The new martial human King killed forest orchid path master. Are you trying to frame a swordsman? It's because the person I killed seems to be related to you!""Do you know where this place is?" Red Moon sovereign asked coldly. No matter where it is, neo martial is our enemy, our common enemy! New martial arts is the root of the red moon region's chaos. If you're a member of new martial arts ... You must be killed! The forest orchid path master died at the hands of a new martial artist. Even the forest orchid Thearch will avenge the path master by killing the new martial artist fanatic!""Using a sword is related to neo martial?"Li Hao sneered,"ridiculous!"However, Red Moon sovereign still refused to give up. Using a sword ... This was too coincidental. He could not help but think about it. He looked at Ji Hao and said,"Supreme Emperor Ji Hao, do you know anything about this person? He killed venerable sovereigns at will ... And caused conflicts between Senlan and the other parties. I suspect that this person is the new martial Swordmaster who deliberately caused conflicts between Senlan and the other parties!" Ji Hao wasn't sure, so he subconsciously moved away from Li Hao.He couldn't help but worry about this.Sword Saint!He was a true top venerable sovereign, at least below the advanced venerable sovereign level. He was almost invincible.This kind of guy ... Was very scary.He hesitated, and Li Hao frowned."You doubt me? Senior Ji Hao, are you suspecting me just because of an outsider, a venerable sovereign who invaded the forest?"“……”This ...Ji Hao laughed dryly,"how could that be!" It's just that the red moon region has been in turmoil recently. I think ... I think ..."Li Hao suddenly sneered and looked at Red Moon sovereign.""Do you have any evidence? If I'm a neo martial fanatic just by saying it casually, what about you? I also said that you're the neo martial blood Emperor, and your Dao power is mainly red. I heard that the neo martial blood Emperor also has Red Dao power ..."
