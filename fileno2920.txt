Tier 2, vanish, new martial ...Ëâπ!I understand now, Huai King!The notorious venerable sovereign of new martial arts. In this case, realm Lord Sen LAN had some ideas. If it was this person ... It wouldn't be too much trouble. His position in new martial arts wasn't high. Also, he was famous for being a fence-sitter, so he would know some inside information about new martial arts ...Even if his identity was exposed, Hongyue would probably not kill him. It was meaningless to kill him. Instead, she would help new martial arts get rid of a venerable sovereign who had ruined their reputation.After hearing King Huai's identity, he felt a little more at ease. After some thought, he nodded."If I really advance, with the strength of a seventh-rank venerable sovereign, it won't be a problem to protect these people with dozens of venerable sovereigns!"At this moment, he had even guessed Li Hao's identity.The Silver Moon King!I was wondering why there were so many unfamiliar venerable sovereigns.Silver Moon and neo martial had met up!Everything was clear now.He finally understood. The Silver Moon King, the venerable sovereigns born in the Silver Moon world, the two venerable sovereigns from new martial arts, and the venerable sovereigns from Ming Hao's team who were said to have been killed ...Wasn't this the end?Around them, Qian Wuliang and the others were all very nervous.They were all listening to the conversation between Li Hao and sector Lord Sen LAN.He had reported his family background!If the other party had any thoughts ...However, there were also some who were extremely calm. The Senlan realmlord didn't dare to do so because he wasn't sure of the location of the new martial. He wasn't sure who killed the awakening God monarch. He wasn't sure how big of a crisis the Senlan realmlord was in.At this moment, how could he dare to attack these people?Once venerable the sword was drawn out ... They would be in big trouble. Moreover, it might not be just venerable the sword.Sector Lord Sen LAN didn't have such thoughts.It's not worth it!Not to mention offending the neo martial artist, the key was that he was not confident. Even if there was only a sword venerable here, he was not sure, not to mention that he was not sure of the whereabouts of the other seventh-rank neo martial artists.Where was the sun god?Where was Emperor Cang?If he were to attack the Silvermoon King now ... That would be suicide."That's it then. The three of you will stay here and merge into the forest orchid world!"Li Hao said and didn't say anything else. He cupped his hands towards sector Lord Sen LAN and left with his men!Seeing him leave with his people ... Sector Lord Sen LAN was silent for a while before opening the Dao universe. With Li Hao here, he had been hesitating whether to open the Dao world or not.Now that he had left, it was fine."My three fellow Daoists, please!"The forest orchid sector Lord didn't say anything more.The three first and second rank venerable sovereigns were not much of a threat.When King Huai and the other two saw this, they did not hesitate any longer. At this moment, great DAOs emerged, and Dao marks appeared. They directly poured into the Dao universe and started their own fusion.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"Hu!"After walking out of the mountain, Xun RUO heaved a sigh of relief. Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Heaven's Fate also sent him a voice transmission, Li Hao, you're really bold ... Aren't you afraid at all?"He wouldn't dare!"Li Hao shook his head. What was there to fear?Venerable the sword was here. Unsurprisingly, they were also paying attention to him.What was there to be afraid of?If it wasn't for the fact that he wanted more, along with revered sword and solitary sword, the Senlan realm Lord wouldn't even be afraid of him even if he reached the 7th stage.Heaven's Fate muttered to himself,'he's so F * cking bold.'He looked gentle and didn't pose any threat from the beginning to the end. There were no signs of falling out, but just now, he had indeed broken out in cold sweat!Li Hao didn't care about this anymore. A faint destructive force began to spread.He didn't know where Sword Saint and the others were but he knew that Sword Saint must be paying attention ... Such a peak Type 6 realm expert could even fool sector Lord Sen LAN.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In an underground crack.Venerable the sword was still meditating when he suddenly opened his eyes."That brat ... Seems like he wants to meet up with us. He just came into contact with sector Lord Sen LAN ... Could it be that he's preparing to attack?"As he said that, he smiled.He wasn't disappointed, but he had been hoping that this guy would bring him some surprises. Now, it seemed like ... This was the only way. Should they join forces to deal with sector Lord Senlan and take over the Senlan great world?That's good, it's about time.He had been here for almost a month, and if he didn't make a move soon, he would be getting anxious.Kong Ji also opened his eyes and exhaled. "That's good!"Let's gather!They had been hiding here for a month, and he felt very bored.Soon, the two of them disappeared.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶After a while.Venerable the sword's voice rang in Li Hao's ears.""Are you going to make a move?"Li Hao didn't sense the other party's arrival ... This showed how strong the other party was.,m "No... Uncle li doesn't need to appear now, I'm looking for Kong Ji! We'll contact each other again when we need to. ""You're not going to attack?"Venerable the sword was slightly stunned, but he still replied,""Actually, it's almost there. I feel that this Senlan sector Lord is about to break through. If he really does, he won't be easy to deal with!"If he killed the other party and seized the forest great world, even if he couldn't reach the sky in one step and reach grade-7 ... It would be enough to do it again.It was a rare opportunity, and if she didn't make a move now, Red Moon wouldn't be able to hold back."I won't do anything for now ... In fact ... I won't do anything to Sen LAN after this. I want to help sector Lord Sen LAN reach Grade 7!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùEven Sword Saint was stunned.What the hell?Did I hear it wrong?"Sector Lord Sen LAN has broken through to the 7th level ... He will definitely escape if he has the chance. He won't stay in Crimson Moon. I want to ... Raid the entire Crimson Moon!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùSilence!Sword Saint didn't say a word and fell into deep thought.Did I hear it wrong, or is someone crazy?This action ... Seemed to have happened in the past.Back when the human King was weak, he often stole from others 'homes ... However, that was before he became a venerable sovereign. After that, in a level eight world, the human King would not steal from others!

That was because the danger was too high!Stealing from a rank eight venerable sovereign's home in someone else's territory ... The difficulty was not ordinary.Li Hao's voice rose again."Senlan alone can't satisfy our needs. Whether it's me, senior, or Kong Ji ... The three of us are not ordinary cultivators. It's just a level 6 great world. Even if we really seize it, how much can we get? There must be countless Dao crystals and small and medium-sized worlds inside the red moon. It's impossible for the red moon master to carry all of them with him. ""Even if we only take a portion of the wealth from a rank 8 great world ... It's not inferior to a rich rank 7 great world! Moreover, I suspect that the Dao crystals Senlan is giving us right now are all they have in order to help the sector Lord advance!""Senior ... Are you willing to try?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùVenerable the sword didn't say anything. He was still thinking.He felt that he was arrogant enough, and the human King was also an extremely Savage person. Li Hao and Kong Ji actually looked more refined. He felt that neo Martial Emperor were all bandits, all fierce bandits who were not afraid of death ...Although these two were quite bold, strictly speaking, he felt that they were not as good as the human King.However, when a level-four Li Hao said that he wanted to steal from an level-eight great cosmos, venerable the sword felt that he might have made a mistake!It turns out that we're not the only lunatics in this world. Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Old Zhang hadn't even considered stealing Hongyue!Although Li Hao wasn't very strong ... After thinking about it carefully, venerable the sword realized that he had a lot to do with Xing Shen's death.As for Tian Fang's side, he had also heard some things.If it weren't for Wu Shan, the human King wouldn't have killed so many people despite his strength ... Therefore, the death of the three seventh-rank powerhouses of the red moon sect was actually closely related to Li Hao.For many years, new martial arts had never been able to kill a seventh level Crimson Moon venerable sovereign. This time, they had killed three in one fell swoop!Of course, it had something to do with his strength and the strength of the human King.Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to kill them.The two sides could be said to have an extremely tacit understanding. They cooperated from a distance and completed a triple kill.Venerable the sword was well aware of this."It's quite exciting ... I thought that killing to wake up my mind might be the most exciting thing recently. Since you put it this way ... I don't mind accompanying you!""However, you know better than me how dangerous it is!" Venerable the sword's voice came."Yes, but the harvest is also greater!""If you don't have any objections, then I naturally don't have any objections ... By the way, lonely kid, what do you think?"Kong Ji, who had been silent all this while, had a change in his expression. After a long time, he transmitted his voice,""I ... I was thinking ... Isn't it too risky? This isn't good. I know rank eight worlds very well ..."Venerable the sword and Li Hao didn't say anything, but Kong Ji said hesitantly,""Why not ... Try it? In addition, I'm afraid we'll have to open the sky universe to attract Red Moon Lord ... Haoyue, why don't ... I have my father ... Go and pester Red Moon Lord?""If the neo martial human King is no longer in Tian Fang ... I heard that he often gets lost. Maybe ... We can use my father's hand to pester him!" He said carefully, looking a little hesitant and a little timid ...However, his words made Li Hao and venerable the sword both silent.Ëâπ!When did loneliness become like this? He ... He actually wanted to try. He even wanted his father to personally take action and pester the red moon master!The second generation nouveau riche was so willful!Kong Ji continued in a rather awkward tone,""Something must happen at Tian Fang's side. Wu Shan has left the clouds, so the Lord of the clouds shouldn't care about anything else. Red moon's Lord ... If the human King doesn't appear, only my father can stop him. Also, Red Moon has a Level 7 Expert ... He won't leave. Even if the forest orchid realm Lord has reached Level 7, he won't dare to attack him ... We still have to deal with it. The key is that Red Moon has many mid level venerable sovereigns. Should I ... Call my uncle yaoyang over?""If that's the case ... Maybe ... We'll have to give a bit more to my uncle yaoyang. Of course, if he were to disappear, it would probably cause some waves. If you have the confidence, Haoyue, we don't need him to come here. We can try it ourselves!"Li Hao didn't say anything.Revered sword was speechless. These two guys spoke slowly and softly, not even comparable to the women of neo martial arts.In the end, the words he said were truly ... Ruthless!He had only said that he would give it a try, but the two of them had even started discussing how to deal with the red moon Lord.You call this trying?This was called "definitely!"If you don't want to do it, I'm going to summon my backer!How exciting!Are you going to steal from a level 8 great world?No, I'll call for a seventh-tier one!Li Hao couldn't help but laugh. "Let's wait and see. If we can make some contact with the human ruler in tianfang...Or if we can confirm that the human ruler is still here, then we won't need the radiant sovereign to do anything. If the human ruler really leaves ... Then we might need your father's help.""Alright!"The void's answer was straightforward. He was only going to pester her for a while. In order to seize the tianfang great cosmos ... Wouldn't it be normal to pester the Crimson Moon Lord?It was just a matter of convenience!It wasn't that he was going to do anything special.As for opening the tianfang great Dao universe, Li Hao didn't say anything, but Kong Ji had guessed it. Obviously, he had either considered it before, or he was really smart. Li Hao seriously suspected that Kong Ji's second generation might have really considered this!In fact, if Li Hao didn't mention it, the already wild silence would be brought up next ... That would be the real thrill. The radiant sovereign probably didn't expect his son to change so quickly.

2922 Chapter 481
 The plan was completely settled.Although the plan was not as fast as the changes, the general direction was like this. If there were any changes during the process ... Then he could only adapt to the situation.At this moment, Sword saint's thoughts were also fluctuating.Li Hao, the new king of the Silver Moon.Void, the son of the God of Light.Previously, he had thought that it was a little strange and inappropriate for the two of them to be together ... But now, he realized that Birds of a Feather really did flock together.The two of them looked gentle, but they were unwilling to be lonely.It wasn't strange for these two to meet in the chaos and have a relationship."Since it's decided, I naturally have no objections."Venerable the sword transmitted his voice again,'however, there are some details that need to be discussed clearly. If we want to steal from a level 8 macro world ... We'll die if we're not careful! Although they don't fear death, no one really wants to die. ""For example ... If sector Lord Sen LAN betrays us, betrays us ..."And now, he had even started to use the word 'betrayal'.He had to guard against this!Sword Saint felt that Li Hao's plan still had some flaws. Sector Lord Sen LAN ... If he really reached the seventh stage, are you sure he would still be afraid of us and not sell us out?Li Hao said via voice transmission, I know, don't worry, uncle li! Of course, uncle will have to take care of this ... If he wants to betray us, it will be when he advances. If Red Moon Lord comes here, he will definitely betray us immediately ... Otherwise, if he betrays us later, Red Moon Lord will be dissatisfied!""At that time, if he really dares to ... We'll kill him!"Li Hao's tone turned ruthless as he said,""I can lock onto the position of his Dao universe. This is one of the reasons! "Secondly, he has just advanced ... If I reverse time by force, even if it's only for an instant, he can still fall down to the seventh step. The seventh step and the sixth step are completely different. It will be very difficult for us to deal with a seventh step! However, the moment the opponent steps into the seventh step and falls in realm, his mental state will explode. Peak of the sixth step ... Uncle will kill him with one strike!"As soon as he said that, Sword Saint was shocked!Right! Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Even if the three of them joined forces and the other party was prepared, it would be very difficult to win against a Level-7 major cosmos absolute being.But ... What if he fell instantly?The Senlan realm Lord might have a mental breakdown. At that time, it wouldn't be too difficult for him to kill a stage six world Lord with a single sword strike. The prerequisite was that he could lock onto the position of the other's Dao universe.Li Hao, how do you lock onto him?Of course, since Li Hao had said so, he believed him. However, he was a little confused. It was not easy to lock onto a Dao universe.Li Hao didn't explain. Sector Lord Sen Lan's apparition had appeared many times in front of him. Although it wasn't his true body, he had comprehended some things previously. He had even torn down two Dao nets and had intentionally allowed the three of them to enter. He had also specially chosen a location for him to appear ...All of this was actually just in case!A person like the Senlan realmlord, if you really trusted him...You're an idiot.After reaching the seventh step, it was very likely that the other party would think that selling Li Hao's group was more worthwhile. As for the previous cooperation, it was a joke.It was normal for venerable the sword to be worried that the other party would turn hostile.And Li Hao had thought about it long ago.When that time came ... He would definitely regret it.Of course, if the other party didn't sell them out, their cooperation would naturally be smoother. This was also what Li Hao hoped to succeed. Otherwise, their plan to steal a level 8 great world would probably fail.Venerable the sword heaved a sigh of relief when he heard Li Hao's plan.This guy was a little good, he knew what he was doing.Everything was planned.He had thought that he was like the human King, deciding to take risks on impulse. If that was the case, it would depend on luck most of the time. If one's luck was slightly bad, it would be eternal damnation.At this moment, he subconsciously compared the two of them.In fact, Li Hao, who was at level four, was not qualified to compete with a human King at all. A human King was about to reach level eight and become one of the true overlords of chaos.However, it was different for venerable the sword. Strictly speaking, he had a special relationship with these two people.Even though the human King was not his true disciple, to the outside world, he was the human King's master.Li Hao's words came from Silver Moon, and his surname was li. Judging from his tone, he was most likely related to the Li family. There was also his sword technique, which was similar to the longevity sword intent. In addition, he also sensed the auras of the sword tree, sword seal, and sword stone ...In addition, he could tell that Li Hao's firmament sword had a lot to do with his own starry sky sword.He and Li Hao had a deep relationship.Of course, venerable the sword did not mention this. He was a venerable sovereign, and an Overlord at that ... How could he go up and tell Li Hao that he might be his ancestor, that he was the descendant of his grandniece for countless generations, that he had to call him ancestor, that his swordsmanship, his sword, and even his world had a lot to do with him ...Wouldn't that be asking for a snub?Venerable the sword didn't know Li Hao's abilities as an Overlord who came from the world alone, but he knew the human King too well. Whoever dared to say that to the human King, suddenly entering new martial arts from the outside, and treating the human King like a grandson ... The human King would beat them up until they had no chance to speak for the rest of their lives.Venerable the sword quickly discarded all these thoughts and said,""According to what you said, sector Lord Sen LAN should be easy to deal with! "There's another point. The three surrounding worlds ... Even if the red moon master leaves and sector Lord Sen LAN doesn't care, the red moon still has a Type 7. We can work together to deal with one, but if the three nearby worlds join in, the endless sky World will have two Type 7 experts! In other words, there are four other seventh rank venerable sovereigns nearby, and they're still from the Crimson Moon Alliance ..."

In addition to the seventh-rank in Red Moon ... That was five.Even if a level 8 was gone, the three worlds nearby were not far away. Once they joined in ... It would be difficult to escape.All of this had to be taken into consideration."Teleport!"Li Hao sent a voice transmission, if you can't escape, try teleporting! I'll return to Tian Fang once. When I open the realm, I'll reach an agreement with the Dao chess to give me a chance to teleport ..."That way, he would be able to teleport from the Crimson Moon to Tian Fang in an instant, and he would avoid danger."Daoqi ... Can you agree? Even if it can, this level nine sovereign weapon might not be that trustworthy. Once it teleports us to the red moon Lord, we'll be dead immediately!""Let's try!"Li Hao said telepathically,"daoqi was very supportive of it the first few times. When Kong Ji came, they supported teleportation. In my opinion, we have to take risks. If possible, we should escape from the Crimson Moon and not teleport. If not ... We can only take risks!"He was a gambler, but he would also minimize the danger. Nothing in the world was perfect.He didn't even dare to take the slightest risk ... And he could become a venerable sovereign?In Li Hao's opinion, whoever had a 50% chance of winning was not gambling. Whoever had a 10% chance of winning was gambling with their lives. Whoever had a 50% chance of winning was lucky!But now, according to his plan, he still had a 50% chance of success.At this moment, Kong Ji sent a voice transmission,"then how do we return to Tian Fang?" There's no way to teleport back now. It'll take a long time. The Crimson Moon will spend at least a month in the void to reach Tian Fang ...""In addition, there will still be some movement when the chess pieces teleport. If Red Moon Lord is near Tian Fang or passing by and encounters the teleportation fluctuations, he might notice something."All of these were dangerous.But Li Hao actually didn't know about these dangers.He didn't know that there would be fluctuations when teleporting, but Kong Ji seemed to know."Will there be a big fluctuation during the teleportation?""It's alright. It's not too big, but top experts can more or less sense it ... When I was teleported here, I might have encountered a top existence. It was extremely terrifying. I even felt the threat of death in an instant. The other party might even cut off the teleportation channel!"Kong Ji didn't mention this before, so there was nothing to say.If he said it, it would seem like he had done a lot of hard work.It was normal to be dangerous.However, if he specifically mentioned it, he would seem to be taking credit. Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Now that Li Hao had decided to use it, he had to remind them. He had sensed that the teleportation process was not instantaneous. Instead, they wandered in the chaos through a special array at a very high speed, almost as fast as a level 9.This was the only way to instantly arrive at another location.Chaos did not have multiple spaces, so it was impossible to overlap and tear space. Teleportation was only a compression of the process.If they encountered a strong Esper, they could even directly interrupt the teleportation process ... Li Hao's expression changed slightly. It was indeed very powerful.One had to know that Dao chess was refined by an eighth-tier great universe. The shadow had also said that it could teleport Li Hao away if it encountered a seventh-tier, and the other party wouldn't be able to keep up. However, if it encountered an eighth-tier ... It would be difficult.Did this mean that he had encountered a rank eight on the lonely road?"Human King ..."Li Hao froze for a moment, then suddenly said,""Did you encounter the human King?"In Senlan, he also knew about Tian Fang's matter.The human King had suddenly appeared and killed a Crimson Moon rank-7. According to the time ... At that time, the top master near Tian Fang would most likely be the human King.A powerhouse at the peak of the seventh step.A powerful being like the human King might have discovered it. Furthermore, the route might be the same. The other party would go from the Crimson Moon to Tian Fang, and Kong Ji would come from Tian Fang to the Crimson Moon ...Kong Ji was startled, he thought for a moment and said, "That's possible!""If he's a human King, according to the rumors ... He's fearless. At that time, if he discovered something, wouldn't he come to kill it with a saber?"Venerable the sword remained silent.Do you think Fang ping is an idiot?He was not an idiot!Teleportation, chaos, tier 9 ... Venerable the sword, on the other hand, was somewhat certain that they had encountered Fang ping. However, looking at the situation, Fang ping would definitely wonder if a rank-9 was in charge of the teleportation. The rumors outside were just rumors.From revered sword's point of view, other than the human King not being willing to think ... If he really did think, his intelligence was not low. If his intelligence was low, he would have died long ago.It was suspected to be a grade-9 teleportation, so he would be an idiot if he tried to stop it.He must have considered this and chose to give up.On top of that, if Xing Shen were to die in the teleportation formation, the human King would surely be able to guess that the teleportation formation had something to do with Xing Shen's death ...Venerable the sword replied,"it's fine. There's no need to worry about the human King. He should know that the teleportation is related to us. Even if he doesn't know the details, he won't meddle in our business."Hearing this, Li Hao and Kong Ji were certain that they had indeed encountered a human King.Kong Ji didn't say anything.However, he was secretly a little shocked. A human King ... Even if he wasn't at the eighth rank, he might really be only one step away from the eighth rank. Coupled with his powerful combat strength and yin and yang DAOs, he might really be able to fight with an eighth rank.The progress of neo martial was really fast."I understand. I'll be careful!"Li Hao didn't say anything else. He quickly said,""Uncle Li, you should leave first. The only thing you need to do now is...Keep an eye on sector Lord Sen LAN! When there are enough rank-6s in the great world within the boundary, more than four of them ... Then you can make your move!"

2924 Chapter 481
At least four!"Then be careful!" Venerable the sword didn't say much. With the two of them joining forces and some venerable sovereigns around them, four rank six experts might not be able to do anything to them.It was just like how Li Hao had not asked if venerable sword could kill four stage six experts.Could he?He definitely could!If a revered sword, who was almost invincible in the same realm, couldn't even fight against four of them ... Then he wouldn't be a revered sword.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Soon, the sword Saint left and disappeared.Kong Ji, on the other hand, silently appeared beside Li Hao. His appearance had changed, and he vaguely looked like King Huai. King Huai and the other two were fusing the great Dao.The others had not noticed the appearance of the void before, but now that a few more people had appeared, they were all shocked.Heaven's Fate's original body sized up Kong Ji ... Then, he moved away a little. This person didn't look like a good person. This kind of person was quiet and didn't bark when he bit. Heaven's Fate didn't really want to interact with these people.It was very troublesome!Kong Ji didn't pay attention to the others. He was actually a little arrogant.To ordinary people, it was a kind of indifference, a sense of disregard.Rich second generation, genius second generation, rich second generation who were willing to start their own business ... Such people were actually very ambitious. If these people weren't li Hao's friends, he wouldn't have taken a fancy to even two masters of the great Dao ... Such weak Masters of the great Dao.As for Li Hao, that was when they first met. They had a similar temperament, even though Li Hao was also a country bumpkin at that time.Kong Ji's interest was piqued, and they chatted for a while more before they got in touch. Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  In fact, Li Hao was the same. He didn't care about ordinary venerable sovereigns, even if they were only at the fourth level."There's a rank six and two rank five from the red moon!"Li Hao explained the situation as he walked,""I won't kill those at the sixth step. If I kill them, they will feel an immense threat and might even send a seventh step cultivator! We have to give them a feeling that if we join forces, we can be a fatal threat to those at the sixth step, and we can even kill two of them ... In order to ensure that they can kill us, at least three or four of them must come!""We'll control the degree of it ourselves. "Kong Ji nodded slightly."I understand. It's not that easy to deal with a sixth-rank fighter. I may have entered the sixth-rank, but I entered in a hurry. I'm not a venerable swordsman. Don't think too highly of me. I'm not afraid of a one-on-one fight, but a one-on-two fight ... It's very difficult for me now.""It's good enough that you can suppress a Tier 6 martial artist!"Li Hao smiled.Kong Ji nodded. No problem."If I can't even suppress one of them ... Then wouldn't it be a waste for me to give up on the fifth-rank path of light and switch to the path of Nirvana for 500 years?He cultivated the path of light and was at least a Grade 6 cultivator.Li Hao then looked at the others and said,""Other than the Dao universe that can't be revealed, we'll use all other means we can! Our goal this time is to kill those two at the fifth step!" "We need to be fast!"Li Hao said in a deep voice,"we can't give those unaffiliated cultivators and some experts in the dark a chance. Otherwise, once these people interfere, there will be a lot of venerable sovereigns. It will be a huge problem!" I don't want them to affect our plan. "Everyone looked at each other, feeling a little pressured.Although they had many stage three experts, killing stage five experts was two stages above them.Li Hao continued,"we just have to work hard to kill one ... Let's work together. I'll hold one of them back. It's extremely difficult for me to kill a Tier 5 expert, but it's not a big deal to hold one back!"Kong Ji could deal with the level six, and Li Hao could deal with a level five. The rest of them, a group of low-level venerable sovereigns, did not have much hope of killing a level five.It was true that they had the advantage in numbers, but none of them had the ability to kill a Tier 5.At this moment, Heaven's Fate was slightly hesitant ... After a long while, he took the initiative to speak, feeling a little depressed.""Why don't I merge with my clone? Under fusion, even though it can't reach the fourth rank, it can still reach the peak of the third rank!"There didn't seem to be any changes, but at the peak of stage three, he could be considered a beginner martial artist and an origin as one cultivator. Other things aside, at least he had one thing that was not bad ... He could take a beating!Even a fifth stage venerable sovereign might not be able to kill him in one blow.Now that he had become one with his clone, his ability to take a beating was second only to Kong Ji and Li Hao.This person actually took the initiative to merge into one!At this moment, the clone was a little surprised. In the next moment, he understood something.Why did they become one?Because King Huai had gone to work!It was still a rather risky job.Even King Huai was working hard to lay down in the future. Empyrean terminus's original body clearly also understood a principle. If he did not put in any effort at the critical moment, it would be very difficult to lie down in the future."I can be a meat shield for a few times ... But I don't have the ability to kill Tier 5 players. I can only withstand a few big moves ..."Li Hao thought for a while and nodded, that's not bad! However ... Who will lead the two of you?"Previously, both his clone and his main body were unwilling to be the leader.And now?Celestial pole's original body looked at his clone and was a little depressed.""What do you think?"The clone remained silent.I won 't!I'm just a clone.At this moment, even Kong Ji was a little interested. He sized up the two of them and couldn't help but send a message,""A clone and the main body are fighting for control? It seems that the disadvantage of a clone is still very big ...""No, neither of them wants the control!"

2925 Chapter 481
‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùKong Ji was stunned and speechless.Neo martial Heaven's Fate truly lived up to its reputation!It was said that the two gangsters of new martial arts were Heaven's Fate and King Huai. King Huai had no background, but Heaven's Fate had one. His father was the Western Emperor, a middle-stage venerable sovereign. It was said that he might have reached the fifth or even the sixth level ...As a result, the neo martial artists were all making crazy progress. This Heaven's Fate had slacked for thousands of years, but he had only barely stepped into the third stage.This kind of person didn't even want the control right now ... What a weirdo!At this moment, celestial pole's original body was a little helpless. After a long while, he said,""Then let's fuse as we please ... It doesn't matter who's in charge, it's all about who's the one with the clearer memories, isn't it? It doesn't matter!"He could fuse them at will!The clone had no objections to this.If all the clones and the main body in the world could be so "harmonious", there wouldn't be so many clones, and there wouldn't be such a huge drawback. There wouldn't be such a thing as the clones and the main body fighting for control.They were truly an extremely harmonious pair!Li Hao was also speechless and ignored them.After a while, the two Heaven's Fate powerhouses came to an agreement and started to merge their bodies together.No matter how lucky he was, it was impossible for him to step into the fourth stage.Even the master of the great Dao was not at the fourth rank.Therefore, when these two fused together, they were quite harmonious. They didn't have many pursuits. They just fused naturally, and they didn't pursue entering the fourth tier in the process.However, Li Hao glanced at it and felt a little emotional.The Dao was natural!When did it matter? was it considered a natural Dao?Was his state of mind calm, or was his mental state very strong?Although the two heaven-grade powerhouses did not show any signs of stepping into the 4th tier, there was no deviation in their fusion. It was so natural that their power increased bit by bit, and their auras were extremely stable!Just one word, steady!"Brother Kong Ji, turn into your clone. That way, we'll have one less venerable sovereign!"Kong Ji didn't care, and he quickly changed to the appearance of the heaven pole clone.In this way, the vacancy of a venerable sovereign could be filled.As for Heaven's Fate, his expression didn't change much ... This made the others feel a little strange. Although this was the first time they had seen a venerable sovereign's clone fuse, director Zhao's clone had fused with it in the Silver Moon world before, and it had been struggling.In the end, the two venerable sovereigns merged without any disturbance.In fact ... There were still some ripples.At that moment, two voices appeared in celestial pole's mind."My Lord, you've gone too far. Where are your memories?""My memories? Other than a few fights in my memory ... I've only been in neo martial arts for a few decades. I've been sleeping all the time, what memories do I have?""You ..."  Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  The clone was speechless. He was really ... Completely speechless!For the past 50 years, besides fighting two or three times and being in a nonchalant state, the main body had been sleeping for almost all the time!Are you Emperor Cang?F * ck you!In fact, he had been sleeping all this time, but after all, it had been 100000 years since the Silver Moon appeared. There was more or less some fun in the 100000 years, so he had been awake for some time. Even if he woke up once every 1000 years for a few years, he would have been awake for a few hundred years!Therefore, his memories, after being separated from his main body, were far better than his main body 's.When the two of them merged, their memories were actually the same in the beginning, but the key was in the end ... In the end, the main body had almost no memories of the end, while he had experienced a lot.After the fusion ... It was actually the clone that took over more of the mind.At this moment, as they merged, be it the original body or the clone, their memories began to connect. Everything they had experienced was fixed in their memories.After an unknown amount of time, the celestial pole opened his eyes.Seeing that everyone was looking at him, he was a little puzzled.""Why are you looking at me?"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù"You ... Are you alright?" Li Hao was a little curious.Heaven's Fate laughed,"what could happen?" I am me, my clone is me, and my true body is me. I'll just fuse with it for a bit, what can happen?""Then ...""You want to ask who dominated me?""Uh ... I just wanted to ask."Li Hao was a little embarrassed.Heaven's Fate, on the other hand, did not seem to mind."Actually, after the fusion, I realized that I'm just myself. Whoever takes the lead will be me. I'm just one person, so there's no such thing as who takes the lead. It's just that Silver Moon has more memories of the later part and neo martial has less, but there's not much of a difference."Li Hao nodded. Is that so?Then, did you two fight for loneliness before? Also, the fusion of the clones ... Was actually so harmonious. It was really F * cking strange!This is not in line with my expectations!In terms of strength, he had made some progress. Li Hao took a look and found that his aura was much stronger than before. After all, he had fused with a level-two clone.However, he was still restricted by the great Dao.He also couldn't go straight to the 4th rank.On the side of the two masters of the great Dao, there were not many changes. One more level-two had been integrated into the great Dao universe, and the difference was not too big. At present, it would be a big problem for the two masters of the great Dao to reach level four.He didn't know if these two would have the chance to break through the current restrictions after this plan succeeded.At this point, Li Hao's side had also reached the peak of their strength.Level 6 Kong Ji, Level 4 Li Hao, Level 3 Hong Yitang, Qian Wuliang, Xun RUO, hei Bao, and Tian Ji, Level 2 Lin Hongyu, King Huai, Chan Xiu, and Yuan who was only one step away from Level 2.

Of course, this didn't include dumb cat.Li Hao couldn't tell what was going on with second cat.Before this, second cat had only been a projection. Now that it wanted to enter the real world, Li Hao wasn't sure if it was still around the second rank, nor did he ask.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Just as the celestial pole was fusing ...Outside one of the cracks was the one Li Hao and the others had abandoned. At this moment, three venerable sovereigns had arrived!Devouring the soul, shocking the soul, and greed for life.In an instant, three auras appeared in the forest world. Around them, whether it was the rank six venerable Emperor Yu Xiu who was guarding the other crack or the six venerable sovereigns from the three macro worlds further away, they were all moved.It's here!The red moon was still strong. Even if it suffered heavy losses, even if it still had to defend its native world and guard against new martial artists ... It could mobilize a large number of middle-stage venerable sovereigns at will.Only two had died, and in the blink of an eye, three had arrived.The three venerable sovereigns landed in the crack.The leader, the soul devouring Emperor, looked around with cold eyes. A powerful consciousness spread out in all directions. In the blink of an eye, his voice came from the other two cracks. Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  "Where are those ten thousand scoundrels?"He was very arrogant!However, Emperor Yu Xiu, who was also rank 6, didn't think much of it. At this moment, he slowly said,""In the southern area of Senlan ... I'm not too sure about the exact location.""En!""Are you Yu Xiu?" Shi hun replied."Yes.""Fellow cultivator Yu Xiu, we came here to kill those thieves! I hope you won't affect our operation, fellow Daoist. "Yu Xiu was silent for a moment before he slowly said,""I won 't. Don't worry."Shi hun kept calling him fellow Daoist. He looked polite, but he was not polite at all.Don't affect them!What did he mean by not affecting her?Who knows?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶On the other side.Shi Hun's attitude was slightly different. He didn't have the kind of arrogance that he had for a sixth-rank cultivator, but he also had the reservation of a powerhouse."Fellow Daoists, we are allies. If monarch Sen LAN dares to attack at a critical moment ... I'll need your support!"The experts from the Three Realms were also very polite. "Don't worry! Senlan won't dare to make a move against senior Shi hun ... If she does, we won't just sit back and watch!""That's good!"Soul Eater's voice carried a hint of a smile. "We've always been supportive of Senlan, but she didn't appreciate it. She bewitched those ten thousand scoundrels and killed many of our fellow cultivators! Of course, the sector Lord is magnanimous and won't argue with the Senlan people over this. We have always been the type of people who don't attack unless attacked ..."The venerable sovereigns didn't take the polite words seriously. If Hong Yue didn't care about her reputation and the attitude of the three worlds, she would have attacked Senlan a long time ago. What was the point of saying all this?Who didn't know what the red moon was thinking? However, the strong preyed on the weak, and the Crimson Moon still cared about her face ... For the three worlds, she had already given them face.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶He greeted the venerable sovereigns on both sides.Shi hun looked at the other cracks. Over there, there was a group of Senlan thearchs. Over at the realm gate, there was also a fifth-stage Senlan.He didn't care about them. He looked around and suddenly said,""Yan Fang fellow Daoist, since you're already here, why don't you show yourself?"In the void, a figure gradually appeared.It was Yan Fang.At this moment, Yan Fang's expression was a little complicated. He looked at the few of them but didn't say anything."Daoist Yan Fang, is that myriad DAOs ... Monarch Senlan?" Shi hun was also calm.Yan Fang was silent for a moment, then shook his head, No.Eroding soul revealed a faint smile,""Since that's not the case, wandao killed a few of my good friends. I'm going to seek revenge from him. Will Senlan ... Stop me?"Yan Fang took a deep breath."My three fellow Daoists ... What identity have you come with?""Rogue cultivator, sixth rank rogue cultivator!" Shi hun laughed.Bullshit!Yan Fang didn't say anything.Even though the red moon was severely damaged, it was still as overbearing as before. It was slightly better than before, but not much better.Who doesn't know your identity as a Soul Devourer ... Rogue cultivator, do you dare to act so arrogantly?Yan Fang suppressed the anger in his heart, and said in a low voice,""As for the myriad DAOs sect ... Since they've offended you, fellow Daoist, their relationship with Senlan is only a business deal. However, if the other wandering cultivators interfere, I will interfere. This is Senlan!""That's the first reason ... Second, fellow Daoists, since you're all rogue cultivators, you have to follow the rules of the Forest orchid!""What rules?" Shi hun laughed."First, you are not allowed to hurt my people. You are not allowed to fight in my Urban area!""Second, the three itinerant cultivators under the command of the myriad DAOs sect have chosen to merge with the great Dao of forest. They will no longer participate in the battle of the myriad DAOs sect .... They are not to be implicated!""What?""Three venerable sovereigns?" Shi hun frowned."Who is this?""They're all weaklings. One rank one and two rank twos ... They didn't participate in the killing before. They were just perfunctory."Shi hun frowned slightly and after a while, he said in a low voice,""Senlan recruited them and made them join the Senlan Dao...That's bold! At the critical moment, the ten thousand DAOs won't merge with Sen LAN, right?""It's not that we can't let the three weaklings go ..." He said coldly."However, there's one thing Senlan has to do. Don't let anyone else integrate into Senlan. Otherwise ..."Yan Fang's eyes flickered with anger and unwillingness as he said in a low voice,""It's my right to integrate or not! Fellow Daoists, this place is a major world, after all!"

The three of them laughed without saying anything.The great world?A rank 6 major world was only dominant in a medium-level world. In the eyes of a rank 7 or rank 8 world, a rank 6 world would lower the prestige of a major world for no reason. Who would take it seriously?After careful consideration, Shi hun decided to give him some face. In the future, they might be colleagues!He smiled and said,"alright!" "Then I'll be direct. Those three ... Since we weren't here before, they'll be Senlan's venerable sovereigns from now on. We can ignore them, but the ten thousand DAOs, and the others, are absolutely not allowed to enter Senlan!"Yan Fang seemed to be struggling. After a long time, he exhaled, sighed, and nodded."Good! But ... Behind this myriad DAOs Emperor ...""Seventh-rank fire element?""Fellow Daoist, do you think that I, Red Moon, need to be afraid of even a seventh-rank?"After saying that, he suddenly coughed."You're wrong. I'm a rogue cultivator ... A seventh-rank one. That's amazing. We'll naturally be careful." Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Yan Fang was furious!Although everyone knew it, at this moment, the three emperors of the red moon were acting like they were from the red moon and wanted to be an itinerant cultivator. What could they do even if they said something wrong in front of them ... This made him extremely angry and unwilling!How hateful!However, anger and unwillingness were useless. Sen LAN didn't dare to offend Hong Yue. At this moment, she suddenly felt that those Red Moon sovereign whom Wan Dao had killed ... Were really F * cking good!This group of bastards, the more they die, the better.This was Senlan, but here ... They were still so unscrupulous.The sector Lord was right. If one didn't reach Level 7, they wouldn't have any status in Red Moon. Even if they joined Red Moon, they would have to live under someone else's roof. If it was possible ... If Sen LAN could reach Level 7 and be independent, that would be the best result.Yan Fang suppressed the anger in his heart, and said in a low voice,""That's it then! Fellow Daoists, you can just follow the rules of my Senlan. As for the others ... If anyone else participates, I, Senlan, will have the power to fight!"Including the other three worlds!The three great worlds were strong, but they were only seventh level venerable sovereigns. Would they dare to come?Sen LAN wasn't afraid!Eroding soul laughed. It didn't matter, as long as Senlan was afraid of me, Red Moon.As for the others ... Since he had come personally, did he need to worry about not being able to deal with a Tier 4?"Yan Fang, my friend, I've troubled you this time. We'll have plenty of opportunities to get closer in the future!""This time, we won't have a good chat. Next time ... Let's sit down and have a good chat. I have plenty of good wine and tea. You're always welcome to come!" Shi hun smiled meaningfully.Yan Fang didn't say anything and directly left.As soon as he left, the rank five venerable sovereign beside him sneered,""I gave you face, but you didn't want it! If it wasn't for the unforeseen event, would a mere rank six world have the qualifications to join us?"The Crimson Moon had devoured many worlds over the years.There was even a great world.Even the major cosmos absolute beings had been killed!This Sen LAN even started to resist. This time, the sector Lord had said that he would take her in, not devour her. He even said that he would treat her well and help her break through to Level 7. Such a condition and she still rejected it. She was truly too greedy!Shi hun laughed,"that's how people are. The more polite they are, the more important they feel!" In fact ... Just wait and see! When that day comes, they'll understand that their current arrogance and lack of cooperation will eventually backfire on them!"Jing po was a little depressed,"I'm just afraid that when the time comes, the realmlord will treat these people with respect. He might even surpass us. That would be really hard to bear."Shi hun laughed and didn't care.How was that possible?If these people really joined the red moon, they would be the vanguard against the new martial, including sector Lord Sen LAN. At that time, if they were to integrate into the red moon, it wouldn't be up to them!"Alright, let's not talk about this. Let's go and find that bastard of the myriad DAOs sect. Kill him so that we can go back and report!"Shi hun laughed."This guy is very bold. He killed several of our venerable sovereigns and even the realm Lord was alerted. Bringing his head back is no less effective than killing a rank six!"The other two nodded and smiled as well, suppressing all the unhappiness from earlier. Not bad!This was an opportunity, an opportunity to make a contribution. Not only would there be no danger, but he could also make a great contribution.As for that Yan Fang, if he dares to interfere ... It would be best to kill him as well!The three of them quickly disappeared.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.Wisps of consciousness swept through the entire forest orchid world. Venerable sovereigns were eager to try!The Crimson Moon expert was about to make his move.There's a good show to watch!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the Dao universe.Sector Lord Sen Lan's expression was cold as he observed everything. After a long time, he looked into the distance. Hong Yue ...He searched the surroundings, but he could not find venerable the sword.New martial!"The Silver Moon King ..."The Silver Moon King's speed of improvement was truly fast!Have Yi and Chan Xiu joined the neo martial world?Not necessarily!However, the two of them had the aura of a great Dao universe ... A new Dao universe?The Silver Moon was actually able to give birth to a new Dao universe. It was truly extraordinary.Of course, as the Master of the Universe, he was now in control of the great Dao universe. The new Dao universe was a huge temptation to Ordinary Level-six cultivators, but to him, it was limited.He didn't even have enough energy to merge his own Dao universe, let alone an outsider 's.He would think about it after he gained control of the Senlan great Dao universe.He then thought of the new venerable sovereign that had appeared beside Li Hao ... Was this the Silver Moon King's trump card against the three red Moon emperors?Two were at the fifth step, and one was at the sixth step.This person had a very special aura, unlike the aura of the great path universe, which had a vague sense of Quietus ...At this moment, he had actually guessed it.It was truly terrifying!Could it be that the divine light plane was also secretly involved in all of this?As a result, he didn't dare to intervene or participate in this matter. If the neo martial was also treated as a tier 8, he would definitely die a tragic death if he, a master of the sixth-tier, participated in the competition between three eighth-tier great cosmoses!"Wu Shan killed Hong Yu, the human Emperor killed Ji Huo, and the sword Saint and the others joined forces to kill Xing Shen ... Hong Yue ... I'm afraid we're in trouble."These thoughts flashed through his mind, but he suppressed everything in the end. At this moment, sector Lord Sen LAN only felt sorrow.He was just a background wall for this group of people.He then looked at the three red Moon sovereigns and sneered. How arrogant. If it was a seventh or eighth rank, they could be arrogant, but what did they have to be arrogant about?He didn't know how long he could Live!

Chapter 2928 Heavy Losses (1)
The void trembled.Someone was coming through the void. Li Hao turned his head and looked at them. His eyes flickered, and he quickly left with his people.The moment he left, the void shattered.The three venerable sovereigns had arrived!Shi hun sneered. His perception was not weak. He had just advanced to fourth stage venerable sovereign. It seemed that he was quite capable. But ... How far could he escape?"Lord Shi hun, should we separate and block them?"Jing po asked in a low voice. It was still difficult to catch up to a fourth level venerable sovereign who had escaped with his men. Of course, if they were separated ... It would be much easier.The Soul Eater was silent for a moment. Should they separate?No matter what, myriad DAOs had killed two tier 4 existences. Even if his true battle prowess was not as strong as Tier 5, the difference was not too great. It was still somewhat dangerous to separate.After thinking for a while, he spoke."You guys join forces. Don't split into three. Just split into two!"Two tier 5 experts!One, he was really worried that he would be eaten by the other party. Although he was nearby, he was also worried that he wouldn't be able to arrive in time."Surround him from the front and back, trap him and kill him!""Alright!"The two fifth rank venerable sovereigns did not say much. They were not like the previous two fourth rank venerable sovereigns. In their hands, two fourth rank venerable sovereigns could not defeat one of them.The two of them quickly flew in another direction.The void rippled, and the speed was extremely fast.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"What?"At this moment, Li Hao was stunned.p Beside him, Kong Ji was also stunned. He looked at Li Hao in surprise. They were still discussing how to kill two tier 5 players without killing the Tier 6 ones, which would alert the Tier 6 players but not make them too scared ... Acting was actually very tiring.But ... They split up?"Why did you split up?" Kong Ji was puzzled.Li Hao paused. After a long while, he slowly said,""We ... Have overestimated ourselves!"What did that mean?Kong Ji was stunned for a moment. After a while, he reacted and felt a little strange.We've overestimated ourselves!The two of them felt that it would be very difficult to kill them. Two rank-5s and one rank-6s were actually very difficult ... Under such circumstances, why would the other party split up?But ... But their Strongest Battle record was killing two fourth stage venerable sovereigns.Why should Red Moon sovereign be afraid of you?Are you all very strong?If two rank five venerable sovereigns could not kill a rank four or a group of low-rank venerable sovereigns, then what was the point of being a rank five venerable sovereign?So ... They didn't expect the other side to split up! However, Red Moon had divided her forces. As long as they surrounded them, they would definitely die!The two of them had different thoughts, which caused Li Hao to misjudge.This was a good thing, but Li Hao and Kong Ji were both slightly embarrassed. It was clear that they had overestimated themselves, which led to a deviation in their plan ... It might not be as troublesome as they had thought, such as how to put on an act in front of a Tier 6.As long as he could quickly kill the two tier 5 players before he reached Tier 6, everything would be fine.Li Hao didn't know whether to laugh or cry.Kong Ji also nodded and sighed.'We really think highly of ourselves. It's a pity that others don't take us seriously. Next time, pay attention. In the eyes of others, this is just a motley crew of a fourth-rank venerable sovereign with a group of low-rank venerable sovereigns.' Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  Li Hao, who was at rank four, did not seem weak, but he was only not weak. He was not strong enough to make venerable sovereigns of a great world fear him."Get rid of that rank six and head toward the two rank fives ... Brother kongji will kill one of them, and I will join forces with the others to kill one of them!"This time, there was no need to hesitate.Kong Ji nodded. He was already a little thirsty.These were just the appetizers.Had they not been worried that their plan would fail because of their speed, they would have cast a world of Nirvana and frozen them with Li Hao's time freeze!In a few moves, these people were all dead.If it still doesn't work, I'll give venerable the sword a few rounds of health recovery like before, and the entire Senlan will be wiped out!Ever since they had killed a stage seven monster together, both Li Hao and lonely void had become quite arrogant.And their strength ... Was enough for them to show off in front of these people.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"You're still running!"Jing po and tan Sheng both sneered. At this moment, the three of them had split up. They joined forces to chase and intercept the group of people from the other side. They were about to meet up with them.Behind them, there was a sixth stage venerable sovereign!At this moment, Jing po chuckled,"a fourth-grade Emperor weapon is not bad. It's said that there's even a Dao domain within it. In that case, it's probably not inferior to a fifth-grade Emperor weapon. The realm Lord doesn't like it. Tan Sheng, do you think ... Among the three of us, whoever kills the other first will have a chance to obtain it?"There was greed in Tan Sheng's eyes, but he didn't speak.He also wanted it.However, there was a high probability that it would consume the soul.Jingpo clearly had some thoughts, but didn't he think that he was a rank five while the other was a rank six?When Jing po saw that he was not speaking, he transmitted a message,""Even if we can't get it, there's a Dao domain left behind by a tier 7 sovereign weapon ... It might be of great help to us if we comprehend it for a while."Tan Sheng nodded his head. This was true.Rank seven Dao domain. Although Hong Yue had many rank seven experts before her, rank seven venerable sovereigns would not casually display their Dao domain for them to admire."Let's not talk about this, let's kill them first ..."Tan Sheng laughed."The power of a fourth stage venerable sovereign's great Dao is still very strong. Kill him and share the power of the great Dao. This is our spoils of war!"As for the other things, they were difficult.

Chapter 2929 Heavy Losses (2)
Shocked nodded, and the two of them sped up, quickly flying in the direction that Li Hao's group had escaped.The entire world was filled with auras.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the air, many people were watching the show and waiting.Looking at the three powerful venerable sovereigns quickly shrinking the escape circle of the other party to a very small extent, many people shook their heads. They were done for!How boring!From the looks of it, he didn't even have the chance to pick up the scraps.He had thought that the ten thousand DAOs would have some way to deal with him, but ... There might be a tier 7 behind him. He just didn't know if they would dare to show up.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The Great Hall of the forest.At this moment, many venerable sovereigns were watching. Ji Hao frowned slightly,""Should we stop them?"Yan Fang didn't say anything.Beside him, a fifth rank venerable sovereign said coldly,""Stop him? You're going to stop them? Ji Hao, do you know who this is? The Crimson Moon's soul devouring!"Ji Hao frowned and did not say anything.The bastards of the Daoist master's lineage ... Were really disgusting.A group of venerable sovereigns from the Crimson Moon were hunting the venerable sovereigns that they had hired in their territory. No matter what their true purpose was or what their true identity was, they were representing Sen LAN at this moment.In the end ... Regardless of whether he could or could not, at least in terms of attitude, he should still be angry and condemned.,m These guys from the Daoist master's lineage acted as if Hong Yue was their master. They couldn't wait for Hong Yue's venerable sovereign to kill them.He was a little angry!As someone from the world Overlord's bloodline, he didn't want Wan Dao and the others to be killed. But at this moment, he was indeed helpless.He wanted to argue back, but the other party was a Tier 5 ...Just as he was thinking, Yan Fang's voice sounded in his ear,""Ignore him! It wasn't that he didn't want to take revenge, but the time wasn't right! On Senlan's Day of advancement ... These people will all be eliminated!"Yan Fang's expression did not change, but Ji Hao was shocked!"We'll just sit back and watch the show ... The situation isn't that tense. We can't attack the people of the red moon ... But if anything happens, we'll deal with those who interfere immediately!"Ji Hao did not say anything, but his heart was still in shock.Was there anything that he did not know?The sector Lord and old Yan seemed to be planning something.As for the ten thousand DAOs ... It might be a crucial part of this.Yan Fang didn't say anything more, only silently observing. He wanted to see how strong this group of people were, how many trump cards they had, and how they would be able to make Hong Yue send more sixth-ranked and not seventh-ranked ones.Just as he was looking at it, in the next moment, his eyes moved slightly.This group of people ... Were about to make contact with two tier 5 players!At this moment, he was completely focused, not moving at all as he silently watched.Tier 5!Would he die?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Everyone was watching.The Senlan realmlord and Yan Fang were waiting to see how long the two tier 5 experts could live. As for the Rogue cultivators and the three great worlds, they wanted to see how long the myriad DAOs sect could last, and whether a tier 7 expert would appear personally ...Because, at this moment, the two sides were about to meet! A shocking laugh resounded through the heavens and the earth, carrying a hint of coldness."Run! A bunch of clowns who don't know their place!"There's no place to escape, right?Meanwhile, Li Hao shouted,""Kill! Killing them is our only chance of survival. The brave will win!"BOOM!The group of venerable sovereigns quickly charged toward the two rank five experts.The void was shattering.At this time, all the venerable sovereigns were watching nervously. The myriad DAOs sect's group was really bold. At this point, even a low-level venerable sovereign still had the courage to charge forward. It had to be said that they were very courageous to face two level five venerable sovereigns from the macro worlds."Ha!" Best novel online free at üá´‚Äãüá∑‚Äãüá¥‚Äãüá≤‚Äã nœÉŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  "You're courting death!" Jing po shouted angrily. Suddenly, a shocking force spread out, shaking the great Dao. Li Hao and his group, except for Kong Ji and Li Hao, were all shocked.It was as if his mind had been intimidated!It was shocking!Tan Sheng chuckled and the power of Dao spread in the air. In the next moment, Qian Wuliang and the others all had the same thought in their minds ... I don't want to die!I don't want to die!He even had the vague idea of surrendering, killing Li Hao, and surrendering to the red moon to save his life.Greed for life!Sovereign greed's Dao wasn't to be greedy for his own life, but to make others fear death.The Dao of the Crimson Moon was indeed not simple.Even though these venerable sovereigns knew that they would definitely win, at least for now ... At this moment, they couldn't help but think,"that's an eighth-rank macro world. What if we lose?"He would die!As his mind was in turmoil, the thought of being greedy for life emerged. All of a sudden, he became a little unstable.A rank five venerable sovereign in a great world was much more powerful than he had imagined.In the crowd, even Qian Wuliang was a little shaken. The power of the great Dao was shaking and wearing down this feeling. He knew that he had fallen into a trap, but it was hard for him to suppress the thoughts that appeared in his mind.The two type 5 powerhouses from the major worlds displayed their might in an instant.In their eyes, all the low-stage venerable sovereigns were not worth mentioning.The power of the great Dao emerged, and these people were just lambs waiting to be slaughtered!Jing po smiled."Other than those ten thousand DAOs, the other venerable sovereigns are nothing. How can they besiege us?"You ... Don't have the right!The two venerable sovereigns quickly charged at Li Hao and the others. They wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to deal with the myriad DAOs.They were very fast!In the blink of an eye, it appeared in front of everyone.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"We're finished!"At this moment, everyone was shaking their heads.The rank six Yu Xiu shook his head, the venerable sovereigns of the three major worlds shook their heads, and some venerable sovereigns who were hiding in the dark also shook their heads.Boring!It was too easy.
