The star that he had left in the palace ... Was flickering.He could also vaguely feel that something was shuttling over. As the master of the seventh rank, the world was still his. The defense of the seventh rank world was even stronger, and the outer layer was covered by the bed universe.He could even sense that something was traveling through the great Dao universe.The target ... Was the star in the palace.Li Hao?He was slightly moved. When Li Hao had handed this to him last time, he had been very worried. However, both parties had agreed that Li Hao would not harm the Thunder World, so he had accepted it.Could it be ... He's here?What kind of method was this?It was a little scary!The Thunder Emperor's eyes flickered slightly. However, entering the Thunder World at this moment was an extremely dangerous thing. It was too dangerous, because there were a total of seven rank seven venerable sovereigns in the vicinity!He looked at the fire Phoenix sovereign and said,""I can hand over the Thunder World. In fact ... When you and I fight, a Grade 7 like you can enter the Thunder World and control it!"The fire Phoenix Thearch's eyes flickered."This ... This guy is crazy. Isn't he afraid that I'm no match for him and someone will attack him from the inside?"Of course, it was not to that extent.In that case, the damage to the Thunder World would be too great. Moreover, the agreement they had signed also stated that other venerable sovereigns were not allowed to interfere in their battle.The fire Phoenix Sector Lord laughed,"Thunder Emperor is indeed a reasonable person!" Of course, we're not in a hurry ... We also believe that Thunderlord will keep his promise ..."That's what you say, but if ... You really say that, then we won't be polite anymore. We'll take control of the world first. By then, it'll be too late for you to regret!There was such a good thing?"Thunderlord, do you have any requests?"Allowing a tier 7 to enter and take control of the world ahead of time could be said to be a complete compromise.There must be a requirement!"I want you to prepare a world in advance," the Thunder monarch said gloomily."Let my people leave in advance ... Take the world to the three regions ..."The flame Phoenix Sector Lord frowned."This is a minor matter. It's just that ... It'll take some time!" Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  At this moment, she would not allow Thunderlord to delay any time!If it wasn't a waste of time, she didn't care if you left or not. Why would she care about the ten billion humans?The 20 weak venerable sovereigns?She really didn't care if these people lived or died.The lightning Emperor was underestimating him too much. Did he think that he would endure an eighth-grade lightning tribulation for trash like them?The Thunder monarch pondered for a while, sighed, and nodded.""Then forget it. However, I still have a request. If it's a critical moment, I ..." He said."I admit defeat, you can't kill me!" He transmitted his voice.“……”The flame Phoenix Sector Lord laughed. His laughter was filled with deep meaning.He was actually ... Afraid of death!This was too unexpected. The Thunder Emperor, who had spoken so arrogantly before and wanted to fight to the death with him, was now afraid of death!Hahaha!It was good that he was afraid of death. The Thunder Emperor who wasn't afraid of death was actually a tough opponent to deal with. If he was determined to fight to the death, even the fire Phoenix World Overlord would be wary of him. But now, the Thunder Emperor was surprisingly ... Afraid of death!The heavens are helping me!As for the other party's voice transmission, she naturally understood what he meant. It would be too embarrassing to say it out loud.She was willing to give this little bit of face to the Thunder Emperor. Otherwise, it would be very troublesome if the other party flew into a rage out of humiliation and really fought to the death."Alright!"The flame Phoenix World Overlord was also very straightforward. If you are willing to surrender, that would be for the best!With such a statement, there was such hope.She smiled. At this moment, she had completely forgotten about Li Hao and the others. After this incident, she would naturally be able to account for the deaths of the two 7th rank experts. However, the Thunder World had now completely fallen into her hands!The Thunder monarch also sighed.The reason he raised this condition ... Was because he saw a glimmer of hope ... Li Hao's group seemed to have entered my Thunder World.As for whether it was hope or not ... He would wait and see.It was better than having no hope at all.In this way, they could also lower the other party's guard. If a seventh-rank really entered the Thunder World and took over it in advance, Li Hao's group might be able to kill long Xuan, and perhaps ... Ambush a seventh-rank!If he killed one, he could hold the Phoenix back. These people might have the confidence to quickly kill the other rank 7 ... Although the final result might not be good. After all, there were still a few sector Lords nearby.However, there was still hope!……At this moment, Li Hao landed in a Palace. In front of him, the stars that he had left behind were shining.There was still a Thunder World venerable Emperor present, but he was instantly frozen by Li Hao.Li Hao looked around and shook his head.""The environment is really harsh, and the power of destruction is very strong. To live in such a world, those who know about it would think that it's a rank seven world, but those who don't would think that it's a prison!"The humans here suffered from the attacks of lightning every day. It was quite uncomfortable.At this moment, he looked outside and smiled. The lightning Lord was quite interesting. He probably really sensed it and actually suggested that he could let Grade 7 cultivators enter early.Would the fire Phoenix send a seventh-rank?If they did come ... That would be interesting!If he could kill a seventh level venerable sovereign in advance, it would be easier to handle. Even if there were four seventh level venerable sovereigns nearby, so what?"Brother Kong Ji, let's go to the World origin and repair it ... If it really doesn't work, let's take the Thunder World and escape!""Can we get close?" Kong Ji was confused."He's about to lose his world. Don't worry, even if we take it away, it's better than leaving it to the enemy ..."The truth was just as Li Hao had expected.The group of people entered the void and disappeared.Following the aura, he soon found the source of a broken world.

Chapter 3281 They've All Gone Crazy (1)
There were some signs of death.It was as if he was dying.Nearby, some of the world Energy dispersed when Li Hao's group approached. Clearly, the Thunderbolt master sensed their approach and did not stop them.At this point ... If these guys really wanted to destroy the entire origin of the world, he couldn't be bothered anymore. After all, the agreement he signed with the fire Phoenix did not say that no one was allowed to destroy it, so it had nothing to do with him!……As for Li Hao, after observing for a while, he looked at Kong Ji.Kong Ji also observed for a while and nodded. He laughed and said, "It's simple. The other party probably doesn't want to be too heavy-handed and cause the world to be completely destroyed. It's only slightly damaged and can be easily repaired!""That's good. Brother void, repair it first ... However, don't repair the last bit. Maintain the half-Nirvana state!"Li Hao's smile grew even more brilliant. He would kill his opponent, leave the realm, kill another level 7, and break through the fire Phoenix realm! At that time...We don't have to run today. Perhaps we can fight and kill the few nearby Jie!"If they could kill one of the seven seventh rank venerable sovereigns before the other, firephoenix and Thunderbolt master would be entangled. As for the other four venerable sovereigns, he, Dao Master Kong Ji, and Silvermoon ... They would only be short of one in a real fight!What was there to be afraid of?At this point, even if I'm short of a seventh rank venerable sovereign, I can still shake people!Shake who?Dao chess!Whether tianfang universe recovered or not, that person could enter and leave, but he was usually unwilling to come out. When he came out, an eighth-tier universe would appear. But now, why should he care?If they could succeed today, the debt of daoqi, the debt of emptiness, the debt of neo martial ...I can pay off all my debts in one breath!He owed Dao Qi a seventh-tier universe, owed human King a universe, and Kong Ji needed a universe ...'When that time comes, I'll have been in the chaos for three years. I'll owe tianfang, huojin, and shuijin a favor each. I won't owe anyone else. Er Mao might be able to devour the world's origin and descend to the main world to become a rank seven venerable sovereign!'Thinking of this, Li Hao's heart was beating ... Maybe I really have to do this to succeed!Otherwise, when the Dragon Lord comes out, I won't have a chance!"Destroy the Four Realms again!"The destruction of the Four Realms had helped venerable the sword, Lizhu, and Wushan. If he succeeded this time, the Dao chess could recover its power as a ninth-grade sovereign weapon, and the void could be upgraded. One of them would be given to the human King, and the other one could be devoured by him and silver Moon.The more he thought about it, the more excited he became.Or, he could leave a realm behind and temporarily place the human race there. In a rank 7 world, second cat's advancement might be able to spur it on.Li Hao's greed suddenly rose.The path of desire?No, this time, it wasn't the interference of the Dao of desire, but ... To gain a firm foothold in this chaos.He looked into the distance at Tian Fang.This time, the human King and the others definitely had some targets. If they were really the ones who had opened Tian Fang ... Then, this time, they must have also made a move in the three regions. Li Hao was a little excited ... You might be attacking a level 8 world, but I won't fall behind too much.Let's see who earns more! "Senior daoqi!"At this moment, he used the mark of the Dao chess that he had not used for a long time.……At this moment, tianfang universe was in chaos.Countless venerable sovereigns were chasing after the man and the cat. In the dark, Dao Qi was trembling carefully."I haven't recovered to my peak. I'm only at the seventh rank. The weakest among these venerable sovereigns is at the seventh rank."Don't see me, if you really encounter me ... I can only escape. Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  However, it might not be safe to escape.This human King was really good at causing trouble.Just as he was thinking, a special fluctuation suddenly spread over.Eh?Li Hao?"Li Hao ..."At this moment, the Dao universe was still closed, but the Dao chess was still receiving information. It could be seen that he had a close connection with this universe. "I need senior's help! I won't say too much, it'll be a waste of senior's energy ... Wait for me to wave the seal again, and senior will teleport over to help me resist a level Seven venerable sovereign! When it's done, senior can recover to his peak strength ... We don't have to worry about any great world obstructing us. As long as it's done ... This time, no one can stop us!"What a big tone!Dao Qi didn't even have time to respond, and then ... The fluctuation disappeared.The chess board instantly shook. What was it again?These people, are they all so insistent?He then sneaked a glance at the human king and emperor Cang who were frantically fleeing in the distance ... This place is too dangerous. Forget it, if you really need my help, I'll ... Just leave. It's too scary to stay here.This human king and emperor Cang were also extremely crazy as they tried to stop those people from breaking out of the world together.What were these two guys trying to do?And where did Li Hao and the others go?Dragon field?The Dragon field was very dangerous. Did they stand a good chance there?Breaking through a level 7 world?It did not seem too bad, but compared to the human King and the others, it was still lacking. It was not big enough. Look at him, he was fighting with dozens of seventh and eighth level venerable sovereigns!At this moment, Dao Qi's imagination ran wild. On the one hand, he admired the madness and boldness of the human King and the others, but on the other hand, he thought that perhaps it was time to go out and take refuge.Well, then I'll take refuge outside!On Li Hao's side, they were in a level 7 world. If they joined forces with Li Hao and Kong Ji, they wouldn't be in any danger.If there was only one rank seven venerable sovereign, he could resist it by himself. If there were two ... It would be a little troublesome. It would be quite difficult for the two of them to fight one rank seven venerable sovereign.

Chapter 3282 You And I Fight For It (1)
On the side of the Thunder World, the two rank seven masters both had great Dao universes.The two sides signed a great Dao agreement. With the eighth-level Thunder tribulation as a punishment, the two seventh-level great path universes quickly floated and began to fight. They attacked with all their might. Fire and Thunder elemental powers instantly exploded in all directions!The venerable sovereigns were all shocked.This was the true Lord of the seventh step!On the side of the fire Phoenix World, the tier 7 dragon race and Phoenix race members observed for a moment. They were not in a hurry to enter the Thunder World. If they wanted to enter the Thunder World, they would have to wait. At the very least, they had to wait for the Thunderbolt master to be completely entangled.Otherwise, if the other party were to suddenly return and trap them in the Thunder World, it would be a great loss if he were to kill one of them even before he died.However, as long as the other party was completely entangled with the fire Phoenix Sector Lord, he still had to go. If he didn't go, what would he do if the Thunder World was shattered by that fellow?The two Grade 7 experts were waiting.In the surroundings, the experts of the giant elephant realm, the mighty tiger realm, and the treasure realm were all watching from a distance. They continued to surround the Thunderbolt master in all directions to prevent him from escaping. It didn't matter if this guy escaped, but if he did, he had to hand over the great path universe!This time, the Thunderbolt master has no other choice!……At the same time.Outside the cloud realm.The group of people finally arrived after traveling through mountains and rivers. They were the new martial Supreme, Sword Master, Li Zhu, sun god, blood Emperor, and King of earth, who were at the peak of the sixth rank. They had yet to enter the seventh rank.They were just a little bit away. The main reason was that they had to consume too many resources to improve.The scorching sun realm wasn't enough for them to advance.There were four rank Sevens and many peak rank sixes. It could even be seen as a battle between a rank seven and a rank six.The venerable sovereigns were floating outside the clouds.At this moment, someone appeared in front of them. It was Wu Shan, a person who had left earlier. At this moment, Wu Shan looked at the crowd with a solemn expression. After a long while, he said, "I'm here to ask for a favor! Be it the world or venerable sovereigns ... You can kill anyone you want. The hundreds of billions of humans in Yunxiao are innocent ... Silver Moon King Li Hao didn't kill any humans when he conquered the Crimson Moon, so ... I'm here to ask for a favor!"When those experts were trapped in tianfang, he knew that Yunxiao was in danger.That fellow, venerable sovereign Yunxiao, had been tricked.Of course, he couldn't be bothered.However, he still came to Yunxiao. At this moment, he looked at the venerable sovereigns and said in a deep voice,""I know the clouds very well. I can sneak into the clouds ... Although the experts are very powerful, they have the advantage of being native. With two stage seven experts and hundreds of cloud heaven thearchs working together ... If we want to break through in an instant, we will have to pay a price and some energy without any preparation ..."The Grandmaster revealed a smile, somewhat surprised.Wu Shan had actually appeared here! Glancing at Wu Shan, the Grandmaster chuckled."Of course we won't slaughter humans, but when experts fight, it's inevitable that there will be some collateral damage. We don't claim to be kind; if there's any collateral damage, we'll just kill them ... However, since fellow Daoist Wushan has appeared, we'll naturally give him face!"The peak of the seventh step, Wu Shan.His strength was still very strong. Of course, they were not afraid of Supremes. Even if this person joined forces with the remaining two Grade 7 experts of Yun Xiao, they would not be afraid. Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ However, both parties had worked together before. What the other party wanted was the safety of the mortals.This was simple."If fellow Daoist is willing to help, that would be the best ..."At this point, the Grandmaster suddenly felt a little amused and chuckled,"Fellow Daoist Wushan originated from the clouds. Why don't we ... Take down the clouds today and gift it to you?""What?"Monarch Wushan was stunned.The Grandmaster, however, had a relaxed expression,'Yunxiao, after breaking through, I'll give it to fellow Daoist! It doesn't matter if fellow Daoist wants to keep it or devour it to advance to the eighth step! Since we are of the same origin, grade-8 ... Is an easy task!"Even monarch Wushan was stunned.He only came to save the human clan of cloud sky, but ... He suspected that he was hallucinating. In order to take down cloud sky, new martial had paid a huge price. Human king and emperor Cang were in danger.In order to break through a level 8 world, in the end ... You're giving it to me?Is this a joke?"Fellow Daoist ... Don't you want it?" the Grandmaster asked with a smile.None of the venerable sovereigns in the surroundings said a word. They simply looked at the Paragon. Since the Paragon had said so ... He definitely had his own thoughts.As expected, the Supreme martial artist continued,"fellow Daoist, once you enter the eighth stage ... You only need to help us with a small matter. Break through the Scarlet Sun City!" There are still 4 type 7 powerhouses in chiyang, and not only that, there might also be one or two Type 7 powerhouses, or even type 8 powerhouses ... Chiyang is our biggest target, Yunxiao is just an extra!""If you can reach level eight, with the help of a level eight venerable sovereign, Chi Yang ... Will definitely be broken!"What was cloudsky?If they took down Yun Xiao, they would probably only be able to produce two or three rank seven experts, such as the blood Emperor and the king of earth. The others would not be able to do it as they lacked Yang Qi. By then, would the six rank seven experts be able to defeat Chi Yang?Not necessarily!Chi Yang now had four local seventh level venerable sovereigns, and there might be other outer domain venerable sovereigns, and even ... The Supreme venerable suspected that there was an eighth level venerable sovereign!The Supreme martial artist was very confident in neo martial arts and that they could break through.However, he might have to pay a huge price!However, if he gave Yun Xiao to Wu Shan, who had cooperated with the sword Master before and had a good character, it would be completely different if he entered the eighth rank and had one more eighth-rank to help him in battle. It would be easy for an eighth-rank to deal with two or three seventh-rank experts.

Chapter 3283 You And I Fight (3)
As for the blood Emperor and the king of earth, even if they didn't advance, it wouldn't be a big deal. After taking down Chi Yang, they would be full of yang energy. By then, it wouldn't just be two rank seven experts.Wu Shan was a little dazed.Whether it was Li Hao, the human King, or the Supreme neo martial artist ...These people were people he had met for the first time, and he was extremely shocked and unforgettable.This was his first time meeting a new martial Supreme. He didn't say anything, and you came to plead for him. Fine, I'll agree. Not only that, I can even give up Yunxiao and give it to you!A level 8 world, how heroic!He couldn't help but think of Li Hao. That young man seemed to have done the same. He had conquered the four worlds, and with a wave of his hand, he and you were alone ... As for himself, it didn't matter whether he wanted him or not.These people were all so proud as if level 8 universes were not worth mentioning!For a moment, Wu Shan was in a daze.The Grandmaster's voice rang out again,"fellow Daoist Wushan, do you have any misgivings or what?" If fellow Daoist feels that it's not good to hear about this ... We ... Can cut the weeds and eliminate the roots!"The Grandmaster said it in a relaxed and light tone.Wu Shan, however, was slightly shocked.This 'cut the weeds and eliminate the roots' was not ordinary. This was ... To destroy the cloud world?He took a deep breath and said,'the Supreme neo martial is indeed worthy of his reputation! I, Wushan, can be considered lucky and fated to be able to meet all of you! I won't say anything pretentious, but if you really give it to me, I want it! Not only that, I also want to protect the lives of some people. Don't worry, they're all my people ... It's just that I'm not the master of the great Dao, so I can only lie dormant in the clouds!" Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ "If I can reach level 8 ... I, Wu Shan, will definitely be the vanguard in the attack on chiyang!"He was no longer polite or pretentious.He even took the initiative to say,'I only need a six-realm world to accommodate the human race. I'll devour the great Dao universe and definitely reach level eight! Rank 8 world force ..."He looked at the blood Emperor and the king of earth,""I think these two Daoist friends are only one step away from advancing. Similar to the situation with the sword Master, the level eight world power can help one to advance to Level Seven!""The world, just directly devour it!"The Autarch laughed. He was a bit surprised by this. This Wu Shan was quite interesting.This time, Wushan really didn't hold back. Since you've said it, I won't be pretentious. Eighth-grade ... Yunxiao, that guy, insisted on going against neo martial arts. Now, the world will be destroyed!Since that's the case, I'm still a cloudsky cloudsman. If I become a tier 8, I can at least save some people.He had nothing to feel guilty about. He was someone who was abandoned by Yunxiao.The venerable sovereigns behind the Supreme-being all felt strange.Sword Saint and Lizhu were familiar with Wushan. Sword Saint laughed and said,""Brother Wushan is an amazing person. If brother Wushan enters the eighth step, with Wushan's help, it will be much easier to break through the Scarlet sun! "Otherwise, chiyang has at least four, at most six or seven seventh or eighth rank venerable sovereigns. Even if we're confident in taking them down, we'll definitely suffer losses ... Cang Mao and Fang ping aren't here, and we can't use our world force. If the losses are too great, it'll be hard to explain!"By speaking out, he could be considered to be a middleman, so that both sides would have less scruples. Wu Shan took a deep breath."Then I'll inform some of my men first. It's not easy to break into a rank eight world from the outside. With the lesson from the Crimson Moon, even if there are only two rank seven guards, they'll definitely have some arrangements ...""I'll try to merge into the cloud universe again. If I can, those two ... I understand them. They won't be able to hold on for long!"The Grandmaster laughed and nodded.This was the easiest and most direct method.Wushan ... Interesting.The targets that Silver Moon King Li Hao chose to work with were usually quite unique. Kong Ji, Wu Shan, and Sen LAN were all interesting people. This man was young, but he had a good eye.If at this moment, Wushan wanted to live or die, and wanted to live and die with Yunxiao ... Then ... Let them die together!At this point, Fang ping and the old cat still didn't know how much trouble they had to go through. They had paid a huge price. It was impossible for him to give up on attacking cloud sky for someone he had cooperated with.That would only cause both sides to turn against each other!At this moment, a voice rang in his ear,""Old Zhang, be careful. If this guy fuses with the clouds and guards the clouds with the power of a peak tier 7, then we'll be in even more trouble ... We must always be on guard!"Venerable the sword was relatively straightforward, but some people were still worried. However, the Supreme martial artist chuckled and said,""It's fine. Even if I'm wrong, he didn't say anything when we were in Lizhu for a while. This guy is narrow-minded. If he thought I was unreliable, he would have said something a long time ago ..."The person who sent the message nodded slightly.That's right!Wu Shan also disappeared in an instant.……After a while.,m There seemed to be some fluctuations within the clouds, and the auras of the two seventh rank venerable sovereigns seemed to be on the verge of exploding.After a while, suddenly, a loud shout resounded through the sky,""It's you? Wushan ... You dare ..."Wu Shan's furious voice rang out in all directions. "I'm back! Yunxiao has no virtue or talent, and now he's trapped and can't get out. The cloud world is going to collapse at this moment. I'm here to save everyone ...""Nonsense! Wushan, you ..."BOOM!As the sound rang out, battle erupted. It wasn't just one place, but many. Clearly, there were people from the mist Mountain who had also launched attacks.In the outside world.The Grandmaster glanced at it and laughed.It was difficult to break into a major world like this from the outside. It was heavily guarded, but if there was internal turmoil ... It would be easy to break in again.

Chapter 3284 You And I Fight (3)
"Let's go!"The Paragon chuckled, and in the blink of an eye, the entire group teleported into the world gate. Surprisingly, there was no one left standing guard near the world gate. The two tier 7 experts had been there the entire time, but as soon as Wu Shan entered, they were both shocked and terrified, and quickly went to deal with him.All of a sudden, it was empty!A rank eight great world had a very strong defense ... But once the realm gate was broken, enemies would invade. It would be difficult to resist unless they were world Lords, not to mention that there were only two rank Sevens.The two seventh rank venerable sovereigns who were still fighting with Wu Shan didn't have time to react before they threw a punch.Sun god, who was wearing a pair of big underpants, didn't say anything.The powerful force directly shattered the entire space!The sun god's seemingly casual punch had instantly shattered a rank seven. In terms of attack power, it was perhaps comparable to the explosive power of Li Hao's dragon-slaying sword.The man and the king did not merge their yin and yang, but that seemed to be the only reason.The sun god's punch shattered a rank seven. On the other side, the Supreme martial artist casually summoned a book. The book of great Dao instantly enveloped the other party and easily suppressed the other rank seven!At this moment, the universe of the great path seemed to fluctuate, and an angry roar resounded through the world.""Bastards, how dare you invade my cloud sky ...""You're too noisy!""The sword venerable killed his way to the great path universe. You can't even get out. What are you talking about?"It only took an instant!BOOM!The universe of the great path cracked, and the sound disappeared.The two grade seven experts were unable to resist at all and were taken down almost instantly. The Supreme martial artist laughed,""Don't kill them. Strip them of their DAOs and hand them over to brother Wushan! It's not just these two. All the other experts in the clouds are doing the same. Strip away the great Dao and give it to fellow Daoist Wushan!"On the other side, Wu Shan was also shocked.These people were so strong.It didn't matter if one was strong, but human Kings were very strong, killing tier 7 experts in seconds!However, these people were all extremely powerful. Each one of them could surpass the other tier 7 cultivators. This was really unusual. His heart throbbed. Fortunately, he had not acted rashly.With these people working together, even a grade 8 world might be broken through."Brother Wushan, quickly absorb the power of the great DAOs and devour the great Dao universe. Otherwise, Yun Xiao will cut off his tail to survive and deprive too much of the power of the great DAOs ..."Although the other party couldn't come out of Tian Fang, he could still contact the great Dao universe. Last time, if Li Hao hadn't destroyed Red Moon sovereign's Dao source, he would have been able to extract more power of his great Dao.Wushan didn't say anything. It was difficult for ordinary people to enter the great path universe, but he was Yunxiao's second-in-command, so he could naturally enter. If Yunxiao was outside, it would be difficult, but now, Yunxiao was trapped, so it wasn't difficult! He didn't say much. He quickly began to absorb the power of the entire great Dao universe. He didn't want to keep it and directly devoured it!According to what Li Hao had said back then, everyone was the master of their own worlds. Why would they want someone else's universe?If he could swallow it, he would just swallow it directly to avoid any more trouble!Wu Shan was still somewhat affected by this. Otherwise, it would be better to leave the eighth-level universe behind and become a Dao master. However, seeing that the eighth-level venerable sovereigns were often dragged down by the great Dao universe and world ... Wu Shan finally decided to devour it first!It was not easy for him, who was at the peak of the seventh rank, to enter the eighth rank. However, Yunxiao was from a world of the same origin, and he was the number two person here.At this moment, it was devouring at an extremely fast speed.In the depths of the great path universe, a huge star was fluctuating. Obviously, Supreme Emperor cloud heaven had sensed all this and was furious!Bastard!Wushan!It was the fog Mountain that was swallowing the great Dao universe.When something happened to the Crimson Moon last time, he was already very cautious. He didn't expect to fall into the trap and be trapped in tianfang. It was exactly the same as what happened to the Crimson Moon last time!……Within tianfang universe.BOOM!Eighth-grade power burst out crazily. Venerable sovereign cloud heaven roared and cut off his connection with the great path universe with a boom. He absorbed countless great path power and barely kept his eighth-grade power!At this moment, his face was extremely gloomy.Damn it!Beside him, Red Moon sovereign sighed and looked sympathetic ... In fact, he was gloating and almost laughed out loud.To think that you would have such a day?Yunxiao's great Dao universe had actually been seized by someone!Before this, he had become a laughingstock among the tier 8 Masters. Now, cloudsky was in the same situation. However, looking at the human king who was still frantically escaping, Red Moon Lord could no longer smile. He looked at Dragon Master who was not far away and frowned slightly."It seems that neo martial's goal is to deal with our world. I originally thought it was to deal with Chi Yang, but in the end ... The other party actually turned their attention to Yunxiao."At that moment, venerable sovereign Yunxiao's aura began to decline. He was in a worse state than Hong Yue and had almost fallen from his realm.His face was a little pale and ashen.He also thought that even if neo martial wanted to plan, they should plan against chiyang. In the end ... They actually went to Yunxiao. Damn it! Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ Bastard!He had lost his Dao universe. If he hadn't cut off his tail to survive, his Dao stars would have been devoured by that bastard Wu Shan if he had delayed any longer!In the distance, the master of crimson sun looked over with an indifferent expression.Are you targeting my Chi Yang?That was wishful thinking!Since you guys didn't help me fight the new martial artists, in order to save yourself, he introduced a large number of powerhouses in the outer area. There were two seventh-rank and one eighth-rank who followed him in!

Outside, there was also a level eight overseer, who was worried that there would be problems. That level eight from the outer region and this level eight from the outer region were both level eight from the same world, and they were also rare double level eight universes!In addition to the four local tier 7 Masters, if the neo martial artists wanted to break through chiyang ... They would be courting death.Therefore, he was not that worried.However, at this moment, the cloud master's expression was dark as he said,""Wu Shan is currently devouring our cloud cosmos. He might be able to enter level eight ..."Everyone was stunned by his words. Even the master of crimson sun frowned slightly."How could it be Wushan? Isn't it neo martial arts?""There are new martial artists involved ... I can sense the sword intent of the sword venerable!"The master of crimson sun frowned as well. He looked at the human king who was still lingering nearby and said in a low voice,""I have to go out, immediately! Let's work together to destroy the great Dao universe and get out quickly ..."Done talking, he looked at the Dragon Lord."Dragon Lord, you control a tier 8 world. You're also the only tier 8 that brought a world into it. Even you have no way of completely breaking through Tian Fang?"The Dragon Lord exhaled, his eyes a little gloomy.""Difficult! Also ... A seventh rank venerable sovereign from our realm has died. Longxuan was killed, and we don't know the details yet. I also want to get out earlier ..."Even though he said that, he still did not go all out.  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  There was no other reason ... Cloudsky's and red moon's worlds had been broken through. At this moment, the Dragon Master actually still had some thoughts and was waiting for Chi Yang to be broken through!Chi Yang was also a great threat.Without their worlds and great Dao universes, these eighth-level venerable sovereigns of the human race were not as powerful as chaos beasts.The human race was having a crazy internal friction.Although a portion of the new martial artists had given birth to powerhouses, these people might only give birth to one rank-7 after killing several rank-7s. In general, the number of rank-7s in the human race was decreasing rapidly!Long Xuan was dead. In fact, he wanted to go out ... But when cloudy heavens was broken and red sun was in danger, the Dragon Lord hoped to delay it for a while.He looked at the human King in the distance, and his expression changed.Raising a Tiger would bring disaster!He knew that neo martial was a big trouble, but ... Neo martial was also constantly eliminating the Masters of Sifang region. Neo martial was a terrifying blade, but ... He might not be afraid!The Dragon field was extremely powerful.In the 12 great worlds, there were a lot of Level Seven venerable sovereigns, with only a few level eight ones. However, if all these level eight cultivators became independent cultivators ... Even if there was still a gap between the level Seven Beasts of Chaos, it would not be as big as before.In the distance.The human King didn't escape far away. He still had to guard against these people joining forces to break out of the realm.At this moment, the human King was covered in blood, but he was laughing. The Dragon Master, Chi Yang, Yun Xiao, Hong Yue, and an outer region level eight were all very difficult to deal with, but they were all afraid that he would fight them to the death.As for the light Supreme Emperor, he had yet to interfere. However, his existence still created some pressure for these people. Who asked them to besiege him before? Although the human ruler, Emperor Cang and the light Emperor were no match for these people, they didn't have much of a chance to break through the realm if they joined forces.The human King could even see through the Dragon Lord's thoughts.This old dragon was not a good person. To be honest, the power that an eighth-tier great being with an eighth-tier universe could exert ... Was not even stronger than him and the gray cat. It was obviously unreasonable. This old dragon was not honest!Looking at cloudsky's appearance, the plan to kill cloudsky had succeeded.However ... Chi Yang might still be in some trouble.He then looked at the few foreign venerable sovereigns ... They didn't seem to be affected. It seemed that old Zhang hadn't found their nest. It was a pity. Otherwise, the foreign eighth-level venerable sovereign's nest would definitely be an eighth-level universe!He had many thoughts in his mind. Looking at how they were chatting, perhaps ... These guys still wanted to kill him before leaving.He couldn't hold on any longer.It had been so many days, and old Zhang had only managed to break through cloudsky. His efficiency was too low.He didn't know how he had been doing this, he was really slow!Not far away, the radiance Supreme Emperor was also following them silently. He didn't make a move, but he just followed them and didn't say a word. Sometimes, he would look at cloudsky and the others gloomily, which made them very uncomfortable.At this moment, the great Dao in the clouds suddenly trembled and the light Thearch suddenly laughed. His laugh was a little cold.Yunxiao and Hongyue were really Blood Brothers!It seems that I'm the only level-eight universe left in the tianfang region!However ... The next moment, he looked at human King. Cloud and light were not far away. Although light had four level Seven experts, if the other party attacked him, he would have to join forces with them to deal with him!The human King was also looking at him. Suddenly, he laughed and said in a clear voice,""Brother Guangming, congratulations. From now on, you'll be the most powerful in the tianfang region! If you and I join hands, we can go anywhere in the world!"“……”Light Thearch didn't say anything.This human King wasn't a good person. In this tianfang cosmos, he had been extremely polite to him recently. If one didn't know better, they would think that they were brothers.Everyone knew what the human King was thinking.However, it was effective. In addition, Guangming was unwilling to sign the great Dao agreement before, which made these venerable sovereigns worried. They even attacked Guangming. Now, they were even more worried that Guangming would attack at any time.At this moment, the level 8 from the outer region spoke, which was a rare sight."Fellow Daoist from the Dragon race ... You have control of an eighth-rank world and are very powerful. You also have three seventh-rank venerable sovereigns assisting you. Logically speaking, your strength shouldn't be at this level. Now that the cloud world has been taken away, Chi Yang is in danger ... Fellow Daoist, are you still going to sit back and watch?"

Chapter 3286 You And I Fight For It (3)
Dragon Master frowned slightly."My world is only here. The great Dao universe is isolated outside!""Your race of chaos doesn't have a great Dao universe. It won't have much of an impact!"The rank eight venerable sovereign from the outer region said softly,""In the outer region, there are also type 8 experts from the chaos race who are extremely powerful. Could it be that the power of a Dragon Lord is inferior to those existences?"The Dragon Lord glanced at him. He could not tell how strong this person was, but he knew that he was not weak.He didn't say anything before, but now he was anxious.It was obvious that Chi Yang's men were guarding the place.The Dragon Master's eyes flickered."The human king and emperor Cang also control the neo martial world. They're more difficult to deal with ... If fellow Daoist can join forces with brother chiyang to suppress them, it's not impossible for us to break through the realm!"The rank eight outer region cultivator was silent for a while. He looked at venerable sovereign Chi Yang. Originally, he was too lazy to interfere, but at this moment, his brother was watching over Chi Yang.Although it was very safe for a level 8 to hold the fort ... But what if?"Alright!" He nodded after some consideration.Previously, no one was willing to contribute, but after seeing Yunxiao's miserable state, he decided to make a move and quickly suppress the two new martial artists. Even if he couldn't kill them, he had to break through the boundary first.At this moment, the Dragon Lord glanced at the crowd and did not say anything more.However, he quickly sent a message to the dragon world expert in his stomach. There were still four stage seven experts in the dragon world who had been lying in wait."Just delay for a few more days ... When the red sun City is broken through, we will go out! At that time, I will join hands with the others to open the realm ... You all ... Will attack Chi Yang! If neo martial defeated red sun, we can't let neo martial take the lead and kill venerable sovereign red sun! "We can't fall into the hands of neo martial again. The four of you will deal with Chi Yang. I'll kill Yun Xiao. The other three ... Deal with Hong Yue!"At that moment, the four seventh rank venerable sovereigns in the dragon world were shocked!The next moment, they were all overjoyed!The Dragon Lord was about to explode.Yes, at this moment, the Dragon Lord had already made a decision. Neo martial kill or me kill ... Wasn't it all to eliminate these original overlords?Originally, apart from the Dragon field, the four level eight worlds of the four-direction region were all in danger."In that case ... You new martial artists are outside and have taken over each other's world. I'll kill their original bodies here, the original bodies of level eight venerable sovereigns. If I kill them, it'll be a huge gain.Get rid of these level 8 experts! Even if the new martial arts really rose, at least there would no longer be so many messy forces in the four-sided region. It was time to reshuffle!And the time was the day the Crimson sun realm was broken!At that time, Supreme Emperor Chi Yang would be in an extremely weakened state. This reshuffling would definitely cause a huge change in the four-sided domain.The Dragon Master's mind was filled with thoughts. Neo martial ... Had helped him a lot.Not bad!Otherwise, it would be very difficult to take down a few level-eight universes. ……On this day, every Overlord in the four-sided domain had their own thoughts and plans.And at this moment, outside the Thunder World, the Thunder Lord was in a state of frenzy for the sake of his own fate and the fate of the Thunder World. He was going all out to kill realmlord Zhan Feng.He had been locked up for too many years, and his strength was far from what it was before.However, at this moment, he had absorbed some of the great Dao crystals and was determined to fight to the death. Thunderbolts exploded in the sky. For a time, even though the flame Phoenix World Overlord was at his peak, it was still difficult for him to take down the flame Phoenix World Overlord. In fact, he was struck by Thunderbolts many times.At this moment, the flame Phoenix Sector Lord had even returned to his original form and was currently engaged in battle!This scene made the two Grade 7 experts speechless.This Thunderbolt master still had such strength even at this stage.It was unbelievable!The other party had been locked up for many years and had been in a period of shortage. He had even sold many of his own Dao accumulation crystals, which still had an impact on him. If he had not been locked up, wouldn't this person have a chance to reach level eight?At this moment, the tier 7 Dragon sent a voice transmission,""It's already at the point of a fierce battle ... Life and death may be decided at any time. The Thunderbolt master may not break his promise, but once he does ... We can't afford to gamble!"The Thunder World was too important!He had to get it completely!The old man glanced at the other seventh stage fiery phoenix beside him and transmitted his voice again,""Do you want to go, or should I go ..."  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  Let's take down the Thunder World first!"I'll go!"The seventh level venerable sovereign from the fire Phoenix realm also transmitted a message,""Thunder and fire intertwine. Our world's bed universe also covers the Thunder World. If I go, I won't be suppressed too much. If the elders go, they might be suppressed by the Thunder world's bed universe ..."The Dragon elder nodded. This was what he wanted to say as well.Now that the Dragon Lord wasn't here and the boundary was isolated, he couldn't use too much power of the great Dao universe. If he entered the Thunder World, he might be suppressed by the Thunder World.It would be better for elder Fire Phoenix to go.Of course, he couldn't say it out loud. After all, they were of the same rank, and this was the fire Phoenix's territory. It would be best if the other party could say it out himself."Then, be careful ... I will keep an eye on the Thunderbolt master. If he doesn't keep his promise and kills his way back, I will stop him together with the fire Phoenix realm master ...""En!"Elder firephoenix did not say anything more. His safety was still guaranteed. If the lightning Lord were to return, he would have to endure the eighth-grade lightning tribulation. There were still two seventh-grade cultivators keeping an eye on him outside, and there were many more seventh-grade cultivators around him.They were only being cautious, so they only gave a few reminders. In fact, at this point, the Thunderbolt master was powerless to turn the situation around!Even though it seemed like he was evenly matched with the fire Phoenix su, the power of the great Dao in the fire Phoenix great Dao universe was almost materializing. The lightning master's great Dao universe was almost an empty shell!

Chapter 3287 You And I Fight For It (1)_6
If this continued, the Thunderbolt master would definitely be defeated!……"They're here!"Near the source of the world.Li Hao suddenly laughed.Waiting here was the right choice.He had already sensed that a seventh rank venerable sovereign was flying over from the outer realm. There were only a few venerable sovereigns left in the Thunder World. Even if they could stop him, they would not be able to do so. However, they were in this world now, and the Thunder master had to save the lives of ten billion people. They could not take a gamble. At this moment, no matter how angry they were, they could only watch as the fire Phoenix entered the Thunder World!This was also the first time a Chaos Beast had entered the Thunder World!As soon as they entered, elder firephoenix laughed. What a strong lightning element. Unfortunately, it was mixed with too much destructive power, making this world a little desolate!A rank seven world, and a peak rank seven world at that. If it had not been besieged for so many years, it might have had a chance of entering a rank eight world.What a pity!The world was showing signs of destruction. At this moment, she only had one goal ... To protect the world's origin. Even if the world was broken, the world's origin was still there. As long as she filled it with a large amount of energy, it would recover sooner or later.This was the key!I wonder if that guy's destruction has hurt the root of the world?With this thought in mind, elder firephoenix followed the aura of life and headed straight for the world origin.Behind her, there was a group of Thunder World venerable sovereigns, but she ignored them.There were about 20 venerable sovereigns, most of whom were low-level venerable sovereigns, and only six or seven of them were middle-level venerable sovereigns.With such power...Even an average mid-tier world would not be weaker than them.The Thunder World was a Grand Peak rank seven great world. It could be considered miserable for it to be in such a state.Even if these people joined forces, they wouldn't be enough for her, a tier 7, to kill!Elder Fire Phoenix smiled and ignored them as he headed straight for the source of the world. Behind him, the venerable sovereigns of the Thunder World could only be angry, but they were unable to fight back. At this moment, all of them were feeling extremely aggrieved!He really wanted to have a great battle with this bird!……"Kong Ji, senior uncle Hong, Qian Wuliang, attack together and kill the enemy!"Li Hao quickly sent a voice transmission,'move quickly. Kill the enemy ... And immediately leave the boundary to kill that dragon expert! "I have an agreement with the fire Phoenix World that I can't attack their tier six or seven. If I do, there will be lightning tribulation ... And this place is near the lightning domain. There are many chaos lightning tribulations, and it might trigger powerful lightning tribulation power! You'd better stay away from me later. After I trigger the lightning tribulation, I'll lure it in again to deal with that venerable sovereign of the Dragon race ..."Everyone listened quietly, a little nervous.One had to know that there were still four rank-7s outside ... Other than these few, there were still four more! Giant elephant, mighty tiger, Tong Bao ... The mighty tiger realm had two seventh-grade Tigers.The distance wasn't far, and there was a high chance that they would capsize.They were all a little nervous. It was rare for Kong Ji to be nervous.Strictly speaking, they didn't have a single person at the seventh step on their side. Even the Thunderbolt master wasn't considered one of them. With such strength, Li Hao was truly crazy to have the audacity to target seven of them!……Elder firephoenix quickly located the source of the world.At this moment, she went straight down to the source of the world. Soon, she saw the source of the world. It was like a heart, but it had stopped beating. She laughed. Fortunately, it didn't seem to be destroyed!The level 7 world origin was right in front of him.The Thunder World has already fallen into my hands.Today, a crucial part of his many years of hegemony could be considered to have been completed. As long as he took down the Thunder World, he could attack or retreat at will. The Lord of the four forces might not be far away ... Of course, it would be the Dragon Lord and not him.Behind him, one of the Thunder world's venerable sovereigns roared,""Get lost! This is the source of my realm, my master hasn't been defeated yet ... What do you want to do?"Elder firephoenix turned around and laughed. His laugh was a little sinister."Human, your mouth is always so dirty! Your master has already said that the outcome of the battle will be handed over to the Thunder World. It wasn't easy for him to obtain a chance for you to live, so you must cherish it!" "I'll be in charge of the world essence for the time being. I'm doing this to save you. Otherwise, if anyone accidentally destroys the world essence and enrages us ... At that time, our previous promise may not be valid ..."At this moment, the few Thunder World venerable sovereigns suddenly opened their mouths wide.His eyes were filled with shock!Elder firephoenix was slightly taken aback. Frightened?In the next moment, as if he had realized the problem, an extremely awe-inspiring sword intent, a fist intent rich in Nirvana power, and two Special Forces, which seemed to be the power of the great Dao of all DAOs, instantly burst out from his back at this moment!In an instant!A sword and a punch landed at the same time!The two rivers of the great Dao were like chains that instantly locked him up.The sword cut through his opponent's body, but it did not cut him in half like it did with long Xuan. This time, Li Hao did not use two swords!However, the empty punch supplemented it. With a boom, the other party, who had not even returned to his original body, was instantly punched through and directly cut in half at the waist!The two rivers of the great Dao were like chains that tightened instantly!  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  With a cracking sound, his body was shattered!Under the Joint Forces of the three parties, the tier 7 elder was instantly crushed into pieces with a look of shock on his face. The fire Phoenix realmlord, who was still fighting with the Thunderbolt master, instantly sensed it.In an instant, he went crazy and his flames soared to the sky.""Bastard! Thunderlord, you're looking for death ..."

Chapter 3288 You And I Fight (3)_7
BOOM!It was called the shaking of the universe. At this moment, the Thunderbolt master seized this opportunity. The seventh-rank was killed. It was called the shaking of the universe. The fire Phoenix was slightly disturbed. He instantly exploded, and lightning covered the area. BOOM!The Thunderbolts continued to fall, and he, who had been suppressed all this time, instantly turned his opponent into a bloody mess!p "What does it have to do with me?" the Thunderbolt master sneered.It's not like I'm the one breaking the contract!Those people came here of their own accord. What does that have to do with me?BOOM!In the distance, the entire Fire Phoenix realm suddenly shook violently. The death of a tier 7 expert caused the entire realm to shake.The venerable sovereign of the dragon clan was also shocked!Damn it!Was there really a trap?How was that possible?It was the Silver Moon King and the others. However, they had been in the Earth Dragon World. Even if they were nearby, let alone being extremely far away, how could they have snuck into the Thunder World without a sound?The Thunder World had always been sealed!If he could sneak in easily, he would have been discovered long ago!Things were bad!No one had expected such a turn of events. Damn it, this is bad.Thoughts flashed through his mind. For a moment, he wasn't sure if he should flee or what else. Fleeing? the flame Phoenix realmlord was in big trouble ...He persisted for an instant!"Enemy attack, come and help!" He quickly roared.In an instant, the four seventh rank venerable sovereigns from the three major worlds burst forth with energy and shot through the void!Something had happened!Silver Moon King, you're really crazy. There are seven venerable sovereigns here, and even if you killed one, there are still six left.You ... On what basis do you dare?……At the same time.In tianfang universe.Dao Qi felt the fluctuation and suddenly looked into the distance. He laughed. I'm leaving!This place was getting more and more dangerous.The tianfang universe, which had always been closed, suddenly opened a small hole. Someone nearby saw this and shouted,""What's that?"As for the path of chess, it turned into a chessboard and instantly entered the crack."It's a chess piece!""It's hiding here!"Nearby, a few seventh level venerable sovereigns rushed over. Some eighth level venerable sovereigns in the distance also looked over quickly. Even the human King was a little surprised. Why was this guy running?He knew that the game was here.But ... Why are you running?It's not necessarily safe outside. If you hide, no one will know you're here and think you've been taken away.Dao Qi, on the other hand, did not say anything and ran away!He instantly left tianfang universe and the crack closed up in the blink of an eye.The Dao chess piece did not say anything. The space fluctuated and he was teleported away. Once he left tianfang world, he instantly turned into a great Dao universe. The entire great Dao universe fluctuated violently and caused a huge commotion!However, there were no experts in the square region today ...In the distance, there was a group of experts, and some of them had also sensed it. The Supreme-beings looked over, and the sword Saint was also a little puzzled,""Dao chess ... Where does it go?"Why did Dao chess come out?What are you doing?The teleportation fluctuation disappeared quickly, but the fluctuation of the eighth-level universe was still turbulent. Sword Master looked into the distance and said,""This ... Is going to the Dragon field? Dao Qi is going to find Li Hao and the others?"It was really strange!You can run anywhere, but the Dragon field. Other than the dragon world, none of the macro worlds in the Dragon field have left. Are you crazy?And it caused such a huge commotion!Do you think those rank-7s are blind?Tianfang, Hongyue, and chiyang were relatively safe now. Only the Dragon field was the most dangerous. Where were you going ... Venerable the sword quickly shouted,""No, it's dangerous there ..."Not only are you in danger, but you're also making too much noise. If Li Hao and the others are hiding, you'll immediately expose them!Had this chess piece been an Artifact Spirit for too long that it had become stupid?The Dao chess piece ignored him. Perhaps it didn't hear him. In an instant, it shuttled through space. The Dao chess piece had the ability to teleport. At this moment, its speed was unbelievably fast. A great path universe directly crossed the Dragon field!Many experts in the Dragon field were so shocked that they quickly looked up.In the transmission channel, the shadow of a chess piece appeared. It looked into the distance with a bright smile. They had joined forces to fight a level Seven. Fortunately ... In the next moment, as it passed through, it suddenly ... Froze.One, two, three, four ...The mysterious man quickly sensed it, and his face turned stiff. 'I shouldn't be stopping here. I'm fast enough that they can't stop me, right?'How many seventh-rank beasts were there?There are seven more here. One seems to have died, and his aura is still leaking out ... In that case, there are eight seventh level venerable sovereigns here?I shouldn't have stopped here ...In an instant, the teleportation stopped.The location was here.The chess piece appeared, and the shadow trembled a little. It looked at Li Hao and the others in front of it in a daze.D * MN it, why did you guys ... Call me here?"I don't have time to say more, senior ... Kill!"“……”While the chess piece was still shaking, it was dragged away by Li Hao and disappeared. In the blink of an eye, it appeared in front of a Dragon. Li Hao struck with his sword and roared,""Kill him! Whether we eat meat or not will depend on today!""Kill!"Kong Ji's eyes were filled with malevolence. The eyes of the two Dao Masters were also red. They seemed to have gone completely mad.He had to kill this Dragon tribe's Tier 7 before the four tier 7 experts arrived!Otherwise, it would be difficult today."Senior, attack!"Li Hao roared. The reaction of Dao chess was so slow!艹!This fellow has been a sovereign weapon for too long, so his reaction is a little slow. Didn't I tell you that we're going to kill together?Dao Qi seemed to have returned to his senses and couldn't help but curse,""So many?"Why didn't you say so earlier!If you had said so earlier, I wouldn't have come.Tianfang universe is a little safer, and no one has discovered me, but here ... The fluctuations in my Dao universe are too intense. Anyone can know where I am!He didn't have time to think about anything else. Kill!If I don 't, I'm finished.He had no other thoughts. In an instant, the chess pieces appeared and suppressed the world. Countless small boxes like a cage instantly enveloped the dragon clan's venerable sovereign.Back then, it was a level nine monarch weapon.Now, although it had weakened a lot, it was still able to burst out with an extremely powerful ability!The Dao chess domain covered the eighth-tier universe!The dragon clan's venerable sovereign had originally thought that he would only be facing the Silver Moon King. Who would have thought that there would be another rank seven? he was immediately shocked!How did this come about?Teleportation?The chaos could teleport?This was the first time he knew about it, but ... It might also be the last time.Li Hao, Kong Ji, two Dao Masters, dozens of venerable sovereigns, and Dao Qi ...Many powerhouses attacked at the same time!Dark clouds also appeared above Li Hao's head. The lightning tribulation was about to descend.The tier 7 Dragon's face turned pale as he instantly returned to his dragon form. It was still possible to deal with one person, but there were so many of them ... All of them were erupting with the power of a tier 7. This ... Since when was it possible for a Tier 6 to kill a tier 7 in the chaos?  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  "Save me!"He let out a shrill cry. The four rank seven venerable sovereigns were also rushing toward him. They were closing in on him, but it was at that moment that a sword fell and a fist struck ...It's too late!The four venerable sovereigns stopped in their tracks.Their gazes were cold and sharp. Damn it, damn it. Two tier 7 Dragons had died in one day. It was fine if the fire Phoenix died, but two tier 7 Dragons had died ... This time, they were in big trouble!BOOM!The sound of an explosion reverberated throughout the world.Li Hao didn't even know the rank 7 Dragon's name. In the blink of an eye, he followed in long Xuan's footsteps and became the second rank 7 Dragon to die. He was also the fourth rank 7 venerable sovereign to be killed in the Dragon field!On the other side, the flame Phoenix realmlord howled in anger: "You're dead. Kill them, quick!"The four venerable sovereigns started to move again and flew toward them!Two ferocious Tigers, a giant elephant, and a rat covered in treasure light-the four experts arrived in an instant with cold eyes. Seeing the Dragon expert being torn into pieces and his Dao marks shattered, they all wanted to kill him!Damn it!These people must die!

Chapter 3289 The Bloody Battle Of The Four Sides
The four Grade 7 experts instantly arrived.However, that expert from the dragon clan still fell. He was torn into pieces and his Dao marks were shattered. This time, the Dragon Lord did not even make a sound.He didn't know if it was because he didn't notice it, or if he did, but he couldn't descend, so he didn't respond at all.When the level 7 Dragon was killed, its corpse was swept up. Instead of being devoured by Kong Ji, it was absorbed into the great path universe, making the Silver Moon universe even more powerful. Although it could not reach Level 7, it could still be strengthened.At this moment, there were four Grade 7 experts, three of whom were Masters of the great Dao.The ripples of the great Dao shook the world.Four huge beasts of primordial chaos blotted out the sky.The two ferocious Tigers, one black and one white, had exceptionally cold eyes.The treasure-piercing mouse's small eyes also emitted a cold light. The huge white elephant's two sharp tusks seemed to be able to pierce through the world.Dao Qi was speechless!'I didn't even know what was going on when I arrived. I killed a tier seven Dragon first, and in the blink of an eye, four more came. There were even two fighting nearby ...'What was going on?"Silver Moon King?"The fierce Black Tiger looked at Li Hao with a gaze that could kill."You came to my Dragon field and killed so many venerable sovereigns. You are too bold!"The four venerable sovereigns didn't attack immediately.That was because, at this moment, they were all peeking at the Dao chess piece. They had already vaguely made some judgments. The other party's teleportation was too terrifying. At this moment, they seemed to have determined the identity of the Dao chess piece. "Dao chess? Tian Fang's monarch weapon?""This is a war between the human race and the chaos race ..." The black Tiger snorted coldly,"you're only a monarch weapon. Do you want to participate in this?"Dao Qi was innocent.Would you believe me if I said I didn't want to be involved?Four rank seven beasts, these chaos beasts were not to be trifled with.Even if he and Li Hao could contend against one, Kong Ji and the two Dao Masters were still slightly inferior ...He could fight!However, it was too difficult.Moreover, they were in the core of the Dragon field. They could fight, but ... There were still seventh level venerable sovereigns on the side of the chaos beasts!  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  Moreover, there were quite a few of them.Once they were entangled and there was no clear winner, if the other side sent another Grade 7 expert, they would all be defeated.Li Hao was quite clear.But ... Have you ever considered how you can quickly take down the other party under such circumstances?Dao Qi had a headache.In the sky, the fire Phoenix World Overlord also shouted out: "Empyrean Phoenix, Empyrean exalts of the Three Realms, all of you, leave the realm! Surround and kill these bastards!"There were more than a hundred venerable sovereigns in the fire Phoenix realm.There were also many venerable sovereigns from the Three Realms. In total, there were about 200 venerable sovereigns. There were even more venerable sovereigns from the external Affairs. Many ants could bite an elephant to death!At this moment, the fire Phoenix Thearch also made a quick judgment. A strong attack might not be able to take down the other party quickly. Since that was the case ... They would surround him!These people actually dare to be so arrogant in our territory!The aura of venerable sovereigns appeared around him.As for the Thunder World, there were only about 20 venerable sovereigns. At this moment, these venerable sovereigns 'expressions were constantly changing. They were all blocking the realm gate. They didn't come out or retreat. Their eyes were all fluctuating.Just a moment ago, Li Hao had killed elder firephoenix and then the venerable Emperor of Dragon World. Their hearts almost jumped out of their chests.In that instant, he even felt that there was hope.But ... At this moment, he quickly became depressed.There were too many venerable sovereigns in the Four Realms. Not to mention these venerable sovereigns, with four rank seven venerable sovereigns surrounding them ... The Silver Moon King's side was probably no match for them!Although the grade 6 experts were all very strong.However, there seemed to be only one level Seven.How could he match such strength?What a pity!These Thunder World venerable sovereigns felt a little regretful and helpless. If it was only the fire Phoenix World, they could even retaliate today. However, they were surrounded by four great worlds!At this moment, the expressions of Kong Ji and the others also changed.The appearance of a large number of venerable sovereigns around them made them realize ... Yes, they were not afraid usually, but there were hundreds of venerable sovereigns now. With so many venerable sovereigns, if they were to attack at once and join forces with four rank Sevens, it would be enough to kill them.He had been too engrossed in researching Level Seven with Li Hao that he seemed to have forgotten about these ordinary venerable sovereigns. They were not to be trifled with, alright? it was fine if there were fewer, but if there were more ... They could still be killed.Just as he was thinking about it, heaven and earth suddenly went into chaos!The four beasts of Chaos attacked at the same time!Beasts of primordial chaos had strong bodies, and most of them were good at the Dao of the body. However, there were some exceptions. The treasure-connecting mouse was covered in a golden light. It looked like it could only search for treasures, but in an instant ... It disappeared.Speed!He was so fast that it was as if he could even travel through the void. He was the first to attack. The Dao chess domain also appeared in an instant to block him. However, in the next second, the expression on the Dao chess piece's face changed."Not good ..."Before Li Hao and the others could come back to their senses, Dao Qi shouted in a low voice,""It can absorb the treasure light from my body ..."What was the treasure light?Li Hao and the others were not too sure, but the other three Beasts of Chaos were all smiling.Yes, treasure-piercing mouse!It had a rather useless ability ... Which was to absorb some special powers from treasures. However, Hundun did not have any good treasures after reaching Level Seven.In the past, this ability was almost useless.The treasure-piercing mouse had an ordinary body, but it was extremely fast.But at this moment, it was somewhat targeted at the Dao chess pieces. It restrained the Dao chess pieces. The other party was shuttling back and forth crazily, absorbing rays of light. The shadow of the Dao chess pieces changed. It was somewhat depressing. What bad luck!
