        i Hao had not been interested in joining the Wei Wu Army.
         But now, he was interested.
         The Golden spear and the forest had both walked a long way on the path of martial arts. Although the Golden spear had yet to be seen, the forest alone was enough to make Li Hao stay.
         As for wanting an official position, that was just something that happened in passing.
         Exploring ruins, fighting against ancient civilizations, fighting against Pirates ...
         The Wei Wu Army's goal was also very interesting.
         Although the Silver Moon was huge, there were not many opportunities for him to fight. If he joined the Wei Wu Army, he might have more opportunities for actual combat.
         Moreover, this place was near the sea.
         Viewing the sea was also a pleasure.
         ……
          In the hall.
         Chief Steward Yu didn't care about Li Hao's request for an official position. Since Li Hao was willing to stay, it was for the best.
         As for high-level City Patrol ... He could just give it a try. He wouldn't lose anything anyway. If the Patrol Division and the administration Bureau were really willing to approve it, who would care?
         Chief Steward Yu didn't want to say more and said,""Then, are you going to stay and talk to them now or go back and come back tomorrow?"
         "Let's come back tomorrow!"
         Li Hao smiled."I came too suddenly. I beat up a few more friends. I'll give them some time to accept me."
         At the side, Mu Lin chuckled and said,"it's fine. It's normal to get injured in a spar." When the Wei Wu Army was first formed, they fought countless battles every day. There are professional healers here, so they will recover very quickly. "
         This place was equipped with healing abilities.
         Compared to the Wulin of the past, it was difficult to recover from serious injuries after getting injured. Many martial artists had fallen because of these injuries. The rise of superpowers today was actually an opportunity for martial masters.
         He didn't need to worry too much. If he used too much force, he wouldn't even dare to go all out in sparring.
         Li Hao and Chief Steward Yu didn't say anything more.
         As Mu Lin sent them off, the two of them walked out of the hall, crossed the square, and got into the car under the gaze of many martial masters.
         ……
         The moment they left.
         In the square, some people began to discuss.
         "The old Devil's disciple is that powerful?"
         "As expected, this lineage is full of monsters!"
         "It's a pity that the captain isn't here, otherwise ..."
         "Of course. If the captain was here, he would definitely make this guy suffer a big loss. He's too arrogant!"
         The crowd was in a heated discussion.
         However, he still felt helpless.
         Who was the captain?
         The Golden spear!
         Back then, he had been as famous as Yuan Shuo. Now, Yuan Shuo's disciple had joined the Wei Wu Army, and he had defeated almost everyone except Jin gun.
         Although Mu Lin managed to save some face in the end, the result of their battle was that Mu Lin was injured, while Li Hao was only gasping for breath. To the Wei Wu Army, this was already an embarrassing loss!
         ……
         There was a lot of discussion outside the square.  In the hall behind.
         The nine Centurions were all gathered together, including Mu Lin.
         The injured Centurions looked a little dejected, but their injuries weren't too serious. The most serious of them had broken bones and their internal organs were slightly shaken. Li Hao was still holding back against them, as the gap between them was not small.
         "Mu Lin, didn't you say that he only broke a hundred?"
         The successor of the mountain splitting axe, Chen Jin, had an unsightly expression on his face. This is the "over 100" you were talking about?
         He was the first to make a move, but he was knocked down with two punches!
         This was too embarrassing!
         "Why are you looking at me?" Mu Lin laughed. He's improving fast, what can I do? I'm not the only one who said that he's over a hundred. Everyone said that he's over a hundred, but in the end, he didn't ... You blame me?"
         Everyone was silent.
         Indeed, the information they received showed that Li Hao's cultivation had only broken through 100.
         Xie Lan from the Jade Sword School coughed. He was really injured, not like hou Xiaochen and the others. At this moment, his face was a bit pale, "It's not a big deal that he defeated us. I'm thinking, if ... If he was really in the perfect breakthrough of a hundred when he fought with sun moxian ... No, he was in the late stage of the breakthrough of a hundred at that time, then it's only been ten days."
         10 days!
         Yes, only 10 days.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Was the information from 10 days ago considered outdated?
         Absolutely not. At least for a Martial Master, the information from ten days ago was definitely not out of date.
         However, the result was shocking.
         Mu Lin nodded slightly,"he's making rapid progress in several aspects. First, he went to heaven battling city." Second, a Blood God at the sunguang level. "Third, he seems to have comprehended another Shi ..."
         All in all, there was a reason for Li Hao's strength.
         However, it was still too hard to believe.
         Could it be that this fellow didn't have the slightest bottleneck?
         After receiving benefits, he could immediately comprehend force, advance, and become stronger?
         Who here had not practiced martial arts for more than 20 years?
         "Forget it," Mu Lin quickly said."He has his own opportunities, and we have ours too. Although our opportunities don't seem to be as big as his, we are already very powerful compared to the martial masters in the outside world!"
         "Since this fellow is willing to join the Wei Wu Army, we will be colleagues in the future."
         "He agreed to join?" someone asked in a deep voice.
         "Yes."
          "What's the arrangement?"
         "The hou tribe wants to form another hundred-man unit and give it to him to control."
         ? Everyone felt a little more at ease when they heard this.
         Well, this was still alright!
         Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to live.
         Whether Li Hao was their superior or subordinate, it was not good for him.
         It was hard to be a subordinate.
         As their superior, Li Hao was too young. They couldn't accept the fact that such a young Martial Master could command them so quickly.
         "Did the Marquis send him here to borrow his knowledge to help us explore the ruins?"
         "It's possible. Besides, he's indeed strong. If he joins the Wei Wu Army, he can make the Wei Wu Army even stronger!"
        
         "That's hard to say. If we had joined forces and formed an army formation, we wouldn't have lost so badly!"
         “……”
         The crowd discussed animatedly. Of course, they no longer rejected Li Hao's participation.
         Martial masters were just that realistic.
         "You're too weak. It's fine if you're just a nobody, but if you're Yuan Shuo's disciple, then don't blame everyone for ostracizing you or even bullying you.
         However, Li Hao was too powerful, and he was also Yuan Shuo's disciple. This was a completely different story!
         Such an existence was qualified to join, and also had the right to be arrogant.
         "My personal guard commander ... Is gone!" Mu Lin sighed.
         The crowd was speechless. Some people rolled their eyes.
         You're still thinking about this at this time?
          Chen Jin sneered."Mu Lin, your defense is invincible. An existence like you is suitable to be the captain of the swordsman's personal guard!"
         Captain of the guards?
         This fatty was the most suitable bodyguard.
         Mu Lin glanced at him and laughed,""That's still better than someone being knocked out by two punches. "
         "You ..."
         Mu Lin laughed and ignored him. He stood up and said,""Disperse, disperse! If that guy really comes to be a Centurion ... I'm worried that he'll transfer some people to his team. Everyone, be careful. Those people in your team might be tempted after seeing how badly you've been defeated today. "
         As soon as he said that, the few Centurions instantly became nervous.
         That won't do!
         They had been building their team for a long time. Even if there were a reduction in members, they would soon be full. Now that Li Hao was new, he wanted to form a 100-man team, so he would definitely have to pull some of the older members.
         It was impossible to let an old man take up the post without any money.
         After chatting for a while, they quickly dispersed.
         As for Mu Lin, he stayed in place for a while, and soon laughed. He thought of his dear little brother ... My lovely little brother, I hope you return to white moon City soon. Big brother will get closer to you!
         ……
         In the car.
         Butler Yu did not say a word and closed his eyes to rest.
         Li Hao recalled the previous sparring. This time, it was really just sparring. There was a gap in strength between him and the Centurions, so he didn't use much strength.
         As for Mu Lin ... The fat man was the one defending, and Li Hao only managed to strike him once with his sword. In fact, it wasn't really a life-and-death battle.
         However, what Li Hao was thinking about was their physique!
         They were all very strong!
         Even the Centurions had terrifyingly strong physiques. At the very least, they were stronger than the team leader.
         "General manager, the divine energy stones can strengthen the body. Did they absorb a lot of divine energy stones?"
         Li Hao asked directly.
          "Yes, the divine energy stones are often the main source of the harvest from the ruins," the chief Jade supervisor said calmly.  "Is hei Teng from the heaven battling Army here as well?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Yes,"
         "The heaven-battling Army is not the only Army of the ancient civilization," chief Yu continued."The Army of that period all wore the same armor, and there were ... Many black armors! "The Wei Wu Army now has 500 black armors. It is a pity that many of the black armors in heaven battling city were taken away by others."
         The three great organizations had received quite a bit.
         Swords gate seemed to have a share as well.
         Li Hao's eyes flickered. With 500 Black Phoenix, their defense was still very strong. Even without the support of the special energy on the ground, the black Phoenix's defense was enough to give sunlight a headache.
         In other words, if these martial masters were equipped with black armors ... They might all be able to use them as sunlit weapons ...
         This was the most terrifying thing!
         Thousands of solarium ... No wonder the night watchmen were so poor. Hou Xiaochen had stuffed all the good stuff into the Wei Wu Army to create an incomparably strong Army.
         Li Hao felt that this thousand-strong Wei Wu Army was a top-tier force even in the central region.
         This was probably Silver moon's greatest trump card, as he had gathered all of his power to create this thousand-man army.
         If everyone was equipped with black armor, with Dou Qian charging at the front, and the Army formation ...
         Li Hao thought carefully, and his eyes flickered.
         Any 100-man team could easily take down the three suns. If golden spear and wood forest were there, it would not be too difficult to take down the rising light. This was under the premise that golden spear could not take down the rising light alone.
         For hou Xiaochen to allow him to enter the Wei Wu Army ... It seemed like he really did take him seriously.
         After a moment of silence, Li Hao said, then I'll recruit people myself?
         "Sure, but you have to pass our test in advance. You can't just recruit a random Martial Master."
         "Yes," Chief Steward Yu said calmly."These martial masters have to pass all kinds of tests before they can join the Wei Wu Army successfully. They'll also sign some confidentiality agreements to not leak some information ... In fact, they're not allowed to leave the base for the first three years unless they're on a mission. Three years later, there will be a month of leave every year, but it will be a rotation. "
         She could not leave for three years.
         This was also a form of torture for many martial masters.
         However, it was normal when he thought about it.
          "Then I'll do the same?"
         "Those above the centurion rank aren't restricted by this rule! It's fine as long as you're there when you're on a mission. "
         Li Hao nodded. This was good.
         As expected, only officials had this privilege.
         If he was a soldier, he would not be able to leave for three years.
         At this moment, many thoughts crossed Li Hao's mind. The Wei Wu Army had benefited greatly. Li Hao took a look and saw that almost all of them were above 100 ... After absorbing so many divine power stones and mysterious energy, they would be letting themselves down if they did not exceed 100!
         This was a huge platform for martial masters to improve.
         He thought of the demon hunting squad.
         But ... What about the Silver City?
         He wanted the team leader and the others to come over. Liu Long would have to stay in the silver Blizzard city and absorb a few divine power stones. It was as if he wanted to kill him. However, there might be many such opportunities here that would allow him to catch up quickly.
        
         Liu Yan, Wu Chao, and Chen Jian ...
         These few people had all entered the 100th level and were qualified to join. Furthermore, they were also night patrollers, so there would definitely be no problem with the assessment.
         Li Hao suspected that there was a treasure here that could help everyone comprehend force. Otherwise, it would be impossible for a hundred people to break through 100 perfection. Force was not that easy to comprehend.
         There were too many opportunities!
         It was so many that Li Hao felt that he shouldn't let the captain and the others continue to stay in Silver City.
         But ... The Silver City was very important.
         At the very least, the stone gate was very important.
         However, on second thought, the stone door couldn't be opened by others ...
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com What Liu Long was worried about now was the Silver City's defense. However, once the three major organizations 'forces were eliminated in the Silver City, it would not be a big problem if he were to arrange for a sunlight to take charge of the Silver City.
         "Chief, can we recruit supers?"
          "Sure."
         "However, superpowers can only be logistics personnel and not official members!" Chief Yu said coldly. Once the formation is complete, it will not be perfect even if one person is missing. However, there are some places that are not suitable for superpowers to enter. When that happens, it will be a big problem if the number of people is reduced!"
         "What?"
         "What you mean is that with the current formation, our strength will be greatly reduced if we lose members?" Li Hao was stunned.
         "Isn't that the case?"
         Chief Steward Yu slightly frowned and glanced at Li Hao.
         Li Hao recalled that not all ancient military formations were like this. Some military formations were actually dispersed.
         For example, if five people formed a formation, 100 people would Form 20 small formations, and these 20 small formations would form an army formation of 100 people.
         The advantage of this was that it wasn't difficult to coordinate and it was easier to break in.
         For a large-scale battle formation, for example, a hundred people working together, it would require a hundred people to train and cooperate at the same time. It would be very difficult.
         Moreover, there was another advantage to the dispersed formation. Even if 95 people died, the remaining five people could still form the formation and not be affected.
         From the looks of it, hou Xiaochen didn't have a formation like this.
         Therefore, they could only form a small army of a hundred people. It was indeed not suitable for them to join supers, but Li Hao happened to know a few small armies.
         Thinking of this, he didn't say much.
         Let's see.
         ……
         The car continued to move forward.
         This time, by the time Li Hao was sent home, the sky had already turned completely dark.
         Downstairs.
         After leaving Li Hao behind, she left with the driver, tactfully rejecting Li Hao's invitation for a meal. In fact, she really wanted to curse Li Hao for inviting her to the cafeteria of the inspector's family building.
         Was this something a human would say?  As for the Phoenix spear, Li Hao mentioned it again, and Chief Steward Yu promised to give it to him the next day.
         ……
         Upstairs.
         Li Hao had just opened the door when the door opposite opened. Hao lianchuan had returned earlier that night.
         He was a little mysterious. When he saw Li Hao, he seemed to be very nervous."Li Hao, when I was training tonight ... I felt ... I felt that there was a faint superpower lock appearing in my kidney!"
         Li Hao smiled."That's good news, Minister. This means that the blood God is really useful."
         Hao lianchuan quickly nodded. Then, his eyes turned red, and he gritted his teeth and said in a low voice,""I'm going to encircle and annihilate the Crimson Moon!"
         He was going to start!
         "Hasn't that always been the case?"
         "That's not the same. Previously, it was just a talk. The other party did not come to Whitemoon city. In fact, Whitemoon city did not want to fight with the other party in the wild ... For example, places like yaoguang city actually have traces of the Crimson Moon. It's just that they have not made the decision to really eliminate it."
         "This time, I want the Wei Wu Army to cooperate. In addition, I'll invite the inspection Office and the military to move out together and completely destroy the red moon!"
         This person was really ruthless.
         A red shadow!
         Since the Scion of the blood God was so effective, killing Hong Yue's people would strengthen him.
         "Minister, do as you see fit."
         Li Hao didn't say anything. They had already decided on this matter, but now, it only strengthened Hao lianchuan's determination.
         "You went to the Wei Wu Army?"
         "Yes."
         Li Hao opened the door and invited Hao lianchuan in.
         Hao lianchuan thought for a moment."I actually know a thing or two about the Wei Wu Army. How did you feel when you went this time?"
          "Strong!"
         Li Hao smiled."In terms of individual strength, there are only two people who are more powerful than the department head. But if the department head goes alone ... He'll be killed at least dozens of times!"
         “……”
         These words were a little vexing.
         However, Hao lianchuan did not seem to mind. He thought for a while and nodded.""That's normal. The foundation of the Wei Wu Army is likely to be the same as the foundation of the Heavenly Star guards back then. Back then, they were a group of powerful martial masters ... But after so many years, not all of them are martial masters. There should be a portion of them who are."
         "The star guards were all in Silver Moon?" Li Hao's eyes flickered.
         Hao lianchuan shook his head."Only a large portion of them are in Silver Moon. There's still a portion in stellarsky city. The three great commanders of the Wei Wu Army were all active in Silver Moon back then. However, the military governor of the Wei Wu Army is in stellarsky city."
         "Governor?"
         "You think that the Wei Wu Army only has three commanders? Wouldn't it be difficult to deal with them if both of them refused to accept it? Moreover, this was established by the royal family, so of course there are people from the royal family supervising it. When the Heavenly Star guards Army was established, the three great commanders "identities were a mystery, and they were the actual operators. The governor, on the other hand, has a name and is the high Duke of the royal family."
         Hao lianchuan explained to Li Hao,""In the current Heavenly Star royal family, other than the Heavenly Star King, there are still a bunch of princes and grandsons, as well as a bunch of Royal relatives. However, everyone else is just a parasite, so there's no need to care about them. However, the royal family had conferred nine princes and 36 state Dukes, which was worth paying attention to. Among the 99 provinces, some of them are actually under the control of the imperial family. Otherwise, do you think that the nine divisions would not want to make the imperial family disappear?"
        
         Li Hao nodded.
         Nine princes, 36 Dukes ...
         He had heard of this, but he didn't know much.
         The star royal family had ruled the world for 120 years. Although they had abdicated 80 years ago, a starving camel was still bigger than a horse, and they still had a strong foundation.
         He didn't pay much attention to it. The Duke in charge of the Wei Wu Army was just a symbol.
         Li Hao didn't say anything else.
         Hao lianchuan, on the other hand, was so excited that he couldn't help but run over to chat with Li Hao. After the chat, he left without even inviting Li Hao to a meal, causing Li Hao to curse him in secret.
         How stingy!
         ……
         The next day.
          Li Hao still arrived on time.
         In the Nightwalker's building.
         Li Hao glanced upstairs. Hou Xiaochen was no longer there. He had no idea where he had gone.
         Li Hao couldn't be bothered. These experts were rarely seen, and it was normal for them to be absent all day long.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com On the fourth floor.
         Li Hao went straight to chief Yu's office.
         Seeing Li Hao knock on the door and enter, Chief Steward Yu didn't seem to want to talk to him anymore. With a wave of his hand, a fiery red spear appeared. At this moment, the small sword that Li Hao had hidden in his military boots seemed to be trembling slightly.
         Li Hao knew that she probably wanted to eat it!
         The fire Phoenix spear was extremely powerful.
         The shadow snake sword he had eaten last time was only a yellow-grade origin divine weapon.
         The fire Phoenix spear was said to be a heaven-grade or earth-grade weapon?
         Who knows?
         At this moment, Chief Steward Yu was holding the fiery phoenix spear. He could feel the fiery phoenix spear trembling slightly. He frowned slightly and quickly stopped thinking about it. "This is the fire Phoenix spear!"
         "The fire Phoenix spear has already recognized its owner. It's the Minister's weapon. Although it's hard, ordinary people can't use it."
         "Hao lianchuan was only able to use it because of the fiery phoenix Spear's consciousness and the head's orders ... Now, the head is lending you the fiery phoenix spear, but he didn't give you the right to use it. So, you can't use it. Even if you use it, you can only use it as a strong weapon."
         In other words, there were no special abilities and no soldier souls.
         Li Hao understood.
          However, Li Hao didn't know much about origin weapons, so he still asked,""Chief, I heard that the origin god weapon can create superpowers and produce mysterious energy. How is it created and how is it produced?"  This was not a big secret. Chief Steward Yu said coldly,""Once the soul is awakened by the origin weapon, it can actually absorb the mysterious energy between heaven and earth. The mysterious energy that is swallowed and spat out by the origin weapon will be gentler and less impactful. It's most suitable for newcomers to advance."
         "It doesn't give birth to mysterious energy on its own. The mysterious energy actually fills the entire world, but ordinary people can't discover it or extract it. You've also seen the mysterious energy before. Once it seeps into the air, it disappears without a trace ... Actually, it's not gone. It's just dispersed, making you unable to capture it. The origin god weapon has this ability."
         "If I have an original God weapon, won't I have unlimited mysterious energy?" Li Hao asked curiously.
         "Not really. It's efficient."
         "For example, a yellow-grade origin divine weapon can only produce about half a square meter of mysterious energy in a day. It's actually insignificant!" Chief Yu explained again.
         "The fire Phoenix spear is very powerful. It can produce about 10 cubic meters a day, but actually...It's not worth mentioning! Do you think 3000 or so in a year is a lot?"
         Not much!
         Li Hao shook his head in disappointment. Just this little bit?
         That's too little!
         In that case, the night patrolman did not rely on the mysterious ability of the origin god weapon to cultivate.
         10 cubic meters. Li Hao had only been a low-level inspector before, but he already had a monthly salary of one cubic meter.
         There were many night watchers. If they only relied on the 3000 or so mysterious abilities of the origin god weapon, they would have gone bankrupt a long time ago.
         Chief Steward Yu continued,"of course, this is an offensive origin god weapon. Some origin God weapons are specially used to convert mysterious energy. They can produce a large amount of mysterious energy. The three major organizations and the night patrolman headquarters might have some." As for us, we only have one fire Phoenix spear. "
         "Some of the mysterious energy we're using now was obtained from our own missions, some were born from the fiery phoenix spear, and the rest ... Were obtained from the ruins!"
         "The origin god weapon also has another use. It can directly devour some items in some ancient ruins and convert them into mysterious energy. Some items in ancient ruins have mysterious energy, but they can't be used. They need the origin god weapon to devour ..." Chief Yu explained.
         "The higher-ups aren't going to allocate any funds?"
          Li Hao was curious. Even if hou Xiaochen wanted independence, he didn't really do it. Was he not going to allocate any funds?
         "Self-sufficient! Now, apart from the central region, the border regions are all like this. All four sides are self-sufficient, but there is no need to hand it over to the central region. "
         Li Hao nodded. So that was the case.
         But in doing so...The central region's control over the four sides would naturally fall. If you don't pay me, do you expect me to listen to you?
         I wonder what the central continent is thinking.
         Li Hao looked at the fiery phoenix spear. The fiery red spear was very quiet at this moment. He couldn't see its soul, as if it was still.
         "Can it be activated?" Li Hao asked after some thought.
         Chief Steward Yu frowned slightly."It's best not to try. It's easy for something to happen!" The Head of the Department has gone out and didn't give you the right to use it. Once you activate it, it's easy to cause the origin divine weapon to attack you!"
         "Although you're not weak, this fire Phoenix spear is very powerful. Even if there's no one controlling it, it can still unleash the power of three yang!"
         In other words, it could be activated.
        
         Li Hao asked curiously,"how?" Devouring the divine energy stone?"
         “……”
         Did this guy even hear what I said?
         Chief Steward Yu thought for a while. Li Hao didn't seem to have any divine power stones.
         He nodded."Yes, if you have a fire-type divine power Stone, you can activate an origin god weapon, but it's not necessary. Li Hao, don't try it. If you have an origin god weapon, I suggest you just take a look. The department head has used this Phoenix spear for many years. Perhaps you can comprehend something and gain some insights. As for the rest ... Don't try it!"
         "Understood!"
         Li Hao chuckled and reached for the fire Phoenix spear.
         However, before he could get his hands on it, the fire Phoenix spear suddenly trembled slightly, as if it was unwilling to touch Li Hao.
         Chief Steward Yu was slightly startled. This was the first time such a situation had occurred.
         She glanced at Li Hao and frowned.""You ..."
          "What did I do?"
         Li Hao was at a loss. He knew that the seal on the small sword had been lifted a little, perhaps because it had sensed the aura of the starry sky sword. The snake from last time seemed to be scared to death.
         The fire Phoenix spear was dormant now, but its soul had been awakened. Perhaps it had also felt it.
         Chief Steward Yu was also puzzled.
         Why was it like this?
         But ... Forget it. Since the Head of Department had already agreed, she didn't want to say anything more. She handed the Phoenix spear to Li Hao and said,""The origin god weapon can be kept in the body, even if it's not yours! The fire Phoenix spear has been unsealed, so you only need to drip a drop of blood on it and it can be absorbed into your body. This drop of blood doesn't recognize you as its master, it just allows the fire Phoenix spear to sense your aura and fuse with your body. "
         Li Hao was in a difficult position. Dripping blood?
         I'll drip my blood on it. Will this gun be fine?
         It wasn't that he was overestimating himself, but the blood drop earlier had affected the two words "heaven battling city ..."
         After thinking about it, it should be fine since it was just normal blood.
         Moreover, he couldn't take this thing out to show off, right?
         Li Hao cut his finger, and a drop of blood dripped onto the spear.
         The moment the blazing Phoenix spear was stained with blood, it seemed to tremble slightly. At this moment, a blazing Phoenix seemed to have appeared on the spear.
         Li Hao curiously looked at it. The fire Phoenix seemed to have opened its eyes as well.
         When it sensed Li Hao's aura, the fire Phoenix instantly disappeared.
         The fire on the entire Fire Phoenix spear disappeared completely.
         His true appearance was revealed!
         A spear that looked no different from an ordinary spear had lost 90% of its beauty without the flames. It was obvious that it was a powerful divine weapon from the start, but at this moment ... It was simply too ordinary!
         Chief Steward Yu was surprised again. He glanced at Li Hao and frowned."The fire Phoenix is restrained. Strange ... Is there something wrong with your blood? Are the bloodlines of the eight great families somewhat different?"
         She thought for a moment and said,"the Phoenix is completely reserved. This means that it has sealed itself. It means that ... You can forget about activating it. Even if you use it now, it can only be used as an ordinary weapon. You've even lost the right to activate it!"
         “……”
         Li Hao was speechless. Was it really necessary?
         What did that mean?
         "Can the seal be undone?"
         "Sure, it's fine as long as the Minister is here!"
         Alright, pretend I didn't say anything.
         Li Hao was speechless and depressed.
         What was going on?
         Did it think that I would harm it, so it sealed itself the moment it felt my blood?
         With a thought from Li Hao, the fiery phoenix spear instantly tunneled into his body. It was originally very big, but after entering his body, it became very small, like a needle. In the blink of an eye, it tunneled into Li Hao's internal organs and became motionless.
         How convenient!
         Li Hao was a little envious, but his small sword was not good enough.
         However, this thing was also disobedient. It had actually restrained itself. How was he going to use it next?
         "Three days later, leave it to me!"
         "Don't think about running away with the treasure. It's impossible. He can sense it if you're too far away from the Minister, so don't even think about it!" Chief Yu reminded him again.
         Li Hao was stunned for a moment. Only now did he understand something. He was extremely innocent and aggrieved."Chief, so you're not lending it to me because you think I'll run away with the money?"
         Why would he have such an idea?
         I've never thought of that!  Chief Steward Yu waved his hand, signaling him to leave. He was not interested in explaining.
         Whether you will or not, you know it in your heart.
         This was not the first time that the five birds sect had been so bold.
         Li Hao Ran away with the Phoenix spear to find Yuan Shuo ... It was not impossible, or rather, it was very possible. This was the reason why she was unwilling to lend it to Li Hao before. For example, hou Xiaochen was not worried about Hao lianchuan running away even when he had given him the right to use it.
         It was obvious that even hou Xiaochen was thinking about this problem ... So he simply didn't give Li Hao the right to use it!
         If he gave it to him and this fellow really took it away, it would be difficult to get it back.
         Li Hao looked depressed. He really didn't think about it ... Why did he have to accuse someone!
         You're all accusing me, do you believe that I'll really take it away?
         Chief Steward Yu ignored him, so he could only take the initiative and say,""I'll go to the Wei Wu Army now ..."
         "Go downstairs and get in the car. Also, you can get your own car in the future. Ordinary cars can't go there and can't get in. They will be destroyed. Buy your own car and register it ..."
         "Aren't we not assigned a car?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao was surprised. I work for the government!
         Besides, I don't have the money to buy a car.
         Chief Steward Yu's head hurt. She didn't want to listen to Li Hao right now. This guy was very annoying at times. He only knew how to take advantage of others ...
         "I'll buy it myself!"
         "I don't have any money!"
         "You ..."
         Chief Steward Yu thought he was joking, but after taking a closer look, Li Hao said with a serious face,""I really don't have money! I looked at my card yesterday, and there's still more than 10000 Yuan. They didn't pay me last month, but it's not enough to buy a car!"
         Heavens!
         At this moment, Chief Steward Yu only had one thought, this guy ... How could he be so poor?
         How could a mighty warrior Qian ... No, even a yunshen Martial Master be so poor that he took it for granted?
         "Alright, I'll give you a car later!" Chief Steward Yu sighed after a long time.
         Li Hao was all smiles!
         Only then did he leave happily.
         After he left, Chief Steward Yu was a little speechless. After a long time, he picked up the communicator and made a call.
         When the other side picked up, she was silent for a while before saying,""Hao lianchuan, Li Hao's salary ... Transfer ... Transfer 1 million Yuan to him every month!"
         Hao lianchuan was stunned,"what?" Isn't his salary a secret ability?"
         "Send him the money!"
         Chief Steward Yu wanted to roll his eyes."This is the first time I've seen such a poor Martial Master in my life. It's so embarrassing."
         Li Hao didn't care about the mysterious energy of one side.
         Perhaps this guy would be happier if it was 1000000.
         No wonder he was so stingy. He really didn't have money.
         Hao lianchuan seemed to have realized something as well. He mumbled,""Is he that poor? I knew it. He freeloaded on the food from the canteen every day, and at most, he would buy a few buns ... I thought that was his habit. "
         The two of them suddenly felt like laughing.
         When he laughed, it gave off a terrifying feeling.
         With Li Hao's age and strength, it could be said that it was normal for young people to be arrogant at this time. Not to mention luxury houses and luxury cars, even changing women every day was a normal thing.
         There was no need to even mention eating and drinking.
          Where's Li Hao?
         Yet, he seemed to have never had such thoughts. A young elite with extreme self-discipline was the most terrifying part.
         At this moment, Chief Steward Yu thought again,"could it be that this guy wants to be promoted just to increase his salary?"
         If that was the case ...
         She could only say that Li Hao was too crazy!
         Who would be promoted for such a small salary?
         ……
         At this moment, Li Hao, who was walking down the stairs, was in a good mood.
         He got another car!
         Sure enough, it was comfortable to live in a public house. He didn't know when he would be able to get a bigger house. Until now, he didn't have any real estate under his name in white moon City.
        
         The vehicle once again passed through white moon City, through the forest, and entered the Wei Wu Army's territory.
         Li Hao got out of the car and tidied his clothes.
         The driver drove off. This was hou Xiaochen's personal car. If it wasn't for the fact that Li Hao didn't have a car, hou Xiaochen wouldn't have even given him a ride.
         At the entrance.
         Someone was waiting.
         Mu Lin, who had nothing to do, was obviously the most suitable candidate. As for the other Centurions ... None of them came. They had things to do and were currently training their soldiers in the distance.
         Of course, they could also take some time out to train their troops. However, they had just been beaten up yesterday, and they had to welcome him today. Everyone would feel embarrassed.
         "Welcome!"
         Mu Lin was still as polite as yesterday.
         He was laughing.
          Li Hao finally realized that fatties liked to smile. When they smiled, they would look simple and honest.
         Department head Hao was also fat and liked to smile.
         There was also Mu Lin's younger brother, mu Sen, who was also a Smiling Tiger.
         He cursed in his heart, is there another Mu Mu in the MU family?
         These two brothers had already gathered seven pieces of wood. Should they gather a few more?
         "Thousand-man commander mu!"
         "Don't shout like that!"
         Mu Lin smiled."Call me second brother mu. I'm still young, just over 40 years old. Why are you calling me a chiliarch? our Wei Wu Army usually calls me by my name. You can call me second brother mu for face!"
         The reason why he was the second brother was because the boss was a golden spear. He couldn't win against him.
         Mu Lin looked at Li Hao with a smile."You didn't bring your luggage? It's fine, there's everything here, you can have anything you want, other than the few people here, everything else is here!"
         Then, he politely pulled Li Hao and walked inside.
         Li Hao withdrew his hand without a sound.
         The so-called 'not moving a muscle' meant that he did not look sideways. He forcibly pulled his hand back and pretended not to see it. As long as he did not feel embarrassed, Mu Lin would be the one who would feel embarrassed.
         Mu Lin didn't mind at all and was still smiling.
         "Brother Li, you're new here and don't know much about this place. I'll show you around and let you get to know each other."
         "Thank you, brother ermu!" Li Hao nodded.
         “……”
         Mu Lin was stunned. Brother ermu?
         I'm talking about second brother mu, did you hear me wrong?
         But then he thought about it and laughed. It didn't matter. Brother ermu was good. It was the same.  He led Li Hao through the gatehouse. Inside the gatehouse was the huge square. It was not small, so it would take some time to walk. Mu Lin led Li Hao to the side and said,""This is the martial arts field. Everyone usually trains here. If you feel that the unique secret technique is not suitable to be spread, you can also cultivate in the room. There are some cultivation rooms at the back that you can use."
         Li Hao nodded slightly. At this moment, there were at least four or five hundred people in the training field. Many of them were looking in his direction while practicing, but when they saw Li Hao looking in that direction, they quickly looked away.
         "The entire base is divided into three large areas, and this is one of them. There's also a living area behind, and the cultivation area. "
         "In the living quarters, each person has one room. All the Centurions have their own courtyards."
         Li Hao was very satisfied with this. This was not bad. In that case, he would be given a big house?
         As expected, the houses in the suburbs were not worth much.
         "There are some special cultivation methods in the cultivation area that are very helpful for martial masters."
         "Oh?" Li Hao was interested."What kind of special training method?"
         ? Mu Lin smiled. This time, he was very happy."Before the rise of superpowers, martial masters were actually very difficult to cultivate. Many times, after cultivating for seven to eight years, or even more than ten years, they would still be able to cut Ten Realms."
         "After the rise of superpowers, martial masters discovered that attribute-less mysterious powers could strengthen their bodies. This also opened up a new path for martial masters."
         "Later on, we also discovered that the divine power Stone had a comprehensive strengthening effect on martial masters, and it was even better than the attribute-less mysterious energy!"
         Li Hao kept nodding.
         Mu Lin continued,"therefore, over the years, the Wei Wu Army has built an attribute-less energy room and a divine energy stone cultivation room. They are both treasured places that can help martial masters to improve quickly. At least before fighting against a thousand, they are first-class in strengthening the body!"
         "Those below thousand warrior tier will go to the attribute-less mysterious energy cultivation room. If you're above thousand warrior tier, then go to the divine power cultivation room. "
         Li Hao's eyes flickered,'the Wei Wu Army is so extravagant? There aren't many divine energy stones, right?"
         "It's not much. Even for us, we don't have much either. However, this thing can be supplemented with mysterious energy. It can be absorbed through the divine energy stone and then released. The effect is not bad."
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "Is that all?" Li Hao nodded and asked.
         Although it was not bad, Li Hao felt that he had missed the key point!
         What was the key?
          Momentum!
         That's right, in a team of a thousand people, over a hundred had comprehended force. What nonsense.
         There must be something here that could help martial masters comprehend force.
         Mu Lin glanced at Li Hao, and his eyes flickered.""Brother Li, you're not satisfied?"
         "Where's the Shi?"
         Li Hao wasn't interested in beating around the bush. He directly said,""One-tenth of those who have broken through a hundred levels of perfection, are they all geniuses? He could easily comprehend force? "My teacher once said that comprehending force is the most difficult stage on the path of martial Dao. If one could easily comprehend force, martial masters wouldn't have declined. Even if the supers rise, martial masters are all C-level, why would they be afraid of supers?"
         Mu Lin nodded.
         As expected, this guy saw through the key point with a glance.
         "There are indeed treasures that can help martial masters comprehend force ... But this is a rare opportunity," he said.
         Li Hao smiled and pointed at the martial masters."A hundred people can sense force, but in fact, a few hundred people will try. How rare is this opportunity?"
        
         He didn't think so!
         Mu Lin was speechless and could only pretend not to hear it. He continued,"What do you think" impose "is?"
         Li Hao hesitated. After a while, he said,""There are many types of Shi."
         Nonsense!
         However, soon, Mu Lin didn't feel that it was nonsense.
         Li Hao continued,"based on my experience, there are three types of Shi!" The first is the eruption of one's own emotions. This kind of Shi is the most suitable for one's body. This is an understanding that comes from the bottom of one's heart, and I call it human Shi!"
         "The second way is to cultivate martial arts to the extreme. For example, when a secret skill is cultivated to the extreme, you can comprehend it step by step and figure out the path of your predecessors. For example, if I follow the five birds technique, I may be able to comprehend the five birds force. This is a force that the secret skill itself possesses. I call it martial force!"
         "The third type is very rare ... You've seen powerful warriors fight against each other. You've seen the inconceivable sword, blade, and spear. You've sensed some will and momentum left behind by our predecessors, and from there, you can imitate them and gain an epiphany that belongs to you. I call this momentum the heaven's momentum!"
         "It's hard to say which of the three is stronger, but I think the second type has the least potential. The first type has a lot of potential, but it doesn't mean it's powerful. The third type might be more powerful, but it's hard to talk about potential ..."
          This time, Mu Lin was really stunned.
         He looked at Li Hao and didn't say anything for a long time.
         After a long time, he sighed,"I thought you were just powerful, but your words made me feel that the people of the five birds sect are indeed extraordinary!" To tell the difference between the three types of Shi ... To tell the truth, even I can't distinguish them so clearly. "
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com That's right, very few people would summarize this because everyone had only comprehended one type of Shi. Why was there a need to divide it so clearly?
         However, Li Hao had given three types of Shi.
         In fact, Li Hao had experienced it before.
         The fire Tiger aura was considered human aura, a kind of explosion of one's own emotions.
         Earth sword force was something that Li Hao had comprehended and copied after seeing Liu Long's ninth-refinement force and Yuan Shuo's attack. It could be considered heaven force, but it was not as strong as the other heaven force. For example, when he saw the sword and comprehended it, the sword force superclass was more powerful!
         This was what Li Hao had mastered at the moment. As for martial force, it was also what he wanted to comprehend next. Water force. He wanted to improve the ninth-form force to the limit and then use a secret technique to figure out the force. This was martial force.
         The invincible momentum recorded in the ancient books was the momentum of a person. The outburst of one's emotions and the accumulation of momentum would make one invincible in a hundred battles. The confidence that came from the heart would make one invincible in the world.
         Li Hao was able to conclude all this not because of Yuan Shuo's teaching, but because of his own knowledge.
         Perhaps he was too young and had not seen much of the world, but there were some things that he had seen before that others had not.  He Yong had said that in Silvermoon's ancient land, every blade of grass and every tree might contain the Shi of some top experts. Since that was the case, Li Hao guessed that the Wei Wu Army might have some treasures.
         It contained the force of some ancient civilization powerhouses!
         In fact, Li Hao had seen such a thing before. Heaven battling city's heaven battling city was one of them, but it was too high-end, and the writer was too strong, so Li Hao couldn't feel anything at all.
         He did sense something from his ancestor's attack. Although there was no physical object, if someone else had seen it, they might have been able to sense something, and they might not have felt the same way as Li Hao.
         ……
         At this moment, Mu Lin's mood was still somewhat complicated.
         I'm not afraid of you being strong, but I'm afraid that you have a clear understanding of martial arts while you're strong. It's not easy to suppress such people.
         He didn't keep her in suspense any longer and said,""Previously, it wasn't easy for me to explain, but now, according to what you said ... You're right, the Wei Wu Army has some treasures that contain heavenly force! It's the marks left behind by ancient civilization powerhouses when they fought, such as sword slashes or saber slashes ... They're still there even after countless years. This kind of treasure can help everyone comprehend Shi more easily. "
         "There are also some ancient ruins with broken weapons that contain some intent. They can help us comprehend force."
         "What about the origin divine weapon?" Li Hao's eyes flickered.
          Since it was fine to break it, why didn't anyone say that he could use an origin divine weapon to comprehend force?
         Even he Yong had only said that he was going to try to sense hou Xiaochen's Shi.
         Of course, He Yong had also said that some origin God weapons that had not been unsealed might have some power left after being unsealed.
         This time, Mu Lin laughed."There are also things that you don't know. This is a good thing.""Origin God weapons are naturally left behind by experts from the ancient civilization. However, origin God weapons are usually complete. After such a long time, many of them have already lost traces of their previous owners."
         "For example, if a blade is cut in half, countless years later, we can see the blade break and think about how the blade was cut in half. However, the origin divine weapon doesn't have such a problem. What can you tell from a complete blade that looks like new?"
         It seemed right, but it was also a little wrong.
         Li Hao frowned."Doesn't that mean that origin God weapons are inferior to broken weapons?" he asked.
         "No!"
         "That's right." Mu Lin denied his statement."There are actually two types of origin God weapons. The first type is one that revives after being dormant, which is what I just said. The second type was a sealed origin divine weapon! "It's not dormant, but it's sealed and hasn't been unsealed. Once this kind of origin god weapon is unsealed, it might erupt with the will and momentum of the weapon's owner in the past ... Hmm, it's best not to comprehend it, or else you'll probably die!"
        
         "The second type of origin god weapon is also pursued by some experts. They've even tried to unseal it in order to understand the power of the ancient civilization experts that have exploded in an instant ... It's extremely rare that there aren't many sealed weapons."
         Li Hao thought of the starry sky sword, the weapons of the eight great families, and also the sword of the night patrolman, which he had given to the night patrolman in exchange for the blood God's clone of the rising light level.
         He had also pretended to be the Li family's sword and sent it up.
         "Are there many treasures in the Wei Wu Army?" Li Hao asked.
         "Not much, and there's one more problem ... It's very difficult to keep it!"
         Sighing deeply, Mu Lin continued,"furthermore, there are some treasures that you can use once. However, the will within them might dissipate after a second use. Some of them can be used three or four times ... But if you use them more than that, the effects will be lost! There are actually very, very few treasures that can maintain their effects. In the entire Wei Wu Army, there are only two or three of them ... These treasures are all personally controlled by the boss of the Golden spear. Even I am not qualified to control them. "
         Li Hao nodded.
         At this moment, he finally understood why there were so many people in the Wei Wu Army who had power.
         "So these treasures were all obtained from the ruins?"
          "Yes,"
         p Mu Lin nodded."Almost all of them are, but some aren 't. They were seized from Pirates. There are many Pirates in the North Sea, and some of them will fish for treasures in the sea. They can't be considered relics, but they have some special effects."  "Are Pirates very strong?"
         "There are strong and weak ones. The Pirates are not in one group, but many. The North Sea is divided into the central North and passes through more than ten provinces. There are dozens of small-scale islands, but there are more than ten thousand large pirate groups in the North Sea, more than half of which are supers!"
         Li Hao was shocked. So many?
         How was that possible?
         "Where do you get so many superpowers?"
         "Many supers could no longer survive in the war in the central continent. Some have enemies, some have lost their families, and some are wanted for their crimes ... The three major superpower organizations were very strict in recruiting people. They did not want the weak or the less talented ... Small and medium-sized organizations have limited abilities and can not afford to raise so many supers. This led to these people becoming bandits, either going up the mountains or the sea!"
         Li Hao frowned.
         To be a pirate ...
         "What do they rely on to survive?"
         "Robbery! There were still many caravans in the sea. In addition, once they set their eyes on a city, they would go ashore and launch a surprise attack. They had even destroyed a city before, and they came and went like the wind. Once they entered the sea, it would be difficult to capture them. Therefore, Pirates were also some of the headaches of the northern and central coastal provinces. Our Wei Wu Army is mainly in charge of cleaning up the Pirates near the moon sea, so there aren't many of them. Silver Moon isn't rich to begin with, so the great Pirates won't even think much of us. "
         "In addition, there are many mysterious energies and treasures in the sea, so there are many strong Pirates," he added.
         Li Hao nodded. He had never heard of the threat of Pirates.  It seemed like the Wei Wu Army was still very strong. They had dealt with all the Pirates that had come.
         No matter how strong the Pirates were, if they couldn't even take care of the Wei Wu Army, then all of hou Xiaochen's hard work over the years would have been in vain.
         It wasn't the entire North Sea. It was just a branch of the moon sea.
         ……
         After chatting for a while, the two of them passed through the large square and entered the living area at the back.
         There were also some ordinary people here.
         He wasn't a Martial Master, nor was he a superhuman. He was just an ordinary person who was in charge of logistics and cleaning.
         There were also cooking and washing. Martial masters were all very busy and had no time to do things. If he relied on martial masters, it probably wouldn't be long before this place was even stinky than a latrine.
         Li Hao didn't smell ... Anyway, every time his clothes got dirty, he would change them. The night patrolmen also had their own changing room with many uniforms, so he just wore them casually.
         Moreover, there were also people in charge of these things in the family building of the inspection Division.
         There were also small buildings here. They were not tall, usually about three stories.
         Mu Lin continued,"there are a total of 100 small buildings like this one. Each floor has six rooms, and each building can accommodate 18 people, up to 1800 martial masters ... Of course, the rooms are very large, nearly 100 square meters. It won't be a problem to accommodate six or eight people. If you really want to accommodate people, even 10000 people will be fine! However, they were all martial masters. Who didn't have some private space? "Besides, there aren't many people now. Even the 100 buildings aren't fully occupied."
          "Our residence is further back. Each of us has one."
         Each building took up a large area and had a small courtyard. It took up nearly 1000 square meters. 100 buildings took up 100000 square meters. In fact, including the spaces, this residential area was probably no less than 200000 square meters. It was quite a big space.
         However, it was only 300 mu of land, which was nothing.
         "There's a canteen and a shopping mall here as well. Also, if you have family members, there's a building in front. It's a hotel, and family members can come and visit ... However, only veterans who have been here for more than three years can do so. Also, the family Review is very strict. Under normal circumstances, it's not recommended for family members to come here. You can go back on your own. You'll have a month's leave every year.
         Li Hao nodded and followed them.
         When people on the road saw the forest, they would avoid it. If they couldn't avoid it, they would quickly salute. Ordinary people were no exception. This was the second-in-command here. The boss was often not around, and he was actually the boss.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Even the few Centurions, even if they did not like him and called him by his name, would have to listen to him obediently when the time came.
         ……
         After walking for a while, a small area with separated buildings appeared.
        
         Li Hao glanced around. There were about twenty to thirty small buildings, all quite far apart. Different from the small buildings in front, this one was quieter and more beautiful.
         "We're staying here!"
         Mu Lin pointed inside."Now, there are 14 people living inside. There are 16 empty buildings. You can choose any one."
         " 14 people?"
         Nine Centurions, including him and Golden Gun, only 11 people!
         Li Hao looked suspicious, while Mu Lin smiled.""Boss gold spear has an apprentice who has also stepped into the thousand warrior realm, so he has one. The captain of his personal guards is also a warrior of the thousand, so he also has one. "
         Li Hao's heart skipped a beat. There were actually two Qian fighters!
         That's right, how could the Golden Spear's personal guards not be strong?
         "What about the other one?"
         "The other one belongs to the Marquis, but the Marquis doesn't come often."
          Li Hao understood.
         He looked around and was not in a hurry to choose a house.
         "What should I do now?"
         "Prepare your team!"
         "In addition, give your team of 100 a resounding name!" Mu Lin quickly said. For example, Chen Jin, who was defeated by you with two punches, has a hundred-man team with a resounding title, the mountain-breaking Army!"
         “……”
         A hundred people, and you call it the mountain-breaking Army?
         Moreover, the successor of the mountain splitting axe had only created a mountain splitting Army. Was this considered resounding?
         Then I'll be called the five birds Army?
         What the hell!
         "I'll prepare everything myself?"
         Li Hao frowned."I don't even know 100 martial masters. They're from this place!"
         "Of course, you can't rely on yourself alone. Before boss golden spear left, he said that if Liu Long ... We thought that he was coming. If Liu Long comes, we can take 10 people from his personal guards to build a new army."
         "It's best not to transfer anyone from the other guilds. They're used to the previous training methods and partners ... Of course, if you really want to transfer someone, you can transfer a maximum of three people from each of the nine guilds. As long as they're not Centurions ... You can choose whatever you want, you can't refuse!"
         "If you use all of them, you'll have 37 people. The rest will be up to you!"
         With more than a third, he could choose the rest himself. This way, the difficulty would be much lower, and it would be easier to integrate.
         Li Hao nodded. This was fine.  "What about the welfare of the Wei Wu Army? Even if I'm going to recruit people, I should at least mention the benefits, right?"
         Mu Lin laughed."The benefits are great. Money aside, Martial Master douqian will be paid one divine power Stone a month! In addition, you can choose a treasure in three months and comprehend it for one day, which is to comprehend force ... Although Dou Qian has mastered force, it is also of great help to comprehend the same kind of force!"
         The divine energy stone!
         艹!
         How rich, this thing is worth hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of mysterious energy.
         The direct line was the direct line!
         When Li Hao and the others were in the Silver City, they only had one-thousandth of the amount of mysterious energy they had in a month. It was completely incomparable. Li Hao's eyes were red. The night patrollers were really pitiful.
         Department head Hao seemed to only have a few dozen cubic meters of mysterious energy a month, while the warrior Qian only cost one divine energy stone.
         Of course, Hao lianchuan's salary was just a salary. When he needed it, he could also use some divine power stones.
         Just one divine power Stone was enough to move Dou Qian, not to mention the opportunity to comprehend force once every three months.
         "What if I break a hundred?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "If I break through 100, early or mid-100, I'll need 10 cubic meters of attribute-less mysterious energy a month. It's the same if I break through late-100, but I can sense Shi once every half a year. If you're in the complete state of dilapidation, you'll need two months less than the later stage. You'll need to comprehend it once every four months, which is second only to the warrior's Qian, but you won't have any divine power stones. "
         Li Hao nodded.
         In that case, the greatest temptation of the Wei Wu Army was to comprehend and increase their force!
         Therefore, the treasures that still had power and will were the most precious things to the Wei Wu Army. As for the divine power stones, there were not many people in douqian. They spent more than ten a month, which meant more than a hundred a year ... These guys had explored so many ruins, so they could still afford it.
         "How do we split the rewards from exploring the ruins?"
          This was also what Li Hao was concerned about.
         Mu Lin chuckled,"I knew you would ask. It depends on the situation!" For example, finding a relic and exploring it yourself was one of the ways! The ruins provided by the higher-ups were another way for one to explore. When snatching remains, the enemy will discover it first. If you snatch it, it's another kind of thing. "
         "The rule set by the Marquis tribe was that if the higher-ups provide the ruins, then we will split it 50 - 50! If you discover it and explore it yourself, then we'll split it 30 - 70. You get 70%, and you get 30%. If they were taken from the enemy, you can take them all!"
         Li Hao raised his eyebrows."You discovered it yourself. The higher-ups still want 30%?"
         If the higher-ups provided it, they would split it equally. He had no objections to this. If he snatched it from the enemy, he would have to risk his life. It was normal for him to take it all.
         However, he discovered that he had to get 30% of the profits ...
         Mu Lin explained,"brother, to put it bluntly, many people here have the current strength because of the support of the Marquis. If you don't have the strength, can you get so many benefits?" Besides, the higher-ups also need money to pay us our salaries. We're all counting on the hou department's stipents...Can he still subsidize us until now? After all, the Wei Wu Army has the word 'Army' in it. Sometimes, if you are too independent, you can't form an Army!"
         Li Hao thought for a while, nodded, and didn't say anything.
         Perhaps!
         The main reason was that he had never experienced this before. The last time he explored the ruins with Hao lianchuan and the others, he had taken everything by himself, so he did not have much awareness of this.
        
         When he was in the demon hunting squad, Liu Long had been the one to assign them.
         "Right, the division plan I'm talking about is for the higher-ups and US leaders ... You get it, so it's up to you whether you want to share it with the brothers under you. If they contribute, you get a share ... It's fine if you don 't, but if they quit after a long time, don't blame them. If they go to another team, it's because of your incompetence!"
         Li Hao nodded and said,"understood!" This means that the Wei Wu Army can still poach people?"
         "Of course you can!"
         Mu Lin chuckled."However, under normal circumstances, this would not happen. The few Centurions still know their limits. In fact, the Wei Wu Army is a private army. Your brothers are your men. This was also what the royal family used to do. In fact, there are many disadvantages. However, it is not appropriate for you to limit too many supers and martial masters. The Marquis is willing to give everyone the greatest freedom!"
         "However, remember one thing. In the Wei Wu Army, there is only one rule that you must follow!"
         "That is, when the Marquis's order is given, no matter how dangerous it is, just do one thing ... Carry out the order! If you refuse to execute it, you will die!"
         Li Hao raised his eyebrows and nodded.
         This is more like it!
         Otherwise, it would be too comfortable for a Martial Master to be so relaxed and take benefits upon entering.
          Hou Xiaochen was clearly someone who only cared about the results and not the process.
         As long as everyone was willing to be obedient in the end, he did not care what happened in the middle.
         After discussing the benefits, the location, and the situation, Li Hao finally asked,""Then, how often do we go on missions?"
         "Not much, usually once a month or less, once every three months is normal. After all, ruins aren't everywhere, and Pirates don't appear every day."
         "Understood!"
         Li Hao heaved a sigh of relief."The pay is not bad, the mission is decent, and the share is acceptable. I'll take this job then!"
         "Under normal circumstances, no one would refuse!" Mu Lin laughed.
         After saying that, he continued mysteriously,"there's another benefit. Although it doesn't look very eye-catching, it's still very good. There's a library here. It was built by the Marquis tribe. There are many secret techniques and secret books inside, including breathing techniques! This was left behind by the Heavenly Star guards when they swept away the scum of the martial arts world. When martial arts were banned, the Heavenly Star guards wiped out many sects with a bad reputation. Also, there are some ancient books ... Your teacher dug up many of them when he was digging up graves, but he destroyed many of them. The Marquis tribe did leave behind some, some of which your teacher obtained when he helped dig up ruins, and some of which we collected ourselves. "
         Li Hao's eyes flickered. This was not bad.
         Although it felt worthless, knowledge was priceless!
         "Alright, brother Li, you can go and choose a house later and move in if you need to. There's nothing good in the South City. This place is quiet and suitable for practicing martial arts!"
         "If you have any acquaintances, just poach them ... Don't you know Liu Long? Douqian, if he came, he would definitely improve. Actually, I wanted him to be the captain of my personal guards ... I even asked my brother to pass on a message, but he didn't come. "
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com So mu Sen had been so mysterious the last time, in order to make Liu Long the captain of his personal guards.  Li Hao was also speechless!
         "Since Captain Liu is here, can't he be the centurion?"
         Li Hao asked. Mu Lin shook his head."If you don't want to, he can! If you become one, he can 't. They did not have that many people. It was still okay to have 100 more people, but the Wei Wu Army could not afford to have 200 more people. The Wei Wu Army only has a thousand men after all these years. This is where the problem lies, the consumption is too great!"
         "If you think it's inappropriate, you can be the Deputy and he can be the chiliarch ... No one will stop you!"
         Li Hao curled his lips. I'm not doing that.
         As the boss, he could get more money.
         As for the captain, he would have to ask him later.
         Finally, Mu Lin said,"by the way, don't forget to get a special communication device later. It can cover a range of 1000 miles and can contact anyone. There is also a positioning device. I can find you at any time!" Under normal circumstances, they won't look for you, but once something happens and they can't find you or you're in danger, they can quickly lock onto your position and inform you in advance so that they don't think they're monitoring you. "
         Li Hao nodded. He felt pretty good.
         As for his location being disclosed ... He was now a living person with countless people watching him. What did it matter if his location was exposed?
         Then, should I recruit soldiers and buy horses next?
         After recruiting people, he went to do big things?
          What big thing? of course, it was to kill Hong Yue's people and take the red shadow ...
         Of course, this was just a side effect.
         Li Hao also had his own plans. If he could bring some people with him and gain some benefits from the Wei Wu Army, he might be able to explore some ruins after becoming stronger. He had gained a lot from the heaven battling city incident.
         ……
         Next, Li Hao went to the neighborhood at the back and chose a small detached building by the side. Behind the building was a plantation. After passing through the plantation, he reached the coastline. It was close to the beach, which was suitable for Li Hao to see the sea.
         Li Hao wasn't very interested in the house, since it wasn't his own name.
         It didn't matter where he stayed.
         He had a big house in Silver City, but it wasn't under his name. If he didn't go back for a long time, it might be someone else's house.
         The only thing that truly belonged to him was that old house.
         However, it was now considered a dangerous building. It had been sealed off and was said to be waiting for demolition ... Li Hao rejected it anyway. There was only one house left. If it was demolished, he would have nothing left.
