Tian Fang recovered.A large number of venerable sovereigns began to gather in the sky. Seventh-level, eighth-level, and even a portion of sixth-level venerable sovereigns were tempted to get a share of the loot.The weaker ones ... Had almost no chance. The level-six ones would at least dare to take a risk. Even if they couldn't seize the great Dao universe, it was fine to become level-seven. If the level-five came, they really wouldn't have a chance.In an instant, the experts of the three regions all gathered in the sky.One could enter the tianfang universe with a great Dao star.If there were no stars of the great path, he could only take advantage of the fact that other people had entered and see if he could take them with him ... Otherwise, it would be very difficult to enter.As for coming out, it was simple.With the great path star in his hand, he could still enter and exit as he wished now that the stars and the universe had recovered.Of course ... If the stars of the great path were extinguished, and the universe recovered and disappeared ... Then the universe that had recovered its deathly stillness might be trapped inside. If the experts worked together, they could still break out.This was the same as last time.However, since it had already begun to recover ... How could it extinguish the stars?The experts arrived one by one.However, at this moment, everyone was still hesitating, considering whether to enter or not ... They were afraid that the great Dao would be restored, and the first person to enter would be attacked by the others.At this moment, the cloud Master arrived.Outside the tianfang world.The Lord of the clouds looked at Tian Fang and pondered for a moment. Should he enter?It seemed like it had really recovered.The stars of the great path in his hands were all flashing with radiance, corresponding to each other from afar. It was as if he could start the tianfang universe at any time.Last time, he and red Moon had only gotten one star.It was mainly because Li Hao refused to give it to him.Should he enter now and abandon Hong Yue?But ... But the Dragon Master was strong, and the heaven's side had opened. Perhaps ... Neo martial and even Supreme Emperor Chi Yang would put aside their battles and come here. At that time, he would not be a top existence among the level eights.Furthermore, after entering tianfang universe, the power of his own great Dao universe would also be suppressed. He would not even be able to leave through the great Dao universe and would be isolated within. Otherwise, Red Moon master would not have been so miserable the last time.Thoughts kept appearing in his mind.He also thought about how venerable sovereign Chi Yang seemed to have colluded with some foreign powerhouses recently. On neo martial's side, Emperor Cang and the human King were both peak seventh level, and the Dragon Lord was strong ...As this thought emerged, the cloud Master hesitated. Originally, he was prepared to abandon the red moon Emperor.However, if he were to abandon him now, they would become enemies. The other party might be able to enter with the other seventh rank venerable sovereigns, but if they entered together, ordinary seventh rank venerable sovereigns would most likely not offend him.After all, they had yet to determine who the master of tianfang universe was.After thinking about it for a while, someone arrived. It was red Moon master. He hurried and considered many things. He felt that Yun Xiao might have already entered.In the end ... The other party was still there, which surprised Red Moon.Cloud Master quickly said,"brother Red Moon, I'm sorry. I was in a hurry to get here. I had to check the situation and determine if it was true. I didn't have time to bring you along." After all, the Silver Moon King and the sword Saint created the illusion that Tian Fang has recovered. I'm worried that they'll repeat the same trick ..."He explained,"I didn't abandon you on purpose. I just came to see what's going on."Red Moon sovereign quickly understood what he was thinking.If he had a great path universe, he would be stronger than Yunxiao among level eight. Now, they were on par, so it could be imagined that this guy wasn't too strong. When Wushan left, he almost dropped to level eight!Clearly, cloudsky did not have the confidence to deal with the others.Of course, he was the same.Red Moon sovereign quickly judged the situation and smiled."I understand. It's better for brother Yunxiao to be more cautious. The last time was a fake recovery. If it's also a fake this time, then we'll have a chance to shine ..."After saying that, he looked at Tian Fang. At this moment, he was sure that this time it was real!There was no other reason!At this moment, even though the universe of the great path had not appeared yet, the stars were shining brightly as if they were going to penetrate the universe of the great path. The entire tianfang was shaking at this moment, and the power of the great path was constantly emerging.Some of them were faintly discernible, but they truly existed.  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  There were even some vague shadows that appeared in the entire Outlander domain. Last time, these shadows had disappeared, and some of the Taoist connotation had been destroyed. But now, there were signs of them appearing again.This should really be a recovery, right?There were more and more seventh level venerable sovereigns in the surroundings. Almost all of them were rushing over using the universe-engulfing technique. They arrived one by one and looked at the two eighth level venerable sovereigns with a grave expression.Some people wanted to enter in advance, but soon, cloudsky's voice resounded through the world,""Everyone ... The recovery of tianfang hasn't completely begun ... Furthermore, some people haven't arrived yet. Rashly entering ... Might not be a good thing." What did that mean?Someone was hiding in the dark. At this moment, he said in a deep voice,""Supreme Emperor cloud heaven wants to stop us from entering the great Dao universe?""No!"Supreme Emperor cloud heaven pondered for a while before saying,"neo martial is domineering. I'm worried that once everyone enters tianfang universe, the sudden appearance of neo martial will destroy One World after another. The destruction of a great world will bring disaster to the chaos! This time, if the human king and emperor Cang don't come ... We ... Still have to besiege and kill neo martial first!"He wasn't using this as a pretext to make a fuss, but he was truly worried.

Chapter 3261 The Silence Before The Storm (3)
He, Yunxiao, only had two rank-7s to keep watch at the moment. He was very worried that they had all gone in. If they did not come out in a short time and the neo martial artists suddenly came from the chiyang region, what would he do?Two seventh-grade martial artists wanted to resist the neo martial artists?The others were fine, but this group of people from new martial arts were simply locusts!He was really a little uneasy. He was afraid that he would follow in Hong Yue's footsteps. Last time, it was like this, causing Hong Yue to suffer a big loss. This time, the people from new martial arts did not come ... He thought that maybe he could take this opportunity to get rid of new martial arts!This was because everyone was worried about this!He continued,"everyone, it's not the first time that neo martial arts have destroyed a great world. The red moon region has destroyed so many great worlds. It was all done by the neo martial arts!" "The four-sided domain used to be very peaceful ... But now, we can't abandon our home just because tianfang has recovered. After all, there's only one winner in tianfang. Who can guarantee that it'll be you? If that's the case ..."Rank seven venerable sovereigns appeared one after another, and some of them nodded.Indeed, everyone was very worried.In fact, cloudsky was still fine. There were at least two level Seven venerable sovereigns keeping watch. Some worlds only had one level Seven venerable sovereign here. If they entered and encountered a neo martial world ... They would just directly send themselves to death!Everyone was also lost in thought. Should they join forces to destroy neo martial first?Just as he was thinking, the Dragon Lord came.At this moment, the Dragon Lord was also looking at Tian Fang in the distance. After observing for a while, he fell into deep thought. It seemed like he had really awakened.Looking at the commotion ... It didn't seem to be fake.It was just that ... The timing of recovery was too coincidental.As he was thinking about this, the radiance Thearch appeared and moved away from them. His eyes were cold and he didn't say a word. He glanced at the crowd and fell into deep thought. If these people didn't go in ... He couldn't go in!Cloudsky was worried that his old lair would be destroyed by neo martial. He was also worried that the world of light would be destroyed after he left.Unless all the grade 8 powerhouses entered!After a while, heaven and earth fluctuated, and the power of the great path of the universe fluctuated. A man appeared, and behind him were several experts with mysterious auras. Everyone was stunned. It was venerable sovereign Chi Yang!This guy actually ran here, how bold!Wasn't he afraid that the world would be destroyed by neo martial artists if he came here?Of course, if a battle did not break out now, and no one was holding him back, he could return at any time."Chi Yang, where's neo martial?"The Lord of the clouds hurriedly asked. Venerable sovereign Chi Yang's eyes were a little cold as he glanced at the crowd. He had been asking for help from these guys, and in the end ... Good Lord, they had been fighting against light until now. What was the result?No results!Today, these guys had actually come here together, and the light Thearch was standing there perfectly fine!Bastard!He was furious, but he suppressed his dissatisfaction and said in a low voice,""I'm not sure ... Neo martial appears and disappears unpredictably. Without the Dragon Master to track him, and I don't dare to leave chiyang rashly, how can I track him?" He looked at the Dragon Lord and was a little more polite.""I'm afraid it's difficult to destroy new martial without the help of the Dragon Master! "We don't dare to leave the world rashly. Only the Dragon Master can bring the world along and keep tracking. Only by giving us a location can we lock onto new martial and completely annihilate the other party!"The Dragon Master also said seriously at this moment,"I also hope to see peace in the four regions. If the new martial arts world coexists peacefully, the three regions will be the territory of the human race. I will not get involved!" But now, in such a short time, neo martial has destroyed many great worlds and disrupted the order of the entire four-sided zone ... Neo martial will be destroyed!"Everyone nodded and did not say anything else.If you, the Dragon Lord, wanted to interfere in the affairs of the three major regions during peaceful times, no one would agree to it. It was not your turn as a Chaos Beast to participate.But now ... Only the Dragon Lord controlling the world could track and lock onto them.As for the others, the grade-8 ones did not dare to chase after them for fear that their nests would be destroyed.If a Grade 7 caught up, it would be suicide.This was the key to why everyone had been unable to lock onto neo martial!The master of Scarlet sun was still thinking, and many people looked behind him. Some of them wanted to ask a few questions, but before they could, a figure suddenly flashed and entered the tianfang world!In the next moment, a cat swallowed and swallowed the power of the world. The origin of the great Dao appeared, and a star appeared. In the blink of an eye, the heaven and earth split open!In the blink of an eye, the human King dragged his blade and entered, with Emperor Cang following closely behind.  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  The human King turned his head and looked over. He chuckled and waved at everyone."Goodbye, everyone. This universe belongs to your master Fang!"The great Dao universe was instantly sealed.The human king and emperor Cang disappeared before their eyes!“……”Everyone was stunned. They looked at the level eight venerable sovereigns and frowned slightly. They were a little solemn, but soon they relaxed.At that moment, both Cloud Master and venerable red sun seemed to be relieved.He seemed to be ... Smiling.Everyone looked at each other and had a tacit understanding. After entering, they would kill him first!In addition, this fellow had entered ... That was much more reassuring.Emperor Cang, the human King, and even the neo martial world were all brought in by the other party.It was just that ... At this moment, the Dragon Master muttered to himself for a moment before transmitting his voice,""I don't see the new martial Supreme, sword venerable, and the others. Are they in this world or ... Outside?""They must have gone in together. The human King isn't stupid. He knew that we would join forces with them. If it was only him and Emperor Cang, they would have died. Only by bringing a few seventh rank venerable sovereigns would they have a chance of fighting ..."The cloud Master felt that was there a need to ask? He was definitely in the world.Otherwise, when the two of them joined forces, they would only have the strength of an eighth rank venerable sovereign. But now, there was more than one eighth rank venerable sovereign who wanted to kill the killer king.

Chapter 3262 The Silence Before The Storm (3)
The Dragon Lord thought about it and felt that this was the case.However ... He still had to be cautious.If the Supreme martial artist and the others were outside ... Of course, it didn't seem to be related to him. Even if they were outside, could they go to the Dragon field?On the other hand, his Dragon World ..."I'll bring Dragon World into it," he said after some consideration."It'll be in case he can use the power of the world in the universe and gain the advantage of being native!"Although there would be conflicts in the great Dao universe ...However, when the world entered the great Dao universe, it would not cause too much conflict. At that time, the other party would have the power of the local forces and would be very difficult to deal with.  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  The key was ... There were still seven seventh rank venerable sovereigns in the dragon world!This was something that no one had expected!It was also the Dragon Lord's greatest source of confidence!Everyone thought that there were only three rank seven dragons on his side, but in reality, there were seven. There were four more rank seven chaos beasts, and at a critical moment, they could even kill a rank eight venerable sovereign!After entering the Dao universe, these guys had lost their advantage of being native. Four seventh-level chaos beasts would have no problem dealing with an eighth-level Chaos Beast who was not at the peak.Even if the Autarchs didn't enter ... It had nothing to do with him, and he couldn't do anything to the dragon world.There were still 11 Chaos Beast worlds in the Dragon field, which were difficult to deal with.,m No one said anything else. At that moment, the Scarlet Flame Master no longer paid any attention to them. Stars appeared instantly, and in the blink of an eye, he opened a universe passage and entered it. Behind him, three great beings followed.The Dragon Lord swept his eyes over them ... And his heart stirred.He was not a venerable sovereign of the Crimson sun World!They were outsiders, and both of them were at the seventh-rank, but one of them ... Was probably at the eighth-rank!No wonder Chi Yang was so at ease.In his crimson sun World, other than him, there were still four rank seven venerable sovereigns waiting in their base. He was not sure if there were other foreign venerable sovereigns, so he was naturally not worried. Today's neo martial still had sword venerable, Supreme, catacombs King, and sun god, four rank seven venerable sovereigns. However, without Emperor Cang, these people had lost the advantage of being native. Without enough motivation, it was almost impossible for them to attack crimson sun by force.At this moment, Red Moon sovereign could not help but say,""Everyone, there's no need to be so vigilant. The recovering great Dao universe has great Dao stars and can be entered and exited at will. The problem now is ... There seems to be a limited number of Level Seven and level eight great Dao stars ... Who can lend me one?"These guys were too vigilant.Although he was the negative example!However, this time, it wasn't like he couldn't come out after entering.Those who held the stars of the great path could enter and exit freely.If he had a star of the great path, he would have gone in a long time ago. He had nothing to worry about, anyway. At this moment, he was a little upset. Last time, Li Hao gave Yunxiao the star of the great path instead of him. This time, Li Hao was making the decision for Yunxiao!The Dragon Lord smiled and said,"caution is the parent of safety!" What he was afraid of was not being able to come out. Wouldn't that be dangerous? It's necessary for everyone to be on guard ..." This time, the recovery was a little too fast, and he was still not too at ease.He was also prepared not to come out.Even if he and the seven rank seven venerable sovereigns could not come out, he would still be the strongest among them.Considering this, he opened his mouth and said,"since the two from neo martial arts have entered in advance, we can't wait any longer. Everyone ... Then I ... Will go first?"With that, the stars of the great path appeared in his hand, and a crack appeared in the sky and earth.This time, the Dragon Lord didn't let the three tier 7 experts carry the world. Instead, he instantly turned into a huge Dragon. Opening its huge mouth, in an instant, it swallowed the huge world. When everyone looked over, their hearts froze!This was a Chaos Beast!Forget about devouring a level 8 world, if they really entered their stomachs, they would directly explode!One thing was that his body wasn't strong enough. The key was that when the Chaos Beast devoured the world, the world wasn't in his body but in a relatively independent space. Or rather, it was a special space created by the Dao of chaos.Humans, on the other hand, were different. They came from within the world.After the Dragon Lord swallowed the world, he brought along three seventh level venerable sovereigns and smiled at everyone.""Then I'll ... Take my leave first!"He instantly disappeared from the world, bringing the world into it.Now that a level eight venerable sovereign had entered, the other Level Seven venerable sovereigns couldn't hold back any longer. In an instant, cracks appeared in all directions, and in the blink of an eye, venerable sovereigns entered one after another.Red Moon master looked at cloudsky, and cloudsky master looked at light. He smiled and said,""Light ... Together?"The radiance Thearch looked at him coldly and indifferently."Are you worried that I'll deal with your cloud world after you leave?""Hahaha, how could that be ..."Supreme Emperor Yunxiao laughed. Yes, that was it!Even if you don't go in, I'll force you in.The radiance Thearch sneered and stepped into the great Dao universe. Soon, he tore the great Dao universe apart and reappeared. He laughed and said,"He can enter and exit. You guys ... You're really worried!"It's not like you can't enter or exit.After he finished speaking, he disappeared instantly. He was just testing it out. He was worried that he wouldn't be able to come out if he went in. Fortunately, he could come out. This made him feel much more at ease.Upon seeing this, Supreme Emperor cloud heaven opened the great Dao universe and said with a smile,""Brother Hongyue, let's go together!"Red Moon cursed!What a coward, insisting on waiting until the end.He didn't bother to say anything more. When the other party opened up tianfang universe, he instantly entered it. Cloud Master followed closely behind and quickly entered.

Chapter 3263 The Silence Before The Storm (3)
For a moment, the entire tianfang fell silent.Soon, another group of seventh rank venerable sovereigns arrived. They held stars in their hands and entered the palace one after another.The Dao Lords of many major worlds in the four-sided domain had left.If someone was in the mood to look for it at this moment, they might be able to find many large worlds without a level 7.From time to time, some venerable sovereigns tried to come out ... But they were all unimpeded. Now, they had no more worries. Since they could come out at any time, what was there to worry about?……In the depths of tianfang universe.The Dao chess was slumbering near a star. At that moment, the Dao chess's weapon spirit shook its head slightly and looked around. The tianfang universe could only last for one more day at most. After one day, it would instantly fall into silence.At that time ... He would not be able to enter or exit!The neo martial human King was really generous!Compared to him, Li Hao was much less generous. Of course, Li Hao wasn't strong enough. This new martial human King reversed yin and yang and forcibly revived the entire universe. It seemed that he had a big goal!Otherwise, the price to pay would not be small. Putting aside the fact that Emperor Cang was injured, reversing yin and yang required a lot of great DAOs 'power. It was even comparable to a tier 7 world. This time, the human King would definitely be greatly injured!"What is he trying to do by luring so many powerhouses into it?"Dao Qi thought to himself, but he didn't dare to show his face.He was afraid of being killed by the human King. The human King might know that he was among them. After all, the sword Master and the others knew about it last time. The human King reversed yin and yang ... It could be said that in the entire square region, besides neo martial, he might be the only one who knew about it!If he were to say it out at this moment, not only would the human King's efforts be in vain, he would suffer heavy losses and might even be besieged and killed ... It was no wonder that Dao Qi was worried that he would be killed to silence him."There's a high chance that venerable the sword and the others didn't come ... Could it be that they're trying to lure these experts in, then seal the universe and ambush Chi Yang?"Many thoughts appeared in his mind. Dao Qi didn't think about it anymore. It had nothing to do with him. At this moment, he just needed to find a place and hide.……On the other side.The human King's face turned slightly pale, he had indeed suffered a huge loss. The human King rubbed Emperor Cang's head, his eyes were cold as he transmitted a message,""The forces left behind in the Crimson sun World aren't weak. There are at least four seventh rank venerable sovereigns, or even more ... There are also some powerful outsiders among them. It'll be difficult to take down the Crimson sun World, but Yunxiao ... He'll definitely succeed!"Even without the world's support, old Zhang and the rest would have no problem taking down Yunxiao.They only had two tier 7 experts!After breaking through the clouds, everything else aside, on the side of neo martial arts, the king of earth, heavenly suppression King, and old Wang all had hopes of entering Level Seven. Now, they were only lacking some great Dao power. Soon, a large number of Level Seven venerable sovereigns would be born in neo martial arts!After that, he would have a chance to attack Chi Yang. This time, I'm going to play big.The human King thought to himself. With so many powerful beings entering, once the universe was destroyed, some of these guys would definitely want to leave. They might even join forces to break open the universe. At that time, he would be in the most danger because he had to stop these people from leaving!At the moment, he was safe. Everyone was looking for the daosource refinement technique, so they wouldn't bother with him!"One day, bigcat. We only have one day to recover ... After one day, these guys will most likely join forces and leave ... We ... Hold them back!"The grey cat wagged its tail, its chubby face full of leisure, "Don't be afraid of them! I'm not good at fighting ... But I can take you away ..."The human King laughed. Run, my ass!"Let's go. We'll find a place to recover first. One day later ... No one is allowed to enter or leave. Whether we can make it or not depends on this!"If he succeeded in this mission, he would most likely be able to take down cloudsky.Chi Yang's words had a high chance of success."Also, outside the Thunder region ... If old Zhang and the others go out and find those foreign worlds, they can also break through them. That would be a huge profit. If my new martial arts can really be successful without limit, perhaps we can produce more seventh level venerable sovereigns at once!At this moment, the human King was smiling happily as he thought about it. As for danger ... What did it matter? He had never been afraid of danger. As long as the harvest was big enough to match his efforts, it was fine!  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  He then thought of Silver moon's little fellow ... And shook his head. It was a pity that he had run off to the Dragon field. Not a single tier 7 from the Dragon field had come this time, save for the few that the Dragon Lord had brought along.He had thought that a rank seven from the Dragon field would come.Now, it seemed that the Dragon field had no chance. If that guy was smart, he would hurry back to the three regions and find some hidden rank Seven Worlds. Maybe he could make a fortune. However, the chaos was huge, so he must have hidden them well. Other than the rank eight worlds, which were hard to move, the rank seven masters probably had their worlds hidden well.A thought emerged in his mind,'I don't care anymore!'After all, the little fellow from Silver Moon was still too weak!If he was at the seventh rank, he could ask the other party to join him and eat a big piece of meat together. However, he was only at the fifth rank. Even if he could fight against a seventh-rank, it would not be possible. There was almost no chance here.……Dragon World region.Li Hao's team had cleared another batch of worlds and killed a large number of venerable sovereigns. The worlds before them had accumulated a lot.Li Hao didn't allow these worlds to drift freely, either.Silvermoon did not have enough venerable sovereigns.He began to refine some worlds. This time, he would not share the worlds. This time, he needed to advance to the sixth step. After reaching the sixth step, he would have more opportunities.

Chapter 3264 The Silence Before The Storm (3)_5
In his long river, small worlds were quickly filled up.Some medium-level worlds could fill up several small worlds.Li Hao's long river of Dao surged crazily.The amount of Primal Chaos energy the Queen was giving birth to was also increasing. In the past few days, the Queen had been absorbing large amounts of human faith. At this moment, she even showed signs of reaching the 4th rank.As the number of kills increased, Lin Hongyu's undead guards had nearly 20 venerable sovereigns, but most of them were low-level venerable sovereigns.Lin Hongyu, on the other hand, seemed to have a chance of reaching level four.This made Li Hao slightly anxious.When he was at the fifth rank, these people had just become venerable sovereigns. He was still at the fifth rank, but the others were almost at the fourth rank. Even if their strength could not be compared to the past, he had been stuck at the fifth rank for too long!It had been three to four months since he broke through the four large fields and entered level five.As for himself, he had many opportunities during this period of time. Not only had he destroyed Tian Fang, but he had also gained quite a lot of benefits even though it was mainly because of Kong Ji. He had also devoured so many worlds, but he had yet to reach level six!This made Li Hao very anxious!The long river trembled slightly.The number of little worlds had been filled up to 800. Li Hao was overjoyed. He was getting closer and closer to the 1000 he estimated!At this moment, Li Hao's River rippled."Heibao, what's wrong?" he suddenly frowned and asked.At this moment, the Black Panther was actually contacting him through the river of time. The Black Panther, who had been unwilling to speak, was actually sending a wave of spirit and consciousness!"This is bad ... Feng Yan from the fire Phoenix is heading toward you with many venerable sovereigns! Not only that, it was said that the fire Phoenix realm had even received some news that a seventh-rank had returned from the Dragon Realm ... It might also be for the Earth Dragon Realm! I'm very close to them now, and Feng Yan's speed isn't fast. The external Affair venerable sovereign of the fire Phoenix realm came in advance and contacted me, telling me to wait for them to arrive and meet them ..."“……”Li Hao was shocked!At this moment, he quickly frowned and put the matter aside. He smiled and said,""You actually sent a message!"“……”Black Panther was speechless.It was anxious.He was so anxious that he couldn't think too much about it. Afraid that Li Hao wouldn't be able to understand the dog's barking, he could only send a message through mental waves. Li Hao actually didn't care about such a big matter, but this.So annoying!Li Hao soon smiled."It's a pity. You can only send messages telepathically. You still can't talk, right?""Yes, yes!"The Black Panther quickly passed through the long river and used its spiritual force. Yes, I can't speak yet, I can only use my spiritual force!Li Hao laughed again.This guy ... Forget it, I'll just take it as real."It's fine. You meet up with Feng Yan and the others! We don't have to worry about Feng Yan and the others ... But we can't kill them in advance. Otherwise, the fire Phoenix realm will sense it and we can't touch the venerable sovereigns of the macro worlds easily!""As for the level Seven in the dragon world ... Even if they rush back immediately without using the great Dao universe, they will need some time ..." At this moment, Li Hao slightly frowned.Rank 7 venerable sovereign!Did he come back for the Earth Dragon World?If he had entered level six, he wouldn't have been worried, but ... He couldn't kill this Dragon Realm venerable Emperor. If he did, the great path universe would sense it. This was the real trouble for venerable emperors of great worlds.Furthermore, if the other party was killed here, the Dragon Master could even directly descend through the great Dao universe!This was a bigger problem!Under normal circumstances, the universe wouldn't cover such a large area. However, with a level 7 being here, the radiation range of the universe would be madly expanded.This was what Li Hao was worried about!If a seventh rank venerable sovereign of the dragon clan really came, he really couldn't be killed so easily ... Unless he had the confidence to escape the Dragon Lord's pursuit after killing him.  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  Li Hao frowned.How troublesome!Why didn't the Dragon Master go and fight the neo martial artists? why did he let the seventh rank venerable sovereign return?What a headache!At this moment, Li Hao had yet to receive any news from Tian Fang. Otherwise, he would have been at ease. Tian Fang was recovering ... And now at that. He knew Tian Fang all too well. It definitely wouldn't be so fast.There was definitely a problem!Moreover ... It was very likely to be related to neo martial, so he didn't have to worry about anything. Unfortunately, Li Hao still couldn't receive the news from Tian Fang.Therefore, he was not afraid of the return of a tier 7 Dragon. What he was afraid of was that the other party's arrival would draw the Dragon Lord back!"Ah ..."He sighed and stopped thinking about it. He would act according to the situation. At this moment, he couldn't give up, and he wouldn't give up. At most, he would escape after entering the sixth step.It was such a pity!If the dragon clan's experts did not return, he would definitely not be satisfied."Hateful!"Li Hao cursed in a low voice. He didn't care about it anymore and began to cultivate in peace. He didn't care if there were other worlds gathering. The worlds that were coming were not too strong. Kong Ji's presence was enough to deal with them.What he needed to do was to quickly advance to the sixth step!As long as he entered the sixth step, he was confident that he could fight a true powerhouse of the seventh step and not a fake one!"I have to hurry ..."At this moment, Li Hao gritted his teeth and quickly sent a message: "How many humans have you recruited to help the Queen break through to the 4th rank? The power of faith and the Dao of chaos ... Was it all in vain? So slow?" ……In the Earth Dragon World.The Queen had also heard the message and immediately came from the river of time. Nowadays, almost everyone in the Silver Moon Emperor class carried this to facilitate communication.

Chapter 3265 The Silence Before The Storm (3)_6
He was speechless!No matter how fast he was, he still needed some time to digest it.Before, he had complained that he had given him too much Primal Chaos energy, afraid that he would be stuffed to death. Now, he complained that he was too slow. What a fickle guy.Were all men like this?'You're just thinking about one thing, and you're so unsatisfied. You're already absorbing the chaotic energy very quickly, but you're actually complaining that it's too slow?"Fourth rank ..."The Queen mumbled. At this moment, her God Kingdom had already expanded to its limit, but...No matter how fast it was, the birth of the power of faith still needed time.Also, his physical body was not strong enough. He could not hold on much longer.He didn't even have time to properly condense it!All he could think about was leveling up.Although she was now at the peak of stage three, the Queen knew that ... She was too weak. Other than advancing quickly, she was practically useless. Of course, she had another advantage, which was that she could devour other people's chaos Dao.That was all!She had wanted to stay for a while, forge her body, and refine her great Dao, but ... This guy was urging her again!Also, that guy really could eat.In the past few days, she had eaten dozens of worlds. Including the previous ones, she had seen Li Hao eat nearly a hundred worlds!In the end, he still hadn't entered the sixth step!And all day long, you talk about eating more of this and that. Who can eat more than you?After complaining in her heart, she sensed the power of faith that she had gathered. She had been suppressing it and hadn't absorbed it before. At this moment, she felt helpless after hearing Li Hao's words.In fact, she really didn't want to enter the fourth step so quickly. If she did ... She would still be in some danger.Now, she was about to become a real energy provider. Apart from the path of faith, her other great DAOs had not improved at all. If this went on, without Li Hao and the others, she might be defeated by any rank four venerable sovereign in the chaos.Back then, she wasn't weak among those of the same rank.The Queen did not stay any longer.A large amount of power of faith rapidly surged into her body. A wave of holy power fluctuated and spread in all directions. She could vaguely see hundreds of millions of people praying for her!They prayed that their God could be strong forever!The Queen, on the other hand, had transformed into a moon and illuminated the surroundings. It was not necessary, but ... The human body was somewhat unable to withstand this explosive power. The only way was to transform into a moon. The moon was her Dao source.A wave of Grade 4 strength slowly spread out.……Lin Hongyu, who was still building her own hell of death, frowned and looked over.It wasn't that he was jealous that the Queen had caught up to him and advanced to the 4th rank.It was just ... He frowned a little. The level four was too superficial. The power of the level four was much weaker than that of celestial pole, King Huai, and even venerable Emperor Xun RUO, who had come to seek refuge with him.Although Silvermoon's venerable sovereigns advanced quickly, they were generally not weak among those of the same rank.They had come into contact with the great Dao universe a long time ago and had been purifying their great DAOs all this time. Their comprehension of Dao wasn't bad. Li Hao had dismantled many great DAOs for them to comprehend. Therefore, although everyone was making rapid progress, they were able to keep up with the improvement of their realms. On the Queen's side ... That Tier 4 power gave people the feeling that ... It would shatter with a single touch!He was too weak!In fact, he might not even be as powerful as he was now.One must know that there was a huge difference between a fourth level venerable sovereign and a third level venerable sovereign."Lingyue, he's just saying that. Is it necessary for you to suck up to him like this?"Lin Hongyu transmitted her voice to him coldly,""He often grumbled like this, but he never said that he would definitely let you advance immediately!""It's none of your business!"The Queen couldn't be bothered with her. She was happy to do so, what could you do about it?"I'm a rank four venerable sovereign now," he replied."You're a rank three venerable sovereign. Be more polite!""You ... You don't know what's good for you!""Heh, you're a good person?""Lingyue, do you think that you can beat me just because you're rank four?""Old grandaunt, shut up!"“……”The two of them instantly became daggers drawn!Lin Hongyu was a little annoyed. This woman ... She really wanted to kill her with a knife!The others did not participate, but they were a little solemn. The Queen had advanced to Tier 4 so quickly. It was too fast, but so fast ... They had to be careful of explosions!Although the Silver Moon Martial Master had no relationship with the Queen, she was still a Silver Moon Martial Master.However, they still needed the Queen's help to gather hundreds of millions of humans.Otherwise, not to mention a rank six world, even a rank eight world might not be able to hold so many people.Please don't let it explode!……Li Hao instantly felt the surging chaotic force surge madly.He raised his brows slightly. I was just saying, but this guy advanced really quickly!However, this was too fast ... From half-step sovereign to fourth stage venerable sovereign, the Queen had spent three months. This speed ... It might scare people to death, but it might not be a good thing. The stronger and more superficial the opponent was, the faster he would die."I was just saying ..."  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  He had not completely stabilized his realm, yet he had forcefully stepped into 4th rank. The power of faith was very unstable, and if he couldn't completely stabilize his God Country or his body, he would explode sooner or later!Li Hao felt a little regretful. Why did he have to say something? but now that things had come to this, Li Hao didn't say anything. The Queen could not advance any further.She had to suppress it for a period of time, at least until her realm was stable. Otherwise, if this continued, it would be useless even if she quickly reached the seventh rank. Not only would she not have any combat power, the chaotic force that emerged would fill up his little world and the Queen would be dead.

Chapter 3266 The Silence Before The Storm (3)
However, as the chaotic force surged in, Li Hao filled the world faster and faster.p The entire River was roaring and surging crazily!Small worlds rapidly circled between heaven and earth. Gradually, they formed a sword. This time, time was no longer the core. The core was a planet of destruction.The sword of destruction!The thousand world sword might really be taking shape.The next second, he suddenly felt an aura of death ... Li Hao frowned. Lin Hongyu advanced?It had been a while since she had advanced to venerable sovereign, but ... It seemed like she had been forced to advance.How troublesome!Women, competing even for a promotion, how boring. Her hell of death was not perfect. Even if she reached the sixth step, she had no hope of reaching the seventh step. What was the rush?As he thought this in his heart ... He was a little anxious.Damn it, these people actually quickly stepped into the fourth tier!This Silvermoon couldn't be about to enter the sixth step, right?"If that's the case, uncle Hong and Qian Wuliang have both reached Level 6, and I'm still Level 5 ... I'll be too ashamed to face anyone."Li Hao didn't care anymore. He began to absorb the power of the great DAOs crazily and broke up the worlds. He even sent a message to Kong Jue."Brother Kong Ji, continue to sweep the world. It's fine if you go further ... I need more worlds!"Outside, Kong Ji, who had just finished dealing with a group of venerable sovereigns, did not have time to catch his breath. Soon, he left behind a few worlds and turned to leave.He felt happy doing some work.Before, Li Hao had always been calm and unhurried. He never fought for anything. Everyone had taken the benefits, but he didn't seem to get anything, and everyone felt bad about it.During these few days, be it the Silver Moon Martial Master or Kong Ji, they were both very happy.Although Li Hao had taken away all the worlds, everyone was still happy and felt that they were somewhat useful. For example, they felt a sense of achievement now that they had gone out to snatch worlds for Li Hao to cultivate.Even Yuan Shuo was huffing and puffing as he transported the world back.He had been devouring his disciples for a long time, and now he was feeling a little embarrassed. This time, Li Hao was cultivating in seclusion while they were fighting for the world ... But they were all overjoyed!The worlds around the Earth Dragon World were decreasing at a visible rate.However, more and more worlds and venerable sovereigns were coming ... It didn't make much of a difference. Some people felt that the other venerable sovereigns might not have arrived, and some felt that they might be hiding far away ...However, this atmosphere lasted for a while, and the group of venerable sovereigns who came later finally felt that something was wrong.It had been almost half a month since the great Dao fluctuations had spread.In half a month's time, there were only 20 to 30 worlds scattered around.There were some familiar worlds ... But most of them seemed to have disappeared.…… When the Phoenix Flame Thearch and the others arrived, Feng Yan felt that something was wrong at first glance. He looked at the Earth Dragon World in the distance and asked,""I was slow enough. I thought there were venerable sovereigns and worlds everywhere ... Why are there only so few?"From the looks of it, there were less than 50 worlds.However, there were at least a thousand worlds within the Dragon Realm. Could it be that the venerable sovereigns of the Dragon Realm were not curious?  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  On their way here, they didn't encounter any other worlds. It seemed like they had all left, but when they really arrived ... They suddenly realized that the dragon world was so desolate!It would be normal if hundreds of worlds were gathered here.Just a few dozen of them ... Even Feng Yan felt that Dragon World was in ruins.Otherwise, how could there be so few worlds? moreover, most of them were small and medium worlds. Other than a few near the Earth Dragon World, there were almost no other worlds.As Thearch Phoenix Flame spoke, he asked doubtfully,""It's not just here. Previously, the worlds at the border area seemed to be a little less ... Black Dog, where did all the venerable sovereigns who participated in your sharing session go?"At this moment, she felt that something was not right, but she did not suspect Black Panther, because they had signed the great Dao Alliance."I don't know. Some of them heard that a great world had appeared here and said that they've come. Have they not arrived yet?"The Black Panther's spirit fluctuated, as if it was also confused."Your Highness, are we going to the Earth Dragon World directly?""No rush!"The Phoenix Flame Thearch frowned slightly."We'll wait for the emissaries from the other macro worlds to arrive. And ... Wait a little longer. Mother has sent a message that Dragon emissaries might return in the next few days. They should be here soon ... When the Dragon emissaries come, we'll go and meet them together!"At this moment, she felt that something was not quite right.There were too few worlds around here, and indistinctly ... He seemed to smell the stench of blood. One had to know that this was the chaos. Even if someone really died, the chaos would wash away the smell of blood.But she seemed to have smelled it. She wasn't sure if it was, but ... At this moment, she did feel a little uneasy.What was going on?The dragon world seemed to have lost many worlds.And a world had at least one venerable sovereign!Where did they all go?"Black Dog, you have a keen sense of smell ... Go and take a look nearby and see if the other worlds are hiding nearby!"Hearing this, Black Panther did not refuse and quickly disappeared from his spot.He also felt uneasy ... It wasn't good.A seventh-rank was coming. More importantly, Li Hao had not reached the sixth-rank yet. Why was it so difficult for him to reach the sixth-rank?If he hadn't reached the sixth step yet, and the other party's seventh step arrived early ... Then he would really be in big trouble.

Chapter 3267 The Silence Before The Storm (8)
……At the same time.Outside the fire Phoenix realm, a rank seven venerable sovereign walked out from the realm. The fire Phoenix realm Lord personally came to send him off with a face full of smiles."Fellow Daoist longxuan, don't worry. Dragon Lord, don't worry too. There are still a few days before the battle invitation. I will not be careless!""Mm, of course I'm not worried, Daoist firephoenix!""I'll go and see the Earth Dragon first. If the great Dao universe has been completely formed, I'll go to the Thunder World with him to help you!" This time, if we can successfully take over the Thunder World ... Then, I hope that fellow Daoist Fire Phoenix can help me!""Fellow Daoist, you must be joking. With the Dragon Master's support, I don't need to worry ...""Hahaha, that's true!"Long Xuan was also very polite, not to the fire Phoenix, but ... To the fire Phoenix's daughter, Feng Yan, who had already gone to the Earth Dragon World. The Dragon Lord had slept with a lot of female beasts, but he did not have many descendants. Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ He was at the peak of the sixth step. After taking down the Thunder World, he would definitely step into the seventh step!A rank seven descendant, that was also one of a kind. Of course, he had to be polite!"Then I'll take my leave first!"Long Xuan did not delay any further. He stayed in the fire Phoenix realm for a few days. At the moment, there was not much movement in the Thunder World. It was good.'I'll go to the Earth Dragon World to take a look first and call the earth dragons to help me. Even if the lightning Lord has any ideas ... With five Level Seven venerable sovereigns surrounding me, even level eight venerable sovereigns would be able to fight against them, let alone the lightning Lord. Even if you really break through to level eight, you'll still die!'"By the way, there seems to be some changes in Tian Fang. I can't contact Dragon World ..."Long Xuan suddenly said,"previously, there was news that the Dragon Lord should have entered tianfang universe ... Now, it may be a period of competition, or the tianfang universe has blocked all contact. The experts of the three regions have all entered. If we can take down the Thunder World, I'm afraid we will need fellow Daoist Fire Phoenix to arrange for us to go to tianfang together to take a look. Otherwise, the Dragon Lord will be alone ...""Of course!""Of course!" Thearch Fire Phoenix nodded and smiled. It's a pity that if we weren't dragged down by the Thunder World, we should have sent more experts to let the three territories witness the power of our chaotic race!" Long Xuan smiled and nodded. He did not say anything else. It would not be too late to go after dealing with the Thunder World.Moreover, the Dragon Lord's side still had seven tier 7 experts assisting, so it was not a big deal.Soon, he headed straight for the Earth Dragon World at an extremely fast speed.……At this moment, Li Hao had filled more than 900 worlds. However, as the nearby worlds were annihilated, the power of great DAOs that could provide him was decreasing."Soon ..."Li Hao mumbled. It was almost a month away from the Thunderbolt master's deadline, and the arrival of the level Seven venerable sovereign as Black Panther had said.He looked outside the Earth Dragon World, at the few Tier 6 worlds on planet Tianhuang that had not been refined, and at the Earth Dragon World itself.After refining these few worlds, perhaps ... He would officially step into the sixth tier!"You should ... Have some feelings, right?"Some emissaries from other large worlds had gathered outside, but none of them had entered the Earth Dragon Realm. They might have sensed that something was not right.After all, too many worlds had gone missing.These people were most likely waiting for the arrival of the Dragon tribe's emissary. After all, the Earth Dragon was a seventh rank venerable sovereign. Even if it was really the Earth Dragon venerable sovereign, these powerhouses would not dare to offend him.They could only wait for the Return of the Dragon clan's type 7 expert before questioning the Earth Dragon Thearch together."It's time to sweep the Dragon field ..."Li Hao suddenly laughed and closed his eyes, no longer caring about it.Dragon Lord ... Let's see if you'll return.

Chapter 3268 Entering The Sixth Step_slashing The Seventh Step With_sword
The Earth Dragon World seemed to be trembling.At that moment, many emissaries from the major worlds outside frowned.What was the Earth Dragon Thearch doing?Why were there so many worlds missing from the nearby area?The venerable sovereigns gathered together, including Feng Yan and a few others. They were talking with each other. They were a little confused and a little worried, but not too much.After all, this was the core of the chaos race."The Earth Dragon Emperor ... How did he manage to level up his world so quickly ... And there are many fewer worlds nearby, could it be ..."Someone made a guess.Could it be that these worlds had been devoured by the other party, and as a result, the world had advanced?Was that even possible?There was definitely one. However, could a rank 7 great world be improved by devouring a small world?If that was the case ... The Earth Dragon Thearch was going crazy.It was a taboo in the Dragon field!Could it be that the Earth Dragon Thearch thought that he could challenge the Dragon Lord's dignity just because the world had advanced?"Everyone, be careful. The Earth Dragon Thearch might have really advanced by devouring worlds. Many worlds have gone missing in the vicinity. When I came here, I didn't see any worlds along the way, but here, there are only a few dozen worlds ...""Feng Yan, your Fire Phoenix Sector is the closest to this place. Didn't you notice anything wrong?""No, I don't ..."Feng Yan frowned. Nothing seemed to have happened recently. Moreover, the gathering of the worlds had only started after the other party had advanced to the great world. Could it be that the Earth Dragon Thearch had been devouring other worlds in secret?At this moment, she was also a little worried, but she quickly transmitted a message,""Everyone, stay together and don't get too close. Also ... Emperor longxuan will be back soon. If there's really something wrong with the Earth Dragon Emperor, there's nothing to worry about."Although the Earth Dragon Thearch was strong, the longxuan Thearch was the Thearch of the dragon world. Even if he could not defeat the opponent, the Dragon Lord could come here at any time through the longxuan Thearch!As long as the Dragon Lord was around, everyone had nothing to fear."Really? Has Emperor longxuan returned?""Right, we'll arrive in a day at most!""That's good!""Don't worry. We're all cultivators from the great world. If the Earth Dragon dares to risk universal condemnation ... Don't forget that our realm Lords can also descend!"As soon as he said this, everyone secretly criticized him in their hearts.It wasn't us!The flame Phoenix realmlord is your mother and is very close to this place. However, they are different. They are only emissaries and not all of them are the children of the realmlord. Moreover, some great worlds only had one level Seven.And now, it was still besieging the five great demon realms.Who would dare to take the risk and descend!The fire Phoenix World. That was because there wasn't just one stage 7 being. If they really met with danger, the fire Phoenix World Overlord might still descend. This was also the reason why everyone didn't run. The current situation was still unclear, and they still had the support of a great world. Otherwise, they would have long run away.At this moment, the entire chaos seemed to be trembling slightly.At first, everyone thought that there were venerable sovereigns in the surrounding rank-6 worlds. They even thought that these guys were really bold ...However, at this moment, many people's expressions changed.In an instant, Tianhuang and the other two tier 6 worlds near the Earth Dragon Realm began to collapse rapidly under everyone's eyes. Countless world forces swept toward the Earth Dragon Realm!At the same time.In the Earth Dragon World, a powerful spiritual fluctuation swept over. It was majestic and cold."The realms on planet Tianhuang are willing to submit to the Earth Dragon Realm! Now that we've just reached the seventh rank, we're in need of manpower. Are you all interested in joining our Earth Dragon World?"“……”In the distance, Supreme Emperor Phoenix Flame's expression changed slightly. Some of the Supreme emperors even shouted angrily,""Supreme Emperor Earth Dragon, without the Dragon Lord's permission, you dare to devour the four worlds ... You ...""Childish!" Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ The voice came again,"without the Dragon Lord's permission, how would I dare to do this?" Long before the Dragon Lord left, I informed the Dragon Lord that the world was about to be promoted. In order to expand the strength and influence of my Earth Dragon Realm, we will form an alliance of the 13 major worlds in chaos. The Dragon Lord agreed to let me gather some venerable sovereigns! How laughable are you juniors? do you think that I would dare to betray the Dragon Lord?"Everyone was stunned.This ... Really?They were not qualified to ask about the seventh or eighth rank venerable sovereigns, but ... Did the Dragon Lord agree to the expansion of the Earth Dragon Realm?At this moment, Thearch Phoenix Flame was still a little hesitant. He suddenly said,""Sovereign longxuan will arrive in five to six days ... If what the Earth Dragon sovereign said is true ... Can we meet him after he returns?" the old man asked.Five or six days?Li Hao snorted coldly in his heart. This Little Phoenix didn't hide anything from the Black Panther, who had told him through the river of time. Five or six days?Do you think I'm an idiot?That fellow would arrive in a day at most.At this moment, he didn't care about this anymore. It was because he knew that the other party was about to arrive that he was unbridled and quickly began to devour the surrounding rank six worlds."That's even better!"Li Hao's voice rose again, and the power of his great Dao fluctuated."But before that ... Can you lend me some worlds? If the Earth Dragon wants to step into a level Seven world, just the great Dao universe isn't enough. It still needs a large number of worlds to fill it and expand the entire world, completely advancing to Level Seven!"“……”None of the surrounding venerable sovereigns spoke.Before coming, in order to congratulate them, they had actually prepared some gifts, including Dao crystals and even worlds. This was because the various sector Lords knew that for a Tier 6 world to step into the tier 7 realm, it required a large amount of World Energy and Dao energy.

Chapter 3269 Entering The Sixth Step_killing The Seventh Step With_sword
If it was before, he would have given it.But now ... Everyone was suspicious.Furthermore, after devouring a Tier 6 world, the heaven desolate master and the others did not appear. This ... Was even more worrying.How would he dare to give the world and the great Dao crystal to the other party?Sovereign Phoenix Flame was the most powerful and had the highest status here. At this moment, seeing that everyone was looking at him, he could only force himself to speak again,""Venerable Earth Dragon, there's no need to rush ... The return of the venerable Emperor longxuan might host the promotion ceremony for you ... We'll give you a small gift then!"At this moment, no one had any doubts.There was no other reason. The pressure was too heavy.He had even surpassed Feng Yan, who was at the peak of the sixth rank, so he naturally thought that he was a seventh rank venerable sovereign.As for the rank seven in the Earth Dragon World, who else could it be other than the Earth Dragon Thearch?They weren't familiar with the Earth Dragon Thearch, so they couldn't tell if his aura was the same as before. Even if they could, it wouldn't be of much use. With the stars Of Time and the River of memories, it wouldn't be too difficult for Li Hao to disguise himself.The world around him was still being devoured by Li Hao.His long river was quickly filled up with realm domains.The world power provided by a rank six world was incomparable to that of an ordinary small world. At this moment, Li Hao felt that he was about to reach a critical point. The convergence of thousands of worlds might have a major change.It could even be considered a transformation.On the Dao chess side, the 1000 squares were often a point of change. When a thousand worlds converged and a thousand DAOs converged, a unique and larger Dao domain would be formed.This was also why Li Hao was so sure that he could reach Level 6 after filling a thousand worlds.A quantitative change would lead to a qualitative change.However, Li Hao was still not satisfied. It was not that he was not satisfied with himself. He should have had enough to advance to the sixth step, but it was not enough for Silver Moon. He had recently devoured all of Silver moon's energy.This group of people in front of him might have a lot of good things. If he could take them down and provide them to the Silvermoon world, they might have a chance of reaching Level 6.Once he reached level six, not to mention the other venerable sovereigns, if the two Dao Masters joined forces, and if Black Panther could also reach level six, the two Dao Masters and One World Master would merge into one and control the two Dao universes ... Even if they could not suppress Level Seven, they could at least resist and delay them. Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ He was at the stage of Li Hao, Kong Ji, and the sword venerable before he advanced.With the two Dao universes and the fusion of three level-six venerable sovereigns as the foundation, the other venerable sovereigns would be able to defend against level-seven venerable sovereigns. This was equivalent to having another level-seven venerable sovereign on his side!Therefore, at this moment, Li Hao had already decided that he had to take down these people. It was fine if they took the initiative to send it, but if they didn't ... Even if a seventh grade venerable sovereign came, he would kill him if he dared to!"I need to increase the power of the world and strengthen the earthly Dragon Realm!"Li Hao's voice resounded again,'everyone ... I'll give you my congratulatory gifts now! Feng Yan, if you think that you can ignore me with fellow Daoist Fire Phoenix behind you, then try me! As of now, the Thunder World is much more troublesome than I am. After the items have been delivered, I can wait for long Xuan to return and absorb some of the world's power. However, it will take time ... At least three days. After three days, long Xuan should be able to arrive, right?" At that moment, the venerable sovereigns of the large fields looked solemn.Was he ... Going to force it?What was going on?Supreme Emperor Phoenix Flame also frowned and said softly,""The venerable Earth Dragon, this is a gift for you. If you need it, we can give it to you anytime ... But ... The venerable one's intention is ... If we want to leave now, will the venerable one stop us?"Previously, the other party's words clearly carried a hint of threat."Not bad!"Li Hao's voice was loud and clear."In order to avoid any misunderstandings, you made up stories about me. When longxuan comes and explains it clearly, I'll naturally let you stay as you wish!" Once you leave, the Dragon field will probably spread the news that I, the Earth Dragon, have devoured the universe and betrayed the Dragon Lord. At that time, even if I want to explain, I won't be able to do anything ... I can only restrain you for now and wait for long Xuan to come before making a decision!"Everyone felt a little more at ease.He was not going to suppress them directly, he was just asking them to stay here, regardless of whether the other party had any ill intentions ... At most, in a day, long Xuan would arrive. By then, whether it was true or not, everything would naturally be clear."Your Highness Feng Yan, hold off the Earth Dragon Emperor first ... We don't want to suffer any losses now. Even if the fire Phoenix realm Lord can descend, the Thunder World is a big deal at this moment. Let's give him the great Dao crystal and the world for him to absorb. It will take some time ... Perhaps, the Earth Dragon Emperor will arrive here!"Feng Yan quickly thought about it and didn't say much. He nodded and said,""If the venerable one needs it, we naturally have no objections!"With that, he waved his hand, and several worlds seemed to float in front of him. There were also countless great Dao crystals. He said,""This is a congratulatory gift from my Fire Phoenix realm to supremacy. One medium-level world, five small worlds, and 100 million great Dao crystals. We hope supremacy will kindly accept them!"Was it a lot?Not too much.To a Grade 7, it would only be worth 200 to 300 million great Dao crystals.However, this was only a congratulatory gift, and it was not considered a small amount. He could not really empty his pockets and give it to someone else.The fire Phoenix realm was very rich, super rich.However, the congratulatory gift ... Could only be considered ordinary.Perhaps there were some, but Feng Yan had kept them. After all, this might be to help the enemy. However, for a rank seven, 100 or 200 million great Dao crystals was not a lot, and there was no substantial improvement.
