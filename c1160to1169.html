        have run away?" one of his subordinates asked softly.
        Li Hao was actually very familiar with the speaker.
        Hu Qingfeng said cautiously,"I actually know a little about Li Hao. I've seen him before. I'm actually very surprised that he caused such a big commotion in the East. According to my understanding of him, he shouldn't be so bold ... Perhaps he's already run away. You should know that he challenged the First Division."
        "He ran away?" Huang Long was surprised. He's not afraid of hou Xiaochen ..."
        "His master, Yuan Shuo, the Earthcover sword, the radiant sword, and the others are all his backers. He definitely won't be afraid of hou Xiaochen."
        Huang Long smiled, a brilliant smile,"it's good that he ran away!" That would be really fun. Hou Xiaochen had declared war, and the vanguard general had run away. Not only had he become a laughing stock, but he had also offended Secretary Liu. Even if Secretary Liu doesn't act now, he'll act sooner or later. I'd like to see how hou Xiaochen deals with this. "
        Hu Qingfeng laughed dryly and didn't dare to answer.
        ……
        As the sky brightened, Li Hao still hadn't appeared.
        Everyone was surprised.
         The Heavenly Star Douluo arena.
        The alluring woman, quicksand, and the dark-skinned man, Wu Yong, were actually already waiting ... But they didn't come.
        The Heavenly Star Douluo arena was still open for business today.
        However, it was obviously different today. Many high officials and nobles had come. Of course, they were not here to watch the battle on the stage. They wanted to see Li Hao of the star military governor's office come to confiscate the property.
        But ... He didn 't.
        Everything was safe.
        On the grandstand, in the private rooms above the grandstand, a series of disappointed sighs sounded.
        "He ran away!"
        "I didn't expect this!"
        "Who would have thought? It was hou Xiaochen who started the war. The demonic sword just entered the capital, and we all thought he was going to do something big and gain a firm foothold, but ... He's gone!"
        "Could he have been assassinated?"
        "Then you're underestimating hou Xiaochen, and you're underestimating the spread of news in stellarsky city. If he really was assassinated, the news would've spread long ago. It's clear that he really did run away in the middle of the night!"
        "The demonic sword ... Is that all?"
        "This is so funny!"
        "Hou Xiaochen probably doesn't even dare to go out. If he does, he'll probably be laughed at ... We all thought that the demonic sword was going to show off its might today, but who knew that no one would see it."
        "It's boring!"
        “……”
        All the guests were discussing. Some sneered, some laughed, and some understood Li Hao.
        After all, he had not just offended an ordinary person, but one of the nine divisions.
        Running away ... Was also a wise move.
        ……
        The Financial Secretary.
        Secretary Liu looked up at the sky, frowning as he fell into deep thought.
        I've been fooled?
        Had Li Hao really been scared away?
        However, when he met Li Hao last night, even though it was their first time meeting, he didn't feel that Li Hao was a timid person.  He had a slight headache.
        Everything had been prepared. Today's Douluo arena was the Asura arena, Li Hao's burial ground ... But he was gone. What was the point of being buried?
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The communication device rang.
        He picked up the communication device and listened to the report. After a moment, he slowly said,""Be careful, don't let down your guard. He was at the Dingbian before, and he entered the Xu estate in broad daylight by impersonating a member of the demon clan. Be careful that he sneaks into the Douluo arena and strikes when you're not prepared ..."
        However, in this way, he actually lost some of his domineering and overbearing aura.
        From his point of view, if hou Xiaochen wanted to establish his might and deal with the Heavenly Star Douluo arena, he shouldn't have done this.
        Frowning, he took out a jade pendant and typed in some words to ask about Li Hao's whereabouts.
        In the end ... There was no news.
        Last night, Li Hao had disappeared after leaving the nine Dragons Pavilion.
        Where did Li Hao go?
        As for Nanquan, Nanquan was actually quite low-key in stellarsky city. Not many people knew that he had made a few moves, and there were very few people who really knew about it. Moreover, no one would leak anything.
        Moreover, on the surface, the southern Fist didn't have any connections with Li Hao.
        The key was that the southern Fist was still relatively weak.
        In addition, they were in the palace. To investigate Nanquan was to go deep into the palace and could easily cause a big change. No one wanted to go to the palace and ask if Nanquan was there.
        At this moment, Li Hao had just arrived in Heavenly Star, and he didn't know anyone.
        One couldn't help but wonder if he was scared and ran away.
        ……
        At the inspection Office.
        The Secretary touched his chin, his expression weird. After a while, he said,""Does the inspection Office have any information on Li Hao's whereabouts?"
        "No," someone said from below."But last night, an expert near the north gate directly soared into the air and left ... It might be Li Hao, but he didn't meet the guards."
        “……”
        The Inspector General was also speechless, this is ridiculous! Hou Xiaochen was so overbearing last night, but this is great ... Forget it, the one who's embarrassing is hou Xiaochen, it has nothing to do with me. "
        The people outside probably didn't even realize that Li Hao had run away in the middle of the night.
        The group of people below didn't know whether to laugh or cry.
        The Thunder was loud, but the rain was small.
         No, there was no rain at all.
        ……
        On this day, Li Hao and hou Xiaochen once again became people that were often mentioned by the big shots of stellarsky city.
        It was just that he felt like he had become a laughing stock.
        People were also searching for Li Hao in all directions.
        Li Hao still had two divine weapons.
        However, no one could find Li Hao.
        At this moment, Li Hao was burning money at the bottom of the ocean to give Southern Fist a satisfactory Super Lock.
        As for other people's comments and mockery ... Li Hao had never cared about these things.
        His life was his. Old hou was taking a risk, but Li Hao was not willing to take such a risk and place all his hopes on others.
       
        Deep in the ocean.
        Three men, one woman, and one dog.
        Yes, there was also a woman. The two people invited by the southern Fist were actually a couple. They both looked to be in their forties.
        At this moment, his inner strength had formed a huge defensive shield.
        The man was like Nan Quan, also with a big beard, but the woman was petite.
        At this moment, the man was so comfortable that he kept calling out,""Oh oh oh ... My God, is this cultivation?"
        "Comfortable!"
        "Ah, so cool!"
        “……”
        Li Hao's face darkened. The man's wife was also embarrassed and ashamed.
         Nan Quan rolled his eyes.
        You're embarrassing me!
        "This is too good!"
        The man's name was yang Shan. He was a Martial Master in the past, but he chose to become a superpower after the rise of superpowers. He was now at the peak of the rising sun. Those who had the strength of the peak of the rising sun were usually not itinerant cultivators.
        The man was indeed not a wandering cultivator.
        A few years ago, this guy had worked hard for the quelling Duke in the West and gained a lot of benefits. In the end, this guy had set his eyes on the Pirates of the West Ocean. He felt that there were not enough resources, so he went to fight the Pirates.
        In the end, he beat up the wrong person and killed a group of Pirates raised by the quelling Duke's mansion. The quelling Duke didn't say anything and only asked him to take out the treasures he had seized. After all, this guy was indeed very strong and brave in battle.
        Those Pirates had dug up a treasure in the sea, which the Duke of an country needed, so the condition was quite lenient.
        In the end, it was unknown if yang Shan had an idea after seeing the money or if he felt that it was inappropriate for the high Duke's public house to collude with Pirates. He immediately took the money and ran away. His wife also ran away with him. In fact, his wife was not his wife before, but a female chief in the backyard of the quelling Duke's public house.
        In the end, he somehow managed to hook up with him and ran away. Otherwise, it would have been difficult for this guy to escape from the West.
        At this moment, yang Shan was shouting non-stop and laughing wildly. This guy looked more reckless than Nan Quan and more like a pirate. One look and you could tell he was not a good person.
        As expected, birds of a feather flock together.
        Nanquan made friends with the same kind of people.
        "My God, cultivation can actually be so enjoyable. It's later than my wife's ..."
        "Yang Shan!"
        The petite woman's voice was a little sharp and angry. She glared at him."What are you saying?"
        "Oh ... I don't mean it that way."
        Yang Shan was embarrassed, then he said excitedly,""Governor ... Governor li! In the future, we will work for you. We don't have high expectations, just give us a good time every few days, and you can do whatever you want!"  Li Hao smiled."That won't be necessary. As long as you don't try to steal my godly sword, we'll have a chance to work together."
        "How could it be!"
        Yang Shan was embarrassed. How could that be?
        Are we that kind of people?
        Li Hao smiled without saying anything.
        The first time they met, he had seen the greed in their eyes.
        However ... One of them was at the peak while the other was at the late-nascent Soul Stage. It was impossible for them to snatch the treasure.
        If it weren't for the fact that he was brought here by Southern Fist and suppressed his greed in the end ... Li Hao wouldn't mind killing two more souls. After killing so many people, he had long gotten used to it.
        It could kill any transcendent!
        Yes, this was exactly how it was.
        Li Hao himself was no exception. Since he had embarked on this path, there was nothing much to say. You kill me, I kill you. No one knew what would happen in the end, but who wouldn't have a blood debt in their hands?
        ,m "Is there a chance for me to enter the metamorphosis stage?"  Li Hao glanced at yang Shan. Yang Shan thought for a while and said,""To transform, I need to unlock the sixth superpower lock and release some of my second superpower. I'm a fire elemental and I've unlocked the kidney's lock. I want to release water elemental superpower and merge it with fire to form a water elemental god art."
        "It's just that fire and water are alternating, so it's easier to break ... It's more dangerous ..."
        Li Hao looked at him."What if I can maintain your internal organs with my sword?" he asked.
        "Then ... It shouldn't be a big problem, right?"
        Yang Shan's eyes flickered."However, we need a lot of sword energy. We don't have that much money. We might not be able to get that much with your money. I think you've used up a lot of divine power stones."
         Li Hao looked at him and said after a long while,"if big brother yang is willing to work for us, we can talk about it!" The things that can be done during the metamorphosis stage are much more than what can be done during the peak stage. Sometimes, if one's vision is slightly higher, one can understand that there are still many things required to enter the divine power realm. The most important thing is the stability of the five internal organs. "
        Yang Shan's expression changed slightly when he heard that.
        Yes, divine-tier!
        Apart from those who had attained divine powers many years ago and were the leaders of major factions, who could obtain a large amount of life energy to stabilize their five internal organs, it was very difficult for others to attain divine powers.
        There was a 90% chance of dying to become a divine power during the transformation stage.
        As he was thinking, the petite woman said with a smile,""Don't worry, Governor li. Big brother he called us here because he trusts us. Whether it's the Li family's divine sword or the Windchaser's boots, are they something people like us can think of?"
        "Besieged by the whole world ... To be honest, we have no one to rely on. We don't have the confidence like Governor li to dare to be the enemy of the whole world! There are countless experts in the Silver Moon martial arts world. In one battle, sky sword, blade Overlord, Southern Fist, and five bird Kings all attacked ... How would we dare to provoke them?"
        She was more tactful than yang Shan and smiled brightly.""None of these people attacked, and none of them took the Li family's divine sword. They don't dare, but do we dare? Governor li has overestimated us. "
        "That's right, Governor li, don't worry. "Yang Shan was also a little embarrassed.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao laughed."I'm not worried. I just don't want any accidents or mistakes to happen. I also like to make things clear so that there won't be any mishaps. You two are both friends of uncle-master Nanquan, so I don't want to end up in an unpleasant situation."
       
        "If they dare to betray us, I'll be the first to kill them," Nan Quan said nonchalantly."Don't worry!"
        “……”
        Yang Shan rolled his eyes and did not bother to say anything more.
        After some consideration, he said,"I'll try to enter the metamorphosis stage, but my wife probably won't be able to do it. To level up a superpower, one's body must reach a certain level and one must touch the superpower lock. My wife is still a little lacking ... If she continues to absorb sword energy and the five elements, she has a chance of reaching the peak ... However, if she transforms, she hasn't adapted to the increase in power. I'm afraid it'll be difficult to control it and she'll explode easily."
        It was easier for a superpower to advance, but it was more dangerous than a Martial Master.
        Power wasn't born from one's own body, but from the absorption of external power. As such, if one advanced too quickly, it was easy to lose control.
        Li Hao understood. He nodded."That's fine. One transformed and one at the peak. They're still stronger than they are now!"
        Li Hao laughed."Let's use war to sustain war. After we're done with the four Seas Corporation, we'll go and clean up the star Douluo arena. We'll find out all the secrets of Secretary Liu. By then, we won't be far from magical powers!"
        After saying that, Li Hao didn't say anything else. Instead, he continued to release sword energy and the five elements.
        He was also absorbing it.
         Within the five internal organs, the temporary five bridges were rapidly operating, and streams of power poured into the five internal organs. There was no longer a need to strengthen one internal organ alone, but all five internal organs were strengthened.
        Beside him, the Black Panther was also absorbing it.
        Li Hao sighed.
        The Black Panther ate ... So much!
        More than anyone else.
        But this guy's strength didn't seem to have changed. He had been like this since he left heaven battling city, and he was still like this even now. As for whether he had improved or not, every time Li Hao asked, Black Panther would shake his head.
        Whether it was stronger or not ... Li Hao couldn't tell.
        Li Hao no longer paid attention to him. While sword energy surged out crazily, he was also strengthening himself and fully armed himself.
        It would be best if he could gain a firm foothold in stellarsky city.
        If he wanted to understand the entire dynasty, it was inevitable that he would need to go to stellarsky city.
        This time, it would be best if he could intimidate the entire heavenstar and give himself some time to catch his breath.
        While absorbing the energy, Li Hao pondered other things.
        A mirror fragment appeared.
        This was the mirror of the Duke dingguo's mansion. It had a monitoring function, but it could not be refined. It seemed to be able to monitor only a small area.
        Li Hao frowned slightly.
        A moment later, he took out another fragment. It was also a fragment of a weapon, and it looked like a fragment of a saber or sword. It was one of the six treasures he had found on the third floor.
        It stood alongside the three earth-grade origin divine weapons.
        Judging from its aura, it was indeed powerful. However, it was useless to keep it. Li Hao took out the starry sky sword.
        Can it be swallowed?
        The small sword had only been devouring weapon souls. Could it devour this ancient divine weapon?
        If he swallowed it, could he unseal it a little?  The current small sword was much more useful than before. Li Hao could control it at will, but he still couldn't refine it into his body, which meant that it hadn't been completely unsealed.
        With the fragment in front of him, Li Hao used the five birds breathing technique, and the small sword seemed to have the desire to eat the fragment.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao held the fragment close to the small sword.
        A moment later, the small sword seemed to have moved. A faint devouring force emerged from the sword, and the weapon fragment trembled slightly. A moment later, it seemed to have softened.
        Then, it turned into a liquid-like substance and was absorbed by the small sword.
        At this moment, something seemed to have appeared on the starry sky sword.
        Li Hao's vision blurred, as if he had seen something as well. It was like an illusion.
        "Kill!"
        The ear-piercing sounds of battle were deafening to the ears.
        Vaguely, he seemed to see a person cutting through the sky with a saber. The long saber was broken, but the enemy was cut into tens of thousands of pieces. The next moment, the fragments of the long saber scattered in all directions.
        Then, Li Hao's vision blurred, and he was back in reality.
        He vaguely understood that this was the scene when the long saber was broken. An expert who used a saber killed an enemy but also broke the long saber, causing the fragments to scatter. This was one of the fragments.
        On the small sword, more sword energy seemed to emerge.
        As for the other changes, he couldn't see anything.
        A moment later, Li Hao took out three more earth-grade weapons.
        He had many divine weapons on him.
        A total of 35.
        They were all seized last time.
        In addition, of the 16 drops of spring of life, he gave three drops each to the light sword and the Earthcover sword. His teacher didn't want them, but he seemed to have some for himself. He had used one drop in the nine Dragons Pavilion before, so he still had nine drops.
        After some thought, he put four drops into a bottle and threw it to Southern Fist.
         Southern Fist was shocked!
        "I may not be able to help you suppress the power lock during the battle ... But with the spring of life, you can unseal it as long as it doesn't break completely ... The spring of life can help you suppress it!"
        "You're buying my life with money!"Southern Fist gasped.
        Sometimes, things were not easy to take.
        Giving him four drops of the spring of life at once. To be honest, Nanquan had gotten a lot of benefits since he was born, but he had never received so many drops of it before.
        "Martial uncle must be joking."
        Li Hao looked at the five drops he had left and took out two small bottles, filling each bottle with one drop. Yang Shan and his wife were a little excited, as if they had realized something.
        Sure enough, Li Hao gave each of them a drop."For life-saving purposes!"
        "Magnanimous!"
        Yang Shan almost grabbed it and said excitedly,""Governor Li, you're so generous! This is the first time I've seen the Silver Moon Martial master's generosity. Old he is extremely stingy, I've never seen him so generous before ..."
       
        Nan Quan sneered.
        'Of course, I'll have to have that too. He's so poor, and there aren't many Silver Moon martial masters who have money. They use as much as they have, so where is he going to find treasures to share?'
        Yang Shan's wife, Qin Lian, also hurriedly thanked him.""Many thanks, Governor li!"
        "I should!"
        Li Hao laughed."To save your lives means that you have to risk your lives. You two should think about it carefully."
        Then, he looked at the three earth-grade weapons and said,"I have quite a few origin God weapons, but not many earth-grade ones. The low-grade ones won't be of much help to us. Three earth-grade ones, one armor, one saber, one hammer ... You three can decide how you want to distribute them. This is a temporary loan, not a gift. The spring of life is a gift."
        Yang Shan bared his teeth."Of course, of course. This saber ... Can I use it?"
        "My wife can use the armor. Old he's defense is strong. I think a hammer will do!" He added hurriedly.
        The southern Fist rolled his eyes again!
        Were those human words?
         But ... It was not bad to have a hammer to use. He also took the hammer in his hand with a smile and grinned,""This can be considered a full set of equipment!"
        He had a copper spear, and now he had a hammer. It would be great if he had a pair of boxing gloves.
        With four drops of the spring of life to save his life, he could be said to be armed to the teeth.
        As for yang Shan and the other one, they each took an origin divine weapon and a drop of the spring of life.
        Li Hao did some mental calculations. He had paid a total of six drops of the spring of life. In addition to the sword energy he had now, he had used up more than 30000 divine power stones.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com According to the little tree's price, it would be 90000 pieces of divine power stones.
        However, according to the nine Dragons Pavilion ... It would be ten times more!
        One million Yuan!
        Yes, the 30000 Yuan He used could be exchanged for three drops from little tree. Li Hao did the math. Wasn't that nine drops?
        One million Yuan wasn't considered a lot.
        The starry sky sword should also be charged a fee.
        "I paid such a huge price, a million divine power stones. If I didn't get so much ..."
        Li Hao looked at them and said slowly,"then it's a loss. I rarely do business at a loss!" Of course, it's true that you've all become stronger, but that's not important to me. Do you all understand what I mean?"
        "Don't worry!"Yang Shan said excitedly. Governor li, this time, even if we have to risk our lives, we have to do a big business!"
        The other party had already paid, and it was such a huge price.
        Such a generous boss, even the quelling Duke seemed small-minded compared to Li Hao.
        This was forthright!
        He had to serve the big boss well.
        Of course, the most important thing was that Li Hao was indeed a key figure in attaining the divine power realm. Without Li Hao, itinerant cultivators like them would have no chance of attaining the divine power realm.  Unless he sought refuge with another powerful force, but someone had to want him. Was it worth it to offend the an country Duke for them?
        Also, would ordinary factions dare to let them enter the divine power realm?
        Perhaps he would only have a chance of gaining their trust after serving them for three to five years. That would be too troublesome. Judging from Li Hao's expression, he might not care about that.
        ……
        The cultivation this time did not end there.
        Li Hao also continued to absorb sword energy to replenish his SuperLock.
        Previously, he had filled up the heart's Super Lock.
        Last time, he had cultivated for ten days. Other than strengthening his force and perfecting his five viscera bridge, he had also been constantly filling up and absorbing energy. When he left the East Coast, he had already completed filling up four super locks.
        This time, he began to fill up the fifth Super Lock in his five internal organs.
        As for the four limbs, Li Hao hadn't started yet.
        His teacher had once said that it was not necessarily a good thing for Li Hao to have too much Shi. The superclass was not strong enough, and he needed to take it slow. It was best to first perfect the superclass sword intent before improving himself.
        Otherwise, it would be very easy for the five Forces to go out of control.
        Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't care too much. He should be able to hold on for a while.
        When the five organ locks were full of energy, according to the normal cultivation sequence, Li Hao could actually use the five super locks to build the five bridges.
        In that case, it would be easier to nurture Shi.
        After completing the bridge of the five internal organs and integrating Shi, if Li Hao could unseal himself like the others, he could even be considered to have entered Yuan Shuo's so-called Soul Fusion stage.
        However, Li Hao didn't choose to combine the five bridges.
        Once he combined them, his "power" would receive a powerful feedback, and there was a high chance that he would be unable to suppress the superclass. This wasn't what he was currently pursuing.
         In the past three days, Li Hao had only installed one Super Lock.
        As for Nan Quan, he didn't have such concerns. He absorbed the spiritual energy like crazy. In addition, he had absorbed a lot of it before. When Li Hao suppressed him, he had secretly absorbed some. In addition, he had obtained some benefits in the Royal remains.
        ? This time, he had filled one and a half of his five viscera locks. In the blink of an eye, he had filled three of his five viscera locks.
        His vitality had also become much stronger.
        Previously, if he hadn't been unsealed, his strength would only be at the middle stage of the rising light realm. However, at this moment, Nan Quan felt that even if he hadn't been unsealed, there was a high probability that his combat strength would be at the peak of the rising light realm.
        Three of them even caught up to the current light sword.
        It was just that his sealed combat power was not even as strong as the previously sealed light sword. This was also the difference between martial masters at this stage. Everyone walked in different directions, and the degree of strengthening was different.
        Nanquan had completed the saturation of the third chain and was slightly regretful.""Why does it feel like ... My vitality is still not strong enough?"
        He was a little confused.
        Li Hao glanced at him."It's probably a problem with the body." "You've completed three of the four limbs and five internal organs, but you haven't completed the Zifu and the spine. If you strengthen your qi and blood, I think the main core will still be the Zifu. "
       
        Nan Quan's eyes flickered as he looked at Li Hao.
        Li Hao looked at him."Didn't you notice, uncle?" he asked.
        "I do have some feelings," Nan Quan said in a deep voice."But I don't think I can completely locate it ... Can you?"
        "That's not possible either. It can only mean that uncle-master's body and bones have not caught up."
        "I see ..." Nan Quan nodded and exhaled."That's why I'm still not as strong as the earthbound sword and the others even though I've already strengthened my third five viscera lock. Could it be that they ... Have a stronger body and bone armor than me?"
        "Senior-martial uncle Hong is probably stronger than you. As for the light sword ..."
        Li Hao thought for a moment and smiled."Probably stronger than you. Her power of light actually has the effect of nourishing the body. The effect is very good!"
        The southern Fist was a little depressed!
        "Then what about BA Dao and the others? BA Dao's physical body is definitely not as strong as mine. His main cultivation is saber intent ..."
        Li Hao shook his head."I don't know. However, since blade Overlord and the others are so strong, they might have strengthened other superlocks. For example, the one in their heads!"
         Nanquan took a deep breath.
        "So ... I'm still the rear guard?"
        "Not necessarily ..." Li Hao smiled."But if uncle-master can strengthen his purple mansion or one of his spine pillars to the point of saturation, I believe that even if it's not unsealed, he'll have the battle strength of the transformation stage."
        Nan Quan said regretfully,"then we'll have to wait a little longer. Wait for me to absorb and digest all of this first. I was saying that I've been improving all these years. How can I be inferior to them? it seems like these bastards have been taking advantage of me behind my back."
        As he said that, a wave of energy suddenly spread out from the side. Water and fire collided. The fire element was obviously much stronger, while the water element was much weaker. With the sudden impact of the energy, yang Shan spat out a mouthful of blood.
        A large amount of sword energy surged into his body. Yang Shan quickly opened his eyes, which were filled with fear.
        “艹!”
        He cursed and then became happy again."Even the metamorphosis stage is so dangerous. If it wasn't for the sword strengthening and protecting my internal organs, I would have exploded from the impact ... Those guys are quite capable. Those who can enter the metamorphosis stage are all F * cking courageous!"
        Just a slight collision between water and fire had almost shattered his internal organs.
        One could only imagine how strong those who had broken and stepped into the sacred art realm were.
        "Is it considered a successful advancement?" Nan Quan asked curiously.
        "Of course!"
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Yang Shan laughed,"he's already releasing water and fire, what do you think?" It's just that ... The water element is too weak, so I don't dare to release too much of it. I can only fuse a little bit into it, but it'll definitely be stronger than before ..."
        He could be considered to have entered the transformation stage, but the degree of collapse was very low.
         The probability was similar to general Huang's death by Li Hao's sneak attack. However, with an earth-grade weapon and the protection of the spring of life, he was not weak.  As for his wife, Qin Lian, she had completed the advancement to the peak stage yesterday. This was much easier than yang Shan 's.
        ,m He had been cultivating for three days.  Li Hao calculated for a moment and said,""Brother yang, please get used to it. We'll move out once the sky turns dark!"
        Then, he thought of something and took out two sets of black armor.""One for each person. Put it on. Its defense is okay, but it has some restrictions on superpowers ... However, it can minimize the leakage of superpower!"
        "I'll wear it at the start. I can take it off when I really encounter a big battle."
        Nan Quan laughed.
        He was the commander of the bronze-armored company!
        The two of them didn't ask anything. Under the guidance of Southern Fist, they quickly put on their black armors. Then, they were very surprised that they could actually communicate with each other even from a thousand miles away. This was amazing!
        ……
        It was not until dark that the four people and one dog left the seabed and headed toward the SI hai organization's headquarters.
        ……
        Li Hao, who had disappeared for three days, had become a laughingstock.
        Not only him, but hou Xiaochen as well.
         At the night patrollers 'headquarters.
        In the past two days, hou Xiaochen had been ridiculed and criticized. Some people from the ninth Bureau had been communicating with the inspection Bureau, asking if hou Xiaochen needed to make some adjustments.
        Who gave him the guts to provoke the Financial Secretary?
        At this moment, in the conference room, Huang Long spoke again,""Deputy Minister hou, the financial division has been suppressing this month's salary for the past few days. Although on our side, the inspection Division will also allocate a part of the funds, but the financial division is the big head ... If the financial division doesn't allocate the funds, we can still talk, but the brothers under us won't have any food to eat!"
        The financial division's money was not all his, but still needed to be allocated to other parties. This was also a means to limit the nine divisions.
        The inspection Office had people and soldiers, but it didn't have much money.
        Of course, the Inspector General definitely had his own wealth, but it didn't make sense for him to take out all his money to support everyone. He couldn't afford it.
        "What's the rush? it's only the 5th today. If I remember correctly, they're only getting paid on the 10th,"hou Xiaochen said calmly.
        "The financial division has already said that this month ... They will not be making any money for the time being. They have been having some difficulties recently, especially the tax collection problems in the East. It will probably be delayed for a while. Deputy Minister hou knows why. It is better to go to the financial division and talk to Secretary Liu. If you can't apologize, I think they won't make things difficult for you. "
        After he finished speaking, he looked at Yao si,"Minister, also, I don't think Li Hao's position as the Vice Governor of Tian Xing is appropriate!" Besides, he's already run away. I think ... It's better to cancel it. Besides, Li Hao is suspected of dereliction of duty. I think he should be held accountable. "
       
        Yao Si was only drinking from a large tea jar. When he saw Huang Long looking over, he raised his head and smiled,""This ... You can discuss it with Minister hou, form a document, and hand it directly to the inspection Division. I won't care anymore."
        Huang Long cursed in his heart and snorted.
        Not care?
        No matter what, why did you sign the letter of appointment? he, hou Xiaochen, doesn't have the right to make you a Vice Governor.
        The old thing didn't even discuss it with him and signed it directly. It seemed like he wasn't willing.
        He didn't say anything more to the old man. He looked at hou Xiaochen and asked,"Deputy Minister hou, what do you think?"
        "No rush."
        "Once we take down the star Douluo arena, we'll naturally have no shortage of money. If the financial division doesn't give it, I'll give it."
        "Why? does Deputy Minister hou still wish to continue?" Huang Long frowned.
        "The Heavenly Star Douluo arena has many officials and nobles. If it's really banned, aren't you afraid of causing trouble? Those people were full of energy. If they were not given a place to vent, wouldn't that be causing trouble for the night patrollers? Did Deputy Minister hou think about it? if this were to happen, there would be more turmoil and many of the night patrols would die! I think it's good to maintain the current situation ..."
         Did it make sense?
        In fact, there were.
        However, the sin was not stopped so that fewer people would die. In the end, more people would die.
        Hou Xiaochen laughed as he looked at Ling Chen and said,"Deputy Minister Huang's eloquence ... Is really eye-opening! According to you, we don't need to care about the three major organizations and everyone else. If they want to fight or kill, it's up to them. This way, we won't have to worry about the number of casualties, right?"
        "That's not what I meant, but the star Douluo arena and the three great organizations are not the same. You don't have to try to confuse us!"Huang Long said indifferently.
        "Alright, that's all for today. What's the rush? the financial division still hasn't given you any funds on the day of your salary, so I'll think of a way to pay you back."
        "I'm afraid you can't afford it!"
        Huang Long sneered.
        There were thousands of supers in the stellarsky city's night watchmen alone. In addition to the other regions in the central region, there were about 30000 night watchmen. This was a huge sum of money. Not only did they need money, but they also needed the mysterious energy and the divine power stones.
        They didn't need to care about the four continents, but the central continent had always been funded by the stellarsky city.
        The Financial Secretary was not at a loss this time, not because of Tian Xing city.
        If these people didn't get the money, they wouldn't blame the financial division, but only hou Xiaochen and Li Hao.
        He didn't know what was good for him and just had to provoke the other party.
        ……
        Hou Xiaochen ignored him and left.
        Behind him, Chief Steward Yu quickly followed. His expression was a little ugly as he transmitted a message,""Minister, this Huang Long is extremely annoying. Why don't we ..."
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com "He's the Deputy Minister and the Deputy Secretary."
        Hou Xiaochen chuckled and shook his head.
        I can't do this.  Otherwise, the bottom line of the rules would be broken. If he could kill Huang Long, then the others could disregard the bottom line and kill him together. This was also something that the nine divisions and the imperial family would not allow.
        They had to at least maintain the rules in the central continent.
        This was the foundation of a dynasty's rule.
        The killing intent in Chief Steward Yu's eyes was overflowing. She really wanted to kill that fellow ... Unfortunately, she couldn 't.
        "I'll make a trip to the Heavenly Star Douluo arena tonight then ..."He sent another voice transmission.
        "Let's wait a little longer!"
        Hou Xiaochen exhaled and looked outside the city. He frowned slightly. Li Hao ... Really ran away?
        I don't believe it!
        If this guy dared to come, why would he run away so easily?
        Maybe something happened, maybe he went to find someone to help him, maybe it was for cultivation, maybe it was something else ... But he believed that Li Hao wouldn't just run away without a word.
        ……
        At the same time.
        On the sea, Li Hao and the others were extremely fast.
        With Li Hao around, he easily avoided the patrols and even the night patrollers on the sea.
        The stellarsky sea was an inland sea, and there were still many people patrolling the area. However, to Li Hao, they were all bright lights.
        The SI Hai group's headquarters was on an island in the star sea. The entire Island belonged to the SI Hai Group.
        This place had been transformed by them into heaven.
        Soon, Li Hao and the others approached the brightly-lit Island.
         At this moment, there were still loud voices coming from the island.
        In the channel, yang Shan seemed to know a lot about the four Seas group. He sent a message,""The SI Hai Group not only has a huge fleet that travels the four Seas, but their headquarters is also a well-known place for entertainment and squandering."
        "Here, there are casinos, brothels, underground arenas, you can find anything you want! This is also a good place to spend money. They sell special products from the four continents and even sea demons ... There's nothing you can't think of, but there's nothing they can't do. "
        "Actually, many people know that this is also a trading ground for Pirates ..."
        Li Hao sent a message, Pirates dare to trade near stellarsky city?
        "What's the big deal!"
        Yang Shan was not surprised and said,"they didn't enter the city. Even if they did, as long as they behave, no one will care! Besides, there's also a security guarantee when dealing with the SI Hai Group, but the SI Hai Group will take a very High Commission ... But it's nothing for Pirates, since it's a business without capital!"
        "The most famous thing here is actually the auction house ... Let's not talk about all the treasures, hehe, they even auction women ... Hehehe, there are all kinds of women here, whatever you want, whatever type you want. They have a good appetite ... Even the demon race is fine!"
        The current demon race could not transform.
        The demon race could do it too ...
       
        Li Hao shuddered and sneered."Isn't it just a bigger den of thieves? That's a good thing, this means that you have a lot of money and treasures!"
        After saying that, he took out the mirror fragment. A special energy spread toward the island in the distance.
        Li Hao quickly approached. This thing had a limited range.
        But with this thing, he could see everything ... Li Hao could see superpowers, but he couldn't see martial masters. He wanted to check if there were many martial masters here and if there were any extremely powerful martial masters.
        To avoid being schemed against.
        He wanted to attack the SI Hai Group. If it was the financial division, he would have already calculated it and set up an ambush for him ... That would be a big loss.
        When Li Hao was close to the island, the mirror finally revealed the island's interior.
        This Island wasn't small, and only a part of it was revealed.
        Li Hao saw many things in the mirror, many times clearer than the naked eye.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Outside the island, there were patrols everywhere.
         Some of them were even wearing the uniforms of the inspection Division and the night patrol, some military uniforms, and the personal guards of the Financial Secretary ...
        The security was tight!
        On the island, there was a port with a large number of ships.
        Apart from that, the entire Island seemed to have a faint defensive barrier. It was very weak, but once one entered, they might be discovered instantly.
        At this moment, Li Hao suddenly raised his head and saw a Big Bird flying in the sky.
        Li Hao's expression changed slightly, and he quickly sent a message: "Sink to the bottom of the sea!"
        They quickly sank to the bottom of the sea. Li Hao was still a little surprised."The defense is really tight. Not to mention the land, there are also small demons patrolling in the air ..."
        As he said this, he thought of something and quickly scanned the surroundings. As expected, there were some light spots in the sea.
        "Perhaps there are still sea demons patrolling in the sea ... Where did so many little demons come from?!"
        Li Hao frowned slightly. The SI hai organization was really on high alert.
        There were patrols in the sea, on land, and in the sky.
        If he wasn't careful, he would probably be discovered, and might attract powerhouses very quickly.
        "According to the information I obtained from the nine Dragons Pavilion, the boss of the four Seas Corporation is Wu Yong, who is in the transformation stage. Under him, there are four vice presidents of the Chamber of Commerce who are in charge of the four Seas business. They are all at the rising light realm, and their combat strength is usually from the late stage to the peak stage ... In addition, there are also the captains of the four Seas 'guard team ... Sometimes they are out on missions, and sometimes they stay here ... Including Wu Yong, there are a total of nine rising light realm experts!"
        This was all the high-end combat power of the SI hai organization.
        Weak?
        Not weak at all!
        A total of nine sunguang, and one in the transformation stage, with the Financial Secretary's back, this strength was not weak.
        "They might not all be here ... But at least two or three of them will stay behind ... It would be even better if they are all here!"
        While Li Hao explained to them, he continued to check the mirror fragments.
        At this moment, he had already detected a building.
        There were quite a few supers here. Some were resting, some were playing cards ... They should be guards, not much of a threat.
        Li Hao raised his head and looked at the island.
        He saw some balls of light and locked onto their positions. He continued,""This time, we'll capture them all in one fell swoop!"
         “……”  The few people from Southern Fist were stunned. Catch them all in one fell swoop?
        Don't mess around!
        How could such a Big Island do it?
        It was impossible to escape in all four directions. One must know that this Island was not small. Even if four people each guarded one side, they might not be able to keep all of them here. Moreover, they had to be careful of being besieged by others.
        Li Hao continued,"it's fine. Don't worry. This treasure of mine can create a cage-like thing and cover the entire Island ... Of course, it can block the Sunglow in a small area, but in a large area, even the three suns can break it ... So, as long as we kill all the Sunglow and the three suns, the others won't be able to escape!"
        Even red beard and a few sunrises couldn't break it during the transformation. It was just that it was expensive and needed divine power stones to support it.
        Nan Quan's teeth were aching as he sent a message,'you want to kill them all? On this Island, I'm afraid there are tens of thousands of people ..."
        "How could it be!"
        Li Hao laughed."There must be some aristocrats from stellarsky city on this Island. We are law enforcement, not thieves! You can't just kill them all just because they're here for fun and a bet. Wouldn't that offend them?"
        You also know that!
        "Capture them all and make their families pay the ransom! At the same time, he could let them identify the SI Hai Group and write a confession letter. With these people's identification, if he captured some Pirates alive ... The SI Hai group's crime would be confirmed! We're not bandits. Remember, we're a law enforcement agency!"
        He repeated again!
        He couldn't kill randomly. He had to have evidence to stand firm.
        "In addition, we must prevent them from using communication jades to communicate ... I don't know if communication is possible since it's blocked ... But we must be prepared for this. It'll only take a dozen minutes for experts to rush here from stellarsky city ... During this time, we must kill all the bandits who dare to resist!"
        "Understood!"
        Nan Quan laughed,"I didn't expect you to be more vigilant than before ..."
        "Be careful, it's no big deal!"
        After saying that, Li Hao sent a message."Senior Qin Lian, you're skilled in dark-type abilities. You and black Panther will be responsible for killing all the experts who have escaped. Senior Nan Quan and yang Shan will be responsible for killing the experts on the island ... I'll locate everyone!"
        As for himself, he would hide his strength first and see if any martial masters would suddenly appear on the island. Powerful martial masters were the biggest trouble.
        After quickly making some arrangements, Li Hao finally looked at the Black Panther. The Black Panther had an innocent look on its face. Li Hao looked at it. "Later, I'll ask you to release the power of your bloodline. Quickly release it ... And suppress all the demons! The demons inside and outside the island will instantly go out of control!"
        Heibao's ability could not be left unused. It was a good ability.
        The Black Panther nodded its big head. It had eaten a lot of food, so of course it had to work. It understood this principle.
         Besides, if he robbed a big one, he could eat more next time.
        At this moment, Li Hao began to wait.
        Later, the sky would be darker.
        ……
        On the four-Island Island.
        The experts felt a faint sense of uneasiness at this moment. It was very weak, but they still patrolled the area and found nothing. Even the bird demons in the sky and the sea demons in the sea didn't give any feedback.
        The special formation that covered the island didn't move at all.
        This time, he felt a lot more at ease.
        The SI Hai Group was a powerful organization. Who would dare to provoke them?
        Hou Xiaochen, who wanted to take care of the Heavenly Star Douluo arena, was now suffering a loss. He was about to become the laughingstock of the Heavenly Star City.
       
        Darkness enveloped the area.
        The sea breeze whistled.
        However, the island was very lively.
        The lights were bright, the women's laughter, the men's shouts, the gamblers 'clamoring, and the passionate audience around the arena.
        In the city, they were more or less apprehensive.
        The sky Star City was an Imperial City after all. Although there were some soundproofing measures, no one dared to shout too loudly even in the sky Star Douluo arena.
        However, at this place, their cries resounded through the world.
        What did it matter?
        This place was still more than fifty miles away from the shore. After the sound of the waves, there was no sound at all. No one would care about them. The noble ladies and young masters, who usually had five or six people, could unscrupulously vent all their desires and energy here.
        As long as you have money, you are the boss here!
         Even the Pirates of traversing Four Seas would be thrown out if they had no money here.
        But even if you have money, you're still a boss.
        Strength?
        Strength was useless here. No matter how strong they were, could they be stronger than the four Seas Chamber of Commerce?
        Could it be better than the financial division?
        As for Li Hao and hou Xiaochen ... Many of them didn't even know about this. They hadn't gone out for several days and had been staying in this money-squandering cave. They didn't have time to care about these things.
        Who would dare to provoke the nine divisions?
        No one dared to!
        Yes, this was what many people were thinking.
        Without anyone realizing it, a thin layer of mist was invading and enveloping the entire Island.
        ……
        Li Hao continued to burn money.
        One hundred, five hundred, one thousand ...
        The copper mirror shard was emitting a faint mist, just like that day in the Xu family's Treasury. It began to release a special defensive shield, but this time it was not for protection, but to trap the enemy.
        Last time, this thing had stopped a powerhouse in the metamorphosis stage. This time, Li Hao only hoped that it could stop those below the three suns.
        He continued to expand, wanting to devour this Island that wasn't too big.
        In the air, the bird demon seemed to have sensed something.
        In the sea, some sea demons also seemed to have sensed something. The Sixth Sense of the demon race was more sensitive than that of humans, and they could vaguely sense that some danger was approaching.
        Just as the eyes of a bird demon blinked, and it was about to call out to warn the others ...
        Suddenly, his hair stood on end!
        A sense of fear that came from his bones and blood vessels spread throughout his body.
        King!
        It was an innate fear. The difference in level and bloodline made the little bird demon forget to call or even move.
        Huala!
        He fell down.
        It wasn't just one. At this moment, hundreds of little bird demons that were densely packed in all directions fell in an instant.
        On the island.
        A giant bird suddenly had its hair standing on end and its wings stretching out ...
        The person who was serving it was a little confused and asked carefully,""King Bird ... Are you alright?"  The giant bird didn't move and prostrated on the ground.
        At this moment, a sense of fear came from deep within his bones.
        A Greater Demon was coming!
        A high-level demon, and ... A demon with an extremely noble bloodline, was here.
        Ancient Fey!
        It was not just the ancient demon. If it was an ordinary ancient demon descendant, it would not be like this. It was an extremely noble existence among the ancient demons. The big bird's bloodline was also not simple. The more complex it was, the more fear it felt.
        In his mind, a word seemed to be echoing ... Demon subduing envoy!
        He controlled all the demons in the world!
        It was a mark left behind in the bloodline, telling the descendants that ancient Fey also had Kings.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The giant bird trembled and trembled.
        The ancient era had already been destroyed!
        At this moment, not only the big Bird, but many demonic beasts on the island also prostrated, and many demonic beasts instantly lost control.
        ,m In the Colosseum.  The two demon beasts suddenly went crazy and rushed toward the crowd. The powerhouse who was maintaining the order instantly punched at the giant demon and shouted,""Are you crazy? they're our guests. D * MN it, what are you doing?"
        These demons had an agreement with them.
        The demon race came here to earn money, and they also relied on the demon race to earn money. However, there was an agreement that they could not harm these guests. But at this moment, a three yang great demon went crazy!
        "Roar!"
        The huge Lion demonic beast roared. Its eyes were bloodshot, and its fur stood on end as if it had been provoked.
        It was a kind of fear, a kind of fear.
        However, it didn't know where it came from, so it could only go crazy and attack in all directions. It bit at the expert who came at it, but it didn't reply. It just madly bit. This place was so dangerous, and it wanted to escape!
        ……
        Li Hao didn't expect that the Black Panther's bloodline, which had been activated and released without restraint, would have such an effect.
        It just so happened that there were many demonic beasts on this Island.
        At this moment, the entire Island was in chaos.
        "Quickly go to the Colosseum ... The demons are rioting!"
        "Damn it, I told you that these demons aren't easy to tame. We shouldn't have let them in ..."
        "Shut up!"
        "Someone come quickly! There's a demonic beast riot in demonic beast Street!"
         "Damn it, why is there a riot over there? What's going on?"
        “……”
        In an instant, the entire Island was in chaos. A large number of experts flew out quickly. Groups of uniformed law-enforcement officers rushed to various places. On the island, some demons began to riot, and the smell of blood instantly spread out.
        At this moment, not many people paid attention to the looming white fog in the sky.
        There would be fog in the sea too.
        Normally, they would be more concerned, but in the blink of an eye, a large number of demons were rioting, and these people had no time to care about anything else.
        ……
        In the middle of the island.
        A six-story building stood tall, which was not low on this Island.
        At this moment, a few sunrises appeared quickly. Someone said in a low voice,""What's going on?"
       
        "My Lord, the demons are rebelling!"
        "Bastard!"
        A moment later, a golden-haired brawny man walked over with a serious expression. He frowned and looked at the crowd."Why is the demon race rebelling? We have an agreement with them to provide them with what they need ... It's a win-win cooperation, what the hell are you doing!"
        "What did the wind bird King say?"
        The next moment, someone ran in and said hurriedly,""Sir, the king Bird has suddenly been provoked. There are some problems and it's ignoring us no matter how much we shout ..."
        The blonde man frowned.
        Just as he was about to go over to take a look, he suddenly looked up. In the sky, a faint mist shrouded over. He frowned and looked at the sky. He vaguely felt that something was wrong. Was there fog?
        "Is there fog on the sea today?"
        "I don't know. It wasn't reported."
        The golden-haired guy frowned."The demon clan is in a riot and there's a sudden fog ... The president told us to be careful before he left ... Could it be that someone did this on purpose?"
         After some thought, he took out a communication Jade and was about to send a message.
        Something wasn't right!
        Of course, he couldn't tell what was wrong, but the four islands were in a mess now, and the demon race was also in a riot. Perhaps he should call the president back ... Although the president was defending the Douluo arena against the enemy's attack, hadn't li Hao already left?
        As he sent the message, he shouted,""Everyone, don't worry. There's been a small change on the island, but it will be dealt with soon! Everyone can play, eat, and drink as they please ... It won't affect everyone!"
        His voice reverberated in all directions.
        Some people didn't take it seriously and just watched it for fun.
        In a luxuriously decorated hotel, a man leaned against the window and looked down at the chaos below. He laughed and said,""Interesting, interesting! That's how it should be. Next time, it should be played this way. Make some violent demonic beasts to kill those ordinary people ... No, supers! We can bet on who will live to the end and who will die the fastest. Hahaha, that's more interesting, that's a man's game!"
        "That's right, over at the Colosseum, there are a few demons putting on a show for us to see every day. They think we're blind, I don't even want to go there anymore! I've been fighting for half a day, but I didn't even die. I'm almost tired of playing!"
        "Who said it wasn 't!"
        The man's words caused many people to echo him. Many people looked down at the chaotic area and laughed.
        This was interesting!
        The guards on the island were quickly suppressing the demon clan's riot. It was extremely chaotic. Many people were running away, but there were also many who believed that the four Seas Chamber of Commerce could suppress it. Not only did they not run away, but they also came closer to watch the show and laughed.
        Wasn't this better than the demons acting?
        Isn't this better than watching superpowers fight?
        This was even better than playing with women!
        A group of people laughed out loud. Regardless of whether they were men or women, they were all watching excitedly. When someone saw the demons tearing apart the guards, not only was he not afraid, but he also shouted madly,"Beautifully torn! I knew it, I knew that The Lion King's tear is first-class. F * ck, in the past, I put on an act every day and the sunlight couldn't tear it apart. Look, now the sunlight superpower is not torn apart in the blink of an eye!"
        "That's right, kill them! Hahaha, Leo King, kill them all!"
        A group of nobles shouted in a frenzy.
        "Move!" A guard roared.
         The demons were on a rampage!  These idiots were still shouting. The more they shouted, the more agitated the demons were.
        "Who are you talking to?" one of the nobles was furious. Call Wu Yong out. Even if he came, he wouldn't dare to talk to me like this. Do you know who I am?"
        The guard could only quickly shut his mouth. He could not afford to offend them.
        However, he was still extremely angry.
        A bunch of bastards!
        Seeing their comrades being torn apart, these people were all very angry. However, at this moment, they didn't dare to really kill the demons. They could only suppress it by force. More and more powerful cultivators joined in, barely suppressing these demons.
        At this moment, the golden-haired man in the distance suddenly frowned.
        He took out his communication Jade and checked it. The message he sent ... Didn't seem to have been sent out.
       This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He looked at the people behind him."You guys try to send a message to the outside. I don't seem to be able to send a message out. What's going on?"
        The others began to experiment.
        The next moment, someone hurriedly said,"no!"
        The golden-haired man immediately frowned.
        Not good!
        At this moment, an extremely cold voice was heard,"the night patrolmen will enforce the law. Everyone, surrender and squat down. Anyone who resists will be killed without mercy!"
        One of the customers was stunned for a moment before he burst out laughing."F * ck, are you acting? The night patrol is here to enforce the law ... Hahaha, this is too F * cking funny ... Can the night patrol enforce the law to this extent?"
        "Hahaha!"
        Many people laughed along.
        This was the SI hai Corporation.
         Someone laughed wildly."You don't even know how to act. The Financial Secretary is in charge of the law. This place is not under the control of the night patrol. Stupid ..."
        BOOM!
        As soon as he finished speaking, a huge fist fell from the sky!
        At this moment, the golden-haired man and the others didn't smile at all. They were shocked. At this moment, they all attacked. The golden-haired man even roared,"Enemy attack!"
        "Those who resist law enforcement will be killed!"
        BOOM!
        A pair of iron fists fell. Southern Fist, who was wearing a bronze armor, was unsealed ... Yes, he unsealed his combat power and broke three superpower locks. Since Li Hao was there, he could still get some benefits if Li Hao helped him repair them later.
        The southern Fist didn't engage in a losing business.
        The explosive power of the southern Fist was unbelievably strong. When it was thrown out, there was a loud bang.
        Someone recognized the golden-haired expert in the sky. He was the president of the eastern sea Chamber of Commerce of the four Seas business group, a peak stage rising light expert.
       
        However, at that moment ... As everyone laughed and ruminated, he was punched and exploded. Blood and flesh exploded.
        Dumbfounded!
        Shocking!
        At this moment, there was no fear, because there was no time for fear. Countless people on the entire Island stared blankly at the copper-armored warrior who had covered his entire body.
        He blew up an expert at the peak of the rising light realm with one punch!
        "President!"
        Some people were terrified. The next moment, several powerhouses of the rising light flew into the sky one after another. They weren't chasing after Nan Quan, but rather, they were fleeing.
        They knew better than the guests what had happened.

        "Night patrolman ... Demonic sword!"
         "The Silver Moon Martial Master!"
        Some people knew something and were instantly terrified.
        At this moment, a long blade cut through the void in the darkness. Yang Shan killed one of the dawns on the spot. In the distance, Qin Lian appeared in the darkness. Like an assassin, she pierced through one of the dawns with her sword.
        In the blink of an eye, the three Sunglow were killed on the spot.
        "Run!"
        Some people lost control and shouted madly.
        "The demonic sword is coming!"
        Many people were confused, but at this moment, they also realized that something was wrong. It didn't seem to be ... An act.
        In an instant, the two of them broke through the smoke and rushed out.
        It directly dove into the sea!
        They didn't dare to fly. They didn't know how many people were coming. They didn't know how many experts were outside. They knew that flying was probably the most dangerous and stupid thing to do.
        However ... Just as they entered the sea, a claw pierced through a person's heart.
        On the other side, Li Hao wielded his bronze mirror and slashed out. Sword Qi swept out and instantly killed an early stage rising light realm cultivator.
        Li Hao chuckled, wearing silver armor.
        He walked into the island step by step with a smile on his face.
        It seemed ... Easier than he had expected.
        These guys actually treated it as an act and a joke.
        Of course, what was even more amazing was that Black Panther had actually caused a riot among the demon race on the island. This was the key.
        In the blink of an eye, 5 Sunglow were killed.
        On the other side, there were only nine of them. Wu Yong was not here, and the other three ... Were not here either!
        The peak of the rising light who was killed by the southern Fist was the strongest.
        The president of the eastern sea Chamber of Commerce.
        The other three presidents were not there.
        In other words, the battle had ended before it even started.
        The five experts who had stayed behind were all killed in the blink of an eye.
        Of course, Li Hao knew that there were more sunrises on the island.
        The number of orbs he saw wasn't just this.  There were five more!
        There were a total of 10 sunguangs, but the other five might not be from the four Seas Chamber of Commerce.
        In the distance, the southern Fist was floating in the air.
        "Everyone, don't move! If you dare to move again, kill without mercy!"
        The next moment, a punch landed!
        BOOM!
        With a loud bang, an old man flew up into the air. His body was covered in flames, and a powerful force swept in all directions with some fear and anger.""Who are you? Night patrolman? I'm the Division of Administration ..."
        "Surrender! Otherwise.......Kill without mercy!"
        "Die!" Nan Quan shouted coldly. The Nan Quan that was used in battle was not like its usual self. With a punch, there was a loud boom that shook the heavens and earth. The old man was very strong and was also at the peak of the rising light realm. However, under the Nan Quan's punch, his bones were broken in the blink of an eye and he was heavily smashed to the ground!
        At this time, far away, at the edge of the island, a person was trying to escape quietly.
        With a buzzing sound, a large blade struck out. Water and fire alternated. The person who was killed by the large blade roared in fear,""Transformation? I'm ..."
        Puchi!
        The head fell to the ground!
        On the other side, the old man at the peak of the rising light Stage also fell heavily to the ground and kept spitting out blood. With a look of horror and despair, he kept coughing out blood."Southern ... Southern Fist ..." He cried.
        Southern Fist revealed his face and sighed.""I didn't kill you ... You're so hard!"
        "I'm ... The administration Division ..."
        "Those who resist law enforcement, those who resist law with violence ... Shall be killed without mercy!"
        BOOM!
        With a single punch, the old man was completely crushed.
        All around them, there was a moment of silence.
        In the distance, a noble young master seemed to be very frightened, but the next moment, he seemed to be very surprised. He hurriedly shouted,""Coach he, it's me, it's me ... Is the imperial family here? I'm ..."
        Bang!
        Nan Quan threw a punch across the air and directly blew up the person. His voice was cold and indifferent."Are you all deaf? Don't move! If he moved, he would die! The night patrolmen will enforce the law. No one is to move, or else, they will be your role model!"
        "My father ..."
        Bang! Bang!
        The sound of explosions continued. Some people wanted to talk about their family background, but Nanquan was extremely ruthless. With a punch, they exploded.
         "No matter what your family background is, what clan you come from, what background you have ... Right now, you are all prisoners!"
        Nan Quan's voice resounded in all directions."Don't try to escape in vain. Don't even think about sending a message. It's useless!"
        His voice was cold."There are still three sunguangs hiding in the crowd. Do you want me to find you or come out by yourself? now, come out and stand in front of me. Kneel down and I'll spare your lives!"
        The crowd was in an uproar for a moment.
        A moment later, a strong man walked out step by step. He looked at Nanquan, then at the nearby Island, at the mysterious big saber transformation, the peak of the rising light of the dark element, and at the unpredictable danger outside the island. He chose to stand out.
        He didn't say much, he didn't say anything, he walked to Nan Quan and knelt down.
        Dignity?
        Can dignity be eaten?
        Dignity ... Was nothing at this moment.
        Under the watchful eyes of a transcendent master, a transcendent master, and a peak expert, the so-called dignity was worthless.
