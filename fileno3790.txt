The third generation of time cultivators descended upon the chaos.However, he was a little unexpected. Although he caused quite a stir, he was humble ...When they thought of the word 'humble', the group of people felt a little out of place.The crowd wasn't stupid.To be able to kill his way out of a new world and become the master of the myriad world, he must be humble ... Perhaps, but he shouldn't be too pedantic. His strength shouldn't be weak either. Otherwise, how could he rise up in the world?Everyone was still on guard.Of course, this was due to his strength.The opponent's strength was on par with Li Hao 's, and today, all the level 9 cultivators had arrived. Huntian was also a top expert, not weaker than the level 9 cultivators at the moment.But when he felt the power of order returning, he felt a little more at ease.As long as he could last for a while and become stronger, he would not be afraid even if the other party had a plan.As long as the power of order wasn't a big problem, it was fine. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Ordinary problems wouldn't affect him.At his level, even if the other party's power of order was mixed with a large amount of power of great DAOs that could poison and kill a stage eight, it would still be impossible to poison him, an expert who was infinitely close to stage nine.Huntian was much more at ease now.Su Yu smiled and said,""Everyone, we, the cultivators of the myriad world, have just arrived and have no intention of becoming enemies with you. If you have any needs, please state them and try to satisfy them as much as possible. Our worlds have been at war for many years, and it's hard to find peace. Long live peace. After many years of war, the Kings of the worlds are exhausted and unwilling to fight anymore ..."With a sigh, he told everyone that it wasn't that our ten thousand worlds were powerless to fight. It was just that we had fought for too many years. Now, the hearts of the people were looking to the back and seeking peace.The primal Chaos aura was strong, and he had no intention of fighting in all directions.There was some credibility to his words.After saying this, in the distance, venerable sovereign calamity's eyes suddenly flickered and he chuckled,""That's interesting. Do you know why so many people came today? Do you know that we are all here for you?""Seniors, weren't you originally here ..." Su Yu was puzzled."No!""Of course not!" Jie Nan sneered. If you ask us what we want, it's simple. Just give us the time under your feet!"This person wasn't weak and could control time. It wouldn't be a problem to kill him.The key was that chaos was everywhere. Huntian, renwang, Chunqiu, and the others were on par with them, but they weren't on the same side.In a chaotic battle ... He might not be able to get time.If this person was really willing to hand over time ... Then things would be much simpler.Of course, if this person pretended to be crazy and was unwilling to hand it over ... Then it could also be clear what the other party's goal was."Shi Guang?" "Oh?" Su Yu stepped on the stars under his feet."You mean the long river path?"Frowning slightly, he said,"this Dao is the foundation of our myriad worlds. Senior, your request is a little too much. We are not afraid of war, but we do not want to provoke war. Order can be given, but time can not! This is the foundation of the river, the foundation of the myriad realms ... Of course, if there is a great Dao of equal strength to exchange with my myriad realms and support the myriad realms, I will not be stingy! This Dao ... Is ominous!"He shook his head slightly, as if he was afraid. He frowned slightly, and with his weak body, he looked like a scholar who had heard bad news.Ominous?Everyone was stunned. Time was ... Ominous?Su Yu continued,"I see that the great Dao of all the seniors here is powerful. I'm afraid that it's much stronger than mine. If anyone is willing to exchange their great Dao with mine, they can support the Foundation of the myriad worlds. It's not impossible to give them this time!"The crowd frowned again.At this moment, in the distance, Chunqiu appeared. She was even more petite now, like a three or four-year-old child. Her voice was much more tender."You can 't!"The level nine venerable sovereigns looked over quickly with cold eyes!"Do you know how much Li Hao paid to create the infinite worlds?" Spring Autumn was anxious and angry. These people won't let you off. Li Hao killed too many people, including their clones ..."Su Yu raised his hand to interrupt him and chuckled."I was wondering what it would be like, Li Hao ... That wasn't me. Don't mention the origin of the myriad worlds. I'm not his successor, either. I'm just an ordinary human in the myriad worlds who has gone through life and death to reach where I am today. What this young friend is talking about ... Has little to do with me."Little friend?Spring Autumn was stunned. In the next moment, he felt a little angry!I'm small, so I'm a little friend?This person ... Was he really stupid or just pretending to be stupid?Bastard!Why would that idiot Li Hao let this person control time?p She had thought that once the New World was out, Li Hao could be recalled and quickly become the time King, or even a level nine Dao vindication. Good Lord ... Li Hao was nowhere to be seen, and this person ... Didn't look very smart.Of course, his strength was still alright.However, at this moment, more than 20 rank nines had arrived. Spring Autumn felt helpless and hopeless. These people had arrived ... Earlier and faster than she had expected, even though she believed that she could fight one person without any pressure.After all, these grade-9 experts were not at the peak.But ... What was the use?Even if he and the human King joined forces, there would only be two of them. Even if neo martial, Silver Moon, and spring and autumn joined forces, would they be able to deal with one or two?In total, excluding chaotic heaven, the combined forces of the three chaos factions could only deal with three to five rank nines.He was still at tier 9!There was no way to change anything.At this moment, she could only place her hopes on roping in this person. This person had many experts under him and had inherited time. If he had some of Li Hao's schemes, he could at least put up some resistance before time was taken away, even if he could not kill anyone.

Chapter 3791 The Darkness Dissipated_ 2
However, once time was gone ... This bunch of people would not be enough!Even if there were many grade 8 ones, they weren't enough.In the eyes of Tian Fang and the others, even if they couldn't kill a rank 8 with one punch, they could kill one with a few more punches.In his heart, he cursed countless times.Stupid Li Hao!No, it should be the crazy Li Hao. Why did he give up on time?Look at the current situation ... Could it be that you're counting on a little fellow to reverse the situation?Li Hao, aren't you stronger than this person?Placing your hopes in the hands of a group of people from the future who don't know the situation ... Li Hao, you're completely out of your mind!She looked at the human King, hoping that he would speak up as well. It would be best if he could change the situation.As for the human King, he was just watching silently, as if he was observing something. He didn't make a sound, as if he was a bystander. It was as if he was afraid of those grade-9 human Kings. The arrogant and domineering human King wasn't arrogant at all.On the contrary, he was much more low-key. Until now, there was almost no movement, and he did not speak."Human King, are you afraid?"Chunqiu looked around and suddenly felt sad.It turns out that ... I'm the only one who still wants to turn the tide and defeat a level nine. It turns out that the human King has given up, and Li Hao has simply disappeared. I don't know if he's disheartened and has found a place to spend the rest of his life, but I haven't seen Li Hao yet.At this moment, she suddenly looked at huntian and shouted,""Huntian!"Others may not say, but what about you?Are you going to watch this person hand Shi Guang over?This person thinks that you are the Emperor of this place, and perhaps ... Only you can stop him!……Huntian was still absorbing the power of order at this moment. As the power of order entered his body, the power of Chaos, which had been growing more vigorous, began to calm down.He heaved a sigh of relief.His combat strength had not improved, but his realm had been completely stabilized. He could break through to tier 9 at any time.All of a sudden, he felt much more at ease.At this moment, he looked at Tian Fang and the others, then at Su Yu, and chuckled. He was no longer as fearful as before, and his laughter had returned to its usual calm."Little friend ... No, Emperor Yu!"He laughed."Emperor Yu, don't be fooled by these people. They are all survivors of the chaos that was destroyed a million years ago. They exploited the chaos to fish and absorb the spirit of chaos. At this moment, they have not recovered their peak combat strength. They are all ninth-grade powerhouses! Once they take control of time and stabilize the primordial chaos, they'll be able to completely recover their battle prowess ... I'm afraid that even I won't be a match!""Huntian, do you really think you're an Emperor?" Jie Nan sneered. Are you worthy? Also ... If you hand over time today, you might still have a way out. If you don't ... Do you think that someone who walked out of this new world can survive?" If he handed it over, he would be able to avoid a battle.Even if they didn't hand it over, they still had to snatch it!At this level, time might not collapse so quickly.Above the long river, Su Yu, who was stepping on the stars, nodded slightly, as if he had understood something."I see ... Ninth-grade ..."At this point, he was slightly puzzled."The division of strength in the myriad world is somewhat different from that in the chaos. This level nine ... What kind of strength does he have?"Huntian was much friendlier at this moment."Emperor Yu, you don't know. Chaos cultivates 10000 Dao laws. Above 9000 Dao laws is Grade 9!" In my opinion, Emperor Yu is on par with Silver Moon King Li Hao. He has cultivated about 5000 Dao laws, which makes him a level eight expert. Anyone above 2000 Dao laws is considered a level eight expert. However, Emperor Yu's Dao laws are powerful and have formed Rules of Order. He probably has the power of 8000 Dao laws. In the chaos, he's considered one of the top experts!"At this moment, Su Yu seemed to have completely understood."I see. I understand a little now ... In that case, there are at least 20 nomological great DAOs out of the 2000 Dao laws in our myriad world. However ... Our myriad world Dao laws are even stronger. It should be more or less the 16 great DAOs ... That is ... A first-class nomological master!"He had completely understood.He nodded.It didn't matter if the others didn't understand. He didn't care. He turned back to look, compared them, and nodded slightly. So that was the case.He understood.A first-class master of the natural order was not weak. In the past, only some of the peak experts of the ten thousand races were considered first-class, and they were all overlords of various realms.So it was only grade 8 here.  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  At their peak, there were dozens of first-class Masters of rules in the myriad realms. Of course, many had died, but many had been born. Now, there were still dozens, which was not considered weak.It had given birth to dozens of level eight venerable sovereigns ... It was still acceptable.From the looks of it, our ten thousand races aren't weak.Su Yu laughed.Of course, the difference between level 8 and level 8 was also huge. Between 2000 to 9000, they were all level 8. This difference ... Was really huge. The group of people in front of him were all level 9.Su Yu was also secretly speechless.That's quite a lot!More than 20.No wonder that old bastard Shi Guang was such a scammer. Not only did he run around, he even dragged him along. He was starting to understand now. Was he just looking for someone to take the bullet for?This pit was a Little Big!At this moment, the sun god in the distance was a little worried. He wanted to say something, but he was held back by the Supreme martial artist, who shook his head.The sun god was a little suspicious.At this moment, the situation was very dangerous. He was actually very familiar with this group of people in front of him. Although his previous memories were not very clear, as time passed, his memories became clearer.Back then, it was this group of people who had taught him many things.Right now, they had walked out of a new world, and the situation was very bad.

Chapter 3792 The Darkness Dissipated_ 3
He wanted to give a few words of advice, but Zhang Tao stopped him.Why?Of course, he also knew that Zhang Tao had many plans. Although he was puzzled at this moment, he suppressed some of the worries in his heart."Su Yu," the catastrophe said again,"since you know the difference, give up the Dao of time. That's your only chance of survival. Otherwise ..."Su Yu looked at him, not angry, but a little confused.""May I ask ... What's your honorific name?""Tribulation!"Venerable sovereign calamity smiled faintly."Calamity?" Su Yu was stunned and nodded slightly."Calamity ... Sounds familiar ..."Familiar?  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  The Lord of calamity was somewhat puzzled.Did it have a spirit that remembered him?Or why?What Su Yu was thinking was,"tribulation ..." This name is not good. I was once called the Tribulation of all races, the ancestor of the Tribulation, the Tribulation of all heavens and realms ... You also called it this. This is a conflict!He looked around once more and confirmed that the time King wasn't here.He was a little disappointed.He really didn't come!It looks like you want to see me become a beauty?Or why?As for the other party running away, it shouldn't be. Su Yu looked back at the floating Earth Spirit that controlled the five elements and smiled. At this moment, he seemed to have sensed something. At this moment, the simple and honest little floating Earth's eyes seemed to change.This quick-witted ghost was always a step slower than others in everything he did, but in the end, he managed to reach where he was now. He walked out of the floating soil of the myriad world and controlled the myriad world's five elements. It seemed ... Perhaps, it had something to do with that guy.He didn't really care about it.It was no big deal. Time had opened up a long river and nurtured the myriad worlds. It was nothing to leave behind a few tricks. He would never care about these things. In those years, he had taken advantage of time quite a lot.Although Fu tu was one of the core members, he was not the most core member. Su Yu did not care whether he was there or not.It was the best result for old Wan, LAN Tian, and the others to be fine.Before he left, he had thought that many people would awaken, but now it seemed that only a few would. Everything was within his tolerance. It seemed that time was really free and easy, and didn't leave too many traces.He listened to these people's words carefully.He quickly judged the situation.This human King and the time King should be on the same side. After all, they had inherited the same heritage. As for that little brat, his true form was a Greater Demon. He could be considered to be on the same side, albeit barely. However, their relationship shouldn't be too close.Huntian and the group of grade-9 experts were probably competitors, but they also cooperated.He quickly deduced the relationship between this group of people.Then, he looked at the crowd and saw the human King and his group, who were the only familiar ones ... He had once observed the rise of neo martial.This human Emperor...Wasn't some kind soul. He was a man of many words. But today, he didn't say a single word. From the looks of it, he was just like Shi Guang and wanted to see how good I was, right?He could easily see through the thoughts of this group of people.'If you can't do it ... It's fine if you get killed. If you have some ability, then we'll be considered a group.'Su Yu sighed and looked around.""The myriad world has been at war for many years. Peace is hard to come by. In fact, I have never controlled the way of time. However, the way of the myriad world stands above time. Once time is handed over, it will be very troublesome if you don't talk about the exchange!"Of course, the Dao of time was the core.However, ever since he opened the sky on his own, the river of time had also been almost completely drained by him.And now, the space civilization was his root.As for Shi Guang ... She had been a sheep for so many years now ... She was pretty frail as well.At this moment, he looked at huntian and said softly,""Chaos Emperor, who has the final say in this land of chaos? If we can resolve the conflict and live in peace, if we can keep the worlds from collapsing, then it's not impossible to hand over the Dao of time ..."Huntian's heart moved.He glanced at the grade-9 experts.At this moment, some of the grade-9 experts had already started to transmit their voices,""Let's just kill him and not let another Li Hao who can't be controlled appear. If I'm worried that killing him will cause time to collapse ... In reality, I'm more inclined to believe that it won't collapse this time!""Me too. I think that the Dao of time has become the foundation of the myriad worlds. I'm afraid it has already materialized. Normally, after killing this person, there's a high chance that it won't collapse!""To avoid future trouble, it's better to kill him. Also, huntian is absorbing order. Once he enters level nine, it'll be troublesome. Why don't we kill him as well?""Not bad!"The group of Grade 9 experts all looked at Tian Fang.Even though everyone was suspicious of him, he was still the strongest. At this moment, everyone was waiting for Tian Fang's decision.Kill, or wait?There was not much point in waiting.,m It was better to just kill him!The great Dao of time had materialized into a River, no longer the river that no one had been able to see before. This meant that at this stage, the Dao had solidified. This also meant that ... Everyone could control it.The master of tianfang didn't say anything.Instead, he looked at Su Yu silently. At this moment, his doppelganger also began to return quickly and merge with his body. His aura was stronger than that of the other level nines, and he was not inferior to huntian, who had fused with order."We can't wait anymore. If we wait any longer, huntian will really enter grade-9. Everyone, since brother tianfang hasn't made a decision ... The minority will follow the majority. It's up to everyone to kill or wait!""Kill!""Kill!""I also agree to kill him ..."The group of venerable sovereigns quickly made a decision. Except for a few who were still a little uneasy, the others all agreed to kill Su Yu directly. They didn't care about anything else. The materialization of Chang 'e time was their greatest confidence.

Chapter 3793 The Darkness Dissipates (Part One)_4
There was a high probability that it would not collapse, and that was enough.The reason why he hadn't killed Li Hao before was because he was afraid that time would disappear completely. But now, he had no such concerns. What was there to worry about?Afraid of those eighth-grade cultivators?What a joke!No matter how many people there were, they were just ants!A group of rank-9s quickly began to approach the river. When huntian saw this scene, his eyes changed slightly, but he looked at the group of rank-8s behind Su Yu and did not say a word.Su Yu also saw it and frowned slightly.""Everyone, don't get too close. Chaos Emperor, what are these people trying to do? Doesn't Hundun have any rules?"Rules?The crowd only felt that it was ridiculous.Where did the rules come from?In this world, the fist was the rule.Huntian sighed."This group of people ... They do all kinds of evil. Where are the rules? chaos and order have collapsed. It's hard to have rules ...""This place ... Has no rules?"Su Yu seemed to be stunned for a moment, then sighed.""I see. I was wondering why this place was so filthy. It turns out that the rules are gone!"He chuckled.Without rules ... Does that mean that I, the most rule-abiding person, don't need to follow the rules?Understood!  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  It was a good thing. Since there are no rules, then whatever I say and do will be the rules.He looked at the people behind him and then at the experts who were rapidly approaching in front of him. He shook his head helplessly.He chuckled."I'm new here. I don't dare to be your enemy ... Forget it. I'll give time to you ... But I'm not giving it to you. You guys have too much ill intent towards me. If I give it to the chaos Emperor ..."With that, the river of time shook violently!Huntian's eyebrows shot up when he saw this!è‰¹!This was a bit ... Like how Li Hao had tricked chaos.At this moment, he was still absorbing the power of order. As for Shi Guang, she was the target of more than 20 type 9 true bodies. This was even more dangerous than the chaotic situation from before. He was not willing to take over this mess right now.Even if he wanted to!However, with the lesson of chaos, he didn't want it now. Even if he wanted it, it would be after he had completely absorbed all the power of order.He quickly dodged!"No, no..." He hurriedly said.Those grade-9 cultivators all looked at him with a smile that didn't look like a smile.Huntian was still tactful!In the distance, Chunqiu was furious. Since you don't want it, then give it to me! My spring and autumn clan has a limited lifespan. Since that trash huntian doesn't dare to take it, I'm willing to use this time to see if these Grade 9 experts can really kill me!"She recalled what Li Hao had said that day."Time is mine, and my clones will instantly recover to their peak."Alright! Since none of you are willing to stand up for me, I will. This time, I will beat everyone up!Go all out!Each and every one of them was usually extremely arrogant, but today, they all cowered?What kind of man is he!If you guys don't want it, I'll do it!She leaped and went straight for the river, shouting,""This King will take it!""Spring and autumn!""You're looking for death!"All the ninth level venerable sovereigns were furious."Even huntian doesn't dare to get involved in this mess. How dare you! I'll kill you too!"As for Su Yu, he looked at Chunqiu, who was flying toward him, and shouted,""She's just a woman, a small demon, and a non-human. How can she bear the weight of time? You can 't!"He looked a little angry. With a wave of his hand, the river shook, and the space trembled. The book of universe civilization appeared and scolded,""Conquering the world and conquering the world is a matter for men. It has nothing to do with women. They really ... Don't know what's good for them!"The space shook!It was as if time was spreading. In an instant, spring and autumn suddenly fluctuated. They were squeezed by space and deviated from their course. They actually rushed in the wrong direction. Spring and autumn was furious!Bastard!This guy actually discriminated against him.Even Li Hao didn't discriminate against him, but he did.At this moment, Emperor Yu sighed and shook his head. He started to extract the river of time and looked at the crowd that was advancing in the distance. "I'll just give it to you. Why do you have to be so malicious? I'm not the master of time, and I don't cultivate the Dao of time ..."As soon as he finished speaking, the star under his feet flew toward the crowd. He said,""No matter what, this is the first time we've left the world, and we have no grudges with you. Every debt has its debtor. If you want to find someone, you should find Li Hao, not me ..."At this moment, Spring Autumn was extremely angry!'You're a coward, a useless person, a good-for-nothing, you're actually ... Such a coward, giving me whatever I want. '"Su Yu, what kind of man are you?""Die!" Chun Qiu shouted in anger. He was extremely furious as he charged at the crowd once again. Since no one is resisting, I'll try!Was this Hundun really invincible at the ninth rank?Behind him, hundreds of millions of incarnations appeared. Su Yu took a look and didn't pay much attention to them. They were not as stunning as the blue sky and were boring.At the same time.A group of Grade 9 experts charged towards the planet, all of them overjoyed. He had really given it up!The third generation was indeed different from the second generation Li Hao!This time, it was too comfortable.At this moment, the group of grade-9 cultivators quickly communicated with each other,"Suppress time first. Don't rush to fight for it. Be careful of falling into his trap. One peach kills three warriors. Li Hao just used it last time. This time, let's get rid of this group of people first before distributing it. Besides, time is mainly used to stabilize chaos, not to control it. Whoever gets it will be the target of public criticism. Don't panic!"Someone was worried about internal strife and quickly sent a message!"I have no objections!""Me too!"A group of weaker rank-9s spoke up one after another, instantly forming an alliance. If they couldn't get it, then no one could control it alone. This time was best used to stabilize the chaos.

Chapter 3794 The Darkness Dissipates (Part 5)
Otherwise, who knew who would benefit from it? there was a high chance that it would be Tian Fang. In terms of strength, he was the strongest.In any case, if we can't enjoy it alone, then no one wants it.The river of time began to compress rapidly. In the blink of an eye, the originally mysterious river was compressed into a huge ball of light that fused into the interior of the time star.In an instant, the time star exploded with an extremely powerful aura, as if a rank nine venerable sovereign had descended.Everyone was overjoyed!The peak of the eighth rank!At this moment, they could truly sense that this time energy had truly reached the peak of rank eight. It might even grow to rank nine very soon.At that time, the chaos would be eternal!Grade 9, no longer in danger of being suppressed, no need to hide in the depths of the chaos great Dao.Su Yu, on the other hand, led the group of experts behind him and retreated quickly. He went straight to huntian, shaking his head. "He's really ... Brutal and rude. Killing people and snatching their treasures. I thought that this wouldn't happen with the omnipotent experts. Who would have thought that I'd be taught a lesson the moment I walked out? the heaven battering King still has the air of a King ..."Huntian frowned slightly, what are you doing here?This group of people would obviously not let this person off.He didn't want to start a war with them at this moment.He quickly retreated, his laughter still ringing,""Emperor Yu, you don't have to worry. Since I've given up time, it has nothing to do with you anymore ... They've always wanted to kill me. Emperor Yu, you're too close to me. Be careful not to get caught up in the crossfire ..."He found a Grand reason.Su Yu was stunned. He nodded and stopped walking. He thought for a while and said,""They ... They want to kill Chaos Emperor? He's really ... Extremely barbaric!"Are you really stupid or are you just pretending?Huntian frowned slightly. At this moment, the power of order in his body had already reached a peak. He was instantly overjoyed. He could feel the fusion of order and chaos!I'm about to reach the ninth step!He was the first cultivator to truly step into level nine in a million years.He was overjoyed!I've been pursuing it for many years, but I didn't expect to succeed today. It's much easier than I originally expected!Before this, what they pursued was a great unity, a strong will, and a strong order ...In the end, someone had helped him complete it!Yes, order had completed a grand unification in the infinite worlds.Therefore, it was also in line with the Dao of huntian. Although he was not the leader, there was no distinction between who was the leader of order. The unification of the infinite worlds was slightly worse than the unification of the chaos, but the difference was not too big.In addition, after chaos's death, he controlled chaos, and his great Dao became even stronger.Now that they had merged into one, he could feel a powerful will enveloping him. His spirituality suddenly increased. He was about to reach rank nine!Huntian was ecstatic!On the other side, the rank nine venerable sovereigns who were still rapidly suppressing the long river looked over one after another. Their gazes changed slightly, and Jie Nan cursed in a low voice,""Huntian ... Kill him first!"The group of people quickly split into two groups.Half of them stayed behind to suppress the river and stars, while the other half went straight for huntian!How can I let you reach grade nine!……Outside.The Grandmaster frowned. "Should we intervene?"The human King shook his head slightly and smiled."There's no rush. Wait a moment!"Still waiting?……At the edge of the four-sided domain.Li Hao was also watching. At this moment, he touched his chin, which had become much shorter, and seemed to be in deep thought.He seemed to have thought of something and frowned slightly.Is he playing such a big game?"I ... Still lack enough understanding of you."Li Hao mumbled. He knew too little.However, looking at the situation ... Perhaps, there would be some surprises that would surprise him.,m Suddenly, he smiled and muttered,"it's also your chance. Heibao ... You can move now."At this moment, the void seemed to fluctuate.Li Hao's gaze was fixed on one of the cultivators, a stage nine cultivator. One of them ... Had a brilliant five-colored Halo above his head. It was the stage nine five elements path master! n(0)velbIn[.]nEt He ignored everyone else and stared at the five-element path master for a while. Finally, he turned his gaze to the group of people behind Su Yu. Soon, he saw a young man!His eyes kept moving, and it seemed that he had more intelligence and less maturity.Li Hao couldn't help but laugh!No way?You ... How did you end up like this?He didn't care about anyone's life, but he did care about this person. He had nothing to worry about, and it was just a dream after all. He still had some concerns.Perhaps ... This was also the last thing he was concerned about on this road to Jianghu.At this moment, his arms trembled slightly. His originally short arms seemed to have recovered some length. Coupled with his short figure, he looked like a long-armed ape and looked a little ugly.He stared at the five elements path master for a long time.After calculating for a while, he realized that the current five elements path master's strength was infinitely close to the 9000 great Dao. It was a pity that he didn't have enough spirituality. Otherwise, he would have been a true ninth-grade body. A ninth-grade body would definitely be very powerful.The power of the five elements ... Was both offensive and defensive.Many thoughts emerged in his mind. In the end, he looked at the person behind Su Yu again. The power of the five birds gradually emerged in his body, shaking the void slightly as if it had a spirit!……Behind Su Yu.At this moment, the young man's eyes were a little dazed. However, he also seemed to be a little quick-witted. He looked into the distance and seemed to have sensed something.On his face, a faint smile gradually appeared.He then looked at Su Yu and was a little speechless.Vicious was also passed down from generation to generation.This flowing time also knew how to choose the main characters. All of them were ruthless characters without exception.He was a little emotional and a little vexed. How many years has it been? I've been a step slower than others every time. Am I not good enough or am I only suitable for a supporting role these days?

He turned his gaze to one person.The five elements Dao master was in the distance!He looked at Su Yu again. Su Yu turned his head and looked at him, as if he had realized something. He smiled and said,""You're leaving?""Probably ... So?"The young Futu looked a little embarrassed. Others might not know, but he did."If you leave, you'll take away my five elements of the world ... It's not very appropriate."Futu, or Yuan Shuo, was frowning at the moment. Soon, he heard Su Yu's voice,""But of course, I'm not that kind of vicious person. The time King left behind the infinite worlds, but he didn't have any good intentions either. Look, didn't he just scam me? I'm a person who can clearly distinguish between gratitude and grudges, so I don't mind. At most, I'll just beat him up. However, if you leave and take away the power of the five elements, it has nothing to do with him. As for you ... You'll be taking advantage of me. ""What does Emperor Yu want?" Yuan Shuo asked."You have a close relationship with him. I can feel that I don't have many hobbies. You should have some bad news about him from his early days, right? You understand!"“……”Yuan Shuo was speechless!艹!I understand.But ... Wasn't this kind of thing inappropriate?You're still in the mood to play this at a time like this? are you bored?"This ...""What, I can 't? Still no?"Su Yu sent a meaningful message,'what are you afraid of? I won't tell anyone!' Who didn't have some dark history these days? If everyone had it ... We wouldn't make it public, right? I don't have many hobbies ... You know me. "“……”He was speechless!A moment later, Yuan Shuo sent a telepathic message to zhang xuan."This ... That's fine too. Don't tell anyone that I did it!""Of course!"Su Yu smiled. Of course not, because ... There was no need to.Who else could it be other than you?Did Li Hao not have a brain?Of course, if you insist on covering your ears ... I don't mind."Do you need a hand?"Su Yu smiled."We've worked together for a long time. Although I've been oppressing you all these years, it's for your own good. I'll give you some parting gifts today!""There's no need for that. He ... Can do it. He's even stronger than you!"At this moment, the young Yuan Shuo seemed to have regained more of his memories. The look in his eyes gradually changed as he looked at Su Yu."You are the Lord of the myriad worlds ... He is the Chaos Knight. Perhaps you can unify the chaos, but you ... Can't rule him!""Is that so?"Su Yu smiled and didn't mind.What did it matter?Was chaos good?Was it that fun to unify the country?[All these troubles are just a dream. I just feel that it's interesting. How can I have the thought of unifying the country? I'm not even familiar with this chaos, so why should I unify them?]"Li Hao, you're pretty free and easy!"He sighed and laughed.Chaos Knight?Bullshit!He just didn't have any responsibilities and was a little more free. He looked at the people behind him and then at the human King in the distance. He sighed. Maybe.The human King is bound by neo martial. Perhaps, I am the same.That Li Hao was the one who was truly heartless.Shi Guang, why are you throwing it at me? you're really going too far!Do you think that I'm easier to deal with than Li Hao? is that why you've been pestering me?Su Yu chuckled when he saw a large number of level 9 martial artists flying toward him, with a portion of them heading toward huntian."Time is an endless entanglement, abandoned by both man and God. What are you ... Chasing after?"His voice slowly spread out."Fight, Li Hao, and the human King ... You don't want any of them. This means that time isn't a good thing. Whether it's the three-body technique, the past, or the future, it's all decided by man!"A soft laugh spread out."Li Hao, are you waiting for today, for now, for me?"His laughter spread in all directions.The ninth level venerable sovereigns 'expressions changed. What did he mean? In just an instant, the time stars in the distance started to spin crazily.Not far away, the human King laughed. He shrugged his shoulders and was extremely amused. Zhan, you're wrong. Only useless people would want your time. However, useless people had no way to inherit your time. Those who could inherit it weren't useless, gutless, or courageous people ...This was a contradiction!You, ah, do you really not understand, or have you already understood? in fact ... You have been waiting for this day for a long time.You regret it, don't you?"So, you can't bear to do this and can only entrust it to your descendants ... That's fine, that's fine!Further away.Li Hao seemed to have expected this. He laughed.That's right! "Zhan ... It's time to say goodbye!"He grabbed the sky with his hands and went straight for the chaos great Dao. His hands seemed to reach into the chaos great Dao and grab an extremely thick five elements Dao.Wuxing, you should die.My teacher is back, please make way!I hope he won't be angry. It must have been hard on him for so many years, right?That's right, being bullied by this person should be quite miserable.……"Time naturally exists. There's no need for the great Dao of time. The stars are only external. Time is natural. There's no Dao of time ..."With a loud laugh, the time star that everyone was suppressing suddenly shone with a boundless radiance.In the distance, the master of tianfang's expression changed slightly.In an instant, it suddenly disappeared.At this moment, the space trembled violently. The book of universe civilization appeared, as if it had broken through the space. Not far away, the human King chuckled and struck out with his saber. It was silent, and he no longer had any arrogant words.This blade seemed to pierce through the chaos!Tian Fang, don't get involved.The blade light reflected the chaos and was unimaginably powerful.In the distance, a pair of hands reached into the chaos great Dao and captured a Dragon. Li Hao's voice faintly rang out,""I, Li Hao of the five birds sect, welcome the return of the sect master of the five birds sect!""Slash!""Explode!""Break!"Three soft shouts rang out at the same time, like death knell!The human King slashed out with his saber. Under the shocked gazes of the type 9 experts, time and space suddenly exploded. The world went dark and time came to a standstill. In the distance, the giant hand covered the sky and grabbed the Dao of the five elements. It clasped its hands together like a sharp sword, wanting to sever the five elements in one strike!The master of Tian Fang frowned!He instantly disappeared again.However, in the next second, heaven and earth became completely silent. Everything seemed to be destroyed. The silent explosion instantly froze the entire chaos!In the void, within the time star, an illusory image appeared.One man stood proudly in the air, looking at the three sides. He shook his head and smiled, murmuring something softly, as if his wish had been fulfilled, as if his depression had dissipated. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Time ... Had never been controlled by anyone, and time should not be controlled by anyone.My reluctance to part, my reluctance to part ... Today, it has completely come to an end.The three of you have finally solved the knot in my heart.Everything shall be gone at any time!Heaven and earth Light!The river collapsed, time passed, and chaos trembled.In an instant, someone cried out in pain, as if the great Dao had been severed and his body had collapsed. His eyes were full of disbelief, with some confusion and helplessness ... How could this be?No matter what ... It shouldn't be me!Maybe it's life or death, maybe it's a disaster, maybe it's someone else ... But it shouldn't be me!In an instant, it was as if a giant beast had appeared above his head. In an instant, it devoured the overflowing spirits and the overflowing great DAOs. He opened his eyes and glared at it!That person's voice rang in her ears. He sighed,""My disciple is filial to me. Today, I don't believe that he will be slower than me!"BOOM!The earth-shattering explosion finally broke out at this moment. It exploded the heaven and earth, the chaos, and the chaos turned into a Land of Light!The darkness was no longer shrouding them, and light emerged.The chaotic sky had brightened.The light in the five elements path master's eyes dimmed as he looked at the sky.It turns out that when the chaos is illuminated, it is so brilliant and beautiful. Unfortunately, I can no longer see it.

Chapter 3796 Chaotic Battle (1)
The dark chaos brightened up today.The light of the five elements illuminated the world.Time seemed to have stopped.Li Hao and Fang ping did not seem surprised by the other's choice.The moment time appeared, it was actually the greatest desire of human nature.He yearned for immortality.He desired to control the future and change the past.Cultivation had cultivated time. Even if one was truly invincible, one could not change one's desire to explore the future, to change the past, and to live forever.Therefore, everyone was looking for time.However, today ... Time exploded.It was time to complete its mission.Chaos should not have allowed time to be controlled by anyone.Li Hao was not surprised.To be able to control ten thousand worlds and break through the blockade of desire meant that one could restrain desire, an invincible desire.He did not know exactly what was happening in the infinite worlds.However, he knew that his desires and greed were all locked in. As long as this person could walk out, it meant that his restraint on his desires had reached the extreme.Li Hao wasn't surprised that such a person could break time.He revealed a smile.At this moment, in the moment of the explosion of time, he seized the opportunity to reach into the chaos and cut off the five elements Dao, capturing and killing a rank nine.This was also the second grade 9 to die in battle in the chaos.It was more sorrowful than chaos.The blinding light illuminated the entire chaos.At this moment, the type 9 powerhouses were dumbfounded. Suddenly, they were a little dazed. It wasn't because the five elements had been killed, but because ... They suddenly felt empty. Time had really been destroyed!Then what should we do? please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  What about chaos?Without time, how could he use it to stabilize the entire chaos great Dao and solidify spirituality?They might not be able to recover to their peak for the rest of their lives.Not only that, but if they continued for a long time, their spirituality would be exhausted, which also meant that their lifespans were coming to an end.As for the death of the five elements, the death of a rank nine was nothing.The scary thing was that Shi Guang was gone."Why?""Why ...""We ... Where should we go?"All the grade 9 experts felt as if their hearts had been destroyed.​ A million years!"We've been waiting since a million years ago. We've been wasting a million years, waiting for the day when the time is ripe. Why ... Is this the result?At this moment, someone grabbed the fading light beside him.This was ... Shi Guang, right? It definitely was!They grabbed at the flowing time power around them and seemed to instantly age. Some looked up at the sky, some looked at the catastrophe, and some looked up at the sky ...At this moment, they couldn't even care about the person who blew up time.Each and every one of them was dejected."Why?"Some people roared at the sky. Why?"Su Yu!"Someone roared as if he had gone completely mad.Someone laughed."Time, time ... In the end, it's all for naught. What immortality, what spiritual convergence, what eternal Daoism, they're all just jokes. We've been submissive for millions of years, we've lived an ignoble life for millions of years, we've waited and waited until today, when time is destroyed ... What are we waiting for? How many more million years can we wait?""He ... Destroyed all our hopes!"Someone looked at Su Yu and suddenly went crazy. His eyes were red, and the great Dao fluctuated as if he was trying to gather all his strength and restore his peak combat strength!Kill him!"Li Hao is also an animal. Maybe he already knew ...""Kill them!"“……”The grade-9 powerhouses were like mad demons. This move would not easily end their future. They were not young anymore.Even if there were still people who could re-cultivate, how many years would it take?At this moment, a sigh resounded through the world.""Fellow Daoists, why do you have to do this? Both of you have cultivated time, and at this moment, perhaps you can still gather time together. We have no intention of becoming enemies with all of you, and we only wish to live. If the two of you are willing to restore time, strip time, stabilize chaos, and live in peace, why not?"Tian Fang's sigh resounded through the world.The two of them had cultivated time before. Even though time was broken, it did not mean that they could not cultivate again.Su Yu smiled, his face gentle.You all want it, I'm not giving it to you!The more he wanted, the more he wouldn't give.No, I can still think about it. The more you guys think about it, the more I want to destroy it. I want you to feel despair and go crazy.……In the distance.Li Hao disappeared and didn't reappear.However, a faint voice could be heard,"Tian Fang, your only chance is to destroy time. Your ten thousand DAOs have already reached the extreme. If someone controls time, you will never be able to achieve it. Now, you have hope. Why do you have to do this!"The faint laughter was like the sound of a devil.In an instant, all the grade 9 experts came to their senses. They looked at Tian Fang with strange expressions. Can you ... Do it?Tian Fang sighed."Li Hao, you know it's impossible, so why ... Do you still say that? You've really become a demon, and you don't forget to influence the emperors with your demon Dao!""Devil? What is a devil?"Li Hao laughed faintly."I didn't destroy time. I didn't become a demon, either. I didn't start the chaos, either. How can I be a demon?" I'm a man of the martial world, and there are only swordsmen in the martial world, where are the Devils?"In the distance.Su Yu kept retreating. Hearing this, he laughed and scolded,""Old devil, stop pretending! I'm just acting on your behalf. Weren't you the one who incited me to destroy Shi Guang?"

Chapter 3797 Chaotic Battle (2)
"You left a gap in the river of time, allowing others to absorb the power of the river at will. The core power within the river of time flowed continuously to the myriad worlds, myriad races, and myriad people. This was not done by me!"Su Yu laughed again."You've passed down the idea of splitting open the sky to every cultivator of the myriad races. If you have the ability, go to the chaos and split open the sky. What kind of world is this?" Mine is the strongest!""You left behind the magic of the three incarnations. The past, the present, and the future. The past can not be changed, and the future can not be pursued. All those who see the future, without exception, end in tragedy. All of the futures you see are fake, all illusory ... Like a dream!""Don't tell me that all of this wasn't your doing?"He sneered and scoffed.Why did I destroy time?Does it really have nothing to do with you?Of course, it also has something to do with me.However, for the experts of the myriad world to truly rise, they would definitely have their own thoughts. For example, the Lord of Dead souls opened the river of dead souls. For him, he opened the river of the universe. Only no one wanted to inherit the river of time.These ideas had been deeply ingrained in people's hearts since the day the sky was opened.The strong would split open the sky by themselves!In the end, time was an outsider 's.He was only confused."You old time ... Fine. Senior Li Hao, if you want to blow it up, you can do it yourself. Why do you have to do it?"Li Hao ignored him.Su Yu's eyebrows twitched. Li Hao, how dare you ignore my question!You're not a thing!This person could have done it himself, so why did he have to make me appear?In fact, he had been thinking about it.Just as he was thinking and speculating, a faint sigh was heard.""It's not the same. I'm not you. I've discovered time from the very beginning. I've inherited the power of time and have been of great help. I'm the one who has benefited directly. Do you understand?"The moment he said that!Su Yu suddenly understood and couldn't help but laugh. He couldn't help but curse,""You ... You're such a hypocrite!"He understood!This time, he really understood.He understood.In other words, Li Hao was directly affected by the war. Therefore, the power of time came from the war. The other party was half his teacher and half his benefactor. He destroyed time, which was equivalent to cursing at his mother after eating milk!Therefore ... He was not willing to do so. He only continued to pass on the inheritance of the battle.Yet, he left behind some ideas.He also left behind his own desires that could restrain time, the world, and all the experts who wanted to rise. He wanted to rise up and break his desires!And those who could break their desires would definitely understand some things. From there ... If they were ruthless enough, they would definitely be able to break time and break the limits.Su Yu, on the other hand, inherited Li Hao's time, not his fighting.At this moment, Su Yu completely understood."I see ... You're such a hypocrite. So, you think I'm ungrateful, so I'll destroy the time you left behind, but you won 't?"Li Hao's laughter rang out again."No, I'm not. It's just that I'm a Silver Moon Martial Master. Martial masters have some dignity that can't be torn apart. Martial men and martial masters are said to be the most heartless scholars in the world ... It's good to read more books, but reading more will break the gods in your heart! As for me ... In the end, I can't break the reputation of a Martial Master. A martial artist only cares about his reputation!"Su Yu laughed.In the distance, the human King's saber fell. He curled his lips and laughed.Li Hao!This guy was so hypocritical that even the chaos knew about it.He didn't want to do it, so he opened a new Sky and produced a new person. The new person broke the time, but he didn 'T. He didn't do it, but everyone knew that it was this grandson's influence.Still pretending!But ... In name, he was indeed not the one who did it."You should've said so earlier, I could've done it with one slash!"The human King laughed heartily."Why go through so much trouble!""That would be such a waste!"Li Hao laughed again."At the very least, I can make use of him and train an expert to block a bullet or something else. Wouldn't it be a waste if he were to slip away for nothing?" Fellow Daoist Su Yu, it's also my wish to rise to power ..."Su Yu's expression changed instantly, and he sneered.""I hate it when people arrange things for me! Li Hao, Who Do You Think You Are to arrange everything for me?"He turned hostile very quickly, even faster than Li Hao!He hated having his fate arranged by others!Li Hao's laughter rang out again."I didn't make any arrangements for you. I created this world, and you took over it. How can you say that I made arrangements for you?" "If you don't want to, don't want, or don't want, no one will force you. My teacher is the successor I've chosen. This new heaven is the foundation I've established. You've taken it, and I'm already being kind by not looking for you. How can you say that I arranged for you? It's said that scholars turn hostile quickly, but it seems like you're going to make a countercharge?"  n0vel online free at 𝓷0𝓿𝓮𝓵𝓫𝓲𝓷 The two of them conversed as if they were ignoring the rank nine venerable sovereigns!As for the ninth level venerable sovereigns, they were still immersed in the shattering of time. Some were listening to them quietly, some were thinking about something, and some were trying to see if they could cultivate time at this moment!,m Time was the only thing. Perhaps, even if time was broken, they still had a chance to cultivate it successfully.Su Yu chuckled."I'm a person who draws a clear line between gratitude and grudges. Since it's your time, I'll break it today. You've fulfilled your wish. We're even!" In the future, we'll go our separate ways. I'm not your successor ...""I have never thought of it that way. I don't like it either. My five birds sect will no longer accept any inheritances."

Chapter 3798 Chaotic Battle (3)
Li Hao's voice sounded.On the other side, Yuan Shuo, who was devouring the five elements Dao, wanted to speak but stopped.I haven't even opened my mouth!I'm the real sect leader of the five birds sect. You, with one word, didn't you end my five birds inheritance?Really ... Forget it.Just you alone is enough.At this moment, he had even forgotten that he actually had a disciple. It was just that ... In the past, his disciple had left, leaving only Li Hao, his last disciple. Now, in his eyes, only Li Hao had the demeanor of the five birds."Hahaha, that's great!"Su Yu laughed,"you're a hateful person, but you're also straightforward!" That's good. Just like that, time has been cut off and this group of people's thoughts have been cut off ..."After saying that, he looked at the group of grade-9 experts and laughed."Time is gone. Do you all still want to be my enemy? "I'm not someone to be trifled with. Now, there's no more conflict of interest between us. Instead, it's chaos heaven who's about to reach rank nine. A true rank nine is stronger than all of you ... If it were up to me, only the strongest should be killed. It's meaningless for all of you to keep an eye on me for time. I think we can join forces and kill chaos heaven first!"“……”The surroundings were silent.Huntian, who had been retreating, had a slight change in expression.As time passed, this group of rank-9s lost all hope. As for him, he had inherited order and chaos. At this moment, he was rapidly becoming stronger. There was really hope of surpassing them. After all, this group of people didn't have enough spirituality.On the other hand, he had enough spirituality. The Dao of order given by Su Yu seemed to be full of spirituality.Huntian's expression changed and he quickly shouted,""Don't be fooled. This person is using me as a second chaos!""Chaos and foolishness," he shouted again."They must overestimate their abilities and control time. As for me, I only cultivate order. I don't have much conflict with you ..."As soon as he said that, a man behind Su Yu was furious and looked unhappy!However, very quickly, she pouted and became quiet again.He said chaos, not me.I'm not chaotic!But ... I seem to be confused too?Probably in the past!Su Yu turned his head and looked at the man. The man rolled his eyes and looked unhappy. What are you looking at?Do you believe that I will hammer you?Alright, he couldn't win.Su Yu thought for a moment and smiled. He glanced at the Martial Emperor. This guy ... Inherited the chaotic will?How could that be?He wasn't too strong.Based on what they said, chaos was a ninth level venerable sovereign and was extremely powerful, even more so than Li Hao's master. Although a Martial Emperor had risen in the ancient chaos era and was considered one of the overlords of the world, he was later suppressed by King Wen and the others. He was in a very miserable state. A tier nine. How did he end up in such a state?Then, he looked at Li Hao, who was hiding in the surroundings, and had a thought. Perhaps ... That guy had done something to everyone except his master. He was truly a black-hearted person.He's the black-hearted one!Otherwise, a reincarnated rank nine wouldn't be in such a miserable state. He would be suppressed during peaceful times, only appearing miserably in troubled times, and suppressed again when peace was restored!  n0vel online free at 𝓷0𝓿𝓮𝓵𝓫𝓲𝓷 He couldn't help but laugh. This time King was vicious and merciless, and he had the face to say that scholars were heartless.Of course, since that guy had inherited the way of the divine text, he must have read a lot.He didn't destroy time to kill his enemies.It was just to divide the tier 9!Without the Dao of time, it was impossible for everyone in this group of grade-9 cultivators to kill him. Some were in despair, some had given up, and some were lost. This was the key to dividing this group of people!Huntian was the shield he pushed out!It was just like how Li Hao had pushed a shield for himself.The moment this young Emperor Yu stepped out, he already knew how to split this group of people apart as quickly as possible.The corners of his mouth rose slightly.,m He looked into the distance and raised his eyebrows slightly. Li Hao had just captured the chaos great Dao and killed the five elements. He was obviously very strong. He wasn't crippled as others said ... This was normal. Su Yu didn't believe that Li Hao was crippled.However, this fellow had not appeared at all. Instead, he was moving in the dark. What was he up to?He was slightly puzzled, but he knew too little about chaos, so he could not make a judgment.At this moment, the group of experts was slightly chaotic.Some of the people who wanted to kill him were divided.He didn't say much. He quickly led his people and flew toward the neo martial artists. A few rank-9s flew up quickly. With the catastrophe in front of them, they were furious and their eyes were cold and crazy."You want to run? You destroyed everyone's hope. Do you think everyone will let you go?"He gritted his teeth and looked at Tian Fang in the distance. He shouted,""Tianfang, even if you have thousands of schemes, these people are all great enemies! Was Li Hao crippled? You've been letting the human King, Li Hao, and even Su Yu get stronger ... You've been weakening us ninth-rank fighters. Have you forgotten who your old friend is?"Today, he was furious.He let out some of the pent-up anger in his heart.Tian Fang!It's you who caused today's disaster.What do you want to do?Whether it was Li Hao, the human King, or Su Yu, there was a process to becoming powerful. And in this process, Tian Fang had actually provided some convenience.This included the inheritances that Li Hao had obtained from Tian Fang. A few days ago, when the human King had continuously devoured the world, Tian Fang could have stopped or delayed it.If he did not cause any trouble and allowed huntian to find them quickly, perhaps there would be a way to interrupt their time flow.

Without time, how could the other party become stronger?All of this had Tian Fang's shadow in it!What was Tian Fang trying to do?Countless thoughts rose in Jie Nan's mind. He gritted his teeth and shouted,"Tian Fang, do you want to rely on the fall of us rank nines to recover our intelligence and return to our peak? You have the confidence to kill all of them, and you will be able to control the chaos, right?"We're all dead, and our spirituality has dispersed. It's enough to support Tian Fang to return to his peak strength.Was this what he was thinking?Or did he have other intentions? Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ The moment he said this, the expressions of those Grade 9 experts changed. This guess might not be fake.At this moment, the grade 9 experts swiftly formed an alliance and split into many groups.The others had all left Tian Fang.Some of them had gone to the calamity grade venerable sovereign's side, while the rest had gathered near huntian. Only the area near tianfang was empty at this moment. The group of grade-9 experts were all mournful.'We ... When did we become other people's chess pieces?'But today, they realized that they were just pawns.Tian Fang might have been using them to place his pieces."Brother calamity, you're overthinking things. I've already said that as long as time is stable, everyone will be able to return to their peak states. We can even extend our lifespans and become immortal!" The chaos is big, but it's also small. Even if I dominate the chaos alone, all my old friends will die, and a new generation will replace the old. Is it interesting to dominate the chaos alone?""Everything I've done is just for Shi Guang to grow up and achieve our goal ..."He sighed and shook his head."The only thing I didn't expect was ... They actually blew up time!""You have all the DAOs. Since they destroyed time, why can't you cultivate them?" Jie Nan's eyes were cold and sharp."You don't understand ..."He shook his head and sighed."Because the spirit of time is dead."The spirit is dead?The Tribulation was slightly startled.At this moment, Tian Fang looked in the direction where the illusionary figure had appeared and said softly,""Yeah, the spirit is dead. Zhan is a time cultivator, and also a generation of time. At the same time, he is the true spirit of time! Just now ... He was completely dead! "In the past, he cultivated time. Perhaps, it was just as he had thought and said. He regretted it and wanted to destroy time. Unfortunately, even if he committed suicide, he wouldn't be able to truly destroy the spirit of time ... After so many years, perhaps he was looking for someone who could be so cruel as to destroy his spirit."At this moment, he seemed to be able to understand and understand why Zhan would commit suicide.He could also understand why the people he found were each more vicious and heartless than the last.Perhaps, this was the person he was looking for. He wanted to find a cultivator who could truly destroy time.Shi Guang's spirit was completely dead.Time Dao completely disappeared.Everyone's hearts jolted. Could it be that Shi Guang would never be able to cultivate it? "I can fight ... But you can 't?""Are you worried that once you cultivate time, everyone will attack you and force you to hand over the Dao of time to stabilize chaos?" Tian Fang, even if you hand over time, you'll still be the strongest!""Now that time has been destroyed, we can't return to our peak. Our lifespans are reaching the end .... If this continues, we'll all die. When that happens, I can't guarantee that we won't go completely crazy!"His eyes were a little red."If it really comes to this ... I'll die. No one will have a good time!""You must have a way, right?"He gritted his teeth. You must have more!Although Li Hao and the others are strong and rising stars, you, Tian Fang, are the strongest, most talented, and most talented cultivator of our era.You've been defeated like this?Your million-year plan collapsed so easily?I don't believe it!Others might not understand you, but I do. The world of calamity is too close to Tian Fang, and he knows how powerful Tian Fang is.In the past, when order was strong and the nine Heavens were established, they only avoided the square region where Tian Fang was.People like order were old-fashioned, powerful, and strict. They didn't even dare to enter the four-sided domain to establish the nine Heavens. It was conceivable that they were extremely afraid of this person. In the end, order died and Tian Fang became the number one in the chaos, the true number one.Was it so easy for a few juniors to foil his plans?"No..." Tian Fang shook his head."A tribulation ... Without time, no matter how many plans we have, it's useless ...""You're lying!"The Lord of calamity was furious. He roared and looked at the people around him, gritting his teeth."They won't give us a way out, so what are we hesitating for? "Today, Shi Guang is gone. This bunch of people are all hiding and thinking that we're their meat. Then, we'll go all out! In the past, they could all reach the ninth rank, so who was afraid of who? "Today, no one will give us a way out, so we'll destroy the chaos and the origin of chaos and let everyone die together! All schemes would be revealed when the chaos was broken!
