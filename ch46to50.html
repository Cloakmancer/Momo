Chapter 46: I feel like I’m very strong
Translator: 549690339
At this moment, Li Hao was very curious about Liu Long’s strength.

“Then the captain ... Has the strength of over a hundred?”

Liu Long’s face was indifferent, and Liu Yan continued with a smile,”I guess so, barely! If the boss is not strong, how can he lead us to kill supers? Supers are still very strong. Even the weakest one has the strength of over 100, and they are more difficult to deal with!”

This time, Li Hao clearly knew how strong his Captain was.

Of course, he only knew what it meant literally. As for how powerful it was in reality ... He really didn’t have any direct experience.

Breaking 100 didn’t sound like much.

“What about teacher Yuan?”

“Your teacher probably had over 100 combat power at his peak, but now he’s old and weak. His physical strength and speed are declining. I’m afraid he won’t be able to do it.”

Liu Long shook his head slightly,”back then, a portion of the top-notch martial masters had reached this level!” However, in the past few years, as firearms became more powerful and superpowers appeared, everyone pursued superpowers. Very few people would put in the effort to cultivate these ordinary martial arts anymore!”

“With the introduction of the mysterious energy, one will be able to reach the sky in a single step. His physique will be strong and his physical abilities will be strengthened. He might be an ordinary person, but after a day, he might be comparable to a Martial Master who has slashed ten times. After some time, he will become a martial Dao Grandmaster who has slashed over a hundred! Tell me, how many people are still willing to practice ancient martial arts?”

He looked at Li Hao and sighed.”Superpowers are to break the limits of the human body. They allow humans to break through their limits and increase their upper limits infinitely. Even a wooden bucket with a little water can contain more water than a wine glass!” And the ordinary martial masters were the wine cups! Superpowers were like wooden barrels! Do you understand?”

Li Hao nodded in understanding.

It was indeed very despairing!

If a normal martial artist could not absorb the mysterious energy and become a super, they would not be able to break through their limits even if they trained for their entire lives. If they could not even defeat a beginner super after years of hard work, how despairing would that be?

Yuan Shuo, for example, had been practicing martial arts at a young age. Now that he was over seventy, his physical strength was declining. He had been a leader in the martial arts world, but the result was good. He had broken through a hundred in the past, but now he might only have the strength to slash ten.

This kind of strength was only at the beginner level among supers!

A 70-year-old Grandmaster could only be compared to some young people who had just entered the sect. No wonder when he was practicing the five birds technique, teacher Yuan had only said that he would have an additional life-saving ability to strengthen his body.

He had never said that this was a killing technique!

Because the reality was too despairing!

As for Liu Long, he gave a simple introduction and quickly said,””Go and try. I’ll observe your speed and strength to see what you’re capable of.”

Li Hao didn’t say anything else.

He didn’t hide it and there was no need to.

With his basic ape art skills, he was afraid that these few people really didn’t care about him.

In the arena, Li Hao was like a monkey, jumping and rolling around the entire fitness area. From time to time, he would use his Monkey Fist and hit some sandbags, causing them to bounce out.

……

Outside the stadium.

Liu Long observed silently.

The thin and weak Wu Chao looked at it for a moment before shaking his head lightly,””He’s stronger than most people and he’s on par with some of the old patrol officers in the team. But ... Boss, can he escape from the pursuit of a superpower?”

The chubby Chen Jian also said gloomily,”I definitely don’t have the level to cut ten. At most, I’ll cut two and three!” This is the first time our demon hunting squad has recruited such a weak guy in all these years, right?”

If he encountered two or three soldiers, Li Hao’s abilities might be of some use and he could kill them.

However, the difference between two or three and ten was not three or four times, but more than ten times the difficulty.

In their eyes, Li Hao was too weak.

Liu Yan crossed her arms and looked at it for a while. She smiled and said,”Keep him. It’s not bad to look at him. He can also do some logistics or intelligence analysis. He’s a civil servant, not a warrior like you!”

Li Hao was a civilian staff, so he should have been prepared.

Liu Yan didn’t think there was anything wrong with it.

Everyone thought about it and felt that it made sense.

Liu Yan continued,”get some firearms. Is slashing ten very powerful?” With one shot, he would still be killed! Of course, once you’ve broken through a hundred, be it a Martial Master or a superhuman, it’ll be hard to deal with them. ”

The main thing was that it was difficult to lock onto a target. Once you saw someone, your brain would issue an order. The next moment, the other party would appear in front of you and kill you with a single slap. Then, no matter how strong the weapon was, it would be useless.

In fact, firearms still possessed extremely powerful killing power.

If there was someone holding him back, it was not impossible for him to be blasted to death if he broke through 100.

Liu Long also nodded slightly,”he’ll definitely carry firearms. Pick some that are easy to use, convenient, and light for him to use!” As long as this guy has the brains, it’s fine. As for his skills ... If he can kill a superpower and introduce some mysterious powers into him, even if he can’t become a superpower, it’s not difficult for him to break through 10 points in terms of physique and speed. ”

“The point is, this guy ... He’s not just a civilian, he’s also an expert in the ancient language. Although he’s definitely not as good as Yuan Shuo, he’s probably enough for us!”

The moment these words came out, the few of them were deep in thought.

Li Hao was still quite useful.

Joining a demon-hunting team seemed like a good idea.

……

At this moment, Li Hao, who was jumping at high speed, felt that he was not bad. At least, he was much stronger than before.

When he left the field, panting, he said with some anticipation,””Captain, do you think there’s a difference between me and a Martial Master who has cut ten? can it be counted as breaking ten?”

He felt that he had the chance to fight ten people by himself!

As for Liu Long, he hesitated for a moment and was also a little embarrassed. He was unable to reply for a long time. Where did this kid’s confidence come from?

Ten cuts, that’s it?

As for the others, they also looked at each other in dismay. Humans indeed did not know their own limits!

Cut ten?

You should wash up and go to sleep!

Li Hao also gradually sensed that something was wrong. After a while, he said, somewhat embarrassed,””Nine beheading?”

“……”

The few of them didn’t say anything.

“Cut five?”

“……”

It was still silent.

Li Hao’s expression changed. It can’t be, right? after drinking the sword water, I thought I was already very powerful and could even fight with teacher Yuan. But teacher Yuan’s power is over 100, so I can’t be that much weaker, right?

Teacher yuan can make five rounds with her ape art. If she can make a ten-minute round trip, I can also make a nine-minute round trip!

After a long time, Liu Long broke the silence,”don’t think too much. I’m not afraid of weakness. I’m afraid of laziness!” If you do well, you’ll only be able to cut ten. ”

“……”

There was silence again.

Li Hao understood and felt helpless and sad. So I don’t even have the ability to cut five?

‘Then why did I still want to kill the red shadow? F * ck, the ignorant are really fearless!’

“Is beheading ten very strong?”

In the basement, Li Hao was still in disbelief.

Beheading ten really didn’t sound like much.

One against ten, it didn’t feel that exaggerated, right?

As far as he knew, some old patrol inspectors seemed to be able to do it.

“Is he very strong?”

Liu Long said coldly and arrogantly,”to me, it’s naturally very weak!” For you, a Martial Master of the ten slashing realms can kill several of you without any problem!”

On the other side, the short yunyao said softly,””Li Hao, don’t underestimate any Martial Master! “Beheading ten directions to become a Martial Master. If you can break through an army formation of ten people and kill all of them, that’s beheading ten directions! One against ten and one against one, killing ten people in a wheel battle, are two different concepts. ”

“It’s useless to talk too much to him. Chen Jian, go and teach him what a Martial Master is!”Liu Long said lightly.

“Me?”

The big fatty Chen Jian was a little honest,”I’m not good at attacking, and I’m very slow. This kid’s speed is still okay.”

They were good at different things!

Li Hao’s speed was even faster than his, and he was better at defense.

“Try it!”

Liu Long frowned slightly.”Just play with him. You’re good at defense and not at offense. That’s to avoid killing him!”

Alright!

Hearing this, Li Hao was a little sad. So he had found a shield to test himself, but he was afraid that he would die.

However, Li Hao was really tempted.

Men all had a competitive heart and a little desire to fight.

He didn’t know how powerful the fat Chen Jian was, but the other party’s physique was so big. Even if he couldn’t beat him, if he ran, the other party wouldn’t be able to catch him, right?

At this moment, Chen Jian’s smile was simple and honest. He glanced at Li Hao, who was somewhat eager to try, and said,”Then let’s have a spar?”

He then added,”I’m the weakest in our team, and I’m good for nothing except defense!” You’ve practiced the five bird ape technique, so you’re quite fast. I might not be able to catch up to you ...”

Li Hao glanced at him. It was fine if he didn’t say anything, but now that he did ... Li Hao was a little worried.

This fatty couldn’t be very powerful, right?

“Chen Jian is the weakest in the team in terms of speed, attack, and breakthrough ability, except for defense. If you’re not willing, then let’s change it to Wu Chao!” Liu Long said impatiently.

Li Hao glanced at Wu Chao and shook his head.

Forget it!

The Thin Man was obviously very agile, and the other party was a Scout in the team, who was smarter than a monkey. Li Hao knew his own situation well. He might not even be able to touch him.

“Then here I come!”

Chen Jian took a step forward, his movements very slow.

Li Hao didn’t say anything else. Just as he activated the art of ape, Chen Jian’s fan-like palm slapped over.

Without thinking, Li Hao jumped up and retreated.

This guy’s slap didn’t look light.

On the other side, Chen Jian slapped Li Hao. Seeing Li Hao jump up, he did not think twice. His movements did not seem fast, but he slightly moved to the right. The next moment, Li Hao’s expression changed.

His landing point was over there!

He didn’t fall behind directly!

In midair, Li Hao hurriedly leaped into the air to borrow the force of the attack. He kicked his feet in a flurry, without any sense of beauty.

Real martial arts didn’t have much beauty to it.

The ape technique was still fine, but some of the other techniques of the five birds technique looked even more silly. They even had to lie on the ground and run on all fours, making them even uglier.

On the other hand, Chen Jian’s fat face revealed a simple and honest smile, as if he had already guessed it.

This was not because his reaction was faster or because of his strength, but because of his experience!

If one did not have any experience fighting supers, they would have died long ago.

Li Hao kicked randomly, using the air resistance to shift his position. At the same time, Chen Jian was not in a hurry, as if he had casually taken two steps. At this moment, Li Hao could no longer borrow force, and fell directly.

This time, the landing point was less than a meter in front of Chen Jian.

The two sides were practically face to face!

The moment Li Hao landed on the ground, he felt the force of the ground and was about to use the force to bounce away. At this moment, he saw a big palm from the corner of his eye. It was the big palm from the beginning.

Pa!

A crisp sound!

Li Hao rolled in the air and fell to the ground with a bang.

Chen Jian did not hit his face, but his neck. At this moment, his neck was blood red.

At this moment, Li Hao was completely dumbfounded.

His neck seemed to be broken!

At this moment, he couldn’t feel anything. His head was dizzy, and he couldn’t even feel anything below his neck.

He jumped and used the air as leverage, but he was stunned by a slap.

He was completely stunned!

As for Chen Jian, he was still simple and honest. At this moment, he looked at his own big palm, then at Li Hao, who was on the ground. He smiled awkwardly and turned to look at Liu Long and the others.

“I ... I didn’t expect his reaction to be so slow ...” Said Jian Jia.”Also, I didn’t expect him to jump as soon as he came up. Boss, you said that if you’re not strong enough, jumping in the air is suicide ... I didn’t expect to encounter it today.”

If one’s strength wasn’t enough and they jumped into the air, once their path of return was blocked, they would be at the mercy of others.

This was a huge taboo in actual combat!

Even if there were more than 100 martial masters, unless it was absolutely necessary, they would rarely leap into the air in actual combat. If that happened, all the openings would be exposed, and there would be no chance to counterattack.

Being down-to-earth was something that every Martial Master had to remember in actual combat!

Li Hao, on the other hand, thought that he was faster and more agile after learning the ape art, so he jumped into the air. However, he was immediately stunned!

……

The entire basement was silent.

There was only Chen Jian’s simple and honest explanation.

Chapter 48: The superpower realm (2)
Translator: 549690339
Li Hao, on the other hand, had his head lowered and his face flushed red. He, who thought he was smart, had suffered a huge blow today.

Li Hao, who thought he was quite strong, was sent flying by a Shield Guard in his team with a light slap. If he hadn’t shown mercy, Li Hao suspected that his neck would have been broken by the other party!

Li Hao, who had just thought that he could at least cut five or six times, had completely given up.

At this moment, he seemed to have come to a realization and understood something.

“I ... Am not a Martial Master. Strictly speaking, I am just a dabbler who has only practiced martial arts for a few days. I have not had any actual combat experience. In fact, I am just a real noob. He has always overestimated himself!

Thinking back to the scene last night, he was still thinking,”as long as I draw my gun fast enough, can I kill the red shadow and the person behind the red shadow?”

Thinking about it now ... He was really naive!

How childish!

……

The others all looked at Liu Long, then at Li Hao, and revealed strange expressions.

Had this guy collapsed from the blow?

This ... His mental fortitude seemed to be very poor!

Liu Long also frowned slightly. He did have the intention to intimidate Li Hao, but that wasn’t the main thing. He wanted Li Hao to understand that the enemy they were facing was far more powerful than he had imagined.

But in the end, Li Hao seemed to have lost his confidence after a single spar.

At this moment, Li Hao was still lying on the ground. Could it be that he couldn’t accept such a failure?

“Is that all?”

A hint of disappointment appeared in Liu Long’s eyes. He had originally thought that even if Li Hao’s strength was lacking, his mind, brain, patience, and bearing ability were all top-notch. After all, he had caught Yuan Shuo’s eye and was even willing to secretly investigate a year’s worth of cases for his friend’s sake. He felt that Li Hao was still worth nurturing.

But at this moment, Li Hao’s life was too smooth. Could such a person withstand the blow?

He was thinking.

At this moment, Li Hao stood up and rubbed his neck, a hint of shyness on his face.

He was like a young boy!

In reality, he wasn’t old to begin with. If he didn’t drop out of school at this time, he would still be a student of the ancient academy.

“I always feel that I’m different from the rest. I’m smarter than everyone else. To be able to get into the ancient academy, to be accepted by teacher Yuan as a disciple, to be able to successfully enter the inspector’s office, to be able to investigate cases ... I feel like I’m capable of anything. I feel like I’m doing pretty well in everything ...”

As Li Hao spoke, he shook his head and smiled bitterly.”Today, I learned that I’m nothing when I fight! I’ve only learned the ape Arts for three years, and I’ve been slacking off for the past year. How can I compare with you guys? I’m afraid you’ve been practicing martial arts for many years, right?”

“Sixteen years!” Chen Jian replied honestly. I only started practicing martial arts when I was 12. ”

“……”

Li Hao was speechless.

It wasn’t because he had been practicing martial arts for 16 years, but because ... The other party was 28!

What a joke!

You’re only 28?

At first glance, he thought that Chen Jian was at least 40 years old, but he was only 28 years old?

He was speechless!

Li Hao thought to himself, but he didn’t say it out loud. He looked helpless.”My teacher once said that in practicing martial arts, one needs talent and two needs hard work! Hard work was more important than talent! I’ve been practicing martial arts for 16 years. I don’t care if I have talent or not, but even if I do, I’m just a lazy person. I’m lucky that I didn’t get killed by brother Chen!”

Chen Jian laughed embarrassedly.”Don’t say that. It’s actually not that bad. Although I held back, I used 30% of my strength. You didn’t even faint when I slapped you. You were just lying on the ground. It’s actually very powerful.”

“……”

Was this a compliment?

Li Hao looked at him. This fatty who looked like a simple and honest old brother ... Didn’t have any other meaning in his words, right?

A Shield Guard only smacked you to the ground with 30% of his strength and didn’t kill you. Is that something to be proud of?

At this time, Liu Long spoke,”it’s good that you can come back to your senses. I was still thinking that if you want to quit after this slap, I’ll fulfill your wish. It seems that you’re quite resilient.”

“But I want to tell you that Chen Jian is only a Martial Master with ten kills, and his main focus is defense!” You must remember that any super is far superior to him! If you can’t even avoid Chen Jian’s attack, don’t even think about escaping from the hands of supers. ”

“Of course, you’ve just joined us, so it’s normal for you to be a little weaker. You’re only a reserve team member now. Other than dealing with the guy in the self-immolation case, you’ll be the bait. At other times, you’ll mainly be strengthening yourself and helping us analyze and organize some data!”

He didn’t expect Li Hao to come in handy now.

There was no hope at all!

After he finished speaking, Liu Long tightened his trench coat and looked at the others. He quickly said,”Liu Yan, help this guy and figure out the situation first! Don’t die in the next mission for no reason. ”

“Don’t worry, boss. I’ll take care of him!”

Liu Yan laughed heartily, while Li Hao wanted to say something but stopped. After thinking for a while, he decided to just let it be.

At this moment, he was just a little brother in this demon hunting squad.

Even Chen Jian, who was known as the weakest, could easily kill him. What else could he say?

As for doctor yunyao, Li Hao didn’t want to ask her any more questions. She looked kind and weak, but in fact, no one knew what was going on. Some people looked weak, but they were actually more terrifying.

As for Liu Yan, he was at least more familiar with her and had at least spoken a few more words.

Liu Yan looked at Li Hao with a smile.”Little Li Hao, come to the office with your sister for a chat. It’s too depressing here.”

 


Chapter 49: The superpower territory (3)
Translator: 549690339
“Captain Liu, there’s no hurry.” Li Hao thought for a moment and said.

“Captain Liu ...” He looked at Liu Long.

“I’ll allow you to call me boss!”

Liu Long’s face was cold and arrogant, as if calling him boss was a great achievement.

Li Hao didn’t say anything. Since he was under the roof, he was the boss.

“Boss, Zhang Yuan’s murderer probably already knows that we’re investigating him last night because we made quite a commotion! I’ve studied the case records, and every rainy day might be the time for the other party to make a move ... And it’s been almost a year since the last incident. According to the time, the other party might make a move in a rainy day in a few days. ”

“I know!” Liu Long nodded lightly. I’ll naturally prepare for it. You’re trying to say that you’re probably the next target, and you’re afraid, aren’t you?”

Li Hao didn’t say anything.

“Don’t worry!”

Liu Long didn’t explain too much. He only reminded Li Hao,””Your goal now is to understand more, to know more, and to better protect your life! As for the person behind the self-immolation case, we will find a way!”

Li Hao could only choose to trust them!

Moreover, he didn’t think that Liu Long would seek death.

After saying that, Liu Long strode out. Wu Chao and Chen Jian quickly followed him. Yun Yao didn’t follow him. Instead, she greeted Li Hao and the others before walking deeper into the basement.

Liu Yan glanced at Yun Yao, and then saw Li Hao staring at Yun Yao. She suddenly felt a little amused and chuckled in a low voice.”Little guy, is it stressful to chat with your sister? This one, don’t keep thinking about her, she’s a good sister. ”

“Captain Liu, you misunderstood!”

Liu Yan laughed again,”misunderstanding or not, it’s nothing. I’m just reminding you!” A doctor ... Not everyone could be a doctor! For us, it’s useless to find a doctor for ordinary injuries! Besides, doctors are usually the most important people in a team. They have to take on tasks that no one else can do. ”

Li Hao’s interest was instantly piqued. He curiously asked,””What?”

At this moment, Li Hao was interested in everything. Only by understanding everything quickly could he keep up with the others.

“Strip the mysterious energy!”

Liu Yan smiled as she spoke, but there was a hint of fear in her smile.

Strip the mysterious energy!

Li Hao was slightly dazed.

The mysterious energy was something that normal people could not see. As for whether supers could see it ... They might be able to see it, but the people in front of them were not. It was obvious that it was not easy to strip away the mysterious energy.

And yunyao could do it!

According to Liu Yan, Yun Yao was indeed an extremely important part of the team. They hunted supers to take away the mysterious energy. Without Yun Yao, there would be no meaning to the existence of this team.

Even someone as unscrupulous as Liu Yan was afraid of her.

.

Li Hao kept this in mind.

Although this team was made up of ordinary people, in reality, they were not simple. None of those who could enter the team were easy to deal with.

“Let’s go, stop looking!”

Liu Yan casually kicked Li Hao and chuckled.””This woman, stay away from me! She’s even more difficult to deal with than boss, and you can even joke around with boss, but don’t talk to her!”

Li Hao obediently nodded.

At this time, he was very honest. It was as if he had returned to a year ago when he first entered the important room. At that time, he was also very honest and didn’t dare to say a word. He just treated himself as a little brother.

I’ll do whatever I’m told to do!

A year later, he was still as honest as ever, but the entire computer room would say good things about him. No one would say he was bad, and that was enough.

……

Following Liu Yan, the two of them returned to the office on the sixth floor.

He had only stayed for half an hour, but when he came back up, the office, which had been terrifying a moment ago, gave Li Hao a sense of security. It was much better than what he had experienced downstairs.

Bang! Bang!

Liu Yan still slammed herself heavily into the chair without any regard for her image. She placed her legs on the table and gestured for Li Hao to sit anywhere he wanted.

After Li Hao sat down, Liu Yan spoke in a casual tone.

“Boss asked me to give you a brief introduction ... I don’t know where to start. After all, I know everything. Why don’t you ask me yourself? if there’s anything you want to know, you can ask and I’ll answer!”

Li Hao said seriously.

He looked polite, but in order to understand more, he would not be polite. He was direct and immediately asked,””Captain Liu, How do I become a super?”

“Two situations!”

“Number one, I was born with it!” Liu Yan said directly. Some people are born with the ability to absorb mysterious energy. They don’t need to cultivate or draw energy into their bodies. Their bodies have some mysterious Energy Foundation, which is naturally strengthened. These people are also known as heavenly God Masters!”

Heavenly priest!

Li Hao remembered this name.

“Second, draw energy into the body! This was the conventional way of advancement, which was to absorb mysterious energy, use it for baptism, and activate the mysterious energy in their bodies. This kind of super was the mainstream and a step that most supers had to take! These people are also known as Starlight Masters in the entire superpower system!”

“Mysterious powers, like the resplendent Starlight, are absorbed by the supers, so they call themselves the Starlight that shines upon the world.”

Starlight master!

Li Hao remembered it again.

In other words, the entire superpower system was divided into two main categories due to the different methods of birth?

“Just these two?”

Liu Yan nodded.”Strictly speaking, we’re also considered the second type. We want to advance to become supers and Starlight Masters by introducing the mysterious energy. So, we’re not considered the third type.”



Chapter 50
Chapter 50: The field of superpowers-4
Translator: 549690339
After some thought, she said,””But rumor has it that there’s actually another way to advance.”

“What method?” Li Hao asked, a little interested.

“It’s said that some powerful supernatural items can directly change one’s Foundation and allow one to advance into the supernatural realm!” In other words, with the help of external objects, you can become a super. ”

Li Hao’s heart skipped a beat!

A super item!

Did the starry sky sword and the stone saber count?

Liu Long should also know that these items were in his hands, but why ... Did he not mention them? was he secretly planning something, or did he really not care?

In the next moment, Liu Yan continued,”of course, this method is not mentioned because it’s very difficult!” First, the Super item needed to be very powerful, and it was impossible for ordinary people to obtain it. Secondly, it was said that there were some restrictions to the Super items. Not everyone could transform after obtaining them. I don’t know the details, but boss might know, but you don’t have to worry about it. ”

Li Hao didn’t say anything and just nodded.

Changing the topic, Li Hao said,””Then what did boss say about matching superpowers and drawing energy into the body? what’s the situation?”

“Everyone’s body is different and they are good at different things. There is not one superpower but many forms. For example, boss was good at attacking, but he didn’t know what kind of attack he was good at. Was it lightning? Flame? Bingxue? In short, with the difference in attributes, he doesn’t know what kind of power he has. At this time, if he draws on an incompatible mystic energy, it will be very difficult to unlock the superpower lock in his body!”

“A superpower lock?”

“It’s what we call a Super Barrier! I don’t know if it exists or not. The boss said that the night patrollers said that everyone had a lock that locked the mortals and superpowers! Only by opening this lock can you step into the supernatural realm!”

Li Hao understood.

Unlock the SuperLock!

This was what these mortals were after.

This was all Li Hao could ask about supers. The next moment, he asked something more important,”Captain Liu, if I want to become a super, is there any way?”

“Draw energy into your body, but it’s probably very difficult for you to get any mysterious energy right now unless you kill the murderer of the self-immolation case this time. Let’s see if I can get you some ...”

“That depends on how much you’ve contributed!” Liu Yan replied bluntly. It didn’t mean that just because you were weak, you had a reason to be allocated more! Our demon hunting squad is very fair on this point. Whoever contributes the most will get the most. ”

Li Hao nodded in understanding.

“Then, I ...”

“You want to say, do you have any way to become stronger?”

Liu Yan smiled and nodded,”yes!” Before becoming a superpower, if he could not directly enter the realm of superpowers, he would have to strengthen his martial arts abilities! You’re too weak, but there are many ways to strengthen yourself. ”

Li Hao raised his head in anticipation.

“First, you can continue to train hard!” Liu Yan said after a moment of consideration.

“Second, a good martial arts technique. Your five birds technique is actually very good. Elder Yuan was a Martial Master with a cultivation of over 100 martial masters, so there’s no need to say much about this. Moreover, the five birds technique is actually very comprehensive. It’s good at attack, defense, and defense.”

Li Hao nodded. This was true. The five birds technique had five main categories, and he had only learned the ape technique.

“Third, external force!”

Liu Yan smiled.”This external force is mainly the mysterious energy. If the mysterious energy can’t help us unlock the superpower lock, it can help us strengthen our physique. Physique is the foundation!” You have a good body and strong qualities. With a powerful cultivation technique, you will naturally be stronger!”

.

Mysterious energy!

Li Hao was deep in thought. This ... I do!

Soaking in sword water!

“Of course, there’s more than one type of external force. The mysterious energy is only one of them. In fact, there are many other external forces that can strengthen one! If that’s the case ... Perhaps you can look for your teacher. ”

Li Hao was startled. What did he mean?

Liu Yan smiled happily and said playfully,”as the Dean of the archaeological Department, I’ve explored countless archaeological ruins. The night patrolman did take most of the spoils, but in order to appease your teacher, he would leave some for him!” And the archaeological ruins have the most treasures! Since you’re so weak, you’ll naturally benefit endlessly if your teacher gives you something good!”

Li Hao didn’t say anything. How could he ask his teacher for a treasure?

You must be joking!

“Hahaha, don’t be shy. Not only your teacher, but our demon hunting squad also has such good stuff!”

The next moment, Liu Yan whispered,”you won’t lose out if you listen to me. As long as you perform well in front of boss and are worth investing in, boss won’t be stingy!” After killing a few supers, plus we are the law enforcement agency of the Silver City, we still have a small Treasury. ”

Li Hao blinked. He understood!

After some consideration, Li Hao asked,””Sister Liu, is there no clear sign of an increase in strength other than one’s own feelings? For example, will there be any changes when you reach the tenth realm?”

“Change?”

Liu Yan was taken aback for a moment before she quickly smiled and said,”there is, but a Martial master’s strength still depends on actual combat and true ability!” There’s an actual combat training room at the back of the basement. You’ll know when you go in. When you can pass the first level in there, you’ll be ten beheading! It means that you have the strength to kill a ten-man elite team!”

Training room?

Li Hao noted it down again and became interested.

He looked at Liu Yan again. Apart from these, was there no other benefits or help in joining the demon hunting squad?

Liu Yan was taken aback by his stare. She seemed to understand what he meant and laughed a little after a while. Her smile was as bright as a flower.”Little guy, you don’t seem to be as honest as you appear to be!”

“For justice!” Li Hao smiled innocently and said softly.

For justice!

Liu Yan could no longer smile. After a long while, she shook her head and sighed. “You’re really good at applying what you learned! I Can’t Give You Anything else since you’ve just joined, but ... Take as many firearms as you can in my office! “Moreover, they’re all legal. Right now, you might need these things more. Strengthening yourself really isn’t something that can be done in a short time. I’ve been practicing martial arts for almost twenty years, but this is all I’ve got ...”

Li Hao nodded. It’s been twenty years. How old have you been practicing martial arts?

The person before him looked to be around thirty, but he couldn’t be older than forty, right?

Of course, Li Hao didn’t dare to ask.

These people practiced martial arts for ten to twenty years, which was quite terrifying. Li Hao knew how difficult it was to practice martial arts. In fact, it was quite difficult. In the past three years, he said that he didn’t put in much effort, but in fact, he practiced the ape art whenever he had time. Seven or eight of the hanging rings at home had been broken, and many of them had fallen to the ground.

Li Hao asked a few more questions, and time passed quickly.

It was only when Liu Yan reminded him that it was almost time for dinner that Li Hao finally stopped his questioning.

The more he understood, the more he yearned for it!

If he couldn’t enter the superpower realm quickly, it would be good for him to improve his martial arts and have more self-protection abilities.

“Soaking in sword water is a good thing. I have to get more and drink more!”

Li Hao felt a cool sensation on his chest. This might be the only way for him to quickly close the gap between him and the others.
