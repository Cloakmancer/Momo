After saying that, he looked at the spiritual bodies that appeared in the long river. These venerable sovereigns were all bowing their heads, not daring to say anything.Before this, he still dared to say a few words.But when Li Hao killed Samsara ... Even though they all knew that they had all contributed in this battle and that Li Hao might not have had the strength to do so without them ... They still felt fear and admiration from the bottom of their hearts.What a terrifying person!They had gained a lot from this battle. They had personally participated in the battle of Dao and gained insight into the thousands of great DAOs, reincarnation, and even nomological rules ...It could be said that after this battle, if they could return successfully and bring back their comprehensions, they would definitely be able to improve further.But ... Could he still return?Li Hao didn't waste any time. He looked at the thousands of broken traces in the river, exhaled, and smiled."Fortunately, a part of it was broken, not all ...""Second cat!" He shouted.The two cats appeared and they were extremely weak.He was helpless!Did he have to work again?"I'll try to restore time ....""Take a look at the replacement paths I asked you to create. Which one is broken? just get it for me ..." Li Hao said. "The rest of you, go and collect the scattered energy around. I'll repair time first!"He had to fix time first. It was not that he was in a hurry to use it, but that he had to continue laying down the heavenly Daoist Rite and transport these spiritual bodies back. Li Hao's voice resounded in all directions."Everyone, please calm down. I'll send you back soon. After this, the dojo will be officially opened, and it will remain unchanged! If you guys have any gains, you can help me promote it ..."Immediately, a venerable sovereign said,"there's no need for us to announce it. In this battle, the venerable was invincible and killed the Samsara. His name has already shaken the chaos. The name of the heavenly Daoist temple will definitely resound throughout the chaos!"After this battle, Li Hao's name resounded throughout the chaos.Killing Samsara was his true path to chaos, his name in chaos, his escape from the suppression of neo martial, and his battle with the king of men.No one would ever say that Silver Moon was a vassal of neo martial.No one would ever think that the Silver Moon King was the only one who was difficult to deal with.It was only at this moment that the Silver Moon King and the human King could be considered equal, or even slightly superior ... Of course, Li Hao's actual combat strength had not reached this level.But killing Samsara, no matter what method he used, was Li Hao's ability.The time star was dismantled by Li Hao.At this moment, some of the great DAOs were broken. Fortunately, both cats had copies. However, it was still difficult to restore them.Li Hao, on the other hand, didn't care about this. He just wanted to try and restore it.Furthermore, after today's battle, his comprehension of Dao had deepened. In addition, he had a deeper understanding of the rules. In fact, he also understood some things. For example, why would Time and Stars have constant changes in the Dao? perhaps it was nothing else but the Dao spirit ... Spirituality.Even if it was restored, it was not as good as before, so it should still have some of the original time power.This was enough!The people around them started to collect resources and clean up the battlefield. This time, they had killed many powerful venerable sovereigns and even took over the entire world of reincarnation. To them, it was a great harvest.Of course ... Myriad incarnations and the others didn't dare to hope for any spoils of war. At this moment, they were all waiting obediently at the side, each more obedient than the other.Today, Li Hao was the main character of chaos!Even the human Kings had been suppressed. Even after killing the extreme Ice Emperor, five level 8s, breaking out of the encirclement of 15 level 8s, and killing four level 8s, they were still not as brilliant as Li Hao's side.At this moment, everyone was looking at Li Hao nervously trying to repair time.They ... Actually didn't want to watch it, because they were afraid that Li Hao would find out.However, he really couldn't help it.They weren't the only ones. At this moment, the spiritual bodies were also watching Li Hao arrange and reorganize the thousands of great DAOs. They were all extremely nervous.This was probably the most direct, profound, and mysterious combination of DAOs they had ever seen in their lives.Flowing time!But Li Hao ... He didn't drive them away, either because he had forgotten about them or because he didn 'T. He just let them watch. This ... Was too unbelievable. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Of course, they soon realized that Li Hao hadn't forgotten.At this moment, Li Hao wasn't angry after failing several times. Instead, he thought for a moment and said,""This time, there are some problems with the time group. I hope everyone can help!"Li Hao said,"please help me control the great DAOs according to the worlds you've fused with. The great DAOs lack some spirituality and are difficult to combine. They could've been combined, but there's some repulsion now. It's obvious that they lack spirituality, so they can't be combined!""As it was before, you guys can continue to help me manage it for a while and reorganize it. That's enough. I don't need your help ..."Everyone was shocked, but the next moment, they were overjoyed!How could such a good thing be considered helping!This was a good opportunity to comprehend the great Dao!You can't even get it.Even the myriad transformations Emperor and the others were envious. What kind of help was this?They had never seen such a complicated and profound Dao in their entire lives. At this moment, they were personally participating in it and reorganizing it. Even if they could only look at it and not comprehend it personally, it was still a harvest that they would never forget.Li Hao quickly looked at the few Level Seven venerable sovereigns.""You guys, help me out as well. Tier 7 Masters more great DAOs. There are 10000 of them this time, but they don't have enough ... Everyone, join in and help me fix it!"

"Thank you, venerable one!"The few Grade 7 experts were also overjoyed.They were just about to say it, but Li Hao brought it up himself. They were overjoyed.The Silver Moon martial masters also joined in.Hong Yitang, on the other hand, didn't participate. After everyone entered the river, Hong Yitang glanced at Li Hao and sighed. He suddenly said,""Li Hao ..."Li Hao looked back. At this moment, Hong Yitang looked extremely Holy.But ...Li Hao frowned slightly.Hong Yitang's expression was complicated, but he still said,""I want to go out first ... This time, a large number of venerable sovereigns have fallen, and the worlds are in turmoil. Many venerable sovereigns in the Eastern Region will probably escape. I'm afraid they'll devour the worlds and annihilate all living beings! I want to ... Bring back a part of the human race. "Li Hao thought for a moment and nodded. In an instant, he raised his hand and pulled a person out of the river of Dao.The Queen was stunned, and Li Hao said, you accompany senior uncle Hong to gather the human race! You're only gathering the energy within the power of faith. As for the spiritual energy and power of faith within the power of faith, let martial uncle absorb them all!"The Queen couldn't wait!In fact, she was very worried that she would be assimilated by the faith. She was worried every day and didn't want herself to be like that. Now, since Hong Yitang was absorbing it, she was naturally eager!"Alright!"She agreed readily, but Hong Yitang didn't care. Since Li Hao had no objections, he didn't say anything and left with the Queen.

The great DAOs that had clearly been unable to merge together before could actually merge now.There was a huge difference between a Dao with spirituality and a Dao without spirituality.Under Li Hao's control, they finally restored the 10000 stars of time, which were originally difficult to restore, although they seemed to be a little weaker than before. However, a time star was successfully formed again.Li Hao was overjoyed!After this time, he finally understood. He had solved all the problems on the path of merging the 10000 DAOs. He might need a lot of time to experiment, do, and improve ...However, with the first step, the rest would be much easier.Time and Stars recovered, the river reappeared, and the heavenly Daoist temple could naturally recover.Very quickly, many rivers of time appeared.Those spiritual bodies also appeared in the previous training hall, and Li Hao's voice spread out again.""Everyone, you can return! You've helped me a lot this time, and Li Hao has nothing to repay you with. Next, you'll be teleported to the heavenly Daoist Rite and can enter the Dao chess game at will to comprehend the great Dao ... There's no need for assessment or anything else!""Thank you for your help, venerable one!"Countless venerable sovereigns expressed their thanks and were overjoyed!This time, he had gained a lot!As the passage opened again, these spiritual bodies did not stay and left one after another.Not long after, venerable sovereigns in thousands of worlds in the Eastern Region received the message. The next moment, countless sector Lords and Dao Masters from the eastern worlds walked out of their worlds, their great DAOs surging in excitement. At this moment, they actually bowed in Li Hao's direction!There was an order to hearing the Dao, and the one who achieved it came first!This time, they ... Truly had the feeling of hearing the Dao. If they heard the Dao in the morning, they could die in the evening.Even if it had not reached this stage, to them, this was an unprecedented opportunity.At this moment, the gates of the heavenly Daoist Rite opened in the worlds. Venerable sovereigns wandered around and shouted,""The heavenly Daoist Rite has been established. Fellow Daoists from all four directions can enter! Dao sparring Holy Land, chaos fortune, bright moon Dao master, the Saint of the East ..."It was an extreme flattery, but there was also some sincerity. At this moment, he really wanted to publicize this Taoist sanctum and let everyone participate!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, Li Hao was extremely weak and didn't have the time to care about this. He didn't care about the spoils of war. He dragged his tired body and fled into the distance.A moment later, they arrived at another place.At this moment, the human King didn't care about him. He was tearing apart the world, the extreme Ice world, and another great world. The human King didn't say a word as he tore apart the world. The entire starry sky was filled with energy, great Dao crystals, great Dao power ...The human King was currently reversing yin and yang, wanting to self-destruct everyone before he resurrected.Seeing that Li Hao had arrived, he simply turned his head and nodded slightly without saying anything.This time, although they had killed Extreme Ice and the others, new martial arts had also suffered heavy losses. A large number of venerable sovereigns had self-destructed. Even if these people were resurrected, they might not be as good as before.Seeing that Li Hao had arrived, the Supreme martial artist took the initiative to come over and said with a sigh,""Congratulations, little friend!""Fang ping is currently setting up the resurrection formation, he has no time for other things ...""I understand!"Li Hao nodded and said,"I don't think the power of the two worlds is enough. It lacks enough vitality ... Reincarnation is mainly about life and death. If I extract all the vitality of reincarnation and put it in, it will at least have enough vitality for resurrection ...""This ...""Samsara was killed by you ..." The Grandmaster said, somewhat embarrassed."Senior, you're treating me as an outsider by saying so."Li Hao laughed."This time, it wasn't my victory. If it weren't for you, senior human King, I wouldn't have achieved such a result. In fact, it's already difficult to clearly separate neo martial and silver Moon. In the eyes of others, they are one, and there's no need to deliberately separate them ..."The busy human King turned around and couldn't help but Mutter,""Little fellow, now that you're strong enough, you won't split up? You don't have enough strength, so you have to distinguish clearly? You really are ..."Even though he said that, he still said impolitely,""Get it quickly, it just so happens that I don't have enough vitality! "Also, you borrowed the power of an outsider. You don't have the power to kill reincarnation, so enter rank 8 as soon as possible! Otherwise ... After killing Samsara today, it might be even more dangerous next time!""Thank you for your reminder, human King!""Do you need my help to resurrect the seniors, human King?" Li Hao chuckled."No need!""It's a small matter!"The human King said indifferently.Seeing this, Li Hao didn't say anything. He quickly fled, leaving behind a large amount of vitality.After he left ... The human King suddenly cursed,""What a heartless little guy. He doesn't know how to be polite at all. Doesn't he know that resurrecting a person can lead to countless lightning tribulations? I'm too embarrassed to ask for it. Damn it, I'm really not going to help!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe Supreme martial artist was speechless!Who asked you to care about your face?It made sense. After reviving so many people, he would definitely face a lightning tribulation. Li Hao happened to be familiar with the chaos lightning tribulation. With his help, things should be ... Much easier.It was a pity.Now, he was too embarrassed to say anything.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Soon, Li Hao saw countless bolts of lightning in the distance."Why didn't you ... Give me a hand?" Kong Ji was a little confused.Li Hao looked into the distance and smiled."The human King might need to condense lightning tribulations? Or training his body? I'm not too sure, but he said that he doesn't need my help. After all, he's a senior, so I can't say much. "Kong Ji nodded and couldn't help but say,"human King is still overbearing!" He actually dared to use so many lightning tribulations to refine his body! All of them combined are probably even more powerful than Samsara's attacks ... It's equivalent to another battle. They're truly unparalleled in their bravery!"The human King was indeed impressive. It could have been avoided, but Li Hao had to use it to temper his body. This body-tempering technique was extraordinary!Li Hao also sighed with emotion ...After sighing for a while, he suddenly felt like laughing. The human King ... Wouldn't really use the lightning tribulation to temper his body, right?As for whether he was too embarrassed to ask or something else, Li Hao didn't say much. That was because he was also very empty right now. If he really helped, he would feel bad. Since the human King had declined, he could just go with the flow!In any case, he wouldn't be able to kill the human King.

Thunder rumbled!Li Hao really didn't care. People like the human King had a tough life, and with the Supreme martial artist and the others around, Li Hao would be shocked if he was killed by this lightning tribulation.At this moment, Li Hao finally had some time to count his gains.He had killed several level eight venerable sovereigns, Feng Ming, tu Ling, Samsara, and two other level eight venerable sovereigns from the world of Samsara. Li Hao did not care what their names were.Five level 8 experts!In addition, seizing a world was a proper top-notch great world. In the chaos, it was also a top-notch existence.After that, there was nothing else.Dismantling and restoring the time great Dao were all internal gains.This time, there were some unexpected gains. For example ... Qian Wuliang was about to reach Level 7, and it seemed like he was really going to succeed.Hong Yitang gave up on the Dao universe and directly fused two DAOs!At this moment, Qian Wuliang didn't advance to the next level. In fact, Li Hao could tell that Qian Wuliang was trying to suppress his advancement on purpose. He was very careful and nervous.Two-Dao universe!Before, Qian Wuliang was only Hong Yitang's assistant, so he felt more at ease. But now, Qian Wuliang had two Dao universes all to himself. If Qian Wuliang had reached Level Seven, Li Hao was actually only at Level Seven!More importantly, Silver Moon could be said to have grown up by sucking Li Hao's blood.Qian Wuliang was worried that he would be scared to death if he entered Level Seven at this moment, especially in the dual-path universe.‚Äã He had merged some of Hong Yitang's River of great Dao, but he didn't dare to merge all of it. At this moment, he had been suppressing it and didn't dare to level up. Otherwise, once he absorbed it, he would definitely reach Level Seven!Li Hao, on the other hand, had noticed.However, he was not in a hurry to deal with it.He looked at the crowd, and soon, he looked at the myriad transformations Emperor. This person had joined the battle. Of course, the six of them were only seventh-rank, but they were just there to make a name for themselves. In fact, Li Hao didn't expect much from them.However, it was already very good that he wasn't scared off.At that time, the timid ones almost ran away in fear.To be able to endure until the end was actually a success.Li Hao didn't say much and simply said,""Thanks to your help, we were able to kill the two rank eight venerable sovereigns in the reincarnation realm this time ... Now that reincarnation is dead, the power of the great Dao in the two rank eight venerable sovereigns is not much ... I'll leave them to you.""This ... I wouldn't dare!""I wouldn't dare let the venerable one ..." Myriad incarnations hurriedly said.A venerable!It was a rare title for a top venerable sovereign.But at this moment, myriad transformations didn't dare to call him fellow Daoist anymore. He hurriedly said,"This time, we're only here for the heavenly Daoist Rite. Now that the Daoist Rite has been established and we've comprehended some truths of the great Dao, it can be said that we've reached the extreme ... To us, this is a great opportunity ..." Li Hao smiled."That's a different matter. Dao enlightenment is everyone's ability, not the spoils of war. It's already incredible that you dared to fight in this battle. Besides, we've offended the three overlords. Two weak eighth-rank beings are nothing to me. Moreover, Daoist myriad incarnations, if you want to reach level eight, I'm afraid you'll need a lot of great DAOs ..."Venerable sovereign myriad transformations hesitated.At this moment, the other venerable sovereigns were also very tempted. However, they also understood that although it was said to be for them, it was actually for myriad transformations.The peak of myriad transformations seventh level. This time, the heavenly Daoist Rite was successfully established. Perhaps it would not take long for him to reach the eighth level. With the power of the great Dao in the bodies of two eighth level venerable sovereigns, the eighth level was almost certain!Of course, Li Hao's nice words were to give the six of them the crystals, but the other five didn't dare to, and couldn 't, give them to the Alliance as long as they weren't stupid. The Alliance had an additional tier 8, so their status would be completely different.Even if he gave it to them, they wouldn't be able to reach level eight.If he gave it to myriad transformations, myriad transformations level eight was almost guaranteed.Myriad transformations Emperor wanted to say more, but Li Hao's voice was not loud, but it was firm."Fellow Daoist, please accept it. Otherwise, I won't be able to answer to myself!"Myriad transformations Emperor's heart skipped a beat and he hurriedly said,""Then ... Then thank you for your help, venerable one!""This is what you deserve. I never mistreat my friends."  Best novel online free at ùô£Oùô´ùôöùô°ùôóùôûùô£ Li Hao smiled.He gave the power of these two great DAOs to myriad transformations and the others. Li Hao looked at the others. Feng Ming was a demon and cultivated poison. It seemed that no one on his side could cultivate poison.And it was a demon!Li Hao also had a few demons on his side, such as li Fuhai and black Panther.However ... Now that Black Panther had stepped into the sixth step, he had started to cultivate the lightning element.Li Hao even wanted to pass on the divine catastrophe text to the Thunder of calamity. Although the power of the eighth step was useful to the Black Panther, it would be a waste.Li Fu hai was too weak.Poison element, the power of the demon race ...Li Hao thought for a while and searched the crowd. In the end, he decided to give the body of the demon to Dao Qi."Me?"Even Dao Qi was stunned!What?For me?The buzzing was not weak. A cultivator with 4000 great Dao was known as the number one demon under the spring and autumn era. Of course, that was not the case.Even stronger than a game of chess!But ... Why are you giving it to me?Li Hao thought for a moment and said,"I'm giving it to you, senior. It's not for your cultivation. It's too wasteful. I want you to turn the buzzing bees into soldiers!" It can be said that even a grade-7 cultivator would be easily poisoned to death, and even a grade-8 cultivator would be at a huge disadvantage if they were to be touched by it ... Senior has refined it into a monarch weapon that can travel through space. It can be said that ... You are unparalleled in assassins!"

Shuttle, stab!4,000 grade eight cultivators with great Dao laws, coupled with spatial travel, could be suppressed by the Dao chess. It could be said that once the cooperation was successful, even if the Dao chess only had the power of 2000 to 3000 Dao laws, they could still fight against someone with the power of 4000 Dao laws.Dao Qi was stunned.Assassination!Be an assassin?This ...Can I do it?Was it appropriate?To be honest, he was very surprised that the corpse of a top-tier rank eight was given to him.Li Hao was a good person.If there were benefits, he would really give them!However, if he gave too much, he would be at a loss. He had just swallowed an eighth-tier universe a few days ago, and now he was giving more ..."Why don't we let a rank-7 devour it? perhaps there's still hope for him to reach rank-8 ..."Li Hao, however, shook his head."We must distribute it reasonably. We must also consider how much effort we put in. We can't be completely fair. We must improve the means of our top experts!" I'm afraid senior daoqi will be busy from now on. The maintenance of the dojo will require a lot of your effort, and it will take up a lot of your cultivation time ..."Dao Qi was a little embarrassed and coughed,""Then ... I ...""Senior, please accept it!"Dao Qi laughed. At this moment, he nodded."Then ... Then it would be impolite to refuse! In addition, I have the 10000 chess pieces. In fact, I don't need to refine them too much. I just need to spread the poisonous thorns all over the chess pieces and refine their Dao domain into one. I am a monarch weapon, so I have more ways to attack and kill!"Originally, he was not good at attacking.Therefore, it was difficult for the three tier 8 experts to break through the defense of two of them in an instant. At this moment, with this, the ten thousand poisonous thorns could break through the defense of two tier 8 experts.This time, Dao Qi was extremely happy.Li Hao also smiled and nodded."Senior, you can make your own arrangements. I don't have enough understanding of weapon refinement. If you don't understand, you can go to neo martial arts and consult the creation Supreme Emperor."Next was the Earth Spirit, which was also a top venerable sovereign. Li Hao looked at them and then at Yuan Shuo.Upon seeing this, Yuan Shuo knew that his disciple was probably going to give him special treatment again.He was a little happy, but also a little stressed.Hong Yitang ... Had gone out. From eating Li Hao's flesh to now, he had become independent and stopped eating Li Hao's flesh. He had eaten his disciple's flesh until he reached Level Seven. Now, the Earth Spirit, a peak level eight Earth Spirit ...While he was thinking, Li Hao said,"Earth Spirit, use the power of the five elements, teacher. Strengthen your earth element and try to combine the five elements as soon as possible. I've said that I'll take the five elements Supreme Emperor's life sooner or later!"Yuan Shuo was under great pressure!This time, he was really under some pressure.He opened his mouth but didn't know what to say. Suddenly, he gritted his teeth and said,""Alright, give it to me!""I ... I want to go out and gain experience!" He added. ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao was speechless. You're already so old, where are you going to train?The East is temporarily at peace. If you want to go, you can only go to the other three sides. It will be very dangerous.At this age, wouldn't it be better to follow me?"I'll go to the North to train!"Yuan Shuo added another sentence. Clearly, he had his own thoughts."Oh, okay. Let's absorb it first!" Li Hao said perfunctorily.‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùF * ck!Yuan Shuo cursed in his heart. 'This B * stard is so useless. He's always looking down on me for being weak. I want to go out, but he won't let me.'How annoying!Forget it, I'll run away after I'm done absorbing it. This time, I'll absorb this top-tier rank-8. It's impossible to reach rank-8, but at least I'll be at the top of rank-7.He didn't say much, in any case ... He was going!"The reincarnation Emperor is considered an Overlord. I didn't want to do anything to him ..." He said.Li Hao paused and said,"but he's dead. It's a waste that the power of his great DAOs is scattered. Brother kongji, it's yours. Your six paths and three extremes also contain life and death. If you don't have enough power of reincarnation, the universe of the great Dao of reincarnation still exists. If you absorb it while you're dead, I'll be embarrassed if you don't reach level eight."Kong Ji was a little embarrassed. 'It seems like it's a sin for me not to enter level eight, but ... It's not easy.'He was having a headache!"As for seniors Wu Shan, Thunder Emperor, and Sen LAN ... First strengthen your great DAOs and open up Dao domains before thinking about other things. Seniors are very strong, but ... Your great DAOs are a little monotonous. At the very least, your Dao domains need to be more perfect ...""I will also absorb some great DAOs to fill my 2000th world!" Li Hao said.At this point, what should be distributed had almost been distributed. Li Hao looked at the Restless Qian Wuliang and said in a calm tone,"Since senior uncle Hong has chosen to give up ... From today on, you are the only silver Moon Dao master, Qian Wuliang ...""This ... You can't ..." He said.Qian Wuliang hurriedly said,"Lord Marquis, I think we should choose another person to inherit Silver moon's Dao of truth." I think many people are suitable ..."Li Hao thought for a moment and said,'splitting up is actually not a bad idea, but ... If silver Moon wants to produce a top-tier expert, he might still need to combine reality with illusion! "I actually think that separating and balancing each other is beneficial for the future, but not for the present ..."  Best novel online free at ’≤÷Ö—µ“Ωl’≥√≠’≤  That's right, separation was beneficial for separation of power, checks and balances, fairness ...However, for now, only by combining reality and illusion could an expert be quickly born, a rank 7 dual Dao master.Great Dao unification!In this way, although Qian Wuliang couldn't reach level 8 quickly, he could be used as a level 8 fighter in the later stage if he made one more step forward and combined two DAOs.

This was the best way.Qian Wuliang was about to say something when Li Hao said,""Let's do this!"For a moment, Qian Wuliang was full of anticipation and anxiety. Finally, he gritted his teeth and said,""Wuliang will definitely die for the Marquis ..."Li Hao was extremely calm,"no need!" Of course, this doesn't mean that I want you to be an ambitious person, but rather, don't forget that Silver Moon is also your home, mine, and many others "!""I don't dare!"Li Hao added,"it doesn't matter if he dares or not. It's fine as long as he's relatively fair. Everyone has their own selfish motives, and no one can be truly fair. However ... I only have one request. Don't cut off Silvermoon's path of becoming a latecomer!""Wuliang understands!"At this moment, Qian Wuliang felt extremely complicated.Li Hao was really free and easy.He really did not want Silver Moon anymore, nor did he plant any more people to take over the truth universe. Of course, he had never thought of rebelling, unless Li Hao died. If he died, he would have to consider it carefully and resurrect as soon as possible.Otherwise, he was afraid that he would die an ugly death.He had seen too many experts who thought they could kill Li Hao die under Li Hao's sword.Li Hao calculated for a moment. Samsara was a large world, and its reserves were not small. He probably had enough energy to fill up 2000 Worlds. If it was empty, he was not sure if he could enter level eight.It would probably be a little difficult for him to become a teacher.This time, their realms didn't improve much. Of course, uncle master Hong had reached Level 7 by virtue of his faith and responsibility. Qian Wuliang was also fine, but there were two more Level 7 Masters.As for level eight ... Myriad transformation was probably in the bag, but he wasn't one of them.It didn't seem like he had improved much after killing so many powerhouses, but ... Li Hao soon smiled. It wasn't bad.At that moment, second cat suddenly stuck out his tongue and gasped,"What about me?" ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùLi Hao was stunned. He coughed and said,"senior two cat ... It's better to continue devouring the world origin of the Samsara realm and recover your living body. Try to maintain the power of duplication with your living body ... This way, you'll feel real ..."I Almost Forgot About You!Without a physical body, second cat's presence was too weak, mainly because it had finished its work and Li Hao had forgotten about it.‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùSecond cat was speechless. I knew it!You remember me when you're using it, but you forget me when you're not using it.Fortunately, he had opened his mouth. Otherwise, Li Hao might have forgotten about his existence. Fortunately, he had obtained the source of life from the realm of Samsara. "There are still countless living beings in the reincarnation realm ...""This ... Let's put it aside for now. The world will not be destroyed. It will only lose its power, the great path of the universe, and the source of life. In a few days, I will make arrangements. You don't have to worry about the people in the Queen's divine Kingdom and the people in the Li realm!"Li Hao made arrangements.There was no rush for this.At this moment, Dao Qi spoke,""This time, new martial has earned big! "Let's not talk about Extreme Ice. Other than Extreme Ice, there are so many rank-8 great worlds. This time, some escaped directly, and some swallowed the world ... Anyway, the new martial artists will gain a lot from this. There are also many rank-8 corpses ... I think those who self-exploded can not only recover, but they might even improve. "Li Hao laughed. Daoqi was very concerned about neo martial. Of course, this guy was interesting and always wanted to compare it with neo martial.The new martial artists were now at level eight. Including sun god and light, there were a total of five. However, on Li Hao's side, Li Hao wasn 't. There were only three of them so far. He felt unhappy and hoped that some would be born so that they could completely suppress the new martial artists.This time, the new martial artists had gained a lot, but they had also paid a great price. Venerable the sword and the others had all self-destructed. If they wanted to recover to their peak ... They would have to consume a lot of energy. This time, they had taken down Extreme Ice and the other great world, but they could barely recover. It was Li Hao who had provided them with a lot of vitality.It all depended on whether new martial could gain more.  Best novel online free at ’≤÷Ö—µ“Ωl’≥√≠’≤  "There's no rush!"Li Hao laughed."At present, the situation is still in our favor. We and neo martial, one inside and one outside, have joined forces to occupy the East. In addition, long Zhan has the intention to deal with Tian Fang. The three of us can be considered to have reached a fragile alliance to resist the three overlords!""The spring and autumn era and the five elements have both lost a top-tier venerable sovereign. We need to be on guard against huntian venerable sovereign!"Li Hao sighed."This way, the current chaos can still maintain balance for a while. As long as we don't cause trouble for others, no one will cause trouble for us in the short term ... The premise is that Tian Fang's return doesn't cause any trouble."As he said this, his eyes flickered.Tian Fang was about to return.Very quickly!This time, he had a premonition that it would be the next moment if it was short, or three to five years if it was long. In short, Tian Fang was about to return, and it was about time.Choosing to return at this time ... He must have had some plans.I hope it won't cause me any trouble.I owe the three Tian Fang cultivators a favor, but that doesn't mean I owe the entire Tian Fang. Also ... What can I do if I don't admit it?It all depended on one's heart!Li Hao didn't care too much about the time backlash. It depended on one's belief."Next, the most important place is the heavenly Daoist sect!"Li Hao said,"everyone, it's best to immerse yourself in the heavenly Daoist field with me and comprehend the Dao! I'll open up a little world and temporarily ignore the problem of filling it up. I'll fuse with the chaos myself and fill it up a little ... The main thing is to open up Dao laws!"

"As for the others, be it senior Wushan, you, or anyone else, it's normal for them to have their main Dao regardless of the laws they cultivate. However, you can't completely ignore other great DAOs. Dao domain ... Is the best and most authentic way to improve.""In addition ... I have some other thoughts about the great Dao ... I won't talk about it for now. It's mainly related to spirituality. We'll talk about it after everyone has constructed their Dao domain and reached this step!"He had made the appropriate arrangements. At the side, myriad incarnations and the others had been listening. At this moment, they were all sighing.Li Hao was ruthless and had many tricks up his sleeve. Most importantly ... This person was really good to his own people. Such a person had previously threatened to destroy the four-sided region and forced long Zhan to leave.For a moment, he didn't know how to judge Li Hao.Saint?Demon?He did not know."In addition, I'll have to trouble the middle world Alliance ... To continue helping me maintain the operation of my dojo. I'll be going into seclusion for a while!"Li Hao smiled."Previously, I only borrowed external power. It doesn't mean that I really have the power to kill reincarnation. This time, after I perfected the 2000 World, I'll probably only be comparable to cultivators with 3400 Dao laws ... There's still a huge gap between me and reincarnation!"He didn't seem to be afraid of others knowing his true strength. Venerable sovereign myriad transformations and the others only heard it and did not dare to take it seriously.Would you believe me if I said that?Even Samsara didn't dare to believe it!Those who believed it were all dead.He died a terrible death!At this moment, Li Hao didn't say anything more. He looked at the crowd and said,""Let's go. We can finally rest for a few days!"His line of sight looked into the distance.The three overlords would probably take action soon, right?At this moment, there was still a question in his mind. What were those grade-9 experts doing?Could they ... Return?"If Tian Fang returns this time, perhaps I'll be able to see a thing or two. In addition, it seems like only Tian Fang left behind his lair in the primordial chaos. What about the other rank-9?For example, the Lord of calamity, the top experts ranked in the entire chaosworld's Nine Heavens, and the other level nines...When they left, what was the situation with their headquarters?Did he directly take away the world or what?Were the powerhouses of their world Dead or Alive?Would they also return one after another?Why did he return after a million years? was it related to time or something else?These were all doubts that Li Hao had yet to figure out.The most important thing now was to improve his strength and complete the two thousand realms. At that time, he would at least have the power of level eight.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶After the battle in the East, Li Hao had become famous. At this moment, there was no expert in the chaotic heavens who did not know that even Samsara had died at Li Hao's hands. This young and unbelievable expert had instantly risen from the chaos with unparalleled strength.His heavenly Daoist sect was also famous throughout the world.In terms of the Dao of the world, it gathered the heroes of chaos!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the West.Chaos heaven world.In the Supreme Treasure Hall.Huntian Supreme Emperor looked at the three rank eights without saying a word.At this moment, Peng Cheng was trembling in fear.This time, huntian seemed to have suffered no losses, but in fact, he had suffered a great loss. All his arrangements in the East had been destroyed. Otherwise, the East would have fallen into huntian's hands according to the earlier arrangements.But now, almost all of the people huntian had planted had fallen.The three of them had returned, but ... The powerful Samsara had died there.After a long time, huntian calmly said,"I'm not surprised that Samsara died there. If he won, he might not have come to huntian world. It's just that ... He still died in the end. That's what surprised me."Samsara wasn't someone who was willing to be his subordinate. This fellow wasn't easy to subdue.  BEst novel online free at ’ºO ã…õ ü…Æ…®’º  It was a pity that he was dead. Otherwise, he could have been of some help to him."I'm not dissatisfied with you guys. It's already not easy for you to escape unscathed ..."Huntian said. Just as Peng Cheng was feeling a little more at ease, huntian Supreme Emperor said coldly,""What I'm a little dissatisfied with is that I've been at ease and invincible for too long. You guys ... Have been a little ... Negligent! The strong were all fought and killed to become strong! This is actually an opportunity, but you should retreat if you're in trouble. When Li Hao was fighting Samsara, even if you didn't attack Li Hao, why didn't you attack Thunderlord and the others instead of just watching?""Are you afraid?"Huntian frowned, expressing his dissatisfaction."If Li Hao really has the strength to kill all of you, do you think he'll let go?" This person is vicious and ruthless, cutting the weeds and eliminating the roots without any scruples. You've all been frightened by him!"Although he wasn't at the scene, he understood the situation very well.At this moment, he shook his head and said,"when there's a battle, fear is the greatest taboo!" In the battle between you and new martial and silver Moon, you lost because of ... Fear! The neo martial human King gave the order and the group of heroes self-destructed. Five tier 8 martial artists defeated fifteen tier 8 martial artists ... How ridiculous!""The people of Extreme Ice are afraid of death, but they are seeking death!""No." He shook his head again."As for Silver moon's side, if you had been a little braver and crazier in the previous battle ... You would not have been so defeated!""In total, how many powerhouses of the eighth step were sacrificed?""In the past million years, the number of level 8s who have fallen is far less than the number of level 8s who have fallen in the East. And these level 8s have all died at the hands of the new martial artist, Silver Moon ..."Pengcheng was speechless.Are you afraid?Yes, he was afraid.Even though he saw Li Hao's weakness in the end, he was still scared and even wanted to escape.

But ... He had to be afraid.Li Hao had killed too many level 8s.Huntian sighed helplessly. There were some things that everyone knew.He understood everything!Even if they were street punks, they also knew that the domineering ones were afraid of the dazed ones, and the dazed ones were afraid of those who didn't want their lives!More importantly ... If everyone knew, would you dare to be the one to risk your life?He didn't dare! If they didn't care about their lives, they wouldn't have said such words.Cherishing one's life was human nature."Alright, you guys can leave!"The three grade 8s didn't dare to say anything and quickly retreated.After they left, huntian Supreme Emperor said softly,""Those guys from the East are very difficult to deal with! And now, spring and autumn and the five elements are also extremely wary of me. Our three sides are restraining each other and can't move easily! Long Zhan definitely doesn't want us to invade the East. He's not weak. He has 7000 Dao laws and a body of chaos. Maybe he's still hiding something ..."This was the real trouble.He knew that it was a problem that might bring him trouble, but he couldn't solve it rashly.Otherwise ... He might get himself burned.At this moment, a black shadow appeared behind the scenes and said,""Tian Fang is about to return! Tian Fang's return might be an opportunity. As the Overlord of the East, could Tian Fang tolerate long Zhan occupying the four-sided region? If not, When two tigers fight, one will definitely be injured!""Secondly, in the North, the Earth Spirit has fallen. Although the metal spirit has mastered the earth element, the five elements are still a little imbalanced ... Perhaps we should focus on the North first! The East is difficult to deal with, the South is difficult to deal with in spring and autumn, and the North ... Is the most suitable for us! If they could take down the North this time and control the nine Heavens, the momentum of the Grand unification would be unstoppable, and they would definitely be able to see the nine Heavens! At that time, Dao master will be able to improve further ...""Further?" huntian asked in a deep voice. I'm not too optimistic about it ... With the appearance of the four-sided domain, the situation has become even more troublesome ...""Do you think I need to get involved in the changes in tianfang?""I can consider it ... But I can't go too deep! The master of tianfang and his group are all very terrifying ..."Huntian was silent.After a long while, he laughed coldly."This group of people may not be of one heart. Otherwise ... Forget it. Let's not talk about this. Tian Fang's return may just be the beginning. The other type 9 powerhouses ... Do you think ... They will return?""It's hard to say,""No." The black shadow shook his head."The path of return is not easy. Otherwise, I would have returned long ago!" However ... This time, a large number of venerable sovereigns have died, all of whom are top-tier venerable sovereigns. The power of great DAOs has overflowed, and the chaos 'capacity is even higher. Perhaps ... This will create some uncertainties. Perhaps some venerable sovereigns will return!""However, even if he returns, it might not be a bad thing for Dao master. His power is enough to dominate the chaos!" He added.Huntian was silent for a while and didn't say anything more.Dominate the chaos? That's just because those people didn't come back. If they did, could I, a pseudo-rank-9, dominate the chaos?The momentum of a grand unification was imperative!Perhaps only by controlling the nine Heavens could he step into that level completely.Then, he looked to the East and frowned slightly. Li Hao cultivated time, but what did the neo martial artist King major in?  BEst novel online free at ’ºO ã…õ ü…Æ…®’º  It was very strange!What did neo martial have to do with these grade-9 martial artists?And there was long Zhan. How did this fellow manage to cultivate to this level all by himself? a Chaos Beast? Peng Cheng could be considered a peak existence. If it wasn't for his help, even the 4000 great Dao would be difficult.The 7,000 great Dao ... This was too unbelievable.The north and south wouldn't be peaceful. Tian Fang was going to return. At this moment, chaos heaven Supreme Emperor was having a headache.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Deep in the chaos.At this moment, the group of statues was very quiet.Time had appeared once more.At this moment, the being with lightning in his eyes suddenly said,""Tian Fang, are your people ... Going back?"The master of Tian Fang opened his eyes and looked at the Lord of calamity. "It's time to return. If I don't ... It'll be too late!""I'm afraid ... It won't be too smooth!""Also, I'm afraid I'll need that person's help if I want to return officially ..." The master of tianfang said slowly.The Lord of calamity was silent for a while before saying,""That person is not a good person. He dared to use the power of my Thunder region to attack the square region and almost destroyed it ... This young man is so ruthless that hundreds of millions of people regard him as ants. 'Tian Fang, you've schemed so much, you've considered so much, and you've waited for so many years. If the time King that you've been waiting for is someone who's cruel and merciless ... Is it really suitable for us to wait?' In the past, a time cultivator was a little kind-hearted ... I've seen him once. If he had officially become a Dao master, there would be nothing to say, but ..."A time cultivator of a generation was a pure cultivator. In the true sense, time was traceless, and he was a traveler of time.That was in line with the image of the time King in everyone's heart.This second generation ... They didn't know much about him before, but now they did. He was a ruthless man who wanted to destroy the square region and threaten a beast of primordial chaos. No one would believe it if this was spread.At this moment, all the statues opened their eyes. No one spoke, but they were all somewhat fearful.After a long time, someone said,"this person might not be suitable to control time ... Tian Fang, if your people return ... I suggest ... You eliminate this person!" The time King we want is selfless and willing to give ..."The master of tianfang fell silent.After a long time, he slowly said,"if we eliminate him, who is suitable to control time?."

The crowd fell silent again.Yes, who was suitable?If it were that simple, anyone could wield it, and they wouldn't have waited until Li Hao's era.He was born in a world where Time and Stars were born. He was naturally gifted and his Dao was natural ...All of this created the second generation of time cultivators.Who else was suitable to be in charge?"If he is not suitable ... Then ... The third generation!" Someone suddenly said."I saw a third generation time cultivator in the dark," someone said coldly."Perhaps ... This also means that Li Hao really isn't the person we're waiting for!"The master of tianfang was stunned and looked at the man.That person wasn't considered top-tier among the grade-9 experts.However, the great Dao was special. It was similar to fate, the future, and prediction. He said that he saw the third generation time cultivator?How was that possible?"When did you see it? why didn't you say so earlier?""Not long ago!""Not long ago, I sensed something ..." The man said softly.Not long ago?The master of Tian Fang immediately began to think. Could it be that ... The second-generation Li Hao wasn't the one they were waiting for in the end?  Best novel online free at ÔΩé0ÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé Otherwise, logically speaking, there shouldn't be a third generation time King!If the person they were waiting for was someone who could control time, he would be almost undying. In the same era or even in the same chaos, it was impossible for two time cultivators to appear. Time ... Was the only one!This was something that the first-generation time cultivator had said in the past.Time was the only one.In other words, it was impossible for two time Dao cultivators to exist in a single era. There could only be one!However, this person saw the third person ... In other words, Li Hao might die, and he wasn't the person they were waiting for?At this time, even the master of tianfang's expression changed.Would he?Who could still control time?Only Li Hao could control time ... Could it be that ... Silver Moon Dao master?It was also born in the Silvermoon universe!It was reasonable to say that outsiders had almost no way of controlling them. These Silver Moon cultivators were born within time, and only people of this era could do so, because Li Hao had taken away time. Those who were born later did not possess this ability. Who else was more suitable than Li Hao?At this moment, he did not know much about the entire Silver Moon, so he said,""When my people return ... I can check it out. If ... I'll see! I don't know much about Li Hao, and neither do you. Your previous actions ... Might not mean ..."He didn't know what to say.He dared to use the power of the Thunder region to destroy countless worlds in the square region. It could be said that he was ruthless enough to destroy his own lair. It was normal for everyone to be a little afraid.If you're already like this now, what about when you're at the ninth step?Time was extremely powerful. Once he reached the ninth-rank, would Li Hao really be able to get along with everyone?To put it more directly ... It was not easy to control!Even though everyone knew that the time King was powerful, as a rank-9 who had been around for many years, no one was willing to be controlled by time. After all, controlling time was more or less the same.Someone said faintly,'if you can exchange, do it as soon as possible! Otherwise, it might not be a good thing to drag it out! In short, I'm not very satisfied with this person ... I think someone else has the same idea as me!"Tian Fang looked at that person without saying anything. Life and death path master!He had been defeated by Li Hao in this battle, and his Dao of life and death had suffered some damage. It was normal for him to be dissatisfied with Li Hao. Although he didn't know the situation, Samsara was indeed a spokesperson that life and death had secretly cultivated.It was a pity ... Before he could explain clearly, he was gone."Let's see. "The master of tianfang didn't say anything else. Everything could wait until they returned.Li Hao ... Time ... The third generation time King?What did all this mean?At this moment, even he, a top expert, was a little hesitant. Where did the third generation come from?Why ... Was there no warning?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the same time.On a long river, a young man who had just woken up was followed by a group of people. He led this group of people and went against the current.There was some doubt in his eyes,"can we walk out?" The end ... Is it out of this chaos, or is there ... No way out? Now, if we continue walking, have we walked into the past or have we walked out of the chaos?"The people behind him were at a loss. They shook their heads. How would we know? we've never tried it before.Come to think of it, you've slept for so long, and you're about to leave the moment you wake up. What triggered you again? "Emperor su ... Let's just live our own lives. This ... Let's not talk about whether we can walk out of this place. Even if we can, we've walked to the past ... Is it really possible?"The young man touched his chin and smiled. His smile was a little strange."I don't want to get involved, but I might have seen the time King twice. Things can't happen three times! The two times I saw him, he seemed to be in some trouble ... What I'm worried about now is whether he can still open up the river of time after he dies. "Hmm, it's very contradictory. But if we really exist in the future, in the river of time ... In a pseudo-chaos ... I'm worried that the past will change the future! That's going to be troublesome. I do want to sleep as much as I want since I'm way too tired. But the main thing is, I'm afraid that someone might kill Shi Guang ..."After saying this, he sighed."This is really troublesome! Human Emperor, you've walked through the river of time, and I've also gone against it, even walking to the end ... Why ... Can't I walk out?"At this moment, a middle-aged man with a solemn expression pondered for a while and said,""I'm afraid that it'll be very difficult to walk out of this place. Unless ... The other party opens up the river of time, allowing the past and future to be the same! "When time is in chaos, we might still have a chance. The flow of time is different, and we can be considered a type of inner world. If the flow of time is faster, perhaps we'll be able to leave in the instant he opens up his world ... But now, if he hasn't opened up his world yet ... We'll only exist in one of the millions of worlds in the future ... There's nothing we can do!"

The young man nodded slightly. It made sense.He quickly imagined ... And speculated. After thinking of many things, he couldn't help but sigh."This guy, I don't know when he'll be able to open up a long river. His strength doesn't seem to be very good! I don't like to be passive, I prefer to take the initiative. If what you said is true, we are only one of the thousands of possibilities in the future ... Then we have to prepare for a rainy day. We can't wait, we have to take the initiative! As long as the other party opens it ... We'll instantly drill out and turn the future into reality! "This way, the inside and outside will be the same. There won't be a case where we'll be gone if he's killed ... If he's dead, we'll still exist ..."Everyone was speechless.Would he?The time King would die?  Best novel online free at ÔΩé0ÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé He couldn't believe it!Did this person see wrongly, or was he muddled from his sleep?"Don't criticize me, I know!"The young man laughed and looked at the end of the river. He touched his chin again."Even if we go out, we might not be able to do anything. It seems that the outside world is very powerful ... Let's cultivate while we walk! Come to think of it, if the future me were to meet the past me, would he ask me for benefits? After all, I've received many benefits from him. "‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùNo one could understand this question. They all shook their heads. Who knew?Besides, would you give it to me if I asked for it? "Outside, are there any cultivators with more than 50 Dao?"Someone asked. The young man shook his head."I don't know. There are some differences in the system! I've tried to fight them once, and their DAOs are a little mixed! Qiong, what do you think?""I have very little memory ..."Behind him, a person shook his head. However, he was a little excited and expectant at this moment."But I know that he ... Must be very strong!"‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùNonsense!There's no point in asking you.He was really a big fool.You're a manifestation of the divine text of the firmament sword, but you don't have any useful clues.Fortunately, the person behind him seemed to recall something and said,""However ... I still have a vague impression of it ... In that era, Dao ... Was divided into nine levels!"Ninth-rank?It was too general! The young man thought about it and stopped thinking about it. Who cares? it's best if I can go out and take a look first. It's best if I don't see that guy. I'm afraid he'll ask me for money.Of course ... I'm also a little afraid. That guy won't take me away and make me his sword spirit, will he?The river of time was where the other party kept his sword.If I swallow others, will they become my swords?Bah!If you dare, I'll fall out with you!The more the young man thought about it, the more excited he became. 'If you dare to treat me as a sword spirit, I'll fight you to the end day and night ... In any case, you might not be that strong since you've just opened the river of time.'‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At this moment, the past and the future of every part of the primordial chaos were changing.At this moment, Li Hao had already disappeared and started his seclusion.Not far from where he was cultivating in seclusion, the human King, who had finally survived the lightning tribulation, was charred black. He looked at the little fellow who was cursing and disrespecting his elders in Li Hao's Daoist Rite temple!You've watched me being struck for three days and three nights without even a greeting, so you should at least be polite!The great Dao is heartless, he is indeed a cold-blooded fellow.I'm still the one who's passionate!Looking at the people who had recovered, he was all smiles.""Welcome back, everyone!"What he received was a group of people cursing!"If there's a next time, we'll blow you up first!"The human King shrugged his shoulders. It was just self-destruction, he would get used to it. He revealed a brilliant smile."The feast will last for three days to celebrate our new martial arts dominating the East! I'll anger that little guy to death and let him go into seclusion alone!"Everyone was speechless.You're really ... Bored to death!At this moment, everyone was laughing, but they couldn't help but look into the distance. In the distance, an illusory realm appeared in the void, lonely ... At this moment, for some reason, they suddenly felt pity.His side doesn't seem to be as lively as our side.The path of seeking Dao, perhaps ... Was just that lonely?

Chapter 3539 _Hundred Rivers Run Into The Sea!
The path of seeking Dao was always lonely.In Li Hao's opinion, this was the case.Being ahead of one person was a genius, but being ahead of everyone was loneliness.He thought ... He understood the battle.In fact, he was very lonely.Loneliness.Zhan was even more talented than him, and he was also a true Dao seeker, a cultivator. When Zhan condensed time, how lonely would he be?The road ahead was clear.If he walked out of neo martial, he would be a grade nine!Walk out?What was the point?Time seemed to be the limit of the Dao. The convergence of thousands of DAOs was the limit of the Dao. When a Dao seeker's Dao reached the limit, what meaning would there be?In the past, he didn't understand fighting and felt that fighting was too pedantic.But today ... Li Hao, who was filling up the Dao world, had come to a realization. He had actually mastered many great DAOs and even restored time. He might as well shock the entire chaos with his talent and absolute.But even so, Li Hao felt that he had a clear path ahead of him. At this moment, he was actually a little lonely.Dugu Wudi!In terms of combat power, he might not be invincible. However, in this era, his comprehension of Dao might really be invincible.And around him, there were people who fought for power and profit.How boring!It was better to return!Where to?He did not know.Where was the end of the Dao?And so, Zhan left.Perhaps he was a little reluctant, but it was only a little. Rather than being troubled here, it was better to go back.This was a battle, right?At this moment, Li Hao's mind was wandering as he thought about the various worlds.Of course, he had not reached the stage of fighting. He was not invincible, his Dao was not invincible, and his combat strength was not invincible. Moreover, he still had the desire to fight. Perhaps fighting meant that he had less desire.  Best novel online free at ÔΩé0ÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé There was nothing to pursue!"I still have desires ..."Li Hao pulled himself out of this state and suddenly laughed. I still have desire. The path of desire is really good.Hong Yue's cultivation was really a waste.When a person lost their desire, it was time for the next battle. "As for me, there are still many more. I still want to meet the top existences of the primordial chaos. I haven't met any rank nine existences yet. I still want to personally fight them. I still want to resurrect some people. I still have many things that I haven't perfected, including my own time ... Or perhaps I should say that all DAOs are one.10,000 DAOs returning to one might not necessarily be time.,m "Thus, I'm not fighting. I haven't reached his level. He has traveled through the past and the future and met many ninth-rank experts. In that era, he discussed the Dao with ninth-rank experts and even surpassed them in terms of the great Dao.Thus, Zhan felt that it was the same whether he walked out or not, so he didn't really walk out."Zhan ... You're wrong!"Li Hao suddenly mumbled to himself, you're wrong. You haven't really walked out. You've walked out, but perhaps some things are different from what you imagined."Desire!"Li Hao looked at his own realm. Now that the 2000 realms had been filled, he was almost not short of energy. He would start to create the 3000th realm. This time, he suddenly made a decision.The 3000th world was dominated by desire.The Dao of the seven emotions and six desires!He had to maintain his own desires. Otherwise, it would be very easy for him to be completely immersed in the great Dao. He would become tired of the world and eventually walk the same path as war. He was still young now, and if he maintained this for a long time, he would definitely walk towards death!"Battle ... Doesn't outline much of the Dao of desire!"As Li Hao spoke, he was suddenly stunned. But the Crimson Moon was near the new martial, and the first thing the Crimson Moon did when the new martial appeared was to deal with the new martial ... At this moment, Li Hao was a little distracted. Was it an accident that the new martial was near the Crimson Moon, or was it not an accident?Perhaps, Zhan also knew?He knew that he was heading towards destruction because he didn't have enough desire. However, sometimes, he couldn't change it because he really didn't have any desire. In that case, it might not be an accident that Red Moon and new martial became neighbors.The not-so-eye-catching Dao of desire had broken the life and death Samsara previously. Furthermore, the Silver Moon world and the void Dao universe were also a type of Dao of emotion. The Dao of desire had a great relationship with emotions.This meant ...Once the thought emerged, he could not extricate himself.Did Zhan discover the problem, or ... Did other factors cause Red Moon and neo martial to become neighbors?No matter what, these two things should be related.Suppressing these thoughts, he filled the world while integrating his spirit into the river of time. At this moment, the establishment of the heavenly Daoist temple and the first batch of venerable sovereigns had benefited many people.Although it had not been long since the end of the battle, the news had already spread and attracted many venerable sovereigns. They crossed the river and entered the heavenly Daoist temple to start discussing the Dao.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶In the heavenly Daoist sect.At this moment, it was full of people, which was equivalent to a grand opening. Everyone was curious. In addition to the promotion of the first batch of venerable sovereigns, countless people were full of curiosity.At this moment, the true body of the chess piece was floating above the heavenly Daoist Rite.The 9999 chess pieces were suspended in the air.At this moment, someone was walking.From time to time, there would be a burst of exclamations.Some of them had just arrived and didn't know much about it. They were curious and asked the illusionary figure beside them. Since they couldn't tell their identity or gender, they asked,""Fellow Daoist, what are you doing?""It's an aisle move!"That person seemed to know something.
