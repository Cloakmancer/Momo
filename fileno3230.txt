At first, the Thunderbolt master only observed. After a while, he was suddenly startled. He vaguely felt a faint aura of faith.Faith?The faith of the human race?Eh?What was going on?He was a little suspicious and strange. There was actually a human's faith in the dragon world. Could it be that they believed in the chaos beasts?His heart moved slightly.As for the Dragon Lord's order to capture a first-stage human to worship a venerable sovereign at the border area, he actually knew about it. However, it was said that he had captured a first-stage human venerable sovereign who had just proven his Dao.But at this moment, he could sense two chaos beasts.One was at the fifth step, and the other ... Was he at the sixth step?His aura was a little chaotic. Even as a seventh rank venerable sovereign, he could not sense it clearly. Of course, he did not dare to be too obvious, so he could only sense it faintly.The two beasts of Chaos seemed to have changed their direction and were now flying toward an uninhabited region.Was he going to take root in a place with no one?The Thunderbolt master's eyes moved slightly.Most of the nearby rank-6 worlds were gathered together, so it was not easy for him to make a move for fear of alerting the enemy. However, there were actually newcomers here, and they seemed to have brought their own worlds.Although there was a high chance that it was a rank five world, the other person might have brought a rank six world."Together ... If I finish them off in an instant, the commotion won't be too big. If that's the case, I'll be able to gain from both worlds ..."His eyes flickered, but he was also a little worried that it was a trap.Such a coincidence?At this moment, two beasts of primordial chaos appeared.Also ... This power of faith, what's the situation?With some doubts, he quickly followed. His eyes were cold. Perhaps I should take a risk. Otherwise, the Thunder World won't be able to hold on!Even if it was a trap ... He had to try.He didn't sense the aura of a seventh-rank, so there shouldn't be any seventh-rank existences.……"Did you follow me?"Li Hao asked. Although his perception was strong, it was still slightly weaker than Kong Ji 'S. Kong Ji silently sensed for a long time before suddenly nodding. "It's following us. There's an aura of life!"He was the dual extreme Emperor of the Dao of life and death, the Dao of destruction and the Dao of recovery. He could sense the fluctuations of life in the nearby area.It was the same for Li Hao, but he was alone and not as powerful as the void.Li Hao took a deep breath, his eyes ferocious."Later, I must hide my Qi! "Otherwise, once the battle starts, I'm worried that I'll attract the attention of some experts, so I'll go all out. Dao Masters, fuse directly! After the fusion, I'll use time to gather the two of you ... We can't be careless against a tier 7. We'll have to use all our big moves to kill the opponent!"The group of venerable sovereigns in the Silvermoon world were excited and nervous.The two rivers of the great Dao had already appeared. Venerable sovereigns quickly returned to their positions and entered the branches of the great Dao to suppress the rivers. The two main DAOs also began to entangle and merge into one.As for Li Hao, time slowly spun in his hand.After entering the central area, he could not be careless when dealing with a tier 7. He was also prepared to go all out and not leave any room for escape.As for Kong Ji, he took a deep breath and was prepared to kill his opponent.……Behind them.The Thunder monarch had been following them all this while. He also wanted to wait for the other party to be far away from the other worlds before he made his move.At the same time, he also had to observe if there were any rank seven venerable sovereigns in the dark.Both sides were extremely careful.The two giant beasts continued to move forward. If they continued to move forward, they would soon reach the vicinity of the Thunder region.Thunderlord wasn't shocked. Instead, he was happy!It was a good thing! Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 If he went there, he would be closer to the Thunder World. If something really happened, he could instantly return to the Thunder World. Not bad! From the looks of it, there was a high probability that it was not a trap.Perhaps, after killing the other party, others would not know because this was not a beast of primordial chaos that originally existed in the vicinity. Even if it died, no one would know.Just as he was looking forward to it, the two beasts stopped in an extremely dark area.Thunderlord was still observing when he suddenly frowned slightly.The silence in the surroundings was terrifying.In the next moment, his expression changed slightly. At this moment, time seemed to reverse and the two beasts of Chaos that were far away from him seemed to appear beside him.A pitch-black Nirvana Dao domain instantly appeared.Time went back!That's right, it reversed for an instant. Black Panther and black Panther reversed for an instant and returned to their original positions. At that moment, everyone, who had great teamwork, instantly revealed their Dao domain and covered the other party.The universe of the great Dao instantly appeared. The two Dao Masters merged into time in the blink of an eye. Li Hao was instantly surrounded by a long river, and he attacked with a thunderous sword!The sword of a thousand worlds!The void instantly erupted with the power of great Nirvana, and the two poles merged.At that moment, the speed was so fast that the Thunderbolt master couldn't even avoid the world. He was directly enveloped by the Nirvana world. In an instant, a sword descended from the sky!Determined to kill, Li Hao attacked with all his might!And the moment they made their moves ... Both sides seemed to know that they had made a mistake. The other party's lightning flickered. This ... Thunderbolt master?The Thunderbolt master was also extremely shocked. This was ... A swordsman, a swordsman, not a Chaos Beast!However, it was too late for both sides to avoid it.The Thunderbolt master growled and punched out. Thunder exploded and the entire Nirvana world was shattering. He had no choice but to fight back. If he didn 't, he might be killed. Who was this? Venerable sword?The new martial Swordmaster?However, it was said that the other party had already reached Level Seven, but this person didn't seem to be ...The power of Thunder exploded, and the sword of the thousand worlds slashed out!The two sides collided without a sound. The moment they exchanged blows, the Thunderbolt master seemed to feel the pressure of countless worlds, even the suppression of the great path universe, and many special great paths suppressing him ...He, who did not dare to use the great Dao universe, was actually ... Actually suppressed in an instant!It was unbelievable!What kind of brute force was this?He was too valiant!It was as if hundreds of worlds had gathered in an instant and smashed down. That kind of brute force, combined with the extremely sharp sword intent, made him feel pain all over his body!Who was this?Beside him, there was a sixth-rank expert who could kill a seventh-rank expert. This ... When did chaos become like this?Who was this?At that moment, he didn't even have time to guess!The lightning and the sword intent disappeared. The two sides seemed to be on par. Just as the Thunderbolt master exhaled, a small flower suddenly appeared. Li Hao, who had just consumed a lot of energy, was instantly devoured. In an instant ... His aura recovered to its peak.The sword slashed down!Kong Ji's aura instantly withered, but he had a proud expression on his face. Wasn't it easy to recover Li Hao?Does this guy really think that we're only capable of one attack?"Slash!""Stop ..."The Thunderbolt master was shocked. He was going to use the great Dao universe. Otherwise, he might not be able to block the second sword!Where did this terrifying person come from?They were only at the fifth or sixth step. He thought he had encountered two seventh step cultivators!艹!

Chapter 3231 An Agreement, An Invitation To A Battle
He was a Grade 7, but he was forced to stop.In fact, he was a peak Type 7 expert.Unfortunately, he didn't dare to use the power of the great Dao universe, let alone the power of the world. His body wasn't full of great Dao power to begin with, and it was almost empty.He was instantly attacked by two powerhouses, and that wasn't all. In the blink of an eye, he had recovered.He could still receive the second sword, but he was afraid that ... There wouldn't be a third or fourth sword, right?These two guys might be able to fight an ordinary seventh-rank on their own.Countless thoughts instantly appeared in the Thunderbolt master's mind!But Li Hao's sword didn't stop.He had roughly recognized who was on the other side, but ... He had to run first.It wasn't that they had to compete, but grade-7 was very troublesome. If he missed this opportunity and allowed the other party to maintain his peak state, he might be killed instead if he and Kong Ji stopped fighting!He could only take advantage of the current situation. Even if the other party was a good person, he had to severely injure him.This was safety! Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Putting their lives in the hands of an expert they were meeting for the first time was still acceptable for Supreme Sword and the others. After all, the relationship between new martial arts and silver Moon was not ordinary. It was fine for outsiders, but Li Hao was not so soft-hearted!BOOM!As the long sword descended, the power of a thousand worlds erupted. A look of ferocity appeared in the Thunderbolt master's eyes. Damn it, this B * stard!BOOM!The sound reverberated. The Thunderbolt master threw a punch, but he still did not use the power of the great path of the universe. He took it head-on. With a bang, his body fell back, and a bloody wound so deep that his bones could be seen appeared on his body.The power of the great path floated on his wound and exploded."Pfft!"A mouthful of blood mixed with a large amount of great Dao power and lightning power gushed out of his mouth. The Thunder monarch's face turned pale, but he did not attack again.He knew what the other was thinking.But at this moment, he could not hide his anger and shock.On the other side, Li Hao stopped and waved his hand. Right before the Thunderlord's eyes, the greatly exhausted void was instantly restored to its peak state. The Thunderlord's jaw almost fell off in shock!How could this be?Li Hao's eyes regained their calmness. He looked at the other party and said in a deep voice,""The master of the Thunder World?""It's me!"The Thunder monarch coughed and looked at the two of them. His eyes changed."You two ... Are you ... The king of the Silver Moon, the Son of God of light?"He had vaguely heard of Tian Fang's matter.However, because they were not at the seventh rank and had nothing to do with him, he only cared about them because the Dragon Lord had gone. He knew that there seemed to be two powerhouses of the younger generation there. They had joined forces and killed the Qi water Supreme Emperor.However, he did not take it seriously. It was said that on that day, powerhouses such as venerable the sword, the catacombs King, the neo martial human King, and even the light Thearch were all present. The rumors outside might just be a false rumor.But now, he believed it.The two of them working together could really kill a Grade 7.The premise was that the other party was not in this world, not in the great path universe. In that case, these two people really had the ability to kill a level Seven. p It was terrifying!Tier 7 and Tier 6 were generally worlds apart. These two people could even be called pseudo-tier 7!The Thunder Emperor said in a low voice,"if the two of you have no enmity with me, it's just a misunderstanding!" I can't rashly use the power of the great Dao universe ... But the two of you are overbearing. I'm using the power of the great Dao universe. This place is not far from the Thunder World, and I'm already at the peak of the seventh level. The two of you ... I'm afraid you might not benefit from it!"Li Hao saw this and chuckled.""The lightning Master is actually here ... It's really surprising. However, the power of the great Dao is rarely used. Who knows how many people are watching the Thunder realm's great Dao universe. Once it's used, I'm afraid that tier 7 experts will arrive very soon. I'm not afraid ... The dragon world is not ready to go to war with the light and neo martial world at the same time!"Regardless of whether there was or not, he had to deter them first.Even though he was a rank seven venerable sovereign in the chaos, he still had to be careful.There were no good people in the primordial chaos.Whether it was venerable sovereigns like Wushan or Senlan, they had worked together many times before they could work together. Only with neo martial, they had not worked together at all and had started to work together directly.At this moment, countless thoughts appeared in the Thunder monarch's mind.The Silver Moon King, Son of God of light.The two of them were actually here!Why were they here?Furthermore, he had such strength!It was unbelievable!He had many thoughts in his mind, but he quickly said,""It's such a coincidence to meet the two of you here ... I thought you were chaos beasts, so I followed you to take a look. I mean no harm!"Li Hao nodded."I believe that you mean no harm, senior. Otherwise ... I wouldn't have stopped!"Did you stop?The Thunder monarch was secretly annoyed!You stopped, and you even gave me a second strike?It had to be said that this strike was really ruthless. The sword mark on his body had yet to disappear and was still bleeding. He frowned slightly and even felt that the wound was constantly devouring his great Dao power ... No, it was corrosion.The power of lightning exploded from the wound, destroying the corrosive power. However, it quickly began to spread again.Thunderlord's expression changed slightly. He looked at Li Hao and said,""The power of destruction?""The Thunderbolt master is so knowledgeable!"Of course, he was familiar with the destructive power contained in the primal Chaos tribulation lightning. Half of the Thunder World was in the Thunder realm.He didn't expect the Silver Moon King to be able to use the power of destruction.It was really surprising!At this moment, the Thunder monarch took a deep breath and said,"the two of you have come ...""Kill the demon!""Eliminate the devil!"Li Hao and Kong Ji each said one sentence after another, and the Thunder monarch was almost at a loss.Killing demons?What a joke!

Chapter 3232 An Agreement, An Invitation To Battle (2)
Just as he was about to say something, Li Hao raised his eyebrows."The fire Phoenix realm is eyeing the Thunder World covetously. It's too risky for you to leave the realm now. Be careful that the realm is breached. As long as you're exposed here, the fire Phoenix realm will definitely attack the Thunder World! Isolate senior from the outside world and directly break through the boundary!""If not for the fact that brother kongji and I concealed the void and destroyed chaos ... Our auras would've been exposed in the battle just now, and that senior ... Would've been in danger!"It was a deterrence and a threat!I know your situation.If you dare to come out, you must have taken a risk. At this moment, I don't need to do anything. I just need to expose your presence here, and the fire Phoenix World will immediately attack the Thunder World.It could isolate one from the outside and even seal off the great Dao universe!When the time comes, you'll be attacked from both the inside and the outside, and you'll be dead!"The Silver Moon King seems to know quite a lot!" The Thunderbolt master frowned."It's alright," Li Hao said with a smile."After all, I'm the elder of the fiery phoenix Sector for Foreign Affairs!"“……”The Thunderbolt master's expression changed slightly. He looked at Li Hao, but Li Hao was all smiles."I even signed a great Dao agreement with the other party. If I were to expose you now, the Thunder World would be in danger!" Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 "A great Dao agreement?""Not bad!""How is this possible?" the Thunderbolt master found it unbelievable."Why not?"Li Hao had no interest in talking about this. He frowned and said,""Senior is here ... Aren't you going to go back?"Unlucky!It was true. Li Hao wasn't being disdainful, but he was really unlucky. This guy was in big trouble.This guy wasn't in the Thunder World, but here. Once he made a move here ... The fire Phoenix World would definitely suspect that this place was the Thunder Lord. Damn it, this meant that even if I didn't expose myself, I would be exposed by this guy.Even if it was a small matter, the other party might still be concerned. Originally, if the lightning Lord had obediently stayed in the Thunder World, the other party would not have cared about such small matters.It was very troublesome!He had to ask the Thunderbolt master to go back and not be a hindrance here.The Thunderbolt master cursed in his heart. Do you think I want to be outside?He had no choice!"If we don't think of a solution here, our realm's great Dao power will be exhausted. Venerable sovereigns are almost out of supplies, and there's too much chaos tribulation lightning power. This will cause the destruction power in our body to be unable to be neutralized.He had to find a way to obtain many Dao crystals.He even despised the two of them.These two people ... Could they be thinking of doing something?Then, before he could do anything, these two might bring him some trouble and expose his location!Unlucky! The Thunderbolt master also felt unlucky.However, these two weren't weak. At this moment, neither of them considered working together because they were too unfamiliar with each other. They didn't understand each other at all, and they had different needs.The Thunderbolt master spoke,"this is the dragon world, and it's extremely dangerous!" And now, the fire Phoenix realm has been keeping an eye on the Thunder World, searching for my whereabouts ... Or rather, they hope that I will appear here ... It is extremely dangerous for the two of you to appear here!""Senior, are you saying that we should leave?" Li Hao raised his eyebrows."This place is too dangerous, it's better if you two don't stay here for long."He pointed at the worlds in the distance,"there are quite a few rank six worlds nearby!" More importantly ... I suspect that there might be a rank seven venerable sovereign hiding here. The Dragon field has been trying to kill me, and the dragon world has left, leaving such a big piece of meat behind. I don't believe that the Dragon Lord would be so kind ... So, I was just thinking which realm nearby has a rank seven venerable sovereign ... If I make the wrong choice, it will be a huge problem!"It was not that easy to kill a grade-7. It was very easy to be completely exposed.If he was exposed, he was confident that he could win. However, the premise was that he had to use the power of the great Dao. Then, the entire Thunder World would instantly show the situation of the great Dao universe. Everyone would know that he was no longer in the realm.At that time, if the fire Phoenix realm attacked the Thunder realm first, he would really not know whether to stay or leave."What?"Li Hao raised his eyebrows,'senior wants to attack this place? Senior, you're being suppressed by the Dragon Lord. If you want to attack, you should attack a rank 7 world or even a rank 8 world. What's the point of killing these small characters?"He felt that this Thunderbolt master ... Was a little ... A little incompetent.You're a seventh-rank, why are you killing these small characters?The Thunderbolt master did not say anything.F * ck!He had no money.Poor?Do you understand?He knew that outsiders might not believe him. After all, this was a rank seven world. How could it be so poor?In a seventh-tier great Dao universe, he could swallow and release chaotic power and convert it into many great Dao crystals. He could even feed a hundred venerable sovereigns. However ... However, the chaotic power near his Thunder World had been sucked dry by other worlds. It had been sealed in the dragon world for many years and struck by lightning ... The consumption was huge and could not be replenished.Therefore, it would not be an exaggeration to say that he was the poorest tier 7 world Lord.Even the forest orchid master was richer than him. Her rank seven world was still running. It had been used up when she advanced to rank seven. However, the forest orchid master didn't even need to consider whether she could support the venerable sovereigns in the realm.This was because a large number of great Dao crystals would be produced every day in the tier 7 world.For a veteran rank seven world like the Thunder World, not only could IT support a group of venerable sovereigns, but under normal circumstances, it was also basic to save more than one billion great Dao crystals. The excess would be used to nurture experts. If they didn't nurture experts, they would have even more savings.How could he not have money?How could he target a medium-level world?Wasn't this just to send off a beggar?Li Hao hadn't thought of this, because he had calculated the number of great Dao crystals produced in a level nine world. It was frighteningly high. He hadn't heard of anyone lacking money in a level Seven world. The forest orchid master wasn't counted, as she was a newcomer.

Chapter 3233 An Agreement And An Invitation To A Battle
Therefore, in his opinion, the Thunderbolt master was taking revenge.Furthermore, it was said that the lightning territory also had a large amount of Primal Chaos lightning tribulation. Wasn't the power of lightning supposed to be a tonic for the Thunder World?How could he lack these!At this moment, he was looking down on this person ... At this time, instead of taking advantage of the Dragon Master's departure to deal with the seventh grade venerable sovereign, or simply moving away, he came here to deal with these shrimps ... Fighting for food with us poor people, it's really annoying!"He's a meat-eater, and I, solitary, and the Silvermoon world ... Are all meat-eaters because we've only risen for a short time. Even the power of great DAOs born in a level-five universe is only the beginning, and it's not enough for the realm monarch to devour.You came here just to fight a rank 6 world?The two of them had their own thoughts.In the end, the Thunderbolt master still decided to ... Say a few words and send these two fellows away. He said in a low voice,""Our realm is severely lacking great Dao crystals. Some venerable sovereigns can't maintain their peak state. I must first seize some great Dao crystals, world power, great Dao power ... To restore everyone to their peak state before we can break out!""I let the two of you leave so that you won't be implicated!""The Dragon field has been locking us down too much these years. I wanted to attack a level-seven universe directly ... But unfortunately, I'm not strong enough now ..."Li Hao was stunned and glanced at him."What?" Kong Ji was stunned.A Dao crystal?The venerable sovereigns had no more power of great DAOs?What a joke.A veteran rank seven world!He wasn't new, so unless he wanted to advance to the eighth step, why would he lack great Dao crystals?The Thunder Emperor sighed."You two are not from the Dragon field. You might not know this, but the Thunder World has actually been sealed by the Dragon field for 300000 years. Half of it is in the square field, and the other half is in the Thunder field!" He said. In the four-sided domain, we can't absorb any chaotic energy at all, but in the lightning domain, it's all chaotic lightning tribulation. We'll need a large amount of great Dao power to neutralize the destructive power within. ""Since the Silver Moon King uses the power of destruction, he should know that it's very difficult to deal with. Those who don't cultivate the power of destruction won't be able to accept it. "My lightning tribulation is a pure great Dao ... After being struck by lightning for so many years, it's only filled with the power of lightning. No one has cultivated the power of destruction. Even if there are, even a seventh level venerable sovereign would find it difficult to consume the power of destruction ..."Do the two of you understand?I can't even cook!It's fine even if they're here. The point is, he doesn't know their attitude and their situation. He's worried that he'll be tricked to death by them!If the two of them joined forces, they might not be able to escape from them if they did not bring along the seventh-level venerable sovereigns of the great path universe and world.At this moment, he would treat them as equals.Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to be in such a position."You don't have money?" Li Hao was stunned. After a while, he said,""Senior's meaning is ... This time, senior came out ... To seek a windfall?"“……”He could say that, but it would be a little embarrassing to say it directly.That was the truth.Thunderlord didn't say anything else.Li Hao's expression changed slightly."Then, does this mean that the fire Phoenix Sector knows about the situation?" he asked."Of course!"Li Hao's expression changed again.Thunderlord was surprised. Why was there trouble?Li Hao's expression changed, and he said telepathically,""We're in big trouble. This guy is short of money, and the fire Phoenix realm must know. This person wants to come out to get some money. Once there is unrest here, the fire Phoenix realm will definitely guess that it is this person ... Damn it!"Previously, he had thought that it was nothing, that it was just a small matter.However, if the Thunder World was so short of money ... It was obvious that the Thunderbolt master's appearance here was actually an open scheme of the fire Phoenix realm. They wanted to force the other party to come out and look for money, reveal their true intentions, attack the Thunder World, and kill the Thunder Emperor! In this way, his plan had been ruined by this person!This ... Li Hao was rendered speechless.Previously, he really didn't know that the Thunder World would lack funds to such an extent. Now that the other party had explained it, he understood. If he hadn't met this person, once he started to make a big move here ... Perhaps ... Perhaps he would be mistaken as the lightning Master!It was really a ghost!If he was treated as the lightning Lord, he might face the siege of those at the seventh step.Luckily!Li Hao secretly rejoiced. Fortunately, he had encountered them in advance, and the other party had not attacked those worlds. Otherwise, he would have been besieged by experts from all directions. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 How unlucky!With this thought in mind, Li Hao instantly said,""Senior, how many great Dao crystals do you lack in your realm?""What?"The Thunderbolt master was puzzled, and Li Hao said,"it's not easy for us to be grateful to the human race!" Senior, if you don't lack too many, we can help you out. You can take these great Dao crystals and return to the Thunder World quickly to guard it. I'm worried that if you return too late, the other party will guess that I've already discovered that all the venerable sovereigns have gathered in the fire Phoenix World!"Li Hao's face was full of worry."Senior, you must have come out secretly this time. The fire Phoenix realm will definitely keep testing you. Once they find out that you're not here, they will definitely attack the Thunder realm!" When that time comes, we'll be in big trouble!"Li Hao's face was filled with uneasiness and worry.""As of now, the Thunder World is the only human world in the Dragon field. Once it's broken through ... The human race will suffer great losses. Trillions of humans will no longer have anyone to rely on!"

Chapter 3234 An Agreement And An Invitation To A Battle
"Senior, how many do you need?"The Thunder monarch was stunned for a moment, and his eyes changed. After a while, he coughed and said,""There's no need for you two little friends to spend so much ...""In the Dragon field, everyone is human. I wouldn't say this in the other three fields! My friend Kong Ji is the son of the God of Light. He doesn't lack money!"Thunderlord still didn't want to lose face. He coughed lightly and said,""There's no need, I just need to take down one or two rank 6 worlds to solve the problem. ""This ..."Li Hao didn't say the word "young."One or two tier 6 worlds did not have much great Dao power. It would be considered good if they could produce one billion great Dao crystals.To a level 7 world, it wasn't considered much.One should know that venerable Red Moon and venerable cloud heaven had spent about one billion to buy a star of the great Dao. Before that, realm Lord Sen LAN had spent hundreds of millions of great Dao crystals to let them kill some venerable sovereigns.As for the Sen LAN sector Lord, he wasn't considered a rich person. At that time, he would still need to make preparations for his advancement.Li Hao quickly calculated and said,""Senior, one billion is not a small number, but...Brother kongji and I will go bankrupt. If we make do and absorb some world power...We should be able to gather enough!"“……”Thunderlord was stunned for a moment and looked at Li Hao. What did he mean?1 billion was really not a small amount.This ... You're giving it to me?There's such a good person in this world?"But I also know that you're unyielding," Li Hao said."You might not accept it!"If you give, I dare to accept!I'm about to kill someone for this. It's extremely risky. If you really give it to me, how can I not accept it?The Thunderbolt master wanted to roar out!If you dare to give, I dare to take!"But the human race really can't afford to lose the Thunder World," Li Hao continued."Otherwise, the Dragon field will completely become the territory of the chaos beasts. There will be no way for us humans to turn things around here! Senior, I know it's hard for you to accept this ... But we won't give it to you for free. As long as you agree to one of our conditions, we'll make a great Dao Alliance and give you one billion great Dao crystals!"“……”The Thunder monarch's expression changed slightly,'the great Dao Alliance? What do you want me to do?"Li Hao's face was solemn."It's not a big deal. It's just to show off the might of the human race. After you obtained the great Dao crystal, you returned to the Thunder World and stood at the top of the Thunder World. You released your might and announced to the entire Dragon field that all mortals can come to the Thunder World. You called on the ambitious Warriors of Chaos to resist the Invasion of Chaos beasts together! "As long as the Thunder World doesn't die, the human race will have a chance to rise up and awaken again in the Dragon field!"“……”Thunderlord's expression changed slightly. What kind of condition was this?This was not a condition at all.He quickly calculated. In this world, where else could there be such a selfless and kind person? was he going to return and show his face in public to prove that he was still in the Thunder World?In that case, these two people also had a plan and felt that they might be able to gain more from this side. He was only worried that he would disturb them ...艹!I still have such a worry."The Silver Moon King is truly a role model for the human race!" He thought. It's just that ... This is a little inappropriate. One billion great Dao crystals isn't a small amount ..."Li Hao continued,"if senior feels embarrassed ... Then you can directly invite realm Lord Zhan Feng. I feel that at this stage, we should disrupt their plans first. The other party is definitely preparing to attack the Thunder World. Senior, you can test the waters first and disrupt their original plans ..."“……”What are you doing, attracting the attention of experts from the chaos realm?He was puzzled. Was it to take down these few rank six worlds?But ... Even if they did, they wouldn't gain much.Moreover, I said that there might be seventh level venerable sovereigns here. He couldn't help but say,""There might be rank seven venerable sovereigns here ... If you two really want to take down the nearby rank six worlds ... I might be able to help ..."The other party had a Dao domain that could conceal the heavenly secrets. This was good. His lightning Dao domain caused too much of a commotion.Li Hao's daylight thief and the empty Nirvana realm were both good Dao domains for killing and robbing!I'm so envious!If I had this, I wouldn't have to be afraid of being discovered. However, Li Hao shook his head."There's no need for that. We don't have such intentions. Moreover, if senior were to make a move here, it would be too easy for us to be exposed. That would be putting senior in danger and putting the safety of the entire Thunder World aside. This is absolutely unacceptable!"He would rather kill them himself!As long as you go back obediently and make some noise, even if there is some noise here, those Level 7 Masters won't care. They will keep an eye on you!Go and cause trouble!I'll sponsor you with this one billion great Dao crystals. I'll sponsor you even if I have to go bankrupt.Between the lines, he expressed his concern for the Thunder World and the human race.The Thunder monarch was a little dazed for a moment. Did he have any thoughts?"As I said, there might be Level-7 here. Although the two of you are strong ... You have to be careful not to fail miserably in an easy task. Besides, one billion great Dao crystals ... That's quite a lot. If the two of you really break through some of the worlds here, you might only gain this much.Work for me?This isn't appropriate, right?Or could it be that ... As the Silver Moon King had said, it was really because he saw the difficulties of the human race that he wanted to sponsor him?Was it appropriate? Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 He couldn't help but say,"this isn't appropriate ...""Senior!"Li Hao was extremely serious,"the Thunder World is the last line that the human race can cross!" Trillions of humans are waiting for you to rise up and save them from the fire and water!"

Chapter 3235 An Agreement, An Invitation To A Battle
He understood.You must let me go.Thunderlord finally understood, and his eyes changed.""The two of you ... According to what you're saying, I should invite flame Phoenix realm Lord to attract the attention of the entire Dragon field after I return. That's fine, but ... How long will it last?""One month! "A month later, senior will challenge the other party to a battle ... Of course, whether or not you'll attack will depend on the situation. It's not that you really have to participate in the battle. You're just showing your determination to the fire Phoenix realm and the Dragon field that the human race still has the power to fight back here. We still have the existence of the great world and can still resist! So that the chaos demonic beasts won't dare to humiliate the human race!"A month?In that case, will there be any movements between the two of you in the next month?What are you two up to?He didn't quite understand.A myriad of thoughts flashed through his mind. 1 billion Dao crystals in exchange for his meeting with flame Phoenix realmlord a month later. It didn't matter if he went out or not. He had to let everyone know that he was in the Thunder World and that he would never leave!With one billion great Dao crystals, he and the realm venerable sovereigns would be able to recover to their peak. This meant that they might be able to Catch the Fire Phoenix realm off guard.After all, the other party had been controlling the source of his Dao crystals.There weren't many who could take out one billion great Dao crystals at once. Only the Lords of major worlds could.However, in the entire Dragon field, he was the only Lord of the human race in a rank 7 great world.Countless thoughts emerged in his mind, and the Thunder monarch said,""Sure ... But forget about the great Dao Alliance. I'll definitely do it. If I sign the Alliance, I'll have to waste a small world ..."Li Hao said firmly,"we have to sign it!" This is also to make senior feel at ease, and we will not expose the fact that senior is here ... We trust each other, and whoever breaks the contract will be served by the seventh-order ... No, eighth-order chaos lightning tribulation!"Not even a tier 7!Li Hao didn't think that level 8 was enough. If not for the fact that he was afraid of causing trouble, he would have said level 9.One billion great Dao crystals in exchange for the other party attracting the attention of the chaos beasts. Was it worth it?Of course it was worth it!'It's just the reserves of one or two rank six worlds. When I complete my plan, it won't be just one or two worlds. I'm not planning to have one or two worlds, but hundreds or even thousands!'Of course, the Thunder Emperor probably didn't dare to believe this. These two were so ambitious that they wanted to capture the entire Dragon World in one fell swoop!Not only that, but there was also another benefit. The appearance of the Thunderbolt master would attract the attention of everyone. At the same time, he could automatically ignore all the changes in the area. Compared to the Thunderbolt master, even if something were to happen here, it would be nothing.This was the greatest benefit!Li Hao had been worried before, but now ... If the Thunderbolt master agreed, these troubles would no longer be a problem.Did Li Hao have one billion great Dao crystals?No, there wasn 't.However, there were still a few hundred million left. If it wasn't enough, he could extract some from the various realms. Just the chaos power provided by the Queen was frantically condensing great Dao crystals. It was still barely possible to gather the money.His life here was much better than the Thunderbolt master 's. The Thunderbolt master was already prepared to sell his Dao accumulation crystals. One could imagine how poor he was.The Thunder monarch took a deep breath. At this moment, he completely understood Li Hao's meaning. He said sincerely,""The two of you, if the two of you truly wish to break through some worlds, I don't need the two of you to pay anything. I can also not interfere with the two of you and return to the Thunder World ..."Anyway, he was willing to see the forces attacking the dragon world.Now, it seemed like he was spending money to get rid of him and not let him disturb them.It was somewhat embarrassing!"No, for the human race!"“……”Li haoguan said arrogantly. He was just worried about this man, for no other reason.Give me the money, you sign the contract, and then we'll do our own things."If possible, when I reach the sixth step, we can cooperate. Before I reach the sixth step ... We won't cooperate. It's too dangerous.In fact, Li Hao had to wait until he reached level six and Kong Ji reached Level Seven before he could work with some of the forces here. Otherwise, working with them was like asking a Tiger for its skin. They were not new martial artists and could not gain Li Hao's trust!The Thunder monarch was a little surprised. In fact, the meaning of his words was very clear. He didn't need to give him Dao crystals. He could cooperate with them ... But he didn't expect to be rejected!It was really surprising!What was the goal of these two? If he gave one billion great Dao crystals just like that, it meant that his goal was far greater than this, but ... Unless he conquered a Level-7 world, he couldn't figure out how to earn more benefits.For a moment, he was a little dazed.After a long time, he spoke."So, Silver Moon King's meaning is ... The great Dao alliance only has one requirement. I'll return, reveal my whereabouts, and arrange a battle with the fire Phoenix Sector Lord in a month. That's all?""Right!""You ... You don't have any other requests?""You can add one more condition. Do not expose our whereabouts. Similarly, we will keep our lips sealed, including the one billion great Dao crystals!"Thunderlord took a deep breath and said,"alright!" I have promised the two of you, and I would also like to thank the two of you for your generosity. If there is a chance, and our Thunder World is able to escape from the encirclement ... We will definitely return the favor double!" Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Li Hao laughed,"there will be a chance ... Senior can definitely do it!" Qian Wuliang, go and collect some great Dao crystals. Ask everyone to take out all their savings. Even if you don't cultivate anymore, even if you have to empty the Silvermoon great Dao universe, you must satisfy the seniors first!"“……”Even Thunderlord was a little embarrassed.

Chapter 3236 An Agreement, An Invitation To A Battle
1 billion was really not a small amount.Selling his blood ... No, he would have to sell a large number of Dao accumulation crystals. Sigh, he was a seventh level peak venerable sovereign, but now, he was in such a miserable state and even needed a junior to sell his entire pot to help him ...Although he knew that the two of them had their own thoughts. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 But this time, didn't he come out to get a Dao crystal?He was even prepared to be besieged!Now that he could avoid these dangers, even if these two people really had a purpose, so what?"Many thanks!"The Thunder Emperor was no longer polite. He did not say anything. This time, if he could escape from the encirclement, he would definitely return the favor. It was not just a matter of face, but also dignity!It was too miserable! To ask for money from two juniors ... If word got out, the entire primordial chaos would look down on him.Qian Wuliang, on the other hand, quickly disappeared and began to plunder the universe of the great Dao, Li Hao's River, and the savings of the great sovereign ...After a while, Qian Wuliang showed up silently and gave Li Hao a storage space. He said to Li Hao,"Lord Marquis, we've taken everything out, but we only have around 800 million ..."It was not enough.This is all we have.Li Hao and the others earned money very quickly. They had defeated so many worlds at once and made a lot of money, but they also spent it very quickly. Li Hao spent money like water. He had used up a lot of resources to fill the thousandworld.There was also the void and Silvermoon universe, both of which were big money-eaters.The average person would not be able to afford it.Hearing this, Li Hao felt that he had overestimated his wealth. It seemed that everyone was using up their wealth very quickly. Dozens of worlds were gone in such a short time.It didn't matter!Soon, Li Hao said,"senior, we only have 800 million great Dao crystals. However, we have a treasure that can continuously produce chaotic force. Many, many. It's just that ... This is the Natal star of one of our venerable sovereigns. If we give it to you ...""That won't do ..." Thunderlord immediately said.Li Hao thought for a moment and said,""I'll do what I say! "In addition to these 800 million great Dao crystals, we'll leave this item with you for the time being. When we have time, we'll get it back ..."After saying that, he added,"senior, in addition, I have to say this in advance. This item has the effect of positioning. In other words, once we bring it back to the Thunder World, we will be able to sense the exact location of the Thunder World. If senior is worried ..."As soon as these words came out, Thunderlord's heart moved. Position?It was normal for a star of the great path to be able to locate his position. After some consideration, he decided that it would be best if he didn't take it. However ... Since the other party had said so, it would be a benefit to him. Since he had said it so openly, then ... It wasn't impossible for him to stay. When the time came for the Thunder World to escape, perhaps ... He would abandon it.But now was not the time."So what?" he asked with a solemn expression. Little friend, you're looking down on me ... In that case, I'll take it. I'll definitely take good care of this star of the great path and not let the venerable sovereigns under you be hurt ..."In his heart, however, he was puzzled. Giving birth to Primal Chaos energy? What Dao?It can even be like this?How many were born?In the next moment, he realized that a star had appeared. It was actually very weak, but it was a Dao integration star. It was the Queen's star, and Li Hao had taken one out.At this moment, chaotic energy was being produced at a crazy rate. At this rate, it would be normal for hundreds of Dao crystals to be produced a day.This ... Was a little unbelievable.A few hundred a day wasn't a lot, but in a year, it would be 100000. Li Hao had 360 such stars, which could produce tens of millions of great Dao crystals a year.And this was on the basis that the Queen was only a second stage venerable sovereign.A year was the amount of a few small worlds. When the other party reached level three or level six...Perhaps a year would be the amount of a large world. That would be terrifying!Of course, Li Hao wouldn't say that. Sending this thing was like trying to put out a burning cart with a cup of water.But at this moment, there was an illusory realm above the Dao star, which Li Hao had integrated into. The Thunder monarch sensed something and raised his eyebrows slightly. This star of the great path was indeed a star of the great path, but ... It seemed to be more than that.It was as if ... There was a Dao domain!He glanced at Li Hao, who explained,""In order to ensure that this star doesn't collapse after leaving this place, I attached a miniature Dao domain to it that belongs to me!"Dao domain!As expected!The Thunder Emperor was a little hesitant. He also had a Dao domain. It didn't seem to be of much use if it left him and entered another world. But ... Was there a need to do this?Was he afraid that he would destroy the stars?Then why did he have to give it to her?For a moment, he was a little hesitant. Although the person in front of him was only a rank five ... Yes, only a rank five, at this moment, he was a little uneasy. Other than positioning, could this star have any other function?Did I?There really was!The river of time was something that a tier 7 lightning Emperor would not be able to discover. With this, it was actually equivalent to ... Opening a realm gate for the Thunder World!Yes, the realm gate!The illusory world was within the Thunder World. If Li Hao arrived nearby, he could even ... Directly bring his people into the Thunder World.One must always be on guard against others!Of course, it was not just a precaution. He also had other intentions. However, it was not the time yet. Seeing that Thunderlord seemed to be hesitating, Li Hao quickly said,""I can make an Alliance agreement of the great path and add one more thing to it. I will never do anything that will harm the Thunder World!"

Chapter 3237 An Agreement, An Invitation To Battle (3)
This thing was not meant to deal with the Thunder World, but only when necessary ... If the Thunder World was conquered, in danger, or broken through by the fire Phoenix realm, if he had the opportunity, he could directly bring people into the inner realm. Perhaps, it would be of great use!There was no need to deal with the Thunder realm. He just felt that ... The Thunder Emperor might not be able to defeat the fire Phoenix realm. Those guys were not simple!Once the Thunder World really falls, this star will still be there, and the illusory world will still be there. I can enter the core at any time and directly attack the root!It's better to be prepared!However, he didn't have such an opportunity back in the fire Phoenix World, and he didn't dare to do so rashly. Otherwise, he should have left one in the fire Phoenix World as his back door.They could attack the fire Phoenix Jie at any time!The Thunder monarch's expression changed slightly. He wanted to say,"there's no need to do this. I can trust you, but I realized ... Forget it, I can't trust you. After all, we've just met. It's better ... It's better to make a great Dao Alliance."Well, it's just a precaution. It doesn't mean that I'm suspicious of you. Don't misunderstand.This Silver Moon King definitely had a motive. Otherwise, he wouldn't have given this to him ... He was sure of this, but whether this motive was to deal with him or someone else, it was hard to say.Li Hao was also afraid that he would make the other party unhappy if he spoke too bluntly.Can I say that this is to prevent your Jie from being broken through and I can't enter?Wouldn't that be looking down on the Thunder monarch?As long as you know what you're doing, there's no need to say it out loud.​ Now that both sides had come to a consensus, the next step was easy. It was actually easy to sign a great Dao Alliance. There were two conditions. One was to use the great Dao universe as a medium and the sacrifice of a world. Li Hao had a few small worlds.In the great path universe, the Thunder monarch's couldn't be touched easily, and the Silver Moon's could be touched too. They were only the medium.With the experience from the last contract, this time it was extremely simple.Both parties quickly signed an agreement!As for the Thunder monarch, he had obtained a total of 800 million great Dao crystals and a star that could continuously produce chaotic force ... It still felt like a dream. Just like that ... He had achieved his goal?It really made one sigh!Both parties signed a great Dao agreement. At this moment, the Thunder monarch was much more direct."My two little friends, I'm a little embarrassed to give me so much. In addition, I still have to say that if you two little friends feel that these Chaos Beast worlds are treasures, then you are wrong. There is actually nothing much in a Tier 6 world. Chaos beasts eat everything. Under normal circumstances, they would not leave anything behind ..."Li Hao nodded. After signing the contract, he felt much more at ease. At this moment, he smiled and said,""As we know, a world is not worth much. If it's tens, hundreds, or thousands ... Then it's worth a lot!"“……”Thunderlord was stunned for a moment. He looked at Li Hao, who smiled and said,""Senior, there's no need to be so surprised. Just before this, we've already destroyed the fire Phoenix World region. There are about 50 worlds. We've come here to destroy even more Chaos Beast worlds!" “……”This was crazy!This was crazy!Why do you want to seize so many worlds?At this moment, the lightning Emperor felt that these people were truly crazy.No wonder he kept asking me to leave. So, he wasn't interested in this small world at all, but ... Hundreds and thousands!This was crazy."The Dragon Lord won't stay in the outer region for too long. He'll definitely return in a year at most ..."He was still a little worried. 'You guys are too crazy. There are so many worlds. Just running around would take a long time.'"Within a month, we'll break as many as we can. Senior, you can rest assured!"Oh, he was just bragging.That's good."In a month's time, you can't even run all the way here even if you want to conquer so many worlds.At this moment, he felt a little more at ease. In the end, he still warned,""You two little friends are very strong, but there's a high chance that there's a seventh rank venerable sovereign here. Previously, I had a vague feeling that if it wasn't the Earth Dragon World, it would be in the nearby void. There must be a level Seven venerable sovereign, which is the reason why I haven't made a move yet. Although the two of you are better at concealing yourselves, you ... Are not simple seventh level venerable sovereigns!"Li Hao nodded."We understand. Thank you for your reminder, senior. In addition, I would like to remind you that the fiery phoenix Sector is not simple!"Li Hao said seriously,"there's more than one level Seven on the other side. There's also a level Seven Dragon. It's said that there's also a level Seven Supreme Emperor in the fire Phoenix Sector. There are three level Seven Supreme emperors in total!" In addition, there were hundreds of venerable sovereigns in their Foreign Affairs Department, all of whom were foreign venerable sovereigns! In addition, the fire Phoenix realm has been waiting for an opportunity. They might have spies inside the Thunder realm ... When senior left, the other party might have already been probing ...""Yes, I personally killed one before ...""One? It's more than that!"Li Hao shook his head,"definitely more than one!" I haven't seen the fiery phoenix realm Lord, but I've seen the princess of the fiery phoenix realm and that seventh level Dragon. They're not simple at all. I suspect that there's something wrong with the venerable sovereigns that you've taken in all these years!"Thunderlord was shocked. Was this possible?Li Hao continued,"in any case, senior, please be careful. If you can't do it, you don't have to worry about the one month deadline. You can just escape. To be honest, as long as you are still in their sight, they won't care about other places. That's because at this moment, the Thunder World is far more important than some small and medium-sized worlds!" Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 The Thunder Emperor exhaled."Don't worry. It's not that easy to break into my Thunder World. It's fine to attack by force. They hope to kill me in the outer realm and won't destroy the entire Thunder World. That's because the Thunder World is the key to the Dragon Lord's conquest of the outer realms! I already knew about this. If not for that, I would have been killed by the Dragon Lord long ago!"

Chapter 3238 An Agreement, An Invitation To A Battle (8)
"The outer region?" Li Hao was startled."Right!"The lightning Emperor nodded,"they hope to use my lightning world to transfer worlds into and out of the lightning territory. Otherwise, it's almost impossible to bring a world out of the lightning territory! It was the same for outsiders and people from the four regions! In the four-sided domain, only my family is a Thunder World. Moreover, our Thunder World has endured many years of Primal Chaos lightning tribulations. Even if other Level Seven Thunder worlds appear, they won't be as strong as our world's Primal Chaos lightning tribulation!""Therefore ... In the short term, the other party doesn't want to break through the Thunder World and will only force me out to surround and kill me! Unless they have no choice but to take action, they will also do their best to protect the Thunder World!"Li Hao instantly understood!So that was how it was!I was thinking, the other party already knows that you lack a great Dao crystal and that your strength is no longer at your peak. To think that someone as powerful as the Dragon Lord would actually be forced to retreat by you ... In other words, you don't wish to break through the Thunder World.Outer region ... The Dragon Lord's ambition was really not small.This was beyond his imagination!It turned out that the four-sided domain was not the enemy's only target. They were quite bold.This was good. This also meant that as long as the Thunderbolt master was still in the realm, the other party would not dare to attack him rashly. They would only continue to suppress him and force him to go out to find the great Dao crystal and solve the crisis!His 800 million great Dao crystals could more or less give the other party some time to recover.This was good!At this moment, Li Hao's smile was brilliant."Then we'll give them a surprise. Senior, please continue to torment them for a while ... When they really think that the Thunder World is at its end, perhaps ... We can scheme against them!"The Thunder monarch laughed."Yes, I think so too. Therefore, when I return this time ... I will not rashly take out these great Dao crystals to use. Instead, I will use them as a trump card at a critical moment. I hope to severely damage the fire Phoenix Sector!""In addition, I wish the two young friends ... A smooth journey!"The Thunder monarch still gave his blessings. These two little guys were really crazy, and their strength was really strong!Of course, he was not optimistic about the so-called plan to sweep across the thousand realms. However, there was no need to strike a blow to them. He was already having such a difficult time, so he had no right to strike a blow to these people.The two of them said goodbye to each other, and Thunderlord instantly disappeared.Li Hao, on the other hand, laughed at this moment, and Kong Ji exhaled."Fortunately, he was sent away after spending hundreds of millions of great Dao crystals. He even helped us attract attention. If I had known earlier ... I would have absorbed fewer great Dao crystals. Money can actually make a level Seven work so hard!"It felt so good!Li Hao was speechless. He glanced at him. What are you saying?In the next moment, he also revealed a smile,"I just didn't expect that the Thunder World would be so poor. How miserable!" However ... It's a good thing for us right now! "We'll wait for the lightning Lord to make his move. The Thunder World isn't too far from here. According to our agreement, when the other party erupts and attracts the attention of the experts, we'll make our move. Brother kongji, this time ... We'll kill the seventh-rank experts and seize the world. The presence of a seventh-rank expert will prove that the appearance of a seventh-rank universe is real!" Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Kong Ji laughed as well.He laughed excitedly. Killing a level 7 ... This time, he was going to kill a level 7 in the truest sense of the word. He was going to kill a level 7 on his own initiative. It was so exciting to think about it without anyone to rely on!Can I?He definitely could!The lightning Lord, who didn't have a universe of the great path or a seventh-tier world, didn't gain any advantage when fighting with them. In that case ... What was there to be afraid of when a Beast of Chaos didn't have a seventh-tier world or a seventh-tier universe of the great path?He would just kill them! ……One day later.Thunder World.Suddenly, a heaven-toppling pressure appeared, and a massive voice resounded through the world.The Thunderbolt master's furious roar reverberated in all directions,"Fire Phoenix, didn't you want to take over the Thunder World and kill me?" "I'll give you a chance. You and I will fight in a month. If you win, I'll hand over the Thunder World. If you lose, I only need one billion great Dao crystals!""As long as I'm still alive, the human race will rise again ... If I'm defeated, I'm afraid I can't help you!"The Thunder monarch's voice was extremely loud!This scene shocked many people.In the fire Phoenix World.Even the flame Phoenix World Overlord was startled. After a long time, he mumbled,""He ... He didn't go out! It's really ... Unexpected!"We've arranged many routes for you, but you didn't take any of them.I'm very clear about your situation.Right now, you're lacking in the power of a great Dao. What you should do is think of a way to seize some great Dao crystals, not challenge me to a battle!It was obvious that a battle agreement would definitely be signed without any evidence!If the other party were to lose ... Then ... The fire Phoenix realm master's eyes started to waver. Could it be ... That I can really take over the entire Thunder World?As for killing the lightning Lord, that was not as important as the Thunder World!This was the most important thing!At this moment, the flame Phoenix realmlord laughed out loud. He laughed in a carefree manner. Thunderbolt master, do you want to take a gamble?​ You, can you beat me?You've overestimated yourself!Even the grade 7 dragon race expert laughed,""Thunderlord, this is a gamble! If we can really sign the great Dao contract and take over the Thunder World, fellow Daoist Fire Phoenix would have made a great contribution!"If they could take down the Thunder World peacefully, this would be the best outcome.Not only the fire Phoenix, but he had also made a huge contribution!The Thunder World was something that the Dragon Lord was determined to obtain. Even if a few seventh rank venerable sovereigns were to die for it, it would not be a problem.The fire Phoenix Thearch also smiled brightly.""I'll also help you, fellow Daoists. Otherwise, why would the Thunder Emperor fight with his back against the water? Then we'll wait for a month ... However, before that, we'll first gather our troops and surround the Thunder World. Since he's not going out, then ... There's no need to deliberately leave an opening!"Previously, he had intentionally let him out. It was a pity that the other party didn't leave. However, it was the same now!A few days ago, he was still testing the waters.In the end, this guy actually chose this path. How interesting.

3239 Chapter 528
The lightning master's might was unparalleled, and he directly invited the flame Phoenix realmlord!On Dragon world's side, Li Hao and the others were waiting in silence. At this moment, Li Hao smiled!Success!800 million great Dao crystals. A level-four world was only worth 100 to 200 million great Dao crystals. It was worth several medium-level worlds, but at this moment, it was all worth it."Let's go!"At Li Hao's command, Kong Ji, second cat, and black Panther followed him and flew toward the nearby Tier 6 world. Their first target was still the world of Tianhuang. As for where the tier 7 expert was hiding and whether or not he was in the world of the Earth Dragon, they were in no hurry.If it really didn't work, then he would just capture all the rank 6 worlds here! n,O,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  ……Tianhuang world.The master of Tianhuang mainland was also waiting near the realm gate. He was looking into the distance at the place where the pressure was overwhelming. He was also shocked. The Thunder Emperor was really bold. The fire Phoenix realm Lord was not to be trifled with.Although the Thunder Emperor was strong, everyone knew that he was very weak right now.This was courting death!He had sent the world out for nothing.For a moment, they were a little envious. They didn't know who the great path universe of the Thunder World had benefited from. If it was taken by the fire Phoenix realm master, it would most likely benefit that Princess Feng Yan. The other party was so young, but she could already enter the seventh level ... They were really envious.As for himself, he didn't know when he would be able to nurture a level-seven universe.Just as he was thinking, the huge eye suddenly flickered.Was there a living being not far away?It looked at the dark chaos with some doubts. It seemed to have seen something vaguely. Was someone passing by?At this moment, he didn't feel uneasy.If the Thunderbolt master hadn't shown up before, they would have to worry about whether he had appeared. But now ... What was there to be afraid of?Just as he was thinking, two giant beasts appeared in front of him almost instantly.A cat and a dog.In the chaos, the most famous combination of cat and dog was naturally Cang Mao and Tian Gou. However, these two were obviously not ...The sixth rank venerable sovereign was a little suspicious. He didn't know the man, and just as he was about to speak, the other party said,""I am the emissary of the fire Phoenix, and I am here to summon sixth grade venerable sovereigns from all directions to besiege the Thunder World!"Then, a stone appeared on the dog's paw. It contained the origin Qi of the Phoenix.This was also the method by which the fire Phoenix realm contacted the venerable sovereign of External Affairs.At the same time, it was also a proof of identity.The Lord of Tianhuang was stunned for a moment, but he quickly recognized her and immediately said,""I'm a subordinate of the dragon world, and I only obey the orders of the dragon world ..."Although he said that, he was a little confused. Could it be that the fire Phoenix realm had obtained the secret Order of the Dragon Master?It was only right for them to besiege the Thunder World.But ... Wasn't the battle supposed to be in a month?Are we, the sixth step, going to participate as well?Such a thought appeared in his mind. Should I go or not? if I go, will I have a chance?The thought flashed through his mind, and in the next moment ... His surroundings turned into absolute silence and darkness. The entire chaos seemed to have lost contact in an instant.The Lord of Tianhuang did not expect that in the core of the dragon world, other than the lightning Master, there would be two other chaos beasts who would attack him. Most importantly, he was at the peak of the sixth rank. These two ...Just as this thought emerged, in an instant, the great Nirvana spell erupted!In an instant, the giant lizard seemed to be frozen.Nirvana!Ten thousand Dao Quietus!It was only at this moment that he could truly feel the difference between people like Kong Ji and Li Hao and these Level 6 martial artists. Not every level 6 martial artist could fight a level 7 martial artist!In an instant!Stagnate!Decapitated with a single sword!The huge head fell off in an instant. The sixth rank venerable sovereign was killed almost instantly under the joint attack of the two of them.Dao marks appeared, like the giant lizard itself.As soon as it appeared, the power of destruction exploded again. Life and death appeared. In an instant, all the Dao marks turned into death Qi. In the blink of an eye, Hundun trembled and died!Black Panther, second cat, and even the Silver Moon Emperor who had been watching the battle ...At this moment, they were all in a daze.This was their true strength?The opponents they had fought before were mostly at the 7th rank. It was extremely difficult to deal with them, and they had to use time to recover before they could fight.At this moment, they also knew that this person was a sixth stage venerable sovereign!However ... In just an instant, he died.It was somewhat shocking!It was only at this moment that he realized that these two were no longer ordinary middle-stage venerable sovereigns.After killing his opponent, Li Hao quickly checked the world. Frowning, he shook his head and sent a message to Kong Ji,""There's only this rank six venerable sovereign and some other low-rank venerable sovereigns!"There was no such thing as level Seven.From the looks of it, he was not in Tianhuang world.Kong Ji let out a breath. At this moment, he was a little dazed. It turned out that there was no sense of accomplishment in killing peak rank six martial artists."It shouldn't be here. Should we conquer this world first or continue searching?" he nodded.They had to get rid of that tier 7 fellow! As for whether there was one or more left here ... It was impossible to judge at the moment. However, the Dragon Lord's expedition was to deal with great worlds such as new martial world, so it was impossible to leave too many tier 7 powerhouses.There was a high probability that there would only be one.At this point, he could only take a gamble."Continue searching! Leave a few venerable sovereigns here to clean up the low-rank venerable sovereigns ..."Li Hao quickly released several venerable sovereigns, including Heaven's Fate and King Huai, who were at the middle level. Li Hao said telepathically,""You are the venerable sovereigns who are cleaning up this world! Let's continue to look for that seventh rank venerable sovereign. Before he appears, we must keep a low profile!"
