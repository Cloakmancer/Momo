        , they would kill each other, but when a third party intervened, they would join forces to kill the enemy. After killing the enemy, they would continue to fight.
         This group of people hung the two words "Silver Moon" in front of martial masters to distinguish them from martial masters in other places. This represented their pride, the pride of martial masters. We are Silver Moon martial masters!
         Perhaps this was the Silver Moon Martial master's belief.
         The Silver Moon Martial Master was the number one expert in the world.
         "Hong Yitang ..."
         The light sword coughed continuously as blood flowed. "Where's the southern Fist?"
         "He's back in the central region. "
         Hong Yitang laughed and said,"I have no choice. I'm the only one here. The others can't be contacted or can't leave. You, on the other hand ... Are in such a miserable state!"
         "It's alright. "
         The light sword also smiled. It was not a brilliant smile, but a smile of an old man.
          At this moment, a wave of water swept over!
         It exploded in front of Hong Yitang with a bang.
         However, Hong Yitang didn't even look at it. He just waved his sword lightly and all the waves calmed down. He looked at the attacker and said,""You don't think that I'm only a three yang, do you?"
         "You're right." Hong Yitang laughed."If you think a wave that can kill three suns can kill me ... Aren't you underestimating me?"
         "Hong Yitang," someone said coldly,"no matter how much strength you've hidden, even if you're the same as the Sword of Light, you won't be able to take it away today! If you want to take her away, I'm afraid the price you'll have to pay will be beyond what you can bear!"
         The auras of the experts began to fluctuate.
         Even if Hong Yitang was like the Sword of Light, he wouldn't be able to take away the dying Sword of Light today unless he wanted to stay.
         In the distance, Xu Zhen also frowned and looked at Hong Yitang."Earthcover sword, you, Silvermoon, even want to protect the person who betrayed his master? The Silver Moon Martial Master was strong in the past, and there are also strong people active now, but think carefully, she betrayed the Duke dingguo's mansion! Don't forget that when the Heavenly Star dynasty ruled the world, our dingguo Army did trample the Silver Moon too ..."
         Deterrence?
         Hong Yitang laughed."Don't mention the dingguo Army. The black armor Army of the star royal family is still worth mentioning. The first Duke of dingguo led the dingguo Army into Silver Moon and was almost annihilated. If the black armor Army didn't come to help, it would have been annihilated long ago. Moreover, it happened two hundred years ago. Do you still think of it as an honor? Doesn't your family's genealogy record these disgraces?"
         Xu Zhen frowned.
         Bullshit!
         Of course, the family had records of it, but only of some great achievements, such as suppressing the Silver Moon. The dingguo Army was one of the important forces, but of course, all of these were written by the victors.
         As for the details, only the people involved knew. Even Hong Yitang only heard about it from the older generation.
         These people weren't too willing to make a move at this moment.
         That was because the overbearing sword had come, and perhaps its strength was really not weak.
         There was no harm in stalling for time. The light sword's condition would only get worse and worse. As time passed, she would be crippled.
         ……
         At the same time, in the sea.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Li Hao advanced silently.
         The appearance of the earth overturning sword attracted everyone's attention. At this moment, he was approaching the water element late stage rising light expert.
         Let's continue chatting!
         He didn't mind another sneak attack.
          After dealing with this late-stage sunrise, he could join up with the light sword. At that time, he could provide some sword energy and perhaps help her recover a little.  Li Hao silently approached.
         Late-stage sunguang was not easy to kill.
         But he had experience and if he worked well with Gou 'Zi, it wasn't impossible to kill him instantly.
         Step by step, he got closer.
         It was getting closer and closer.
         Li Hao didn't see anyone, only a large ball of light. The other party might have some special means to hide, but in Li Hao's eyes, these means were useless.
         When he was about 30 meters away from his opponent, Li Hao stopped moving.
         At this moment, he stopped in his tracks.
         The radiant sword was right above him.
         At this moment, the light sword seemed to have vaguely sensed something. She knew that there was someone under her feet, so she had not entered the sea. However, at this moment, it seemed that someone was sneaking over.
         Who was it?
         He didn't feel like a superhuman, but more like a ... Martial Master!
         ……
         In the sea.
         Li Hao was silent for a while.
         Above them, the earth overturning sword was still chatting with them, as if they were just having a casual chat.
         No one seemed to be in a hurry. The only one who was in a hurry was the light sword.
         Meanwhile, a small sword appeared in Li Hao's hand.
         Li Hao had not cultivated the sword nurturing technique well and did not have much effect, but he had been nurturing it all this time. The four sword intents in the small sword had been nurturing it all this time and did not need to be fused again.
         Li Hao closed his eyes. At this moment, he recalled the sword attack he had seen in the past.
         The more powerful he was, the more he could understand how powerful this sword was.
         A faint sword intent seeped out.
          At the same time, Hong Yitang's body exuded a majestic sword intent that spread in all directions, causing many people's hearts to palpitate.
         In the ocean, the water-elemental being also felt a bone-piercing sword intent.
         He was secretly shocked. Hong Yitang was so strong!
         Even though he was so far away and the water was still there, the other party's sword intent still gave him a bone-piercing cold feeling. This guy, could it be that he had another light sword?
         At this moment, one had to admit that Li Hao and Hong Yitang's cooperation was perfect!
         Sword intent filled the air and normal people would not be able to tell.
         In the field, only the light sword's eyes moved slightly.
         It didn't seem like ... A sword intent!
         As a top-class swordsman, she felt something different. There seemed to be a sword intent under her feet. Was it ... Li Hao?
         Demonic sword?
        
         At this moment, such a thought emerged in her mind.
         Just as this thought rose in his mind, Hong Yitang slashed out with his sword from afar!
         "Get lost!"
         Hong Yitang growled and covered the sky with his sword. The sea surface churned and the sky and earth were overturned!
         ……
         In the sea.
         Li Hao instantly attacked!
         Fast, extremely fast!
         Not only that, but the blood Blade technique also exploded in an instant. Without any hesitation, the sword broke through the waves and directly attacked the light ball.
         He didn't see anything.
          I don't care how many smokescreens you create for me.
         The sunguang expert in the water was originally amazed by Hong Yitang's power. In the next moment, his expression changed and he hurriedly escaped in the water. Like a stream of water, he escaped from his original spot.
         BOOM!
         The sound of an explosion rang out from where he was standing, as did the sound of an explosion in the sky.
         Dawnlight, who had escaped through the water, staggered slightly. He was terrified, but fortunately, he had dodged the attack. At this moment, he looked not far away. There was another swordsman there. Just as he was thinking about it, Li Hao attacked again!
         This time, the waves swept across. BOOM!
         The sound of an explosion rang out nine times in a row!
         In an instant, Li Hao attacked. The late-stage sunguang expert's eyes revealed a touch of coldness. He didn't see or discover this powerful swordsman before, but now he did. This swordsman was not stronger than him.
         He waved his hand, and countless waves engulfed Li Hao, instantly freezing a part of the seabed.
         He wanted to use his power again, but his expression changed again. He instantly tried to escape, but he still couldn't escape the dog's paw. With a pfft, his arm was directly penetrated by the dog's paw, which was supposed to penetrate his heart.
         However, at this moment, the other party had sensed it a little. In the water, these Water-type senses were very sensitive and they avoided the vital parts.
         Even so, the late-stage rising light realm expert was still shocked!
         Damn it!
         Why was there another one?
         A great demon!
         The dog didn't seem to be satisfied. This was the first time it had failed a sneak attack, and the Black Panther felt that it was a disgrace.
         And Li Hao's longsword had already slashed down!
         The only thought on the water-type Esper's mind was to run. If this continued, he would be in trouble.
         At this moment, on the surface of the sea.
         The light sword's eyes flickered. Suddenly, it stomped its foot, and a huge wave surged up. Its sword intent burst out and instantly blasted into the bottom of the sea!
         The Water-type super was about to escape when his expression suddenly changed. On his left was the Black Panther, on his right was Li Hao's sword, and above him ... Was a sword intent of light.
         BOOM!
          The path ahead was blocked. In an instant, Li Hao stabbed his sword into the other party's chest. The Water-type super roared, but before he could make a sound, the Black Panther's Claw struck out. The sea water was like a heavy weight, instantly crushing the other party's head and causing him to bleed!  Li Hao's long sword moved in a circle and exploded with light. With a splash, waves were set off and the man was cut in half in an instant.
         Li Hao, Black Panther, light sword, earth overturning sword ...
         The three swordsmen and the great demon did not discuss much. At this moment, they cooperated very well and killed a late-stage suguang who was good at fighting in the water.
         Li Hao instantly put the corpse into his storage ring.
         At this moment, the few supers who were still testing Hong Yitang seemed to sense something, but at the same time, they didn't seem to feel anything. They all looked in the direction of the light sword.
         Beside Xu Zhen, the white-haired old man was also silently sensing. Suddenly, his expression changed!
         "There's someone in the water!"
         BOOM!
         In an instant, the sword energy filled the sky. One of the powers who was surrounding the light sword immediately dodged and the sword energy exploded. With a loud boom, the waves turned into water arrows and splattered in all directions. The person who just escaped had dozens of sword marks on his leg and blood flowed out.
         And Li Hao also surfaced.
         The group of people were extremely surprised and looked at Li Hao. Where did this swordsman come from?
         No, or rather, did Silver Moon have an eighth swordsman expert?
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Today, the light sword had displayed its divine might. The earth overturning sword had yet to probe anything. Now, another swordsman had arrived. Some red appeared in the water, and some people's expressions changed!
         Previously, there was a person in the water. Could it be that ... He had died?
         Li Hao did not pursue. Instead, he appeared next to the light sword. He looked at the old man in front of him, who was neither male nor female. In fact, Li Hao did not want to look at him for long. However, he had to admit that the light sword's instantaneous reaction just now, when it pierced through the water, did not show that she was seriously injured, dying, or had no will to fight.
         On the contrary, the other party's will to fight was very strong.
         At this moment, one person broke through the encirclement, or rather, the others did not stop him and allowed the overbearing sword to enter. The three swordsmen gathered together at this moment.
         Before the light sword could speak, someone from the outside suddenly said,""The sword Qi is so sharp that blood is bound to be seen when it's used. If it's not a Heavenly Sword, it must be ... Demonic sword Li Hao!!"
         In an instant, everyone looked at Li Hao.
         Everyone's faces were covered.
         However, there were some who could not hide their ecstasy and madness.
          Li Hao!
         The Li family's divine sword was in his hands, and in such a short time, he had killed Xuguang. The bloodline of the eight great families ...
         At this moment, some people were really overjoyed.
         Why was he chasing after the light sword?
         Aren't they just wind-chasing boots?
         But the Windchaser's boots, even if they were the weapons of one of the eight great families, they were still inferior to the Li family's sword. Was this a buy one free one?
         No, it was better!
         In the distance, Xu Zhen was also startled. The next moment, he let out a furious roar, "You're Li Hao?"
         When they first came out, everyone thought that it was hou Xiaochen who killed Xu Feng.
         However, after Li Hao killed the White shark Pirates 'expert, and after the news spread that he had become enemies with the light sword, it was easy to come to a conclusion that Li Hao had done it!
        
         At this moment, Xu Zhen had gone crazy. He roared,"Light sword, you old witch, you really have a poisonous heart! Little Feng must've been killed by you two. This Li Hao is little Feng's murderer. He actually came to save you ... You B * tch, you demoness!"
         Anyone who saw this scene would doubt the Sword of Light!
         Li Hao was Xu Feng's murderer, but at this moment, it was Li Hao who took the risk to save him. This didn't make sense.
         It could only prove that the light sword had betrayed the Xu family long ago, and Xu Feng might have been killed by her.
         The radiant sword did not speak.
         He only glanced at Li Hao and sighed. He was about to say something when Li Hao revealed his true face. He looked around and laughed. "I'm quite famous, and I'm honored! I'm only wearing armor, but you guys still recognized me. You guys have good eyes!"
         With the three great swordsmen gathered, Li Hao was not nervous at all.
         Currently, only the heaven sword and the Azure light sword were no longer with Silvermoon. Otherwise, it would be a Grand occasion if all the sword principle experts came.
         Hong Yitang also shook his head."I haven't been in the martial world for many years. These people took longer to recognize me than they recognized you. It seems that I need to travel more."
         At this moment, the sound transmission fluctuations kept flashing in the surroundings.
          "It's Li Hao! With the divine sword of the Li family in hand, everyone, let's work together and stop hesitating ..."
         "The Earthfall sword isn't weak. It might even be able to unseal itself. He's very strong. As for Li Hao, judging from his previous battle results, he's not weak either ... I'm afraid it'll be difficult to take them down without joining forces!"
         "How do we split the Li family's divine sword and the wind-chasing boots?"
         "Do you think you can take the Li family's divine sword? Of course, if someone really gets it, it'll definitely be worth a lot. Even if you sell it to someone else, it'll be an astronomical figure ..."
         The experts quickly communicated with each other.
         They had to communicate with each other. Originally, everyone was just making do at the last minute and wanted to exhaust the light sword to death. However, at this moment, two swordsmen had arrived. This made things difficult.
         If they didn't communicate, who would go first?
         The first one to go up would be in danger.
         But if he didn't go, what if they ran away?
         At this moment, they were eager to reach an agreement and complete the exchange of benefits.
         At this moment, the light sword looked at Li Hao with a complicated expression and said telepathically,""You guys barged into the encirclement so directly ... I'm afraid you won't be able to leave easily!"
         This wasn't the way to save people.
         Of course, this way, she would be the safest. Otherwise, the two of them would harass her from the outside and reduce some of the pressure on her. However, she would have to break out of the encirclement herself. At that time, it would really be dangerous.
         Now that the three of them had gathered, she was safe, but the two of them were in danger.
         She knew that the earth overlayed sword was very powerful, but powerful was not invincible.
         There were more than ten Sunglow powerhouses here, as well as powerful existences in the metamorphosis stage.
         "Can you still fight?"
         Li Hao asked.
         "I can ... But I won't be able to hold on for too long ..." The light sword replied.  Li Hao was a little conflicted.
         But since he was already here, what was there to be conflicted about?
         Martial masters were sometimes impulsive.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Silver Moon and the others did not pay for his life, but only for his treatment. He should have been waiting outside, but it was all Hong Yitang's fault that he had to show himself!
         He threw a small bottle to the light sword.
         However, before he could fly there, he flew back on his own. Li Hao looked at Hong Yitang, who also took out a bottle, which was now in the hands of the light sword."Eat it. It's the spring of life. Li Hao can't suppress your injuries for a while. Just make do with it."
         Li Hao took back his spring of life, a little surprised. Hong Yitang also had one?
         Hong Yitang also sighed. These people were really dangerous!
         Nan Quan had spent one of his high-purity divine power stones, and now, the Sword of Light had spent his spring of life. He was only left with two high-purity divine power stones from the benefits he had picked up in heaven battling city.
         Money fell from the sky, and he didn't even grasp it.
         The light sword didn't say anything and quickly swallowed it.
         Outside, someone saw this scene and was shocked. He quickly sent a message,""There's no need for further discussion. They seem to have brought a healing treasure with them, and they want to snatch it ... This is their chance. If we delay any longer, we might have to pay an even greater price!"
         In an instant, those powerhouses also quickly came to an agreement.
         Everything could wait until they captured a few people.
         Otherwise, it would just be empty talk.
         At this moment, Xu Feng gritted his teeth and shouted at the two people beside him,""Kill!"
         If they didn't make a move and the Duke dingguo's mansion didn't make a move, how could they do it?
         The two people beside him, the white-haired old man was at the peak stage of the rising light realm, and the other middle-aged man was at the late stage of the rising light realm. They were both experts. At this moment, they hesitated for a moment, gritted their teeth, and joined forces to attack!
          The white-haired old man seemed to be an expert of a special system, or even transformed from a Martial Master. With one punch, the sky collapsed and the earth cracked!
         As for the middle-aged man, he also slashed with his saber, causing waves to surge into the sky.
         With the two of them taking the lead, the rest of the people didn't hesitate any longer. They attacked instantly. In an instant, superpowers exploded in the surroundings and the entire sea region was no longer calm.
         Li Hao and earth overturning sword also instantly attacked.
         The longsword struck the air!
         The sound of swords resounded through the world. The earth-overturning sword suppressed the surroundings, and Li Hao's four forces sword also cut off his own sword. There was no return!
         BOOM!
         The collision between the sword aura and the superpowers caused an explosion. Li Hao spat out a mouthful of blood, and the earth-covered sword also staggered slightly. The surrounding superpowers were also shocked!
         "Silvermoon swordsman ..."
         Someone said in a muffled voice. He was a little shocked. So strong!
        
         The strongest move was still the Earthcover sword. With one strike, he suppressed many supers, giving Li Hao the chance to attack. Li Hao's sword was also very strong, but not to the point of shocking everyone.
         However, the earth overturning sword suppressed several top-notch experts with a single sword. That was what was terrifying.
         With the cooperation of the two swords, the two sides collided once. The result was that Li Hao was injured, and his internal organs were shaken by the earth overturning sword. However, the superpower side was not in a good state either. A bloody mark appeared on the white-haired old man's fist.
         Behind them, Xu Zhen's expression also changed. The next moment, he growled, "Let's attack together. Don't hold back. Hong Yitang hasn't been unsealed yet. Maybe he can. Attack quickly!"
         However, no one paid attention to him.
         Someone coldly said,"Xu Zhen, are you watching a show?" Let's attack together!"
         This guy was also in the late stage of the rising light realm.
         No matter what, the people of the Xu family weren't completely useless. They still had some strength. He didn't have the right to command others.
         Xu Zhen was a bit angry.
         The body of a thousand gold could not sit in a Hall.
          Wasn't it enough for his guest elder to go on stage?
         He actually wanted him to personally take the field.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com It was so dangerous!
         However, he couldn't hold it in anymore. He gritted his teeth and said,""The light sword seems to be recovering ... Let's attack together!"
         The next moment, he jumped up and kicked!
         This kick created a whirlwind.
         He had trained in martial arts before, but his martial arts talent was average. He had not been able to comprehend force for a long time. After the appearance of superpowers, he transformed into one, and now he was cultivating well.
         Since he had personally entered the arena, the experts from all around finally came to an agreement.
         Let's attack together!
         At this moment, thousands of miles were frozen and lightning flashed!
         BOOM!
         With a loud explosion, the earth overturning sword struck again and again, creating a defensive circle of more than ten meters, blocking the attacks. Li Hao's sword also struck out instantly, causing damage to the experts on the periphery.
         One for attack and one for defense ... However, the defensive power was still good, but the offensive power was not enough.
         Li Hao's attack was slightly weaker.
         "What a pity, you're not Tian Jian ..." Hong Yitang sighed.
         These words were a little stimulating.
         Obviously, Hong Yitang felt that if Tian Jian was here and worked with him, these people would not be a problem.
         And that was indeed the case. Li Hao, who had the battle strength of a mid-stage rising light realm expert, was relatively weaker in terms of attack power.
         Outside, there were only two mid-stage rising light realm experts.
         The rest of them were either in the late stage or the peak stage, and some were even in the metamorphosis stage. Li Hao's sword aura could not kill them, and it would be difficult to even hurt them.
         At this moment, the light sword was still absorbing the spring of life and recovering some of its injuries.
         If he didn't recover, Li Hao wouldn't be able to suppress the riot of his internal organs.
         p However, in that case, the two of them could only choose to defend.  Li Hao didn't say anything, but he felt a little sullen and depressed.
         Where did these guys come from?
         Where did so many experts come from?
         At this moment, his attack power was even weaker, but his sword was a little ethereal, like the fluttering catkins of a willow tree. Coupled with the Shadowless Sword, it was somewhat elusive. However, to the people on the outside, it was even easier!
         Previously, Li Hao's sword attacks had been somewhat threatening.  But at this moment, they suddenly felt that the threat was even smaller.
         Hong Yitang, on the other hand ... Wanted to cry.
         He regretted it!
         What was Li Hao doing?
         He used himself as a defensive shield, and then he hid behind it, using people to practice his skills, practicing his catkin sword ... My God, do you think that this place is very safe?
         The light sword was recovering from its injuries. Although Li Hao was still fighting, he was now curled up in the defensive circle. His attacks were weak and powerless. How could he resist if this continued?
         Li Hao didn't care.
         This was a form of trust. He believed that Hong Yitang could hold on. Otherwise, once the defense was broken, he wouldn't be able to escape.
         However, his attack did seem weak.
         Since that was the case ... Since he couldn't hurt anyone, he might as well do something weaker!
         Sword after sword, they were like fluttering catkins. Li Hao was immersed in his sword attacks, and his courage grew. He even broke through the defensive circle several times and attacked with his sword, only to startle his opponent. In the end, he discovered that ... This sword couldn't even break through the defense of a mid-stage Sunglow realm expert.
         Xu Zhen kicked Li Hao back, then suddenly laughed,"He used the bloodblade technique. Now that the effects of the technique have worn off, he's in the stage of backlash. His strength has weakened a lot, and he's only at the early stage of the rising light realm!"
         Li Hao's situation was similar to the weakened state after using the bloody blade technique.
         He quickly determined Li Hao's situation.
         On the other hand, Hong Yitang was really strong. He actually blocked their attacks, but he was unable to fight back. If he continued to defend passively, he could only wait for death.
         Xu Zhen's words made everyone's eyes light up.
         So weak?
         The early stage of the rising light realm ... To them, it was still easy to deal with. At this moment, many people were staring at Li Hao. When Li Hao rushed out again, all kinds of superpowers exploded outside in an instant. With a loud bang, Li Hao was beaten and retreated, covered in blood.
         He didn't care about all this. All he could see was the sword in his hand!
         The next moment, he charged out again. His powerful body gave him more opportunities to fight. Sword after sword, Li Hao's Willow catkin sword became more and more familiar, but he still couldn't show any sword momentum!
         "Li Hao!"
         Hong Yitang shouted in a low voice, and the defensive circle swayed slightly. Li Hao rushed out again, but he was clawed by a cloaked expert. With a plop, a large piece of flesh was torn off his arm!
         The other party went straight for his sword. However, he had been cut when he tried to grab Li Hao's sword. Now, he chose to cut off Li Hao's arm.
         Even his powerful body couldn't block the other party's attack, and his skin and flesh were torn apart by a single claw.
         Li Hao's sword, on the other hand, fluttered in the air. He stabbed his opponent, but was knocked back by an extremely powerful super power. With a boom, Li Hao vomited blood and quickly retreated, barely managing to retreat.
         The other party still wanted to pursue, but he was sent flying by overturning the heavens and overturning the earth!
         Meanwhile, Hong Yitang's face gradually turned pale.
          At this moment, he could only defend. The light sword was still being digested, and Li Hao was also practicing ... He was like a nanny, carefully defending so that the enemy wouldn't take the opportunity to break their joint attack.
         Hong Yitang was extremely tired. If he had known earlier, he would have sneaked an attack on these guys alone.
         These people, none of them were free from worry!
         Li Hao, on the other hand, was completely immersed in it. His sword moves became even more gentle, like the swaying of a tree branch, erratic.
         With a clatter, he pulled back his sword. Li Hao was kicked and retreated again, coughing up blood.
         He looked at Xu Zhen and revealed a smile.
         Did you have a good time?
         Later ... I'll use you to test my sword!
         The first sword of the five elements will be you!
         At this moment, the wooden sword force had already appeared. As expected, this kind of life and death battle was the most exciting and could stimulate the sword intent the most.
        
         Li Hao retreated, but Hong Yitang was sweating.
         His heaven and earth flipping sword was simply superb!
         The swords attacked in all directions and blocked the attacks. It was only now that Li Hao had the mood to take a closer look. He had to admit that the defense was watertight!
         A total of 13 sunguang's were attacking them.
         Out of the 14 people, Li Hao's team had killed one. The remaining 13 people were not to be trifled with. Perhaps they were afraid, or perhaps they wanted the others to fight first. But no matter what, Hong Yitang was fighting 13 people alone. He was extremely powerful!
         It was only when Li Hao retreated that they felt the danger and pressure.
         Even Hong Yitang's bronze dagger seemed to be deformed.
         It was being squeezed!
         Hong Yitang had already unlocked the seal and was in a state of unsealing. However, he wasn't as crazy as the others. Every time he did so, the Super Lock would break.
         Whether it was in the Cang mountains or heaven battling city, Hong Yitang had never broken the Super Lock on such a large scale. Instead, he had used a kind of gentle and silent unsealing method, which was even more terrifying.
          This meant that he was able to control the release of some of the potential of the superpower locks.
         At this moment, Li Hao was also panting.
         He didn't go to help immediately.
         This time, he had his eyes on Xu Zhen. Xu Zhen was one of the five late-stage powerhouses alive, but his identity was special. There was also a late-stage and peak of the rising light realm on the scene, and they all came with him.
         If this person died ... The people of the Duke dingguo's mansion would either be in complete despair and fight to the death, or they would be scared out of their wits and escape.
         However, as the son of the Duke of dingguo, this person was not easy to deal with.
         Li Hao gasped for breath and looked at Xu Zhen.
         At this moment, a faint Shi, like a Willow catkin, was born.
         The Willow catkin sword.
         The momentum of this sword was not as vigorous as the other wooden swords. It did not have the boundless vitality of the wooden swords. There was only a sense of softness, as if it would run away with the wind. It was timid but endless.
         Li Hao's sword momentum came from two aspects. The first was the catkin sword technique, and the second was the little tree's comprehension of Origin Energy.
         Among the catkins, there were also some characteristics of the small tree.
         What were the characteristics of the small tree?
         He wouldn't let his guard down!
         Persevering, continuous, and endless.
         He had stood alone outside the palace for tens of thousands of years, determined on one thing, and would never look back for the rest of his life.
         At this moment, Li Hao had a deeper understanding of the little tree's Dao. The little tree's Dao seemed to be the same as the big tree 's. Perhaps it was purely an inheritance or rebirth, instead of walking another Dao.
         Therefore, in Li Hao's perception, the son inherited his father's path, which had always been the history of the big tree's growth. Now that the big tree had died, the small trees would take root and sprout, or spread their mission endlessly.
         "Li Hao!"
          Hong Yitang bellowed again because his defensive circle was shrinking. Li Hao, on the other hand, seemed to be sensing something and was about to leave his circle. Once he left his protection, Li Hao would be in trouble!  Li Hao drifted back a few steps like a catkin.
         At this moment, the light sword's face was pale and then redder. It felt like it was about to wake up.
         Hong Yitang complained in his heart.
         These two guys were really unreliable.
         The light sword was one thing, and he had a rough idea of what Li Hao was doing, but ... It was really going to cost him his life!
         At this moment, a small tree in Li Hao's liver seemed to have begun to take root and sprout.
         It was as if it was just a willow branch that was inserted into the soil and growing.
         The small tree began to grow, and chains appeared like roots. They no longer bound the small tree, but spread all over the roots of the small tree, spreading to the entire liver.
         At this moment, some strange things had settled in his five internal organs.
         The Tiger in his heart, the waves in his kidney, the mountain in his spleen, the origin of the golden sun in his lungs, and the small tree that had just spread to his liver.
         Among the livers, the small tree was the most fragile.
         The other four forces were clearly much stronger.
         All of his other Shi had used either the Skygold Lotus or the spirit accumulation fruit, but this willow branch was extremely fragile and had just been born.
         At this moment, Li Hao coughed, and a Golden Lotus seed appeared in his hand.
         This was the petal of the heavenly Golden Lotus that Hong Yitang had given him that day. Li Hao had already consumed it.
         The Lotus seed, however, had been kept.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The petals had the effect of strengthening Shi, but what about the Lotus seeds?
         Li Hao actually didn't know, but at this moment, he wanted to give it a try. Perhaps the effect would be good. If possible, he hoped to strengthen the willow tree. The five Forces were out of balance, and it was easy for problems to arise when they were fused.
          As soon as the Golden Lotus seed entered his mouth, it melted and disappeared.
         The cooling force was even stronger than the Lotus petals. Li Hao's mind jolted. The Lotus seed had the same effect, but it seemed to be stronger.
         This force was instantly guided into Li Hao's liver.
         The small branch seemed to have been nourished and instantly began to grow.
         Gradually, the small tree began to grow.
         Bang! Bang!
         At this moment, Hong Yitang's heart beat faster and faster, and a burst of fire seemed to be seeping out. Li Hao woke up instantly and looked at Hong Yitang. At this moment, Hong Yitang's face seemed to be on fire.
         One of his superpower locks seemed to have broken.
         The powerful force expanded his defensive circle, but the faint explosion of fire energy made him feel uncomfortable, as if his heart was burning.
         Back when he was dealing with hou Xiaochen's group in the city, he hadn't been in such a situation.
        
         At this moment, the light sword seemed to be opening its eyes. Hong Yitang shouted,""Continue with your repair. Don't waste the spring of life!"
         It was obvious that the Sword of Light had sensed the danger and Hong Yitang's powerlessness.
         If this continued, Hong Yitang would follow in her footsteps.
         However, Hong Yitang also knew that the light sword was still being repaired. Once it was used, all the injuries that had just been repaired would collapse in an instant. Not only would the spring of life be wasted, but Li Hao might not be able to save him anymore.
         He had to wait for the energy of the spring of life to fully permeate his body and heal his injuries before he could make a move.
         The Sword of Light's eyelids struggled for a while, but gradually, it calmed down.
         The earth overturning sword seemed to give everyone a great sense of security.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com Even Li Hao could focus on his own cultivation, because he knew that the Earthcover sword was still there. As such, he had some confidence.
         ……
         At this moment, the experts who were attacking from all directions were shocked.
          Did they use their full strength?
         No, there wasn 't.
         At least two of them in the transformation stage had not used their full strength. Under such circumstances, it was not a good idea to use their full strength and become the first target of the Earthcover sword. It was not just one group, but many groups.
         Even so, there were a total of 13 top powerhouses. Even in the central region, they were still top existences. Such strength was even enough to destroy some powerful organizations.
         However, today, he was unable to break through the defense of one person. It was unbelievable!
         One of the two powerhouses in the transformation stage was wearing a mask, while the other was wearing a black armor. They looked like black armor, but there were some differences. At this time, the powerhouse in the armor couldn't help but praise,"Seven Swords of the Silver Moon and the earth-covered sword ... I'm afraid they're the best in the world ..."
         Putting everything else aside, just this defensive swordsmanship alone was impregnable. His reaction speed, inner strength, and combat experience were all top-notch!
         Seeing that he still had the mood to judge in the middle of the battle, some people cursed in their hearts. It's all because you guys didn't use your full strength!
         This person couldn't help but speak, but in fact, someone recognized him.
         At this stage, they were all big shots, so who could hide it from who?
         The moment the armored expert spoke, several people in the crowd guessed his identity. A name immediately appeared in their minds, one that disdained fan Chang!
         He was definitely a Big Shot.
         Linjiang's Governor-General was the Overlord of Linjiang province. Originally, he was only the director of the administrative Bureau, but he later merged with other organizations to form the Governor-General's Office, Silver moon's old neighbor.
         It was said that one of the eight Pirates, the sea demon Pirates, was supported by this person.
         And he was also the nail that the nine divisions and the imperial family had placed on the edge of the Silver Moon.  It was no wonder that this person wanted to hide his identity. His identity was special, and if he were to reveal his identity and kill the light sword, he might attract the revenge of some Silver Moon martial masters.
         As for Linjiang and silver Moon, they were too close.
         However, at this moment, no one cared anymore. It didn't matter if this person's identity was exposed. In fact, from the start of the battle until now, the identities of the 13 people present had probably been exposed. They could all guess a thing or two.
         Xu Zhen cursed in his heart.
         Of the two experts in the metamorphosis stage, one was fan Chang, and the other was wearing a cloak, but he was not a flying expert. If his guess was correct, the other person was the commander of the Imperial Army.
         The king of the plains!
         Indeed, he had seen the other party a few times, but he didn't expect that the other party's strength would be even greater than he had imagined. The king of the plains was the superior of hou Xiaochen and the others, and was the existence who had established the Wei Wu Army back then.
         His palace wasn't too far from here. Obviously, there was an expert from the plain Field King's side. This person was called Qian Feng, and he had always been the top general under the plain Field King.
         Out of the four powerhouses at their peak, other than the one from the Duke dingguo's mansion, he had long recognized that the remaining one was orange moon, who was hidden behind the mask.
         The remaining two had also concealed their identities, but they still could not hide it from him.
         One of them was the great Pirate of the North Sea, a Duke under the King of the North Sea. Xu Zhen didn't know his name, but he had heard a thing or two about this man's title, the Duke of the peaceful sea. He had even ridiculed the great Pirate of the North Sea for his ignorance.
         From the looks of it, he was not weak. He was even a powerhouse at the peak of the rising light Stage. He did not know how strong the King of the North Sea was. From the looks of it, he was at least a powerhouse in the metamorphosis stage. It was just that he had not appeared at this moment. No one knew where he had gone.
         Xu Zhen also recognized the other peak-stage sunrise cultivator. He wasn't from Fei Tian or Yama. Perhaps these two families didn't have enough time to send their experts, and only sent a late-stage sunrise cultivator each. This peak-stage sunrise cultivator seemed to be from stupa mountain, one of the seven divine mountains. It was hard to tell who he was exactly, but judging from the way he attacked, there was no doubt about it.
         The seven divine mountains were not as famous as the three great organizations, but those who knew the truth knew that they were not weak.
          Sky sword Mountain, mountain Lord Tian Jian.
         Haotian mountain, Mountain Master Haotian, one of the peerless overlords.
         Mount Tian Peng was guarded by a peerless great demon that once devoured a suguang with a single bite. It was a terrifying sight.
         It was said that the people on stupa mountain were extremely strong in the Dao of killing. When stupa descended, they stopped Wars and put down soldiers. This was also based on strength.
         ……
         These people all had their own ulterior motives.
         Although they were all praising Hong Yitang's strength, in fact, they were all confident of winning.
         In fact, they had not consumed much.
         And Hong Yitang was obviously unable to hold on.
         At this moment, Li Hao's Five Forces gradually began to balance, and the starry sky sword in his hand also trembled slightly. He didn't look at Hong Yitang anymore, as he could only defend at this moment.
        
         She didn't know how long it would take for the light sword to stabilize her condition. Li Hao wanted to inject sword energy into her, but she might not be able to suppress the power of the superpower lock with her current physical condition.
         As these thoughts flashed through his mind, the five chains began to wrap around Li Hao's five internal organs. Although he hadn't studied much about the five internal organs as one, Li Hao had his own experience.
         The five waves of force followed the five chains and collided with each other.
         This was Li Hao's first time trying to merge the five Forces.
         The appearance of the five Forces did not mean that they could merge.
         In the past, it was not a complete fusion, but Li Hao's superclass of sword intent and his powerful sword intent had suppressed it.
         At this time, he wanted to try and see if the five Forces could naturally merge and not the kind that suppressed.
         As soon as the five types of Shi came into contact ... Li Hao's body trembled as if he had been struck by lightning.
         His powerful five internal organs had long reached the level of Wan Fang.
         But at this moment, it was still trembling slightly, and cracks had even appeared on it.
          Li Hao was shocked!
         So strong?
         As such, he couldn't rashly try to merge the five Forces. At this moment, he could only try to use the sword intent superclass to tame the five Forces and let it control them.
         "Ha!"
         Right at this moment, Hong Yitang let out a loud shout. Flames rose up and instantly evaporated a large amount of seawater. A powerful inner strength burst out and shook the surroundings, forcing the others to retreat.
         Hong Yitang spurted out a mouthful of blood and panted heavily. He brandished his sword again, and the world around him seemed to have been flipped over. He felt even stronger than before.
         However, everyone was an expert, and they could see a thing or two.
         Hong Yitang couldn't hold it in anymore.
         He was in a period of exhaustion.
         Hong Yitang felt a little aggrieved. If he didn't have to protect these two, he could still kill a few people if he wanted to. However, once he attacked, his defense would be broken.
         He had a chance of escaping, but there was no hope for Li Hao and the light sword.
         Hong Yitang gritted his teeth!
         He was waiting for an opportunity.
         Only by waiting for Li Hao and the light sword to recover would they have a chance to turn defeat into victory. Otherwise ... They could only think of a way to escape.
         He believed that Li Hao wouldn't waste his time.
         She also believed that the light sword would not collapse so easily. With the water of the spring of life in her body, she would definitely be able to recover some of her combat power given time.
         Just like these two, they also believed that he could defend to the limit.
         "Ha!"
         With another roar, not only did he not compress the defensive circle, but he expanded it. The others also took advantage of the situation and retreated, their eyes revealing a cold look.
         You won't be able to hold on for long!
         At this moment, Li Hao had roughly sorted out his Five Forces system. However, he didn't have enough time to do a specific fusion.
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com He didn't care.
         It was almost enough.
          On the small sword, the five Forces quickly merged, and the starry sky sword trembled slightly. Li Hao used the sword nurturing technique. At this moment, the five Forces were restrained, and the starry sky sword dimmed a little and no longer trembled.  Nurture a sword!
         He opened his eyes and looked at the 13 people on the outside, then at Xu Zhen. If this person died ... Maybe there would be a different effect.
         As for Black Panther, he should have been looking for an opportunity.
         As long as Xu Zhen was dead and his men fled, Heibao would be able to seize the opportunity.
         At this moment, Li Hao waved his sword again and charged out!
         They were still as light as willow catkins.
         Just like before, Li Hao charged out of the battle circle. In an instant, he was attacked from all directions. Li Hao's Silver armor trembled violently, and some of it retracted back into his body.
         The silver armor had its limits as well.
         At this moment, Li Hao was clearly unable to display its full power.
         The Willow catkin sword attacked again.
         With a thud, he was punched to the side.
         With a loud boom, another person reached out to grab Li Hao's arm, trying to seize the divine sword.
         Li Hao's counterattack was light and weak.
         Li Hao attacked a few times and quickly retreated back into the battle.
         The others felt a little regretful, but they weren't in a hurry. Li Hao's lethality wasn't worth mentioning here.
         Other than the two mid-stage Sunglow realm experts, who needed to be careful, the others were not too worried.
         "Hong Yitang, stop being so stubborn! If you retreat now, Li Hao will hand over the Li family's divine sword, and the light sword will hand over the wind chasing boots ... Then the three of you can live. Otherwise ... I'm afraid none of you will be able to leave!"
         Someone said. It was one of the two in the transformation stage, the general from the Pingyuan Palace, Qian Feng.
         Hong Yitang remained silent.
         At this moment, he seemed to have sensed something from Li Hao's sword intent.
         It was a sign ... That he was about to explode.
         Li Hao wanted to kill someone.
          Can you do it?
         He did not know.
         However, he didn't mind creating an opportunity for Li Hao.
         As Qian Feng's voice fell, he roared in a low voice and seemed to give up defense in an instant. He slashed out with his sword. The sky collapsed and the earth cracked. The sea collapsed and the sea seemed to be collapsing.
         Everyone was shocked, and the charging experts quickly retreated.
         As for the weaker ones, they were a step too slow.
         In the next moment, Hong Yitang put away his sword and defended again, causing these people to curse in their hearts.
         It was a scare!
         There were also a few powerhouses who were cursing in their hearts. They were all so afraid of death, no wonder it was difficult to capture these people.
         At this moment, a few late-stage and mid-stage Sunglow realm cultivators rushed to the front because they were slightly slower in retreating just now. Instead, they were closer to the front.
        
         Li Hao's eyes flickered, and he instantly seized the opportunity.
         It was so comfortable to work with a Martial Master.
         Hong Yitang was too good at creating battle opportunities.
         The moment the other experts retreated, he instantly charged out. Xu Zhen and the others who were in the front didn't pay much attention to him. It wasn't the first time Li Hao had charged out. As long as it wasn't Hong Yitang, it was fine.
         Li Hao suddenly roared.
         "Kill!"
         The roar was like a fierce tiger coming down the mountain. The roar shook the eardrums.
         A powerful divine intent suddenly burst forth. At this moment, they saw many things. There were mountains, water, Tigers, trees ...
         The floating Willow catkin sword was still as light as ever.
         However, this time, the sword was like a venomous snake. The sword flew out and locked onto one person. It was everywhere and didn't let up.
          Five different lights shone in all directions.
         The sea water shook violently, and huge waves rose. With a boom, Xu Zhen was pushed forward. His expression changed slightly, and he kicked out. He wanted to do the same thing as before, kicking Li Hao away.
         However, this time, the kick only produced a loud bang, but Li Hao didn't move an inch!
         "Be careful!"
         The white-haired old man who was a little further back was suddenly shocked. With a roar, he quickly stepped forward and punched out!
         Li Hao's sword didn't seem fast, but it only took an instant for him to draw it and slash down.
         He slashed out with his sword!
         Xu Zhen only felt that he was surrounded by tree branches ... No, sword light. At this moment, he didn't know where the weakness of Li Hao's sword technique was. He roared and tried to break the sword light, but he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his right leg. Li Hao's left fist hit him, causing him to stagger slightly. The right leg he had just kicked Li Hao with had a crack.
         At this moment, the web-like sword radiance was falling toward him.
         The sword light flashed and disappeared!
         The next moment, Xu Zhen escaped from Li Hao's side and jumped out. His face was filled with shock, and then he laughed,"You little bastard, you have some good tricks. You actually dared to trick me!"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com As for Li Hao, he also retreated instantly. He gasped for breath and began to build up his sword power again.
         Xu Zhen laughed out loud, but he was still a little scared.
         Behind them, the white-haired old man and the middle-aged man were still in shock. They quickly moved closer to Xu Zhen. They were scared to death just now. Fortunately, Li Hao's sword looked dangerous, but it didn't cause much damage.
         The Duke was fine.
         If something were to happen, not long after Xu Feng's death, the light sword would rebel, the five generals would be killed, and if something happened to the little Duke, the Duke dingguo's mansion would explode.
         The others also looked at Xu Zhen.
         In the beginning, he didn't care.
         But soon, someone let out a soft "huh" sound. The governor of Linjiang turned his head to look at Xu Zhen. At this moment, Xu Zhen was still rejoicing, but also mocking Li Hao, saying that Li Hao's big talk was nothing.
         He thought he couldn't avoid the sword just now, but it was suddenly gone.
         He was fine!  However, at this moment, the soft hushed sounds continued to ring out. The white-haired old man beside him didn't pay attention at first, but in the next moment, his expression changed drastically.
         The retreating Xu Zhen looked at the old man, slightly startled. What kind of expression was that?
         "Young ... Young Duke ..."
         The old man stuttered. At this moment, he looked at Xu Zhen with eyes full of shock.
         Streaks of blood gradually appeared on Xu Zhen's face. Like a spider web, it began to crack.
         Xu Zhen didn't feel any pain. He only felt an itch on his face ... He reached out and scratched it. In an instant, his face caved in, and his hand cracked.
         Like porcelain, countless cracks appeared in an instant.
         Pieces of flesh and blood fell off.
         "No... Impossible ..."
         Xu Zhen panicked. How could this be? he was clearly fine!
         At this moment, it also attracted the attention of the others.
         At this moment, Li Hao appeared again and attacked a mid-stage rising light realm super with his sword. Hong Yitang took the opportunity to roar and stab again, giving up on defense.
         The others were still looking at Xu Zhen. At this moment, Xu Zhen was like a porcelain doll that instantly cracked. His entire body directly turned into thousands of pieces and fell into the sea.
         The white-haired old man and the middle-aged brawny man were both extremely shocked and felt dizzy!
         At this moment, he didn't even have the time to care about others.
         And this was Li Hao's chance.
         "Kill!"
         The sword was no longer soft and weak, but extremely fierce. It instantly exploded and with a loud bang, the mid-stage rising light realm expert was about to escape when he suddenly felt countless branches wrap around him and he was stopped for a moment.
         And this instant was enough to take his life.
         The sword slashed down, and he died a much more straightforward death than Xu Zhen. In the blink of an eye, he was directly cut in half by the starry sky sword!
          In this instant, Li Hao killed two people with two slashes.
         Hong Yitang, on the other hand, gave up on defense and slashed out with his sword. The other mid-stage rising light realm cultivator was crushed into a ball of meat without any resistance and exploded with a bang!
         Hong Yitang instantly resumed his defense, and Li Hao also retreated to the defensive circle in the blink of an eye.
         In the blink of an eye, the others quickly retreated.
         But at this moment, everyone's expression changed.
         He was dead!
         Xu Zhen was dead, and the two mid-stage rising light Warriors were also killed in an instant. Out of the 13, only 10 were left ...
         All of this had happened too quickly.
         "Duke!"
         At this moment, the white-haired old man seemed to have gone crazy. He clutched onto pieces of flesh and blood as he crumbled. Xu Zhen was dead, and he died in such a miserable way. He had been hacked into pieces!
        
         If this news were to spread ... Even if the high Duke's public house suffered heavy losses, would the dingguo Guild let the two of them off?
         The white-haired old man glanced at the middle-aged man. The middle-aged man's expression also changed slightly as he looked at the old man.
         The two of them were both very powerful. One was at the peak stage of the rising light realm, and the other was at the late stage of the rising light realm. They were fine, but Xu Zhen, the heir of the high Duke's public house, was killed. How could they explain this?
         No matter what ... He couldn't stay here any longer.
         The two of them instantly made a decision.
         No matter what, he had to leave first.
         Whether it was to go back to beg for forgiveness or to escape, for other reasons, he could not stay any longer.
         In the blink of an eye, the two of them had made up their minds. They grabbed Xu Zhen's storage ring, took some of the flesh and blood, and ran away.
         The two of them were also extremely decisive, deciding to escape from this place in an instant.
         However, the next moment, a claw emerged from the water and reached for the middle-aged man's crotch. The middle-aged man couldn't believe it. He looked down and saw that the lower half of his body had almost been pierced through!
          Before he could come back to his senses, a dog's mouth appeared and with a crack, half of the other party's body was bitten off!
         Bang! Bang!
         The white-haired expert punched out, forcing the Black Panther to retreat. It dragged half of the middle-aged man and disappeared into the water. Soon, a stream of red blood appeared.
         In the blink of an eye, a dog appeared. Its eyes were filled with ferocity as it looked at the white-haired old man who was in disbelief.
         Just as Li Hao had expected, although Black Panther hadn't fought many times, his grasp of battle timing was top-notch.
         This series of changes shocked everyone.
         In the blink of an eye, four powerhouses had died.
         And the one who escaped was in a confrontation with a dog!
         This ... What was this?
         Hong Yitang, who had just been besieged, could finally catch his breath. He looked at Li Hao with relief. This kid didn't disappoint him.
         Although he had only killed the weakest group, the strong ones were still there.
         However, without these people, the threat of those powerhouses was greatly reduced.
         Out of the 13 people, four had died, and one was fighting the Black Panther in the distance. There were only eight people left.
         This series of changes caused a commotion in the crowd.
         The governor of Linjiang was also a little solemn. He looked at the few of them and wanted to retreat.
         However, he was also worried that if he retreated now, he would become a target for these people.
         "Earth overturning sword, demonic sword ... They really live up to their names!"
         The governor of Linjiang was extremely solemn as he spoke again,""If that's the case ... Then let's end this matter here ..."
         The eight powerhouses, except for him, didn't say anything.
         At this moment, all of them turned pale with shock.
         How could Li Hao kill a late-stage Sunglow realm expert in an instant? and where did that dog come from?
         The previous idea of exhausting a few people to death had been miscalculated.  At this moment, everyone was somewhat regretful.
         At this time, a strong expert sent a message,""You can still win by joining forces and going all out. Don't you want the Li family's divine sword and the wind chasing boots, mom? With a few dead, there will be fewer people to split the loot!"
         They were the experts from stupa mountain.
         It was obvious that the attacks from Li Hao and the others didn't scare him.
         He still wanted to try!
         The premise was that the two powerhouses in the transformation stage were willing to fight with all their might.
         ……
         At this moment, Li Hao heard a voice.""Li Hao, Hong Yitang will deal with the two metamorphosing experts. I'll deal with the three at the peak of the rising light Stage ... And I'll leave the three at the late stage of the rising light Stage to you ... Can you handle them?"
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com The sound of the light sword.
         She was awake, but her injuries were probably still very serious. At this moment, Li Hao needed to stop or kill the three late-stage rising light experts.
         Li Hao's eyes flickered, and he sent a voice transmission.
         I'll try it!
         As for whether it would work, who knew.
         It wasn't a swordsman's style to always defend and passively fight back.
         The next moment, the three of them reached an agreement.
         Just as the crowd was hesitating whether to retreat or continue ... A sword light flashed!
         BOOM!
         The three of them didn't even give them a chance to discuss or retreat.
         Hong Yitang was even more excited now. He couldn't help but curse,""A bunch of grandsons. If it wasn't to protect the two of them ... I would've killed a few of them to my heart's content!"
         He was not a Saint!
         Back then, in order to get some clones of the blood God, he had personally killed the butchers in the central region. Li Hao felt that he was kind ... But Li Hao had been blind.
          A sword was struck out!
         The world spun. In the blink of an eye, Linjiang's Governor and the commander of the Wang family were swept into a sealed space. Hong Yitang was extremely fierce."The two of you will fight me today. Either you die, or ... I die!"
         Buzzzzzz!
         The sword Qi cut through the air. The two men's faces changed dramatically. They couldn't hide anything anymore. A powerful force burst out. The governor of Linjiang used a saber and Qian Feng used a spear. Both of them were origin divine weapons, and their strength was more powerful than before.
         In the blink of an eye, the three of them caused the sea to collapse and the sea to roar.
         Not far away, the Sword of Light's face was still pale. With a swing of her sword, the world was lit up. Her expression was cold."Black Widow, a pirate from the North Sea, and a guy from stupa mountain ... Don't even think about leaving!"
         Cheng Yue, who had been hiding her identity all this while, spoke with a serious tone,""Light sword, how much longer can you use your power ... We've already decided to retreat, but you're still so persistent ..."
         "Black Widow, have you forgotten who we are?"
         I didn't forget!
         In an instant, the orange moon exploded with a deafening boom. It was as if thousands of Spider threads had burst forth, piercing through the void. Of course, she hadn't forgotten. As a Silver Moon Martial Master, she knew how these people worked.
        
         Who would have thought that in the blink of an eye, these people would turn the tables?
         Thousands of Spider threads pierced through the void as Black Widow shouted,""Her injuries haven't healed yet, kill her!"
         The remaining two people quickly attacked, both of them were ruthless.
         The moment the three of them joined forces, a gap appeared in the light sword technique.
         It was at this moment that orange moon let out a roar and rose into the air. She once again unleashed thousands of spider web-like sword techniques as if she wanted to kill the light sword. However, in the next moment, they suddenly scattered in all directions.
         The Black Widow took to the air and disappeared from its original spot.
         As a Silver Moon Martial Master and one of the thirty-six heroes, she had her own way of survival, even though some people said that her ranking was a bit superficial and that she relied on her beauty.
         When earth overturning sword and the others chose to counterattack, she knew that her previous good opportunity was gone!
        This chapter upload daily at NovelBin.com After all, this group of people were not on the same side. They were not willing to contribute under the infighting. Now that they were being defeated one by one, how could they still have a chance?
         She chose to escape!
          In an instant, she disappeared from everyone's sight.
         The light sword, on the other hand, frowned slightly, as if it had anticipated her choice. After glancing at Earthcover sword and Li Hao, who were not far away, she did not pursue them. Instead, she slashed at the two peak sunrise sword experts, who were pale with shock.
         The two of them were about to go crazy!
         The Black Widow ... Had actually escaped in an instant!
         ……
         On Li Hao's side.
         Of the three late-stage sunrise realm experts, one was from Yama and one was from Fei Tian. Li Hao didn't know the other, but he could easily recognize the other.
         At this moment, Li Hao didn't care about what was happening in other directions.
         With a sword strike, the five Forces fused together. The three powerhouses also rose up to resist, and the rumbling sounds continued!
         In a one-on-three battle, Li Hao was obviously not as good.
         However, Li Hao didn't care about this. He wasn't afraid of getting injured, or even losing an arm or a leg. The catkin sword in his hand was like a large net that enveloped the three of them, not giving them any chance to escape.
         The sword moves were soft and continuous, and the three of them also counterattacked madly, letting out violent roars.
         At this moment, the sword light swept across the North Sea!
         Among the three swordsmen, Li Hao was the weakest, but his swordsmanship was also the sharpest. It seemed soft, but each move was fatal.
         Hong Yitang, on the other hand, was as majestic as ever. He suppressed the two powerhouses in the transformation stage and forced them to retreat.
         Linjiang's Governor-General's roar resounded in all directions,"Hong Yitang ... You dare to kill me? If I die Here, you won't be able to bear the consequences!"
         BOOM!
         The sword strike came crashing down, nearly causing the other party to explode. Fan Chang roared once more and madly slashed out with his saber. As for the other person, he also swept his spear across the heavens and earth, not saying much.
          At this moment, any threat or intimidation was meaningless.  Fan Chang had been in a high position for a long time and had forgotten all this.
         These Silver Moon martial masters didn't care about such things, and they didn't even interact much with others.
         Silver Moon martial masters would only talk to the corpses after they had finished killing.
         Three, no, four battlefields.
         The first to end the battle was the light sword.
         The radiant sword Qi swept across the sky. With a loud buzzing sound, the Grand Duke of the peaceful sea was killed on the spot.
         The powerhouse from stupa mountain could not help but roar,""I'm the brother of the stupa Mountain Master ..."
         His elder brother was the mountain Lord of Buddha sacred mountain!
         He was one of the top experts in the world.
         The Sword of Light slashed down, and with a boom, the opponent's head was crushed. With a cold voice, he said,""Stupa Mountain Master? I think I should know him. He's the guy who called himself King stupa, right? Yuan Shuo broke Silver moon's arms, shaved his head, and hung him near Silver moon's boundary stone. I thought he was dead, but he's still alive ... That Yuan Shuo guy always leaves some trouble behind!"
         Unfortunately, the person in front of him was already dead, and he could no longer hear it.
         In the distance, Li Hao took advantage of this opportunity. In the moment of distraction and panic, the three experts slashed out with their golden sword force. With a loud boom, they tore the elder of Fei Tian into pieces!
         With a backhand punch, like a Roaring Tiger, a Giant Tiger appeared and swallowed one person directly. The other person was extremely frightened and instantly fled. Just as he escaped into the void, the Sword of Light came at him!
         With a plop, it pierced through the heavens and earth, nailing that person to death in the void!
         In the distance, the two powerhouses in the transformation stage were shocked.
         At this moment, fan Chang's eyes turned gloomy. Just as Hong Yitang slashed out, fan Chang suddenly threw out something. The moment this thing appeared, it exploded with a loud bang!
         The powerful explosive force caused the seawater in all directions to disappear instantly, forming a huge hole.
          As for fan Chang, he continuously vomited blood and took the opportunity to escape.
         There was only gloominess in his eyes.
         The treasure was gone.
         He had obtained it from a ruin. According to the information on it, it was an extremely powerful bomb passed down from the past. It was an energy bomb. It was said that it had killed countless experts during the ancient civilization.
         He had once obtained three of them and used two of them. Each time, he had killed a top-tier expert.
         But today ... It was only used to escape.
         As expected, even though the bomb was extremely powerful, at this moment, a sword radiance shot out from the core of the bomb in the sea. With a pfft, it directly cut off one of fan Chang's arms.
         As for fan Chang, he didn't even turn his head. It was as if it wasn't his own arm that had been chopped off, and he immediately disappeared on the spot.
         As the governor, he knew the gains and losses.
         The other expert from the Pingyuan Palace was also affected by the bomb. He was seriously injured and spat out blood. He looked in the direction where fan Chang had escaped and sighed. This bastard ... If they continued to fight, Hong Yitang would not be in a good state even if he lost.
