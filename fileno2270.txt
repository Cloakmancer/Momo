At the same time.Li Hao's spiritual power spread out.Very soon, his spirit jolted.In the next moment, it seemed to have entered a person's body. He knew that it should be the shadow of the sword venerable. It was the same last time. As expected, when he looked down, there seemed to be another starry sky sword in his hand.However, today was different.This place used to be very quiet.But today, this place was very noisy. The rumbling sounds continued!In the distance, an ancient city stood tall. A book of the great path was suspended in the air, enveloping the ancient city. It was the star River City, the city that Zhang an had seized.At this moment, the ancient city and a bright moon clashed in the vast universe.They collided with each other!In the distance, a gate stood still in the universe. It was the Stargate!Under the Stargate, a figure sat cross-legged like an ancient statue. He did not interfere in the battle between the Silver Moon and the ancient city, but just watched silently.When Li Hao's spiritual energy seeped over, the shadow suddenly looked over.He seemed to be smiling faintly.The seal was no longer peaceful. Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ Li Hao also opened his eyes and saw the ancient city, the Stargate, the Silver Moon, and even a deathly silent ancient city in the distance. It was sword city!It seemed like Zhang an had failed to take down Silver Moon!Not only that, the Silver Moon seemed to be a little abnormal. It flickered with light and attacked again and again as if it wanted to rush to the seal and escape.It had been a month!Li Hao thought to himself,"Zhang an has been here for a month, but he has failed to take down Silver Moon ... More importantly, Silver Moon is part of the seal. Logically, the red moon sovereign should not just sit by and do nothing, but help Zhang an and the others."The enemy of my enemy is my friend.He should not have just stood there and watched, but rather wished that Silver Moon would be taken away.The entire seal was divided into eight directions, and there were phantoms in all directions. However, except for The Phantom of venerable sword, the other directions seemed very weak. Red Moon Thearch sat cross-legged in the center of the seal and just watched.At the same time, light flickered on the Silver Moon. At times, it would be silver, and at other times, it would be another color. It was slightly gloomy and cold.The two rays of light crossed each other, and there was even a red power that was spinning within.BOOM!With another loud noise, the shadow that Li Hao possessed trembled slightly. Li Hao frowned. The battle between the two sides seemed to be weakening the power of the seal.At this moment, Zhang an's voice reverberated,""If you continue to fight, the seal will break ... Is that the result you want to see?"At this moment, a voice came from the Silver Moon, which was filled with resentment and coldness.""You want to take my original body, can't this King resist?"Li Hao was stunned!In the next moment, his heart moved. No way?This guy ... Is he really that bad?He was in a daze. This voice, this tone ... Why did it sound so much like the Queen's voice?The Queen ... Isn't the moon goddess, right? He was a little confused. If the Queen wasn't the moon goddess ... Could they be twins?Or ... The disappeared Queen had somehow entered the seal?Zhang an's tone was as calm as ever.""Is this your original body?""Why not?"The woman's voice sounded again, with a little coldness,""I am the moon goddess, the moon goddess is me! Everyone in the world acknowledges it. If you don 't, Who Do You Think You Are?"“……”This ... Is the Queen?This time, Li Hao was stunned. After a while, he understood.The Queen had really sneaked in!You have some ability!This big-breasted brainless B * stard had sneaked into the seal without me knowing. More importantly, he had actually ... Actually taken over Silvermoon and blocked Zhang an's plan, seizing Silvermoon's true body!Even if not all of the silver moons were here, they were still a portion of them.This ... He really had some ability!Did I underestimate you?Li Hao was surprised, but Zhang an felt a headache coming on. He was really ... Helpless!The plan was perfect!The truth was cruel and cruel. He was about to succeed, but suddenly, a rock appeared in his way. He had even helped the other party and almost destroyed the mark that belonged to the moon goddess.In the end, she was taken advantage of!He could only smile bitterly.If it were not for the fact that he had almost destroyed the moon goddess's Mark, and that there was only a little bit left, this woman would not have been able to take over Silver Moon. However ... It just so happened that she had entered and taken over the moon goddess's body!He knew who she was. She was the Queen of the West ...He was also very surprised. He didn't know how the other party had sneaked in, but Li Hao hadn't killed him. Li Hao really couldn't have done it!Now, the other party had seized the Silver Moon.The power of the Silver Moon was still extremely powerful.The number one deity in the world!In the past, even the sword Saint was unable to destroy the other party. The other gods were at the level of Saints ... The Saints of the past!This Moon Goddess must have been a top-tier Heavenly King back then.Even though he wasn't using his full power now, he had the power of a Saint after taking over the Silver Moon. Furthermore, it was the top-notch kind. He actually couldn't take down the other party in a short time.Just as Zhang an was having a headache.All of a sudden, the red moon Emperor, who had been quiet all this while, spoke,""Li family's descendant, since you've come, why don't you show yourself?"Both sides were stunned.At this moment, the virtual shadow of the sword Saint trembled.Li Hao immediately broke away from the shadow and condensed his appearance.He stood in the void and bowed politely,""I am Silvermoon Li Hao. Greetings, venerable sovereign!"

The venerable sovereign standing under the Stargate also raised his eyebrows and chuckled.""Greetings!"Interesting!He had seen this person the last time, but he was not as calm as he was now.Li Hao ignored Zhang an and the Queen. He only looked at the Stargate in the distance. The Stargate was boundlessly huge, as if it had pierced through the universe ... But in fact, it had really pierced through the universe.The red moon sovereign was right in front of the door.Li Hao walked forward in the air and said,""This time, junior has come to ask for advice on a matter. I hope senior will not be stingy with your advice!""What's the matter?""The moon goddess herself is not here," Li Hao chuckled."You should know that, venerable sovereign, right?""How so?" the venerable sovereign laughed."If the venerable sovereign still doesn't know, then he's too stupid. Even I know, so how could the venerable sovereign not know?"Red Moon sovereign laughed again."That makes sense. So what if you know?""I know," Li Hao said softly."Then I'll have to ask you something. How can I Kill the Moon goddess herself?"“……”In the distance, a figure appeared on the Silver Moon.He still held his scepter and looked at Li Hao coldly without saying a word.Li Hao didn't even look at her. He just stared at the venerable sovereign and said,""The moon goddesses should be closely related to the Silvermoon world, and they're very difficult to kill! I'm not talking about that. Please give me some advice, venerable sovereign. After all, the other party has suppressed the venerable sovereign for many years. If I kill him, it can also vent your anger!""You're very interesting!"Red Moon sovereign laughed,"it's very difficult!" She ... Could be considered the core of the Silver Moon world. In other words, if her mark had not been destroyed by the sword Saint, she would have been the Heaven's Will ... However, she was destroyed and fell into silence, causing the Heaven's Will to be Reborn!""If you want to kill her, it's as difficult as ascending to the heavens. She's almost immortal!"Li Hao thought for a moment and nodded,"that's true!" What if this second generation Moon Goddess uses half of her original body to replace her? is there any hope?""You actually have such thoughts ... Interesting." Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ Li Hao smiled."The moon goddess is immortal because she exists in the world. Billions of people still remember her, and as long as they remember her, she's alive ... If the moon goddess in everyone's hearts is gone, will she still live?""I don't know about that. I've never tried it before."Red Moon sovereign smiled."There's one more thing," Li Hao said."Sword city is empty now. Can you send me there, venerable sovereign?""This originally belonged to the Li family. If you want to take it ... Then just take it!" Li Hao said regretfully,"forget it. It seems that even the empty sword city has some suppressing effect. If I take it away, the venerable sovereigns will come out. I'll be the sinner of the world."After saying that, Li Hao looked at Zhang an and the Queen and said with a smile,""The two of you are fighting right under the venerable sovereign's nose. Aren't you afraid that the venerable sovereign will be dissatisfied and disturb your peace?""Your Majesty, you're truly blessed after surviving a great disaster!" Director Zhang is at the peak of the Saint realm, a quasi-Heavenly King, and can even fight against Heavenly Kings ... In the end, he's actually evenly matched with you. I've worked so hard to cultivate, but it's not even as good as what you can get ... I'm really envious!""Of course, the Queen should also thank me for trapping the true Moon Goddess for a month and giving you a chance. How about giving me some face ... The two of you stop now ..."The Queen sneered,"Li Hao, do you think it's still the same as before?."And now, I have taken over Silvermoon's original body!His combat strength had instantly reached an extreme!What face do you have to speak of?Li Hao laughed, Your Majesty ... You're really too proud! Do you really think that director Zhang can't take you down? He was only worried that the seal would break if the battle got too intense. He should not get carried away! Otherwise, the book of Dao wouldn't be for defense, but for attack! If I were Division Chief Zhang, this woman would be lawless. I'll teach her a lesson and let her understand that even if there's an unexpected gain, it's not a reason for her to be lawless!""Hehe!" Zhang an also smiled and looked at Li Hao."The venerable sovereign is here. He doesn't dare to move!"The Queen's expression changed for a while before she suddenly said,""Li Hao, if you help me kill the real Moon Goddess ... I can stop and even help you!""Forget it, I don't need a pig-like teammate. You're too stupid!"Li Hao shook his head and thought, a useless teammate at the peak of the Saint realm is even more difficult to deal with than an enemy of a Heavenly King! Whoever you work with will be unlucky, and I don't want to touch your bad luck!""Li Hao!"Although the Queen had already seen through many things, she still couldn't stand Li Hao's humiliation. She was furious!How detestable!Do you think this is still the same as before?My current combat strength has surpassed yours!Li Hao had no interest in them. He looked at the Stargate and suddenly said,""Senior venerable sovereign, if I can open the Stargate, can you leave directly? Leave the Silvermoon world...You can go anywhere, and I won't have to worry about you anymore. "Red Moon sovereign was stunned. After a while, he chuckled and said,""You can 't! Don't listen to their nonsense. After the Stargate is closed, there's almost no hope of opening it again, unless you control the Silvermoon world ... Even the starry sky sword can't open it!"So that was how it was!Li Hao looked around and into the distance as he spoke. This place, the vast universe, seemed to be very empty. Other than the Stargate, sword city, Galaxy city, Silver moon's main body, and red Moon Emperor, there seemed to be nothing else.At this moment, he was walking in one direction, a corner of the eight trigrams.

2272 Chapter 380
The Hong family!Just as he was about to go over, the venerable sovereign's voice suddenly sounded,""Descendant of the Li clan, what are you doing here?"At this moment, the voice was a bit illusionary, and Li Hao's mind was somewhat frozen.Her footsteps slowed down slightly.It was as if he had been interrupted by the other party, just like the first time he came here!At this moment, the three characters in his mind started to shine.The words 'heaven-battling Dao' were shining.Li Hao had an idea.There might be a problem with the Hong family.This was also the purpose of this trip. Of course, one of the purposes was to check on Zhang an and the others.He looked in that direction for a while and did not move forward."I'm here to ask the venerable sovereign if there's any good way for me to kill Zheng Yu. I want to be the venerable sovereign's last opponent, not these guys ... What do you think, venerable sovereign?""That's a good idea,"Red Moon sovereign nodded and smiled,""However, that Zheng Yu isn't weak. Now that I've been sealed for many years, my strength has been lost, and there's no power of the Crimson Moon to make up for it here. Even if I walk out personally ... I'm not sure if I can kill him! Why don't you think of a way to break the seal? perhaps ... I still have a chance to kill him!"Li Hao seemed to be thinking.At this moment, in the star River City, an unfamiliar Saint expert suddenly shouted,""Li Hao, as a descendant of venerable the sword, you can't listen to this man's nonsense and lose the face of venerable the sword!"Li Hao didn't need to look to know who that person was. He was probably a Saint of the Zhang family, an expert from dingtian city.Zhang an slightly raised his hand and interrupted the man.Zhang an knew Li Hao ... Although he was young, he had a strange mind. How could he easily do such a thing?At this moment, the battle in the seal seemed to have stopped with Li Hao's arrival. Everyone was waiting to see his reaction, as if Li Hao was more difficult to deal with than a venerable sovereign.In fact, Li Hao was the weakest among them. Everyone else was here in person, while he was only a wisp of mental power.Li Hao smiled."I know. I wouldn't dare to let a venerable sovereign out. The strength of a venerable sovereign is unparalleled!" I'm a mere Dao integration cultivator. I'm just courting death by letting a venerable sovereign out!""I don't have any other intentions in coming here. I just want to advise everyone not to fight each other and live in peace. I also want to visit the venerable sovereign. As a cultivator of the new era, the venerable sovereign is like heaven in my eyes ... It's a great honor to be able to see the true face of a venerable sovereign!" "And ... Director Zhang is probably fine. Your Majesty, you can look for me when you get out. The venerable sovereign left a lot of Crimson Moon Power in your body. I'll help you get rid of it ... It's too strong!""You ..." The venerable sovereign chuckled."You ... Why do you like to do such unlikable things?"Li Hao chuckled."Then I'm sorry, Your Majesty. After all, Her Majesty is not very clear-headed, and I'm afraid she'll cause me trouble ... She wants to deal with the real Moon Goddess now. I'm not afraid if she wants to deal with me, but I'm really afraid if she wants to deal with my enemy! I'm afraid that she's going to give benefits to the real Moon Goddess...Sigh!"“……”In the distance, the Queen's face was ashen!This was probably the greatest humiliation!Li Hao wasn't afraid to deal with Li Hao, and he was even happy about it. However, if he were to deal with the true Moon Goddess ... He would be worried!This ... Was this something a human could say?"Li Hao!""Don't think that I'm still the same old me ..."The Queen's voice was extremely cold.Li Hao rolled his eyes and said,"I know you're still the same old you because you can't see yourself clearly." I've never treated you as an enemy. The more you hate me, the happier I am. The less you hate me ... The more I worry! I hope you will continue to hate me! It's better for me to deal with the real Moon Goddess myself. I'll thank you if you don't give me any trouble!" After he finished speaking, he looked around and took one last look at the sword city in the distance. He smiled and said,""Alright, I've finished reading and the small talk is over. Seniors ... I'll take my leave first! In addition ..." Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ He looked at Zhang an and said,"director Zhang, you should quickly become a Heavenly King!" Maybe he's on a new path ... But it's not impossible to surpass the limit. I'll restore heaven and earth as soon as possible so that heaven and earth can accommodate the Heavenly King ... Without becoming a Heavenly King, the future will be very difficult!"After saying that, he turned around and walked away. In an instant, he merged with the illusionary shadow of the sword Saint and disappeared.At this moment, the world was silent.At this moment, be it Zhang an or the Queen, both of them suddenly lost interest in fighting. Zhang an laughed and said,""Since that's the case ... I won't force you, but ... You should take care of yourself. Just as Li Hao said, Silvermoon's main body is very complicated! It's been hanging here for 100000 years. Although I've removed a lot of impurities with the book of Dao, there are still many things hidden in it ... Don't do anything rash!"As soon as he finished speaking, he rode the ancient city and headed straight for the seal.His goal in entering the seal this time was to seize the Silver Moon, but Li Hao's appearance ... Dispelled some of his plans.After Li Hao left, Star River City began to merge with the seal and disappear.The venerable sovereign seemed to want to move. The apparition of venerable the sword, which had been quiet, suddenly attacked. The venerable sovereign frowned slightly and struck out with his palm. The sound of thunder resounded in the world. He glanced at the seal and frowned slightly, but did not say anything.The Queen's expression changed.At this moment, the venerable sovereign suddenly said,""Are you going to leave by the original path or by the seal?"

2273 Chapter 380
The Queen's expression changed!"If you're not leaving, are you going to stay here and chat with me?" the venerable sovereign asked indifferently. Silvermoon is the core of the Silvermoon world. Although the world barrier is strong, it won't be able to trap Silvermoon's true body. "The Queen gritted her teeth."Why don't you destroy me? they're all gone now. The mark on the Silver Moon is almost gone. It's not like before. You might be able to destroy me ..."The venerable sovereign chuckled."You're very interesting. When you get out, say hello to those guys for me!"With a wave of his hand, the Silver Moon rolled and disappeared without a trace, as if it had pierced through the world!After they left, Red Moon sovereign laughed,""Killing you ... Why would I do that?"How interesting!Perhaps Li Hao can use you to fish out the moon god and kill her!You're just a mere peak Saint, and you suddenly obtained power ... Who would care?After chasing everyone away, he looked at the corner of the eight trigrams in the distance.Just now, Li Hao seemed to have wanted to go over and take a look.He fell into deep thought, and his thoughts flashed. He smiled and sat down cross-legged again, no longer thinking about it.Li Hao ... Did he come for this?……At the same time. A bright moon suddenly appeared in the sky and then disappeared.At that moment, Ming Yue turned into a Queen and disappeared with some anger.On the other side, a bright moon also appeared quietly. In the temple, the statue suddenly sighed,""Being trapped for a month is really ... A disaster! Do you think Li Hao did it on purpose?"The man with the sword said softly,"maybe!" The second-generation successor taking away the rest of Silver moon's body is indeed a problem ... The point is, her brain has always been bad, and this time, she actually managed to sneak into the ruins. Don't you think ... This is retribution?"He really had nothing to say!He couldn't help but laugh,"really ... Li Hao, Zhang an, and the venerable sovereign of Red Moon are all helping her to get the silver Moon!" It seems that you and I have become public Enemies!""Think of a way to quickly recover this part. Otherwise ... I'm afraid I'll really be killed by her!" The moon goddess sighed.The sword-bearing man nodded slightly."That's true ... We're not afraid of the enemy being powerful. We're only afraid of our own people ... Who are more terrifying than the enemy!"Everyone was very depressed about the Queen.If the enemy was strong, they could just fight.The so-called "one's own people are too much of a burden ..."They were worse than the enemy!As she was speaking, the moon goddess statue suddenly felt a little pained and helpless.""This ... Idiot!"At this moment, a vast amount of faith energy was once more lost.At this moment, a bright moon suddenly rose up in the Silver Moon world, and a majestic voice resounded through the world,""I'm the moon god, undying and imperishable! The believers of the divine Kingdom, the believers of the world, the demon took half of my body and deliberately tarnished my reputation. You're all demons, colluding with Li Hao's generation!""From now on, the name Moon Goddess no longer exists! As the times change, I travel the world in the name of the God of heaven ... If the moon god appears again, she will be the moon Demon! The demonic flame is arrogant, so I'll cleanse the world of the demonic flame and return the world to clarity!"As soon as she finished speaking, a bright moon shone over the world, and a beautiful figure shot into the void.At this moment, it was as if a real God had descended into the world!At this moment, it was as if everything that had happened before was the doing of the moon Demon, and had nothing to do with the Empyrean God today.The few remaining temples in the divine Kingdom region suddenly began to collapse.Countless statues crumbled in an instant.At this moment, some of the believers who still had some hope were suddenly overjoyed!So that was how it was!The moon goddess from before was actually a demon!No wonder he kept failing and even gave up his God Country.It turned out that the real moon goddesses had only appeared today ... No, it wasn't moon goddesses anymore, it was sky goddesses!……"Hahaha!"At this moment, even Li Hao, who had just appeared, couldn't help but burst into laughter. The Queen ... Seemed to have gained intelligence?Was the real Moon Goddess in pain, as if she had just eaten shit?She had done so many things to embarrass the celestial capital, and now ... The Queen had thrown all of them away, making the moon goddess the scapegoat. She, on the other hand, had a clean reputation, and now, she had changed her appearance and become a celestial!This is so interesting!In the eyes of the believers, the moon goddesses were the moon demons who insulted the gods. In the eyes of the believers, gods were invincible and would not be defeated again and again. All the mistakes were made by the moon demons!……At this moment, the moon in the sky trembled slightly.The man with the sword sighed and shook his head.He really ... Fell into the latrine pit!Second generation, I don't know who she learned this from, but she's learned how to throw away her avatar. Since the moon goddesses 'reputation is no longer useful, then I'll just throw it away. Now that she's become an Empyrean God, the true Moon goddesses are actually feeling bad.If one day, his reputation as a heavenly God was gone, he could just change to another identity.……At the same time, many people were extremely surprised.Ying Hongyue, Zheng Yu, and the others couldn't help but laugh.After being tormented by the Queen, even if the moon goddesses really stood out and said that she was the real ... Who would believe it?The prestige of a God would only be further lost!……Li Hao didn't do anything else.He didn't care about anyone, and he was just waiting for something in the Silver City.Zheng Yu had only stared at him for a day, and the next day, Hurricane city had disappeared. The current Li Hao would no longer intentionally destroy the seal. This was the conclusion Zheng Yu had come to. It was useless to continue staring at Li Hao!After three days, Li Hao suddenly opened his eyes. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  He looked into the distance.A shadow flashed and disappeared.He didn't chase after her.Soon, Li Hao landed on a broken ruin. At this moment, a huge seal and a hammer were placed on the ground. Hong Yitang frowned slightly and sent a message,""Really?"Would a person like Ying Hongyue easily hand over something?It was unbelievable!"It's true!"Li Hao nodded and said telepathically,"he doesn't need this for now. It'll be best if he can send me into the seal. If he can't ... These two things aren't easy to get, especially the Hong family's hammer! Once he fuses with the starry sky sword, there might be some changes ... It's hard to say if the starry sky sword might even be seized by him!""You ..." Hong Yitang's head hurt."I'm exhausted from watching you guys fight and scheme against each other!""It's endless fun to fight with others!"Li Hao laughed."Wouldn't it be boring if they were all idiots? It's actually very interesting to pry into the truth from the tiniest of clues. In the past, I liked to study some dossiers, and I would often obtain some unexpected results ... It's a very interesting thing. ""Martial uncle, you can go back first. You just need to take a look at Zheng Yu. It's not of much use for you to follow me. It's enough to calm Zheng Yu's heart."Good fellow!I'm just a tool, right?Getting the God of beginner martial to bring me along, getting Zheng Yu to bring me along, so ... It's just to make everyone feel at ease?"You ...""I said it myself. You're not afraid. Since that's the case ... Take me to the seniors and let them know that I, Li Hao, have returned!""Haha ..." Hong Yitang laughed."Now that you mention it, it feels like I'm meeting your parents ..."Li Hao also grinned. It seemed ... That he was!At this moment, the Black Panther rolled its eyes.These two men were so disgusting!

2274 Chapter 381
(Do you still have double monthly votes? Vote one point, lalalalala!)Li Dynasty.Li Hao came again. This time, he was alone. He didn't even bring the Black Panther.The king of Dali was speechless when he saw Li Hao.Was he really alone?What happened to the deployment of troops?What happened to the group of Saints?This time, we're going to deal with an existence that might be the remains of the God of beginner martial arts. In addition, there's Ying Hongyue among them ... I'm really F * cking speechless. Just you and the two of us, can we deal with the other party?Let's send them to their deaths!"Li Hao!"The king of Dali couldn't help but ask, did he really come alone?"Don't panic!"Li Hao smiled brightly."Don't worry about me. I'm fine!" He said.Who's worried about you?I'm worried about myself!In this situation, wouldn't he be courting death if he went?The king of Dali was very pessimistic,"sigh!" Perhaps ... This King should not have placed too much hope on you!""You're goading me, aren't you?"Li Hao chuckled.“……”Who has the intention to provoke you?I'm being serious!He felt a little helpless and helpless ... Forget it, let's just take a gamble. If you, Li Hao, are not afraid of death, why should I be?"Are we just going there directly?""Of course not. We have to be careful. It's best if we can hide it from everyone ... Otherwise, if we're discovered, Ying Hongyue might do something. We'll be in trouble then!"Alright!The Dali King also felt that they should keep a low profile. In the group of three, Li Hao was considered strong, but he and Jiang Li were not. They were only at the seventh level of the sun Moon tier. If they really encountered a top-notch existence, they would be killed.The three of them quickly flew away.After the three of them left, a figure appeared in the temple. He looked at the three of them in confusion and then glanced at Li Hao a few more times ... Why did he feel that Li Hao was different from the Li Hao He had seen the first time?Strange!Of course, he didn't know enough about the new Dao. Perhaps he had improved again. His strength had indeed improved a lot. He was quite powerful. Even if he wasn't as powerful as the skeleton ... He shouldn't be too far off.With Jiang Li's bone of the initial stage of martial arts and the Overlord gauntlet of the Li Dynasty's King, there was still hope.Of course, there was only hope!Thinking to himself, he looked at the place where Li Hao had disappeared for a while ... But he still felt that it was a little uncoordinated. Could it be that something went wrong during his cultivation, resulting in the uncoordinated feeling?……At the same time that Li Hao and his men left ... In the forbidden Sea.Ying Hongyue's expression kept changing. After a long time, she suddenly opened her eyes and coldly snorted. "As expected, you still came!"I knew that you wouldn't give up so easily.In addition, this guy was extremely smart. He knew that this bastard would definitely come after him and the forbidden Sea!The Hong family's hammer was worth it!At this moment, his body trembled. A moment later, he merged into the forbidden Sea. In the depths of the sea, a white jade skeleton suddenly opened its eyes. It was slightly dazed. Ying Hongyue said softly,"What a pity ... I'm missing a few bones. It's not complete yet. But ... That Li Hao guy might send them to me!"Then, he frowned slightly.Li Hao ... How many people had come?If there were too many people, it would not be easy to deal with.This thought flashed through her mind, and soon, many figures appeared in the vicinity. Almost all of them were Saints, and there wasn't just one. There were several of them. Ying Hongyue frowned slightly."Scatter in all directions of the forbidden Sea. Don't gather here!""But ... If they really come, I'm afraid we won't be able to save them in time ..."p "It's fine!"Ying Hongyue said softly,"if we want to get the complete skeleton ... We'll need some time. If they appear all at once, will Li Hao still be able to come?" Go!"Several figures quickly disappeared.It was just that ... Ying Hongyue was still a little uneasy.He looked at the skeleton again ... Unfortunately, it wasn't complete. Of course, it might be complete after this time. The strength of this skeleton must have been terrifying when it was alive, not weaker than a half-step sovereign!If all the bones were gathered, perhaps ... He would have a chance to fight against a pseudo-Emperor.At that time, he would truly have the capital to resist everything."Li Hao ..."He mumbled,"you are good at scheming, but don't underestimate me. These days, you have been winning. It is my turn. Once I win, it will not be a small victory!"……At the same time.Near the source of the forbidden Sea, Li Hao stopped and covered the surroundings with his domain. He frowned slightly and said,""Something doesn't seem right ... The forbidden Sea hasn't moved at all ... Maybe the other party has some plans. Call more people over ... Wait for a while and gather all the neo martial sages!"The Dali King heaved a sigh of relief!'F * ck, you're finally afraid!'If I was really worried, you wouldn't be afraid. I'd just rush up. I was almost scared to death by you!Soon, a message was sent out.The three of them began to wait.Now, heaven and earth could accommodate Saints again. Not long after, the aura of Saints spread over. The king of Dali was overjoyed. More than one Saint had come. It seemed that Li Hao was going to get serious this time!……This moment seemed to be hidden.However, as soon as the Saints moved, almost all of Li Hao's Saints were in the spotlight. It didn't take long for someone to hear the news. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Hurricane city.Zheng Yu smiled and glanced at flying sword immortal.""It looks like ... Ying Hongyue's idea of refining the forbidden Sea will be very difficult to achieve! Li Hao had just come out of seclusion, and his strength had increased greatly. He was probably not weaker than an ordinary Heavenly King now! Of course, this was only a possibility ... But he was definitely very difficult to deal with! With the addition of a few new martial Saints, there will be a good show to watch!"

"Lord, should we interfere?" a Saint asked from behind.Zheng Yu thought for a while and smiled."Hurricane city is close to that side ... Don't get too close. We'll decide based on the situation. Moreover ... It's within the Li Dynasty. If you get too close, you'll easily cause some trouble!"Everyone was deep in thought, but they didn't say anything."He can match a Heavenly King?" the flying sword immortal suddenly asked."It's possible!"Zheng Yu raised his brows."Don't underestimate the prodigies of any era. If not, why would I keep targeting him?" It's precisely because this kind of person improves too quickly, and Li Hao is a meticulous person. He quickly determined that Ying Hongyue is refining the forbidden Sea ... If we don't stop her now, with the forbidden Sea, Ying Hongyue might really be able to display the battle prowess of a Heavenly King, and she'll be the only Heavenly King who can walk between heaven and earth ... This is the best time for Li Hao to make a move!"The flying sword immortal was silent for a moment."You know about it too, my Lord?""I can guess a thing or two ... I know very well what Li Hao has been doing these days!""This fellow wouldn't do something useless. He made a few trips to the Li Dynasty ... Isn't it just to deal with Ying Hongyue?" Zheng Yu said with a smile.The flying sword immortal was puzzled,'what does my Lord think? Shouldn't we join forces with Ying Hongyue to eliminate Li Hao?""No need."Zheng Yu drank a cup of tea and laughed."Just watch!",m "I'm not the only one ... At this moment, everyone is watching and also wants to see the end of the red moon!" Whether Ying Hongyue could turn things around or not would depend on this! It's not a bad idea to show how much you have!"Flying sword immortal didn't say anything else.Perhaps everyone would be happy to see Li Hao and Ying Hongyue's confrontation. In this era, there were only two overlords ... Yes, one was Li Hao, and the other was Ying Hongyue. As for people like the king of the Li Dynasty, they were actually not worth everyone's attention.And today ... The two of them might officially confront each other!Was it Li Hao who was slightly better, or was it Ying Hongyue who was astute?……At this moment, in the sky.Some people were also watching.The Silver Moon began to lean towards the North, crossing the Cang mountains.Although the moon goddess was angry, she also quieted down at this moment. In the temple, the situation in the Li Dynasty vaguely appeared, but ... It was very illusory, and she could only see a rough outline. It was very blurry."Is there really no way to investigate any more?""Is that beginner God ... Really that difficult to deal with?" the moon goddess asked softly."It's quite difficult to deal with!"The man with the sword smiled, then frowned.""These two guys chose to fight in the Li Dynasty. I'm afraid they are deliberately avoiding our eyes. In the Li Dynasty, with that guy there, neither me, Zheng Yu, nor Red Moon sovereign, who might have already infiltrated ... Can see clearly ..."Li Dynasty was a good place! In this confrontation, even if some of his trump cards were exposed, only the God of beginner martial in the Li Dynasty knew about it. As for the others, they actually could not see the details, but could only vaguely make out the situation.However, other places were fine. At that moment, yueshen said,""Heaven battling city's old turtle, little pagoda tree, Li Daozong, li Fuhai, and Redwood, even martial Union's Diamond Wood, have all gone there together ..."6 great saints!Including Li Hao, there were seven Saint-level experts."It's not just that!"  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  "Take a closer look!" The sword-carrying man laughed.Yueshen looked around but could not find anything. The man waved his hand and suddenly, a chaotic scene appeared. On the other side, Lin Hongyu, Hong Yitang, and black Panther were also hiding in the dark, just at the edge of the Cang Mountain.The moon goddess sighed."His understanding of the new Dao isn't deep enough. They almost managed to hide it. It seems that Li Hao is also very cautious ... There are more than Seven Saints. Including these three ... There should be ten in total. He's fighting with all his might!"The sword-bearing man nodded slightly.The three of them were so secretive that he almost didn't notice them. He had to admit that it was too difficult to control a new Dao at this stage.However ... The man with the sword on his back frowned slightly. He looked around again and said,""Didn't star River City come to watch the show?"After searching for half a day, they still found Star River City.However, after getting a little closer, the sword-carrying man didn't look at it anymore. A book of the great way was floating in the sky above the city. Under such circumstances, it was easy to be discovered.The star River City was also near the Cang mountains ... From the looks of it, they could make a move at any time.This was interesting!"Now, all of them have gathered ..."He laughed."It seems that everyone is very interested in the battle between the two prodigies of the new era. It can be considered the first official battle of the blood feud. Ying Hongyue killed Li Hao's entire family, and Li Hao killed a few of his wives, ruining his plans many times ... This time, it's the most interesting one in the past 100000 years!""It's not bad ..."The moon goddess agreed."She dares to come here?" he suddenly snorted.At this moment, an extremely luxurious figure suddenly appeared in the picture. He looked up at the sky, his eyes as bright as the moon. The picture instantly blurred.Seeing the second generation moon god ... The moon god's liver hurt!The man with the sword laughed."It's normal for her to be here. Experts from all over the world are heading here, so she can sense a thing or two. The battle of the forbidden Sea might have decided who the true Overlord of this era is!""Who do you think will win?"" 50 - 50!"The man with the sword laughed."They all have confidence and are very powerful. They are all powerhouses from this era who came from the weak. One of them is bold and dared to use his body as bait! One is young, impetuous, extremely talented, and born with Dao ... It's actually very normal ... Who can win!"

2276 Chapter 381
Yueshen stopped asking.For the entire Silvermoon to pay attention to this battle, these two could be considered to have truly reached the peak of this era.……At this moment, the king of Dali was getting more and more nervous!The sages began to gather.It gave him a lot of pressure.In the distance, the forbidden Sea seemed to be rolling. He didn't know if Ying Hongyue had discovered it or not. At this moment, he was very nervous, afraid that Ying Hongyue would discover it or that the forbidden Sea would run away!"Still not making a move?"He looked at Li Hao with a grave expression."No hurry!" Li Hao laughed.Still not in a hurry?The king of Dali cursed in his heart!This guy wasn't anxious when he should be, but he was more anxious than anyone when he shouldn't be. How annoying!Li Hao's expression changed.After a long time, he coughed."Let's wait a little longer. We'll make our move once it's dark!"Dark?To a strong person, it didn't matter whether it was day or night. Why did he have to feel like it was a ceremony?Surprise attack at night?What a ... Boring fellow!……At the same time.The universe of the great path.Star River mayfly!The Galaxy that had sunk into the depths of the universe suddenly turned into a human figure. He walked out from the depths of the universe and his voice resounded in all directions."Director Zhang!"His voice reverberated.The great Dao shook!A moment later, a star broke through the sky, and a human figure seemed to vaguely appear. It was slightly shaken and somewhat in disbelief!Li Hao?If Li Hao was here ... Then ... Who was Li Hao from the Li Dynasty?Li Hao's face was expressionless, and his voice was calm.""I will tear the void and enter the star River City! The book of Dao, you still have to cover for me!"The stars were bright, and there was silence for a moment.Li Hao didn't say anything.After a long time, the stars trembled, as if in response.Li Hao revealed a faint smile. The void in front of him split open, and an ancient city appeared. Above his head was a book of the great path.At this moment, Li Hao stepped into the air and instantly entered Star River City.At this moment, the people in the city were dumbfounded.Zhang an also arrived in an instant. He looked at Li Hao without saying a word, but his expression was full of doubt!The Li Dynasty ... Wasn't li Hao?However, the powerful aura and the dense power of a great Dao ... It was impossible that it wasn't li Hao.But who was Li Hao?   Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  And ... It made people a little afraid.Li Hao made a grabbing motion, and a mirror appeared out of thin air. Li Hao examined it and said,""Come with me!"Zhang an frowned slightly."Book of Dao, cover for me!" Li Hao said calmly.Zhang an frowned even more."Where are we going?""We'll know when we go!"At this moment, Li Hao was very domineering!Zhang an thought for a while and nodded. He was about to say something when Li Hao looked at the others and said calmly,""Everyone, this place will be sealed for a moment. No one is allowed to leave!""You!"Li Hao looked at the speaker and calmly said,""Director Zhang, can you do it?"Zhang an pondered for a while and nodded."Sure!""Activate the main city's formation. No one is allowed to enter or leave the city. Before I return ... Kill anyone who dares to barge out of the main city!"As soon as these words came out, everyone's expression changed slightly, and they no longer spoke.As for Zhang an, he also took out the book of Dao and a city Lord seal instantly floated in the air!In his hands, the city Lord seal was no weaker than the book of Dao. In an instant, an illusionary figure appeared. It was as if he was holding a pointer in his hand and stood in the void. However, everyone in the city instantly revealed looks of respect!Supreme martial artist!At this moment, even some of the gazes that were originally peeking at this side disappeared instantly. Whether it was the sword-carrying man, Zheng Yu, or the others, they all instantly withdrew their gazes!The shadow of a Supreme Being!In the hands of others, it was actually ordinary, but in the hands of a Supreme-being's grandson, he might be able to burst out with terrifying strength.At this moment, under the protection of the book of Dao, Li Hao and Zhang an disappeared in an instant.……The Li Dynasty was still quiet.They were waiting for the arrival of the night!Everyone was frighteningly quiet.At this moment, in the land of the Silver Moon, a man was walking in all directions underground. Zhang an looked around and said in a deep voice,""You've thought it through?""Yes,""You really want to go to the city of Thunder ... If it's as you said, there might be many Heavenly Kings there ...""Right! Therefore, no one would believe that I would appear there. Even senior Zhang didn't believe it, so who would?" Li Hao was extremely calm,"it's precisely because no one believed me ... Even Ying Hongyue didn't believe me that I had to appear there!" Charge into the city and annihilate them in one fell swoop! Heavenly King? So what if he was a Heavenly King? Now, without any awareness of defense, he thinks he is invincible. Although he can't come out, no one can go in!""It's just that a group of Heavenly Kings who became Heavenly Kings after being infected by the power of the Crimson Moon are all fake Heavenly Kings!""Even if there are many of us ... At this moment, we're defenseless and even in deep sleep, what's there to fear? In this battle, if we can annihilate them, cut off Hongyue's claws, cut off the venerable sovereign's arm, and cut off Ying Hongyue's arm ... I'll make him a real stray dog!"Zhang an didn't say anything, but ... He was a little sad.You're really F * cking crazy!His guts had really exploded!Li Hao was going to take him to Thunder City, which might have been completely occupied by the experts of the Crimson Moon world. There might be many Heavenly Kings there.This guy ... He's going to fight in the forbidden Sea on the surface, and I've taken it seriously. The whole world is looking forward to seeing his first official confrontation with Ying Hongyue.In the end ... He did not go!But ... Was that really not Li Hao?They were not blind. If it was someone else in disguise, they would have seen through it long ago. Of course, the other party was in the Li Dynasty now, so they could not see it clearly. However ... No matter how unreal it was, they could not be wrong about how strong he was.

2277 Chapter 381
"Can director Zhang deal with a Heavenly King?" Li Hao suddenly asked."The fake Heavenly King can ... But really can 't.""That's good. ""I didn't say I wanted to join the battle!" Zhang an could not help but say.You're making the decision for me?The two of us can't be considered as partners!"Then forget it!" Li Hao said calmly.“……”Zhang an was speechless.At this moment, Li Hao's eyes suddenly flickered. He smiled and said,""Over here!"Zhang an looked forward and saw that deep underground, even in the magma, there was a city floating silently, not moving at all. Not a single breath was leaked out.The Hong family's Thunder City was also known as the thunderstorm city.It was very quiet!It was as if there was no living person, as if it had long been dead. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt But at this moment, golden light flickered in Li Hao's eyes as he said softly,""There are many experts ... I can already feel the extremely dense power of the Crimson Moon. There will be many Heavenly Kings as well. Perhaps ... There will be no less than five!"Zhang an wanted to take a deep breath!Really?Even if he was a fake Heavenly King ... He was still a Heavenly King of this era. To be honest, he was extremely afraid of him.One is fine, he can fight!Two ... That would be troublesome!If there really were more than five ... He'd better run as far away as he could. If he stayed, he'd be beaten to death.Li Hao laughed,"so much Crimson Moon Power ... So much immortal power, Heavenly King Power ... So much energy!" If we take down this place, I can guarantee that a large number of experts will appear under my command! A treasure land!"Go to hell!Even a refined person like Zhang an wanted to curse at this moment!He always felt that ... When this fellow got crazy, he was even more than a human King.One Saint, no, two saints including himself, fighting a group of Heavenly Kings!This situation ... No one would believe him even if he told them.Li Hao racked his brains and came up with a bunch of smokescreens. Zhang an felt that even if he didn't come up with any, no one would believe that he would go to his lair in the world of the Crimson Moon.Of course, if they did, the unexpected factors would be reduced to the lowest."Can we sneak in without a sound?" Li Hao looked at Zhang an."Alright!" Zhang an thought for a while and nodded."I can barely do it!"Li Hao smiled. This is why I'm looking for you.The grandson of the Zhang clan's Supreme martial artist!Many of the formations actually originated from this Supreme martial artist. As his grandson and a true core member, he should be very familiar with these."After entering, each of you will find a Heavenly King ... Ambush and kill two of them ... Then, seal the city, pull it into the great path universe, and kill them all!""Heavenly King, do you think I'm a pig?" Zhang an couldn't help but ask."Could it be more powerful than a pig?""I don't believe it," Li Hao said softly."They haven't appeared for 100000 years and pose no threat. The Heavenly King can still maintain vigilance for 100000 years ... If he had this ability, how could he be so easily invaded by a venerable sovereign? Such a talent should be a strong person in new martial arts! "It's not that I'm looking down on them ... But don't compare a group of trash that has been eliminated from the new martial arts world to me and you. The grandson of a Supreme martial artist, the strong ones who have participated in the new martial arts battle, and me ... Are you and I inferior to trash that has been eliminated from the small worlds?"It was very crazy!But Zhang an listened and nodded. There was nothing wrong with it!After all, he was still the grandson of a Supreme martial artist! He was an existence that had fought alongside the human Emperor.As for Li Hao ... He didn't lack methods, wisdom, or strength. It was true that these people couldn't be compared to Li Hao. However, he was still not at ease."What level of strength are you at?""I don't know,""You ...""You're so wishy-washy!"Li Hao frowned slightly."As an expert in the early stage of neo martial realm, why are you so naggy?" he asked.'I ...'Zhang an was speechless."I'm just worried that you'll die. You ... You really make me speechless!"The two of them began to sneak into the city.……At the same time.Li Dynasty.The forbidden Sea.Ying Hongyue kept frowning. He still hadn't attacked?What was he waiting for?Li Hao ... Did you really think that I didn't notice you?The thought flashed through his mind, and he felt that something was wrong ... Strange!However, the Hong family's hammer was still on Li Hao.Many thoughts flashed through his mind. He looked at the beginner martial stage skeleton that was eager to try ... He frowned and quickly thought of something. After a long time, he shook his head. There should be no surprises, right?What accident could there be?Li Hao was here, and his people ... Were probably all here!Outside, Zheng Yu and that person in the sky were still keeping an eye on him. It could be said that the more famous Li Hao was, the more closely he would be watched!He couldn't get anything out of it!Of course, there was still a little uneasiness in his heart.,m ……At the same time.On the Cang Mountain side, the Queen looked coldly at the distant area, frowning and cursing in a low voice. What is Li Hao waiting for?Let this King see where you get your confidence from to be so arrogant and look down on everyone.If he couldn't even defeat Ying Hongyue ... That would be a joke!You can't even defeat the enemy who destroyed your family, and you have the right to laugh at me?At the very least, this King has won against the real Moon Goddess!……Hong family, Thunder City.The city was very quiet.Of course, there were still living people, and quite a few of them.His life was also quite comfortable.In the sky, a blood-colored moon could be vaguely seen, exuding some Crimson Moon Power.Similar to the other major cities, the city was huge, and the center of it was where the experts were located. At this moment, many of the residences in the city were open.At the edge of the city, there was a blood-red Tree. It was swaying, and there were many fruits on it. They exuded a sweet fragrance, which was particularly attractive.

2278 Chapter 381
What was different from the other main cities was that there was not much Origin Energy in Thunder City. It was almost all the power of the Crimson Moon.Almost all of the experts who were traveling outside were wearing red robes.There seemed to be more than just ancient people here. There were also some modern martial masters ...There were even some existences that had almost been forgotten, such as ... The Blue Moon of the seven moons. Several of the seven moons had died, leaving the red moon, Blue Moon, and purple Moon. It was said that the purple Moon had died in the Li Dynasty.Blue Moon had long disappeared.It wasn't just Blue Moon, there were also some other people here. At this moment, it seemed like someone was chatting about something."This time ... Many saints have left the city. I wonder if they can annihilate Li Hao!""Difficult!""The leader said that he might be heavily injured. Killing him ... Will be very, very difficult! As long as the great Dao universe still existed, this person would be difficult to kill! However, if everything goes smoothly, we might be able to kill a few Saints ..."“……”In a luxurious mansion, Blue Moon was chatting with some people, including some old people from the red moon.These people were all quite satisfied.He wasn't as down and out as he had imagined. On the contrary, when he mentioned Ying Hongyue, he was full of reverence and fanaticism. He seemed to trust Li Hao more than Martial Master Silvermoon did."Li Hao is just a clown! He will die in the hands of the leader sooner or later. If it wasn't for the fact that he wanted to use him to divert the attention of the Zheng and Li families, the leader would have killed him long ago!""Not bad! Li Hao thought that he had unified the world, but all his arrogance was just an illusion! It's just a pity that some people died ... However, for the sake of the leader's great ambitions, they died a worthy death and the world is United. There's still a chance for them to be resurrected!"“……”They discussed loudly. Although their voices were not loud, it was still loud in the empty city.The Red Tree outside the city was still swaying.His aura was extremely powerful.Compared to general Huai and the others, it was much stronger. It was almost at the same level as Zheng Hong Yuan. This was a Heavenly King Tree!In the city, there were several more of such auras.The entire city was like an iron wall!The auras of Saints, Immortals, and paragons could be felt everywhere in this city. There was no need to hide them, as it was very tiring to hide one's aura.Everyone knew this city well, so there was no need to do so.During this period, no one could take down this city.Yes, anyone!If Zheng Yu himself came out, there would still be a chance ... But if he couldn't come out, then there was naturally nothing to worry about. Who was Li Hao? Zhang Hao? did you dare to come in?Can you come in? You don't even know where this city is!On the big red Tree, a faintly discernible face appeared, with some satisfaction, greedily absorbing the power of the Crimson Moon that was scattered in the air. No one had expected that the entire Thunder City would become the base of the Crimson Moon! Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ This was the real base of the red moon organization, and also the real base of the red moon universe!As for the others, they were all just a smokescreen.Whether it was the earth glory that was left in the remains or Zheng Yu and the group of infected people, they were all just smokescreens.……​ At this moment, Li Hao had entered the city.Zhang an also entered the city.Not only had they entered the city, but the place they had appeared in ... Was extremely special. It was the city Lord's mansion!Moreover ... Not far away from them, the aura of a Heavenly King was overwhelming. Li Hao looked at Zhang an, but Zhang an didn't say a word. Why are you looking at me?The core of the formation is right here. There's nothing I can do even if I appear here.There were several Heavenly King auras around him.Once we're discovered and surrounded ... We'll be finished!At this moment, Li Hao cast a domain on himself. He glanced at Zhang an and said,""Can you tell?""Five Heavenly Kings, Saints ... There are actually 12 of them. It seems that not many have gone to the forbidden Sea ... And there are over 100 undying beings! There are many at the peak as well ... I didn't expect there to be a group of cultivators who are cultivating a new Dao. ""Yes, his ancient divine guards!"Li Hao, on the other hand, understood."The ancient divine guards are Ying Hongyue's elite forces back then. They were almost never exposed. Later on, too many people were transferred from the three major organizations. It seems that a portion of them appeared but died in battle ... Ying Hongyue is willing to do so, and she has her own methods. I can even sense the aura of several suns and moons!"In such a short period of time, she had nurtured quite a few sun and moon, as well as some mountain and sea ... Just for this, Ying Hongyue had paid a great price.Indeed, there were many Heavenly Kings.Five Heavenly Kings was not a small number.There were more than 10 Saints ... And more than 100 undyings!The power of the Crimson Moon covered the sky and earth. It could be said that even if a Heavenly King entered this place, he would be invaded by the power of the Crimson Moon and then besieged by five Heavenly Kings ... There was a high chance that he would not survive!Li Hao took a deep breath and said,'if you can't do it, find someone with the weakest aura to deal with! Out of the five Heavenly Kings, the one in the city Lord's mansion is quite powerful, and the tree outside the city is not weak either ... The remaining three are slightly weaker ... You choose one!"Zhang an was too lazy to pay attention to him, and he didn't sense it either. He just judged according to his aura and said,""I'll take care of the city Lord's mansion ... You can choose one at will ... Also, if you really succeed in killing it, do you have a plan on how to move the city into the great Dao universe?""Don't worry ... It's a small matter!"Li Hao laughed. At this moment, the two of them were so bold that they were still in the mood to chat with a group of experts.Zhang an glanced at him ... And sighed with emotion.

2279 Chapter 381
This little guy, whom he had played around with at Yuanping martial arts university, had really grown up, and at a frightening speed!Li Hao didn't speak anymore. He absorbed some power of the Crimson Moon and covered his body. The next moment, he walked out of the city, partly visible and partly hidden.He was going to cut down that tree!This Heavenly King Tree had stabilized Thunderbolt city. With this thing here, it would be difficult to move the city. Only by killing it would there be hope of successfully moving the city into the great path universe.As he walked, his body was covered in black armor.They were like the ancient divine guards!At the city gate, Li Hao did not bother to hide himself. He openly walked toward a tree in the distance. Not far away, a few ancient divine guards were walking around, but no one gave Li Hao a second look.Such audacity, it could not be said not to be crazy!Li Hao was confident that no one would care.To have someone in charge of such a safe place ... They really didn't take the Heavenly King seriously!With unhurried steps, Li Hao walked straight towards the sky King Tree. This was the first time he had seen a Sky King-ranked demonic plant, and ... Those red fruits were extremely alluring even from a distance!What kind of tree was this? This fruit ... What use does it have?Li Hao raised his head and looked at the incomparably tall tree with greed in his eyes. His gaze even fell on the face on the tree, but ... The other party didn't care.In this place, greed was normal.Under the influence of the Crimson Moon, everyone was extremely greedy!Not being greedy ... That would be a problem!The greedy Li Hao took another deep breath of the Crimson Moon and became even greedier. The giant tree thought, this little guy doesn't know what's good for him. It's not necessarily a good thing to absorb too much Crimson Moon Power and have too much desire.He still had to restrain himself.Of course, this had nothing to do with him!It didn't care what these weaklings did. If they wanted to absorb it, they could. If they couldn't control their greed ... Then they would just die.Seeing that the other party was walking towards him ... The big tree laughed in his heart. He was too greedy. Was he going to pick the fruit?This had happened more than once since these people had entered.The previous few times ... These people had all become her nourishment. Even if Ying Hongyue knew about it, she couldn't do anything about it. Moreover, Ying Hongyue wouldn't care about this. If she couldn't control her inner greed and was killed by the big tree, then she would die in vain!A few of the ancient God guards noticed him. Some frowned, and some wanted to give him a warning, but when they saw him, they immediately ran toward the tree. The branches swayed, and the red fruit began to emit a fragrant aroma ....The ancient God guards immediately left.This fragrance was also a form of temptation.It was obvious that the tree had also discovered Li Hao and was trying to tempt him into eating fresh blood.At this moment, no one cared about Li Hao. If he died, he died.As for Li Hao, he could barely suppress the red light in his eyes!He looked at the big tree with great greed ... Good tree!The tree of the Heavenly King!The fruit of the Heavenly King!In the neo martial era, there weren't many big trees at the Heavenly King level, right?"Can this fruit ... Be eaten? What's the use of it?"Li Hao muttered.The giant tree's voice was gentle as it said,""This fruit is called the heavenly fragrant fruit! Eating one pill would prolong one's life and permanently maintain one's appearance! If you eat two, you'll be immortal and have endless lifespan! If he ate three, he would become a peak mortal and reach the heavens in one step! It takes 30000 years to bloom, 30000 years to bear fruit, 30000 years to ripen, and it only ripens once every 90000 years. Now, 100000 years have passed since the Silver Moon closed, and this is the first time it has ripened, bearing 99 fruits ... Do you ... Want to eat it?"The giant tree's voice was filled with temptation."If you eat 99 pills, it won't be difficult to become a saint in a day!"The stronger the desire, the more delicious the food!He was talking about Li Hao, not the fruit."A Saint in a day? Then, if you eat the entire tree ... Can you become a Heavenly King?"The giant tree was stunned for a moment. I've seen people with strong desires who couldn't wait to eat my fruits. In my life, this is the first time I've heard someone ask if one can become a Heavenly King if they eat me as well.This ... What kind of greed was this! It was unbelievable that there was such a greedy person in the ancient divine guards!"Perhaps ... I can?" the giant tree laughed."Really?""How about we try?"The big tree continued to tempt him as if it was staring at food. It was so delicious!Li Hao also licked his lips ... It was so delicious!I can't break the fruit. It's too delicious, it looks delicious!A sword appeared in his hand, and he seemed a little shy.""Then I'll cut the fruit. Senior, please don't cry out in pain!"“……”The giant tree felt that this person was not greedy, but crazy!Cry out in pain?What a joke!This sword, on the other hand, seemed pretty good. It even looked a little familiar.Familiar?Could it be a replica of some powerful divine weapon?At this moment, it spread out a few branches."It's about time, little guy. It's time to come in and feed me!"And Li Hao, holding his sword, fearlessly stabbed forward!What an adorable tree!He didn't guard against me at all, and even opened his arms ... I've never killed such an easy-to-kill strong person in my life.The long sword entered his body!Not even a Dao integration stage super mighty figure would be able to break through a Heavenly King's body so easily, much less the sun and the moon. But in this moment, the Heavenly King's body was like tofu as the sword pierced through it.
