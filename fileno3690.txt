On the periphery, the venerable sovereigns were well-trained. At this moment, although they were unwilling, they retreated in an orderly manner. Li Hao ignored them, even though there were many seventh level venerable sovereigns among them.Instead, he walked step by step into the void towards the huge Hall.The hall of order!Even at this moment, the hall of order was still operating.  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Behind him, Spring Autumn also quickly followed. She walked barefoot in the huntian realm. Her eyes flashed as if she wanted to destroy this realm. This realm was very, very strong!Without a realm, even if huntian's strength would not be reduced much, the experts under him would definitely be affected.Li Hao didn't pay attention to him, either.He took a step into the hall. At this moment, there were not many people here. It was different from the previous clamor. Everyone was resisting his invasion.In the hall of order, countless mirrors appeared.Spring Autumn caught up and looked at the mirrors. He sneered,""There is no privacy to speak of when observing the scenery of the heavens. The entire West is under huntian's observation. This is the nine Heavens!"Li Hao nodded slightly and said in a low voice,""Let's not talk about right or wrong. Monitoring the heavens is actually beneficial in resolving disputes ... Of course, it's not easy to judge whether it's good or bad. To the weak, it's a form of protection. To the strong, it's more of a restraint ..."Spring Autumn was an expert, so she naturally wouldn't like this kind of situation.As for Li Hao, he was also an expert, and he didn't like to be monitored ... But for many weak people, such surveillance might be able to protect their safety.Different positions meant different ideas, so there were no absolute pros and cons.Spring and autumn waved his hand and was about to destroy all of them.Li Hao raised his hand and stopped her again.At that moment, Chun Qiu was truly furious. Her eyes turned cold. She wasn't afraid of Li Hao, and she had given him face. Li Hao had interfered and stopped her several times. She was already furious.She was a demon!Huntian might return soon. If he didn't take advantage of this time to destroy his Foundation, when would he be able to?She hated Li Hao for stopping her!"It's a pretty good thing, it wasn't easy to build it ..."Li Hao said nothing more. He looked at the Nine Worlds in the mirror. Even though there was only a quarter of chaos, he fell into deep thought.A long time ago, he had guessed that the division of the worlds in the nine Heavens might not be purely based on the strength of the worlds, but also ... Dao!It was a kind of order layout that used the world as a chess piece, just like him but more daring than him, and the real world as the Dao.He had entered the huntian realm just to take a look.There was no other reason ... He wanted to split open the sky.Perhaps, he needed to observe how this master of order had set up the world and chaos in the past.Even though this place was only divided into the West, he had some understanding of the East. He had also gone to the North once, and only the South had not been there ... He might be able to find some reference points after observing it.Seeing that he was being ignored, Spring Autumn was even more annoyed.""If you don't quickly finish off these people, do you think you can fight huntian when he returns? He even forced the chaos into giving up his Grade 9 spirit. Do you think your mere 8000 Dao laws can compete with him? Even if you and I join forces, we might not be able to defeat him!""Not to mention, after this battle, he will definitely gain something and become stronger than before!"Li Hao, do you understand?Or was he hoping that the human King and the others would arrive?Who knew what the human King was doing right now!As for long Zhan ... She did know a little. That Dragon was in the South. Of course, he didn't dare to go to the spring Autumn realm directly. Instead, he went to other realms to save his so-called fellow race members.p A large number of chaos beings were being gathered by him.It was obvious that those people might not come at this moment.If they didn't come, they might not be able to match huntian.It was better to kill these rank eights now, destroy huntian realm, and then escape. When huntian returned, it would be too late.When the time came, even if he wanted to take revenge ... He would have to see if there was a chance.Li Hao didn't say anything. He simply looked at the mirrors and observed the worlds. He fell into deep thought. So, this was the plan?The master of order ... Was also a cultivator with great courage.It was a pity that ... Tian Fang and the others had plotted against him.Otherwise, if true order had been established in the past, perhaps ... There was really hope of surpassing tianfang. At the very least, they should be able to rival tianfang, and not be the dominant force today.Li Hao observed all of this, his face expressionless.At this moment, the river of the great path was still the same as before. There was no change.But inside Li Hao's body, his blood and Qi were boiling, and his flesh and blood were constantly regenerating.At this moment, Li Hao was already making preparations for his future, be it the river of paths, time, or order ...His Dao River was very strong, but it was also very messy and chaotic. Many ideas were presented in the Dao River. His Dao River was much stronger than before. He controlled the Dao River and could fight 8000 cultivators of the great path.This was all that Li Hao had accumulated over the years.Killing and plundering, killing powerful enemies, raiding worlds, plundering chaos ...Bit by bit, he had shaped the river of the path into what it was today. However, in his heart, he had always maintained his original thoughts. The river of the path ... Was too complicated, too chaotic. Furthermore, the core of the river of the path had not been built by him.Time had always been the core of the river of the path.However, this time did not belong to her.And now, it had even incorporated a large amount of order power, faith power, and responsibility power ...

He did not want any of this.Everyone felt that Li Hao wanted to split open the sky. They imagined that after Li Hao split open the sky and earth, he might be able to reach level nine and become the master of time, the master of the time path, and control the time left behind by Zhan Tiandi ...But Li Hao had never thought of this.The time King isn't me.The Dao master of time wasn't me.I ... Am not a person who pursues time.Perhaps, some people would think this way, but only I would not think this way.Human body, Martial Master, qi and blood, Dao meridians, internal organs, force, spirit, magic ...Perhaps, this was the pugilistic world he was pursuing, the freedom he was pursuing.As Li Hao thought about this, his flesh and blood shattered and began to reform. Without the path River, Li Hao wasn't very strong. His body was only average. Even though he was nurtured by the path River, he was still considered strong without the path River.He should still have the strength of a seventh step.However, in this chaotic world, right now ... What was the seventh rank?There was no chance at all for a tier 7.But ... It was enough."Even though it's only at the seventh rank, it's the seventh rank that belongs to me. I can't strip it away, I can't devour it, I can't give it up. My Dao belongs to me."The human King's Dao was one, and his Dao was his own. This was also the logic."The origin of chaos is the true source of chaotic energy ..."He looked at the sky as if he was thinking about something.At this moment, Chun Qiu, who was behind him, became even more impatient.""Li Hao, what do you want to do? Are you waiting for death?""Fellow Daoist Spring Autumn, don't you think that the world in the mirror is very beautiful?" Li Hao turned around.Spring Autumn looked over, and his eyes flickered. I advise you to give up on this idea. Back then, the master of order was said to be very powerful, but in the end, he also died on this path!"Obviously, she could tell.  Best novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  But she didn't study it in depth.Perhaps knowing that Li Hao wasn't really just admiring the scenery, Spring Autumn said in a deep voice,""Using countless worlds to construct one's own Dao domain ... To become the master of all chaos, this is the nine Heavens of chaos that order wants to create! But ... This way, the entire chaos will be under his control. A million years ago, there were many level 9s, so why would they bow down to him?""The current huntian is even more overbearing!""That's why ... In my opinion, we should lay low for now and let huntian fight those tier 9 experts first. It's best if we avoid them!" After that, neither side is a good thing, so it doesn't matter if one or two of them die ..."She had a clear judgment of the situation.She had always been doing this.For example, if huntian was powerful, she would weaken him. She could not let huntian eliminate everyone and unify the chaos before the arrival of the level nine divine Emperor.Li Hao didn't say anything. He just stood there and watched for a while.Just as the spring Autumn Emperor was about to turn around and leave Li Hao to face huntian alone, Li Hao turned around and walked out. She didn't really fall in love with Li Hao.He just didn't want Li Hao to be killed by huntian, which would lead to a deviation in the chaos. Or Li Hao would be captured by huntian and become a puppet of order like before ... Which would be very dangerous.It would be best if Li Hao could survive and become an existence that could resist chaos 'unification.At this moment, seeing that he had finally left, Spring Autumn cursed in his heart!So you know fear!If we don't leave now and that guy returns, do you really think we can win in a fight on his territory?Li Hao was thinking about something as he walked.Soon, he reappeared near the realm gate of the huntian realm. Nearby, a large number of venerable sovereigns were eyeing him covetously. They even wanted to stop Li Hao and the others from leaving while waiting for Dao master to return!They could feel that the Dao master ... Was coming back!The few level 8s who had been suppressed by Li Hao in the path River also looked happy.The Dao master was about to return.Order was being rebuilt.Yes, the order power that Li Hao had extracted from the West seemed to be returning. The weak West was now constantly strengthening.Spring Autumn had obviously noticed it long ago, and that was why he was so anxious.Now that Li Hao was at the door, she was no longer in a hurry.He could leave at any time!It was wishful thinking to stop these rotten fish and shrimps. If Li Hao hadn't been stopping them, she would have destroyed the entire huntian realm by now.But now ... Forget it, in case huntian went crazy and hunted her down.Li Hao was unreliable and might not help her."Let's go!"Chun Qiu walked out, but Li Hao stopped.""Daoist friend, please leave first. I will wait for Daoist huntian. My master was in the five elements realm before. Now ... He might have been captured by him." Spring Autumn was stunned and could not help but curse,'you're waiting for death here? Do you really think you're that powerful? Do you think you're invincible with just 8000 Dao laws?"Your master?If your master is dead, then so be it!He was just a weakling, a seventh-grade cultivator. He should just die."Besides, aren't you going to break the origin of chaos and revive the dead? If your master is dead, then resurrect him as well. As long as he's alive, there's hope. Don't you understand this principle?"For the first time, she felt that Li Hao was a wimp!She was furious!Li Hao smiled and said,"fellow Daoist, you can go first. I'm still suppressing six level 8s. Fellow Daoist huntian won't let me kill them. So ... We can exchange hostages. That's why I didn't kill them. Otherwise, it'll be difficult to exchange if we completely fall out."

3692 Chapter 597
It was as if he had been certain from the beginning that his teacher would be caught.There was no choice, the difference was too great.Even if his teacher had devoured the entire five elements realm, even if he had really reached level eight, even if he had reached the level of the five elements Overlord, against hun Tian ... There was no room for him to resist."You ..."Chunqiu was really angry, and his eyes completely changed.""You still want to release these people? Let huntian continue to grow stronger? Huntian threatened you with your master, so wouldn't you work for him?"If that's the case ... I'll kill you first!Her eyes turned fierce!Li Hao, you can't blame me if you insist on this.In an instant, she stopped thinking. This bastard ... Was too infuriating. He charged at Li Hao like an Army of thousands, and countless phantoms appeared. She had already decided to kill this kid!Even the few rank eights of the huntian realm would be killed!How could he really let these people live?Huntian had too many experts under him. Six grade 8 experts might not be able to do anything to her, but what about ten?And the 15th?And more?She wasn't really invincible, a true tier 9. Even if there was a difference, it wasn't so great that numbers didn't matter!Li Hao retreated,"fellow Daoist, why are you doing this?" "If we really get entangled with each other, huntian will return and both of us will be injured. That would really benefit the other party. Before huntian returns and fellow Daoist leaves, we won't really do anything to huntian realm and won't hurt each other's relationship. Now that all the level 9s are here, huntian won't hurt our relationship and give them an opportunity!"He continuously dodged and retreated at an extremely fast speed, as if he was shuttling through time. In fact, time even began to wither and wither ...This made the other party furious!Li Hao, you didn't use the Dao of life and death against hun Tian, but you used the Dao I taught you Against Me!Her eyes were cold and sharp. She had attacked Li Hao several times, but she couldn't do anything to him. If she wanted to kill Li Hao, she might really have to pay a huge price. She also sensed that hun Tianzhen was about to return ...She was so angry that she threw out these harsh words before turning around and disappearing into the void."If you surrender to huntian, I'll be the first to kill you!"In a fit of anger, he instantly disappeared from his spot.The moment she left, the grade 8s in the river all heaved a sigh of relief.Today was unfortunate, but also very lucky.Fortunately, Li Hao had been stopping Spring Autumn kill, so the chaos heaven realm was almost unscathed. Apart from losing some great DAOs, the injuries they suffered were nothing.Unfortunately, there really were people coming this time, and they were two experts. Fortunately, the path master was prepared, and Li Hao ... Had not killed them for his master's sake.This was a blessing in misfortune! When the Daoist master returned ... Everyone would be safe.The biggest threat, Spring Autumn, was gone, so they were much more at ease.At this moment, venerable Pengcheng became bolder and took the initiative to speak,""Silver Moon King, you should know that even if a rank 9 expert were to return, a Dao master would still be able to match him!""This time, you didn't destroy the chaos heaven realm, nor did you kill its cultivators ... Although we've suffered some injuries, they're nothing. If the Silver Moon King can join my chaos heaven realm ... The unification of the chaos will be immediate ..."The old man who had been pierced and suppressed by the sword coughed.""You may not know this, but the ninefold guards were once under the command of the path master of order. There aren't many of us in the ninefold guards, and only 28 of us have survived since then! Including me, 11 rank-8, 17 rank-7 ..."11 rank eights!Other than the ninefold guards, there were also Pengcheng and the other five type 8 powerhouses, a total of 16.At this moment, they still didn't know that huntian had subdued four of the five sects, as well as four other grade 8 cultivators. If they knew, they would be shocked. There were a total of 24 grade 8 cultivators!Even the old Tian Fang didn't have so many grade 8 experts.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Tian Fang's return could be considered a peak period, and he only had 12 grade 8 cultivators.As for the other parties, they might not even be as many as huntian's rank eights even if they added them up. Neo martial, Silver Moon, the chaos race, and the spring and autumn of the South might be able to gather that many rank eights if the four parties joined forces.One could imagine that huntian's power over the years far exceeded everyone's imagination.Li Hao did not say anything.At that moment, he continued to extract the power of the great DAOs of the chaos heaven realm. It was really rich. A top-notch world like this was not any weaker than some rank Nine Worlds. It was even richer than those destroyed rank Nine Worlds.Half of the power of the great DAOs merged into the river of Dao, while the other half was extracted by Li Hao and integrated into his body.The few grade 8s were also being weakened by him.This made Pengcheng a little uneasy!He was still extracting the power of their great DAOs. If this went on ... They might fall from their cultivation realm. This was secondary. The key was that this guy ... Was he planning to fight with the Dao master?Even Spring Autumn did not dare to do so and had already run away.Li Hao dared to do this?…… Primal Chaos void.Beside huntian was Yuan Shuo. At this moment, Yuan Shuo's aura was unstable, fluctuating between level 8 and Level 7. His face was pale, but he didn't say anything.His skills were inferior and he was far inferior.Even though he had killed a rank 8 in the five elements realm, the rank 8 guards were still like children in the face of huntian and were instantly suppressed.He couldn't even run!When he saw that huntian was only trying to capture him, he also realized something. At this moment, as he looked at the group heading west, his eyebrows twitched."My disciple is still in the West?"

"Yes!" Chaos heaven Supreme Emperor nodded slightly. At this moment, his dark power was gradually dissipating and order was returning to him.It returned to its previous peace."Yes, he didn't leave. He only captured my people and didn't kill them. It seems like he's waiting for me to return ... To exchange with him. It seems like he values you a lot.""He asked you to fulfill your promise and destroy the five elements so that you can absorb the power of the five elements to strengthen yourself and advance to the eighth step ..." She chuckled."Your disciple is really dedicated. Don't worry, I won't kill you."Yuan Shuo was silent.Huntian was followed by a large number of experts.Other than a group of grade-8 experts, there were also grade-7 experts.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ At this moment, the commander of the ninefold guards said in a low voice,""Dao master, the power of order has dissipated a lot ..."It didn't dissipate, but was drawn out by Li Hao.They were well aware.In addition, the heavenly order policy was still with Li Hao ... At this moment, the commander of the ninth rank guards was a little angry after quitting his venerable sovereign addiction. That Li Hao was really audacious and was courting death!"I know, it's fine."Huntian laughed and started chatting with Yuan Shuo,""As far as I know, Li Hao doesn't have any other relatives besides your master, right? The people he has been trying to resurrect are his parents and family?" Yuan Shuo remained silent."Fellow Daoist, you don't have to be on your guard. Even if Li Hao were here, he wouldn't mind answering my questions."Yuan Shuo thought about it and agreed.Li Hao ... Actually didn't really want to hide these so-called secrets. He smiled. Although his face was pale, he wasn't that afraid. He nodded. "That's right. It was his parents and friends ... They were all killed by his enemies in the past. At that time, he was only an ordinary person.""Ordinary people ..."Huntian sighed."With the blessing of time, it's really incredible. In just a few years, we have reached where we are today. In fact, I would like to see ... The cultivator who created time is said to be from neo martial arts?""If you want to, you can do it anytime!"Yuan Shuo ridiculed, his courage growing."He committed suicide. If you want to see him ... It's very simple!"As for the other party's opinion that Li Hao had relied on time to get to where he was today ... Yuan Shuo didn't say anything.But ... When did Shi Guang get to Li Hao's side?It was Li Hao who had relied on himself to scheme against li daoheng, Zheng Yu, venerable sovereign Red Moon, Ying Hongyue, and a large group of experts. Only then did he manage to control time and seize the time star.Before this ... Did he rely on this?In Silver Moon, he had relied on himself to get to where he was, step by step. Under the threat of countless people, he had killed them all and seized time. It was not like ... Time had belonged to Li Hao from the start.In Yuan Shuo's opinion, this was putting the cart before the horse!Without Li Hao's rise, he wouldn't have been able to obtain the time star.It wasn't to say that Li Hao had become who he was because of Time and Stars.Huntian didn't care about his words, but the ninefold guards beside him were furious. The few who had just surrendered sighed."You're so stubborn!" Wait ... That might not be the case.Although Li Hao was strong, he was no match for huntian.If you want to threaten the heavens in exchange for your life ... It's as difficult as ascending to the heavens, and you might even lose your life.……In the East.The human King had sent a grade-8 flying with a single slash. At that moment, he looked to the West and could not sense anything very clearly. However, he could still make out some things.Then, he cast a glance in the direction of Alliance City number 9 and curled his lips.'F * ck, he ran away a long time ago, but he's still on guard against me ... I really ... Want to kill him!At this moment, the entire East, level 8 worlds, were almost all under his control.The grade 8 expert who was sent flying was really hurt."Human King, I've already agreed to surrender ..."[Motherf * cker, why did you lie to me?]The human King sneered,"did I ask you to surrender?" I killed my way here, and you suddenly surrendered. You can't do anything to me! I've always killed people. Once you surrender, what should I do to you? If we take you in, we'll be afraid that you won't listen to us and we'll kill you. It won't be good to say that we're killing prisoners, and it'll also tarnish our reputation ... Can't you resist to the end? You have no ambition!"He was very unhappy!The rank eight venerable sovereign opposite him was helpless.I'm clearly no match for you, What should I do if I don't surrender?The chaos is in complete chaos. It's not safe at all. What should I do if I don't surrender?In the past, there were many level eights in the East, but today, some were dead and some were running. Today, two level eights were killed by the human King before they could even surrender. He saw it and became anxious. The white flag was raised before the other party could arrive.I surrender, okay?In the end ... The human King was displeased!No wonder he was so fast and didn't give anyone a chance to speak at all. So ... The human King didn't intend to take in the others at all.At this moment, even the light Thearch sighed.What was this?She was really ... Speechless.In this way, he had profited. At least, when he joined neo martial, they were still very polite, unlike now ... Look, human King wanted to fight to the death with the guy on the other side!In the end, the other party surrendered, and he was extremely angry.The human King was scolding when he suddenly frowned.In the distance, the void fluctuated.It was as if time had passed, as if heaven and earth were withering. In the blink of an eye, an illusionary figure appeared. The human King was about to slash down with his blade. In the distance, the little girl frowned slightly."Human Emperor, please wait. This is only a clone of mine. Killing him won't do anything ... Li Hao is trapped in the West. Huntian has defeated chaos and is on his way back. He has captured his master, Yuan Shuo. Something might happen to him if he remains in the West ..."

It was actually spring and autumn!The human King frowned slightly."He didn't leave?""No, Yuan Shuo was caught."The human King touched his chin and understood. Yuan Shuo had been captured ... Although he was a little surprised, it was understandable. Even if old Li had been captured, he would not leave.Of course, he would fight if he could. If he couldn't win, he would first save old Li's life.Obviously, Yuan Shuo's capture might have caused such an impact, but spring and autumn ... This old witch actually came to ask for help!His eyes flickered,"aren't you over there?" Why are you shouting at me?"Spring Autumn sighed."Li Hao is unruly. I tried to help him a few times, but he was unwilling ... I think that he and the human King share the same bloodline. Perhaps ... He'll be more at ease if the human King is gone."The human King sneered,"how can I not know what you're thinking?" Huntian isn't easy to deal with. Even the descent of chaos couldn't defeat him, and you're counting on us? Of course, I'm not afraid of him ...""Does the human King not care?"The human King shrugged his shoulders."I did. It's already too late. It's so far ... I can't go."​ "It's fine, I can help the human King!""I'll use the life and death technique to travel through time. I'll be able to reach the West in an instant!" Spring Autumn said sincerely.The human King laughed,"why should I save him?" He's not my son, really!"Spring Autumn frowned.Neo martial and silver Moon ... Weren't they one?Had a falling out?At this moment, the Supreme martial artist frowned slightly as if he was thinking about something. He looked at the spring Autumn Emperor and said softly,""Where's long Zhan? Senior, did you find long Zhan? Huntian is powerful, maybe ... If we work together, we can better resist his invasion!""My other clone has already gone to inform long Zhan. If everything goes smoothly ... This time, I might still be able to suppress huntian a little!"The human King was still thinking about something. The Grandmaster looked at the human King, waiting for his decision.At this moment, he didn't want to interfere.At the same time, venerable sovereigns rushed over from all directions. The Thunder Emperor and the others seemed to have received the news as well. They rushed over without stopping, all of them extremely anxious.Li Hao seemed to be trapped in the West.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ As for huntian, he had just resolved the chaos and was now returning.Even a ninth-rank had been defeated, let alone Li Hao.After all, Li Hao was only at level eight, and he was too young. The power of his great Dao laws was only in the thousands. How could he rival huntian?Kong Ji didn't avoid suspicion and said anxiously,""Senior human King ... Fellow Daoist Hao Yue is trapped ... Can you ... Lend a helping hand ...?" "Didn't you say that he ran away? now you're looking for me?"the human King sneered.He laughed coldly and said,"since he dared to stay, did he not make any preparations?."Of course, he suddenly laughed and said,""Alright, go! I'll go and take a look. Everyone's here, so I'll feel more at ease and not be afraid of being targeted by him. If he wants to fight, he won't hit me first. It's good to watch the fun!"He didn't seem to be worried about Li Hao. That guy ... He always said that he was very heartless.If he really couldn't get Yuan Shuo back ... Li Hao wouldn't just sit and wait for his death.Perhaps, there would be a good show in the West.He thought of something, and his eyes moved slightly. Splitting open the sky, the West, was actually a suitable place.Little Li Hao ... What are you trying to do?Chunqiu ... You've fallen for your trap, haven't you? you're welcoming people everywhere, and you're even more enthusiastic than when she's being hunted down. What an idiotic demon.Well, it has nothing to do with me.A free ride would do.He laughed."Then let's do it together. With Chunqiu and long Zhan here, if huntian dares to make a move, we'll beat him to death. With the two great demons here, we'll eat him up in one bite!"“……”The spring Autumn Emperor was speechless.These words ...Of course, she didn't want to say much at this moment. Everyone had to work together to stop huntian from unifying the chaos. That was the key.Otherwise, they wouldn't have an easy time after this.It would be best if he could weaken huntian a little.She was also secretly happy that the human King was still willing to take action. With long Zhan, even if she and Li Hao were killed, they would be able to compete with huntian Yi!As for the Supreme-being, he glanced at the human King and transmitted a message,""You really want to go?""Let's go and take a look!"The human King replied,"I don't know what that kid is up to. Maybe he wants to use this opportunity to do something. Otherwise ... With his personality, it would be a wonder if he would stay in the West. Chunqiu running all over the place to recruit people might be within his calculations. Only that old witch Chunqiu is really afraid that the kid will die there and help the heaven's ... How is that possible?"Li Hao had many tricks up his sleeve if he wanted to leave.The river of time was the best method. It was fine if that guy didn't run away. Otherwise, he could have taken a few level eights with him and replaced them directly. Why would he stay there? the danger would increase!These guys didn't understand Li Hao at all.Perhaps ... This time, the world was really going to change.

Chapter 3695 The King Of Men Who Knows Me (1)
In the West.Outside the chaos heaven realm.Li Hao stood on one side of the world gate, while the river suppressed the six level 8 cultivators. Peng Cheng and the others were still talking, hoping that Li Hao would recognize reality and join them.Li Hao was a little impatient.The longsword appeared and lightly tapped Peng Cheng's head. That huge head ... Was instantly torn apart by the longsword.Peng Cheng groaned in pain.Li Hao laughed as if he was beating a child. "Don't talk so much. You're not huntian after all, right?"Pengcheng instantly fell silent.Can't afford to offend!At this moment, he had no power to fight back against Li Hao. The gap between them was too big.At this time, it was better not to provoke this person. Saving their lives was more important. With the return of the Dao master, they would be saved.The old man, the Vice commander of the ninth rank guards, who had not said anything, also glanced at Li Hao. Li Hao seemed to be thinking about something, as if ... He was not just waiting for the return of the path master.He was a little suspicious, but he didn't dare to ask.Moreover, Li Hao was constantly extracting the power of the West. By now, the power of order in the West and the power of great DAOs in huntian had almost been completely drained by him. Even several level 8s were about to drop in rank.Li Hao, do you want to take this opportunity to get stronger?It must be very difficult.  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ He actually knew a little about Li Hao's situation. Li Hao used world as his Dao. The path master had once said that Li Hao was much stronger than others at the same level. However, his Dao was too strong, making it difficult for him to advance further.It was hard to control.Li Hao, who had 5000 Dao laws, might be comparable to a cultivator with 8000 or 9000 Dao laws. However, it might be even more difficult for him to reach level nine with 6000 or 7000 Dao laws.Everyone knew that using the world as the Dao would make one stronger.Why were there so few people who would do it?In fact, there were.He was the master of order in the past. However, the master of order did not completely create his own Dao. Instead, he laid out his own Dao through existing realms. He was not like Li Hao, who had completely opened his own Dao.This was too troublesome and consumed too much energy. Normal people would not be able to obtain it in their entire lives.It was equivalent to re-opening countless worlds!The grade 8 experts were all well-behaved.Soon, the fluctuation spread.Waves of powerful auras, as if to intimidate or suppress, spread out. Before the chaos heavens had even arrived, black figures had already traversed the void.Pengcheng was overjoyed, and the old man heaved a sigh of relief.He's back!The ninefold guards.In the past, under the command of the master of order, the strongest force had a total of 11 level eights, 17 level Sevens, and 28 top powerhouses! In fact, there were even more back then.Back then, the ninefold guards had nearly a hundred people. However, the master of order had fallen, and a large number of them had died. The remaining people had escaped under the leadership of the withdrawal commander, leaving huntian with a strong foundation.The powerful black shadow was the first to appear, revealing its true appearance. However, it was still somewhat illusionary, hidden in the darkness.These people were the guardians of order."Silver Moon King, let them go!""Dao master will be back soon. Let them go now and retreat on your own. There might still be a chance of survival!" Jinku's voice was cold.A powerful aura appeared in the world.This withdrawal commander was stronger than he had imagined. His aura was no weaker than Li Hao 's, and he was a top-tier expert with a strength of 7000 to 8000 Dao laws.In terms of strength, this guy could even be an Overlord, not weaker than the combined power of the five elements overlords.At the same time, a powerful aura was still approaching from behind.That was huntian.However, he was not in a hurry to come over. It was as if he was looking at something or waiting for something.The ninefold guards continued to approach Li Hao.At the same time, a few five-elements messengers had also arrived. They looked at Li Hao with mixed feelings ...Of course, there was also hatred.Li Hao glanced at the other side and found that one person was missing, venerable fire Yan Emperor.He was probably ... Dead.He only took a glance and didn't say anything. He had interacted with Huo Yan in the past. Huo Yan could be considered a cultivator, and he was actually not bad ...However, in this era, there was nothing they could do if they died in the battle for supremacy.A large number of level 8s had arrived.There were many.The number of level eight Supreme emperors under huntian's command was beyond imagination. Li Hao had suppressed six of them. At this moment, there were 18 level eight Supreme emperors and a large number of Level Seven Supreme emperors outside.24 tier 8 existences!Li Hao was speechless ... Although he was powerful, there were so many venerable sovereigns, and the dark shadow Commander was no weaker than him. If he were to be besieged by these people ... He would only have a dead end.Of course, he might be able to kill a few.However, in the end, he would probably not be able to escape death.There was no need for huntian to interfere.These people were not new rank eight venerable sovereigns. They were all old-time venerable sovereigns, and some of them were even more senior than huntian. Li Hao remained calm. He looked into the distance and smiled.""Daoist huntian, there isn't much conflict between us, and I didn't kill your people. You schemed against me, and I've been passively bearing it. I only broke your scheme ... In conclusion, you're the one who let me down, but I didn't do you any wrong, right?"In the distance, huntian's voice was calm and gentle.""That's not right. If you didn't come to my huntian realm, you wouldn't have come up with any schemes. I was fighting Chaos, but you came to the West ... Right?"Li Hao thought for a moment, nodded, and then smiled.""Can't I take a look? Couldn't he just observe it for a while? Fellow Daoist, you didn't give me a lesson to prevent me from causing trouble. Let's be frank. I do have bad intentions ... But fellow Daoist, you've already done something to me, and you're even worse than me. "

Chapter 3696 The King Of Men Who Knows Me (2)
"You're wrong." Huntian laughed."If you weren't greedy and didn't refine my clone, you wouldn't be like this.""But that was given to me by you. After discussing the conditions, you agreed to give it to me. How is that greed? The price is clearly stated. ""But I didn't say I would refine it for you!"“……”At this moment, the two of them were like serious students, talking about their kindness to each other.These cultivators frowned slightly.He didn't understand.Dao master, is there a need to say so much to Li Hao?  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  It was meaningless!Li Hao was really bold.Who did he think he could threaten by suppressing six rank eights and controlling the huntian realm sect?He was wrong.The West was stable because of the Dao master, not because of the realm or these rank-8s. Even if they all died ... It wouldn't be a big deal to the West.In fact, withdrawal symptoms even felt that killing Li Hao ... Would be better.At that moment, huntian appeared.Beside him was Yuan Shuo ... Of course, there was also a big tiger that had long been dispirited. At this moment, the Tiger was also trembling with fear. It was a little surprised to see Li Hao, as if it had just recognized him ...He cried out bitterly in his heart.This is troublesome.It turned out that chaos was Li Hao ... Fine, the chaos it knew was Li Hao. This guy was indeed ruthless, but ... He was also weak. He clearly couldn't beat huntian.This was really troublesome.Yuan Shuo, on the other hand, was as calm as ever. He shrugged and spread his hands at the sight of Li Hao, as if saying,"I, your master, have been captured. I can't do anything about it. My opponent is too strong, and I'm too weak."Huntian, as always, was like a peaceful Daoist, calm and relaxed.On his face, there was a faint smile.He looked at Li Hao in the distance and said,"let them go. I'll let your master go." Since you don't want to be The Guardian of order, then hand over the heavenly policy of order. I have no intention of killing you, Li Hao. You should know that. "Li Hao nodded."In this era, when time is still under my control, the strong probably don't want to kill me ... Except for the human King."Li Hao laughed,"to be honest, I'm not afraid of you guys killing me!" "You won 't, and those grade-9 cultivators won' t. Unless another time cultivator appears ... You won't kill me before you take away my time!" Of course, that's not necessarily the case for the human King. The human King is on my side, otherwise, I'm really afraid of being killed by the human King ..."He laughed as he spoke.Why?Because ... You all have your own concerns. Perhaps there were human Kings as well, but the human King was a madman. He didn't care about the consequences of losing time ... It was very difficult to deal with people like the human King."But you guys, the stronger you are, the less I'm afraid!Huntian laughed."That's the fear of the other rank-9. It might not be mine. Time ... Might really be able to stabilize chaos and stabilize spirituality, so when the other rank-9 hope arrives, they naturally don't want to kill you. But do I ... Need to? Even if my spirituality is no longer there and I can't descend as a tier 9, I only need to maintain my current strength and I'll be invincible ...""I don't believe you," Li Hao laughed.“……”It wasn't that they didn't believe he wasn't strong, but they didn't believe he was willing to give up and stop improving.What was the use of time?,m Li Hao didn't know, and neither did huntian. Tian Fang and the others might know, but they should all understand that time was the key to stabilizing the spirit of chaos.Since that was the case, how could huntian be willing to stay at this level?After reaching rank-9, he might have to take refuge in the depths of the chaos like the other rank-9s.That was not what he was after."Let go of my teacher."Li Hao said sincerely,"to me, the fact that you've captured my teacher only makes me a little apprehensive. It doesn't change anything else. I've captured Pengcheng and the others only so that they won't cause trouble. I don't think a few tier 8 Masters can do anything to you.""Let go of my teacher and I'll let them go. Huntian, what do you think?""It's nothing," huntian laughed."He's just a cultivator who has just entered level eight and his realm is unstable. He's not worth my fear.""You're staying here and not leaving. What do you want to say or do when I come back?"The others were a little confused.Since he didn't care ... He would just take down Li Hao!Why waste time with him?Huntian, on the other hand, was as peaceful as ever. He did not show any overbearing arrogance to deal with chaos, nor did he show any signs of chaos."I'm just a little confused, so I'd like to ask you, fellow Daoist,"Li Hao explained."Just say it.""Fellow Daoist, you absorb countless power of darkness and chaos and turn yourself into the filth behind order. I'm a little familiar with this. In fact, neo martial does this too, but they're not as ... Straightforward as fellow Daoist! The new martial only allowed Emperor Cang to absorb the power of corruption from the origin. It doesn't include people's hearts, thoughts, and desires. "Li Hao said seriously,"fellow Daoist, you turned yourself into a trash can ... Well, it might be a little derogatory, but it's not really derogatory. I admire your choice very much. But why ... Do you want to absorb everything?"Huntian laughed,"the human heart is greedy, and there is no end to desire!" Everyone only pursues peace and a carefree life ... Isn't such an era good?"Li Hao shook his head."That's not good. Is he very different from a puppet?""Of course it's big!"Huntian laughed again."They have their own thoughts. I'm not destroying their spirit. I'm just expelling and absorbing all the bad sides of them. All that's left is the good side! When the chaos was completely unified, the entire chaos would be on the good side! There will be no more wars, conflicts, and killing. The old will have support, and the weak will have support ... Li Hao, don't you think that chaos will be much stronger than it is now?"

Chapter 3697 The King Of Men Who Knows Me (3)
At this moment, some of the others nodded, while others remained silent.Some of the grade 8s who had just surrendered didn't say anything, and some had uncertain expressions, but they didn't speak.Before Li Hao could say anything, Yuan Shuo chimed in,""Bullshit! It was bullshit! Little Hao, don't listen to his nonsense! Whoever lived in such an era would be better off living in troubled times! Without his own desire, without his greed, without all the negative emotions ... Was he still human? It's human nature to feel seven emotions and six desires!"Huntian laughed."Yuan Shuo, you don't understand. You're too weak. When you reach my level, you'll understand that such a world is great!"Great?Yuan Shuo sneered, as if he did not think much of it.Li Hao also smiled."Teacher, the weak should be polite to the strong. I should also be polite to fellow Daoist huntian. Don't be so arrogant. You're a captive. Be careful that he doesn't kill you in a fit of anger!"Yuan Shuo instantly became dispirited. He was a little helpless as he nodded. That was true.I'm weak!Forget it, I'll just be honest and keep a low profile.Huntian laughed,"you and your master are very interesting." Li Hao, there's not much point in discussing this today. This is my path, and I can only Walk This Way if I want to! Back then, the master of order was willing to save everything, but in the end ... He ended up in a very miserable state! For the sake of their own ambitions and desires, Tian Fang's group of people joined forces to scheme against him and killed him ..."Li Hao nodded."That's true. By the way, you're the reincarnation of order?"He then shook his head and said,'forget it, it's not important! Whether it's a spiritual legacy or something else, since you don't completely follow the path of order, you're a huntian, just like me. I don't like people saying that I'm the embodiment of war ... That's not good. ""Li Hao, that's exactly what I want!"Huntian laughed again.Yes, he didn't like to be treated as an order, and he didn't think of himself as an order.He was huntian!The two of them chatted as if they were waiting for something.After a while ...  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  The void began to fluctuate.Off in the distance, ripples began to appear, and figures began to appear. Each region seemed to have a Spring and Autumn period.After the Spring and Autumn period, some people followed.In the South, long Zhan's figure appeared, followed by several grade 8 cultivators.In the East, the figure of neo martial appeared, and even Thunderlord and the others had arrived.On the other side, a person appeared, but soon, a few more demons appeared. They were all under the command of spring and autumn. At this moment, the spring Autumn Emperor chuckled and looked at Li Hao with his bare feet, as if he was taking credit and showing off.""Li Hao, how is it?"It was as if he was saying, I saved you!The war did not break out."As for me, I've brought with me the most powerful group of people in the chaos.On long Zhan's side, other than long Zhan, there were also black Tiger, Qing Qiu, Hong Yue, Feng Yan, Coiling Dragon, and a new tier 8 cultivator who had just advanced not long ago. Including long Zhan, there were a total of 7 tier 8 cultivators.On the new martial world's side, there were as many as seven rank-8s including human King, sun god, Supreme, Emperor Cang, light, brilliant sun, and a new rank-8 who had just surrendered and had not yet been incorporated into the system.Besides them, Thunderlord, daoqi, kongji, Wushan, myriad transformations, ermao, six level 8 Warriors, and Qian Wuliang who was Level 7 were also here.As for Spring Autumn, he had brought five demons, including the butterfly that Li Hao had seen before.In terms of numbers, even if all of them joined forces, they would only be able to match up to huntian.However, with long Zhan, human King, Spring Autumn, and the others around, if huntian was not strong, then the ninefold guards would not be able to match this group of people.Li Hao glanced at it but didn't pay much attention.He then looked at the human King and the others. The human King had his arms crossed and was chuckling, as if he was just here to watch a show.Long Zhan, who was far away, looked at Li Hao, then at huntian, and remained silent.On one hand, they had come to see how strong huntian was. On the other hand, they had come to stop huntian from killing Li Hao, or rather, subduing Li Hao. Otherwise, it would be very troublesome. Huntian seemed to have expected it and didn't care. He just chuckled,""I welcome all guests to the West! It has been a long time since the West has received so many distinguished guests!""In the current chaos, the type 9 powerhouses are still around. There is not only hatred between us. On the contrary, we are the ones who need to work together to resist the return and arrival of the type 9 powerhouses!""Now, chaos is in turmoil. This is also an opportunity for the type 9 powerhouses to descend. It's not that they can't descend, but their strength will be weakened after descending. However, there are probably more than 20 type 9 powerhouses who have all descended ... Even if they're not as good as me, they won't be any worse than anyone else."The reason so many experts had descended was because their current spirituality was not enough to support them in displaying the strength they had a million years ago.However ... Even if they were only 8000 Dao laws, could they fight against so many people?The tier 9 did not come because he was worried that he would be killed after his strength declined.Take the Lord of Chaos for example. In the past, huntian probably couldn't rival him, but this time, he was almost killed by huntian ... In the eyes of those Grade 9 experts, such a death was too tragic.He might as well wait!Huntian was too lazy to say anything else. He looked at Li Hao."Leave the huntian realm, leave the heavenly policy of order behind, and release them. I'll let your teacher go and we'll forget about this!"The spring Autumn Emperor heaved a sigh of relief.

Chapter 3698 The King Of Men Who Knows Me (3)
This was the best outcome!She looked at Li Hao, waiting for him to let her go.That's enough!He didn't even ask you to return the power of the great DAOs.It was not wise to provoke huntian at this stage.Your master has also been released. He has absorbed a lot of the power of the five elements and entered the eighth rank. You have also absorbed a lot of great Dao power and entered the ranks of the 8000 Dao laws. This time, you have gained the most apart from huntian!Li Hao looked around, then at the human King and the others.He smiled and nodded."That's good. Thank you for your generosity, fellow Daoist ... However, you took the initiative to merge the heavenly order scroll into my Dao River. At this moment, it's almost all over the Dao River. I can't completely remove it, so I probably can't give it to you ..."As soon as these words were spoken, the atmosphere instantly became a little tense.The spring Autumn Thearch's expression changed slightly. He glanced at Li Hao and frowned.Heavenly policy of order ..."Strip it off ..." She had no choice but to say.Li Hao shrugged and said helplessly,"it's not that easy. I didn't do it on purpose. It's just that ... I've completely integrated into the river of Dao. Of course, if fellow Daoist huntian wants it, I can give it to you ..."With that, the heavenly policy of order appeared in the river of the path, but it was a little broken compared to before.This was not important!Huntian only took a look, and his expression changed. He said softly,""Li Hao, are you doing this on purpose?"At this moment, the heavenly policy of order not only contained the power of order, but also countless power of faith. It was as if trillions of people were worshiping it!It was an existence like the sun!Just the thought of it made the few cultivators in the Dao River feel uncomfortable. It was as if countless thoughts had emerged in their minds: protect the human race, protect the human race, protect the human race ...Even huntian was frowning.He was actually using faith.But ... She wasn't as ... Clueless as Li Hao.  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  There was too much power of faith that was entangled with the power of order. If he were to take it back, he might be greatly disturbed.He somewhat understood how Li Hao had resisted the invasion of the heavenly policy of order. Using poison to attack poison!You want me to protect the order, and I want you to protect the human race. Not only do you want to protect the human race, but you also want to die for the human race, sacrifice yourself, and satisfy all the desires of the human race ...And this was the opposite of huntian's Dao of order.The order he governed was for everyone to abandon their desires!You shouldn't have any desires. You just need to live your life honestly. However, the faith that Li Hao absorbed contained all of this, and it was especially strong. If he took back the heavenly policy of order, perhaps ... It would cause a conflict in his own Dao.No wonder Li Hao said that if you want it ... It's not impossible.The premise was that you were willing to take it.Huntian closed his eyes slightly, as if he was thinking about something.After a moment, he spoke,"the heavenly policy of order is the symbol of order and the source of order!" "Li Hao, I have no intention of doing anything to you right now. You should be able to strip away everything on your own, but you can 't. That Hong Yitang of Silver Moon should be able to ... Return the heavenly policy of order. This time, it ends here!"He seemed to be getting impatient.Li Hao seemed to be playing with him!Li Hao shrugged."That won't do. Senior uncle Hong is still a normal person. If so much power of faith is extracted, he'll really become a puppet. Think of a way and try to slowly strip him off ... If you want it, I'll return the heavenly policy of order to you. If you don't want it, just leave it here ...""Li Hao!"Huntian was a little angry."Don't test my patience again and again! Or do you think that you can act unscrupulously just because spring and autumn are here?"Li Hao also regained his calm."I didn't provoke you. You merged into my River of path. In order to resist your invasion, I could only absorb the power of faith to resist your invasion of order!" Is it my responsibility to keep pestering him? If you want it, I'll give it to you. What else do you want?"Huntian was a little irritated.He couldn't tell if Li Hao was deliberately provoking him or if he really couldn't do anything about it. At this moment, he was having a headache.Should he take it back?The problem was how to take back the power of faith.It was very troublesome!If he didn't take it back ... The order in the West might go out of control. He had also mastered the Dao of order, but the power of order in the order heavenly policy was the source of the power of order. It didn't even exist in the chaos great Dao.When he had invaded Li Hao, he had put in a lot of effort.Moreover, he also needed the power of order to suppress the dark turbulence in his body."You ... It seems like you don't care about Yuan Shuo's life?"He slowly said.Li Hao shook his head."I'm not a cold-blooded person. People always like to misunderstand me. I care a lot. Don't you think so, teacher?" You see, I used six rank 8s and the chaos heaven realm to exchange for my teacher, but he has only just reached rank 8...To be honest, are you still not satisfied with this exchange?"Huntian didn't say anything and just looked at Yuan Shuo."What are you looking at me for?" Yuan Shuo was a little helpless. I'm a captive, I can't do anything about it. Besides, didn't he give it to you? You see, I've given you people, the world, and the heavenly policy of order ... You'll just have to suffer a little and strip it off yourself. It's not too troublesome!"Huntian's expression turned ugly.This master and disciple seemed to be acting recklessly!Supreme Emperor Spring Autumn also seemed to want to say something. Li Hao looked at Spring Autumn, smiled, and explained,""Daoist Spring Autumn, I can understand your good intentions. The heavenly policy of order only has some power of faith mixed with some desire ... Actually, it's a good thing to neutralize the order. This way, it can restrain Daoist huntian's dark heart ... And let Daoist huntian return to his clear mind."

Chapter 3699 The King Of Men Who Knows Me (3)
Spring autumn's heart moved.Previously, she had only thought of getting everyone to give up on the war for the time being. At this moment, her thoughts were somewhat drifting.That's right!Using faith and desire to suppress the pure order and completely neutralize it might be able to restrain the dark chaos heaven. It might not be a bad thing."Huntian," she said,"it's just some power of faith. Since Li Hao is willing to return it, you can just take it!" You're also a human. Even I, a monster, didn't say anything, so why do you care about this?"“……”Huntian Supreme Emperor looked at Spring Autumn and said softly,""Chunqiu, are you pretending to be stupid or are you really stupid?" His eyes turned cold."I have always understood your thoughts. However ... As a cicada, you have broken the cycle of fate. You should cherish it and not ... Desire more and have no end. Your desire has already surpassed order and rules!"He then looked at long Zhan in the distance."The rise of the chaos race is not necessarily to unify the chaos. Now, Pengcheng is also living very well. As long as your chaos race follows the rules of chaos or returns to the great Dao universe from the chaos, you will naturally be able to solve many problems ..."Long Zhan did not speak the entire time.Seeing that huntian had taken the initiative to look for him, he also sighed,""The chaos race that has been incorporated into the great Dao universe ... Isn't that the demon race? A demon who had assimilated ... Was even inferior to a demon! The chaos race was originally favored by chaos, but after returning to their home, they became the slaves of chaos, the slaves of the myriad world ... Huntian, since you only care about the rules ... How about letting me control it for you?"He suddenly laughed."I'm not asking for much. The chaos race doesn't have many people. I've actually made some preparations ... The human race is powerful and has many people. I can't really exterminate the human race!"At this moment, he spoke his true thoughts,""Some civilizations have totems and spiritual beliefs. I have an idea, and I'm not sure if you all agree with it. We, the chaos race, can be independent beyond the infinite worlds. However, in order to maintain our spirituality and heritage, the human race ... Can choose one as the civilization's belief totem!""It's just a spiritual sustenance and symbol. We, the chaotic race, will not interfere in the affairs of the human race. As long as we ensure that the generations of the chaotic race will become the spiritual belief of the human race, there will be no problem!"Everyone's expression changed slightly.The human King pouted."We humans only believe in ourselves and not others ... Of course, I'm only talking about me. If others are willing, I don't care. It has nothing to do with me anyway. I, neo martial ... Will not believe in a beast!"Long Zhan looked at huntian. The opinion of the human King was not important. He only looked at huntian,""This time, I'm not here to fight against fellow Daoist huntian. I'm only here to fight for a future for my chaos race! If fellow Daoist agrees, I can even give up on my own ideas and no longer devote myself to the rule of the chaos race over the chaos ... I can withdraw from the struggle for hegemony in the chaos ..."It was a difficult choice to make, but he knew that it was even more difficult for the chaos race to rule over the entire chaos.Since that was the case, it might be better to settle for the second best.Huntian remained silent.At this moment, one sentence might be able to subdue long Zhan, but ... Spiritual faith!Was that even possible?Order was the absolute lack of desire. In other words, all negative things would disappear. As for chaos, it represented barbarism, ambition, and madness. The Western world only believed in order, not ... The so-called Chaos.Even if long Zhan took a step back, it would also be going against him.Huntian didn't reply. Long Zhan understood and smiled. He felt relieved and relieved. At this moment, he laughed lightly,""I understand. I also know that the things I beg for are actually ... Not reliable. It's just that I'm a little timid after seeing how strong you are!"At this moment, he was completely relieved.You can't ask for it!The only thing he could do was ... Fight!He could only fight for it himself.Behind him, the few cultivators of the chaos race were feeling rather complicated right now. The Dragon Master had revealed his cowardice in front of the various overlords. As long as the chaos race was given a chance to survive, he would give up on his original thoughts.But ... No one was willing to give it to him.Even if long Zhan was very strong.That wouldn't work either.Even if all he wanted was a spiritual symbol, he couldn 't.You have no right to make such a request!At this moment, the few powerful beings of the chaos race were all a little angry and sullen. Just like long Zhan, they all fell into absolute silence.The matter had reached a stalemate.Both sides were restraining each other.Huntian was not willing to give up the heavenly policy of order."There's another way ..."  Read Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ At this moment, huntian spoke."Li Hao, since you're unwilling to give up the order heavenly policy, then ... Integrate into order and control Order for the West. I've decided before that you'll join the ranks of order. You'll be the master of order!"Li Hao shook his head.Huntian's eyes glowed with a dark light."I've already been tolerating and taking a step back!"A powerful aura spread out and shook the void.At this moment, the type 8 powerhouses also released a powerful pressure that shook the surroundings.The human King yawned and looked at the crowd, muttering,""Let's do it directly. You two talked for so long, but didn't you do it in the end? You still have to rely on your fists to speak, is there a need to go through so much trouble?"Spring Autumn and the others all looked at the human King speechlessly.
