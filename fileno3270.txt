If a world wanted to reach Grade 7, this was definitely not enough.At this time, the other 10 realm monarchs also took out their gifts.Of the 12 large fields of the chaos alliance, Dragon field was not there. The other 11 fields had sent people. A seventh level venerable sovereign who had advanced to a seventh level world was naturally worth paying attention to.In total, there were five medium-level worlds and many small worlds, a total of 21. There were even more Dao crystals, reaching a total of 800 million.In total, he had more than 1.5 billion Dao crystals.……At this moment, Li Hao was secretly speechless.On average, each of the 11 great worlds had sent hundreds of millions of congratulatory gifts. The Beast of Chaos was quite particular!Looking at the human race, even when sector Lord Sen LAN rose, no one gave him anything.How tragic!Of course, the human race's forces were scattered and didn't belong to anyone, so they naturally wouldn't give gifts to others. On the other hand, the chaos race could be considered a unified force.They were all in the same pot.At this moment, they were not stingy.At the thought of how the Thunderbolt master had struggled and looked pitiful for one billion great Dao crystals, Li Hao felt a little sympathy for him. He looked at the Beasts of Chaos. Here, the gifts they received for advancing to a world were more than one billion.If the dragon world wasn't here, as the sect master, he would have to give them some benefits.Li Hao didn't hold back either. A long river swept over and took away all the gifts.These envoys all frowned.The long river of Dao?This ... Was a newly-advanced Dao universe. Although they didn't understand, they knew a little. It was said that a newly-advanced Dao universe was very scattered, and it was very difficult to quickly form a Dao River.Now ... Was the Earth Dragon advancing quickly, or was this Dao universe not newly born?At this point ... Everyone was even more suspicious.However, he had no choice but to bear with it.,m They couldn't fight back against a seventh-rank venerable sovereign. Even though almost all the venerable sovereigns present were sixth-rank, including Feng Yan, who was at the peak of sixth-rank, in their minds, there was a world of difference between seventh-rank and sixth-rank! Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ Even a dozen Grade 6 experts might not be able to defeat a Grade 7 expert.At this moment, Phoenix Flame sovereign didn't say anything. He just kept fluctuating the power of his great Dao, hoping to send out the news through the great Dao universe and tell his mother that there might be a problem here.The Earth Dragon, perhaps ... Had really betrayed them?Who knows?……At the same time. Fire Phoenix World.The flame Phoenix realmlord instantly frowned. Although the message his daughter sent over wasn't too clear, she could still sense some of it. Something had happened over there?At this moment, the fire Phoenix realm was already close to the Thunder realm.The fire Phoenix World Overlord looked into the distance. It was as though he could see the Thunder World and the lightning Lord. During this period of time, the lightning Lord had been hovering near the entrance of the Thunder World, emitting a pressure that threatened all directions.The flame Phoenix Sector Lord frowned after looking at it for a moment.How could the Earth Dragon rebel?With the Dragon Lord around, who dared to?Although the longxuan had gone over, if they really rebelled ... The longxuan might not be able to take down the other party. As for the Dragon Lord, not to mention that the Dragon Lord had entered tianfang, even if he hadn't entered, there was a battle there. How could he leave rashly?How troublesome!"You two!"At this moment, she looked at the two seventh level venerable sovereigns beside her and frowned.""The situation doesn't seem right. There hasn't been any movement from the Thunderbolt master recently. It seems that something has happened with the Earth Dragon ... Although the longxuan has gone over now ... The existence of the Thunder World prevents us from being distracted ..."After thinking for a while, she said,"let's wait for a while. If the longxuan is unable to take down the Earth Dragon, it might just be a misunderstanding. If it's a misunderstanding, then so be it. But if ... Something really happens to the Earth Dragon, I might leave!" The two of you must be careful. Once I leave, the lightning Master will be in charge of the Thunder World. If we were to fight on our own territory, we can only rely on the two of you to join forces and block him in the Thunder World!""The realmlord ... Is going there?"The old fire Phoenix was surprised.The Thunder World was a big deal!The Earth Dragon had not betrayed them yet. Even if they had, they would have to stick close to them. The one-month deadline was coming soon. The Thunderbolt master had even taken the initiative to contact them, hoping that both sides would sign a great Dao Alliance.You're still going there at this time?The flame Phoenix Sector Lord took in a deep breath,"I'll deal with the weak ones first. If the Earth Dragon is suspicious ... Then we'll be surrounded by enemies. I'll descend there and work together with long Xuan. We'll defeat him as soon as possible!" Moreover ... Feng Yan is still there. ""According to the time, longxuan will definitely arrive in a day ... There's still time!"The two venerable sovereigns looked at each other and nodded.The old man from the Dragon Tribe said softly,"if it really doesn't work out ... I can go to the dragon world as well. With the long Xuan around, I'll try to use the secret technique of the Dragon Tribe to rush over. As for the realm Lord's side, we should prioritize the Thunder World first!""I understand, thank you!"The fire Phoenix Sector Lord didn't say anything more. He was merely feeling a little irritated.The Dragon Master had entered the great path universe and lost contact with her. This was the first reason. The second reason was that there was a problem with the Earth Dragon. The third reason was that the Thunder World was now in a precarious situation, so she had no choice but to stay here.These three things happening at the same time made her a little uneasy.If it was the same thing, then it would be fine.Of course, she quickly added,"it's a good thing that the five demon races didn't move. However, the iron-eating race is too strong. Not to mention the three rank Sevens, the iron-eating Thearch is even at the peak of rank seven. His body is extremely strong and intrepid. Other macro worlds can't touch him ... But the mighty tiger, giant elephant, and Tong Bao near us can also move at critical moments!"Now, these three worlds were also besieging the Thunder World. In addition to the Thunder region behind the Thunder World, there was the fire Phoenix World in front, the Tiger World on the left, and the treasure-connecting world on the right.

Chapter 3271 Entering The Sixth Step_killing The Seventh Step With_sword
However, the giant elephant realm could still move.If the Earth Dragon was really in trouble ... The giant elephant could still get out, so they were not so nervous.The target of the four great worlds was the Thunder World.As for the other Seven Realms, their target was the demon clans of the five worlds. They could not have any fewer. Any fewer, and they would not be able to match the five demon realms.……At this moment, Li Hao quickly extracted a large amount of world power and transferred countless great Dao crystals into Silver moon's great Dao universe.As for himself, he did not absorb any more.This was because Li Hao had filled up 999 realms. Only one realm was left, and he was going to fill it up with the sword realm!Yes, Li Hao had been filling in the other realms before.In Li Hao's opinion, the sword was only a carrier.The way of the sword did not mean that only the use of the sword was the way of the sword.But now, in order to strengthen his offensive power, he had filled the destruction realm, strengthened the destruction, and strengthened the power of destruction. He needed a sword realm to strengthen his sword principle! It was purely the way of the sword!The firmament sword would act as the carrier of the world of swords. In that way, the thousand worlds would be the world of swords, with destruction as the core and the firmament as the carrier ... That way, his thousand-Daoist sword would truly be a success.Before that, it would be best if he could upgrade Silver Moon to a Grade 6 world.A large number of great Dao crystals shattered crazily and surged into the great Dao universe. The small worlds were also quickly integrated into the Silver Moon world by Li Hao. Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ Ever since Silver Moon had broken through to Tier 5, he had absorbed quite a bit of great Dao power.Even when he was at Tian Fang, he had absorbed some of Tian Fang's power.In total, Li Hao had spent at least ten billion great Dao crystals.However, until now, he had not been able to step into a level-six world. The main reason was that the Dao universe was a dual-Dao universe. Although the benefits were great, the consumption was also great. For the dual-Dao universe, perhaps only new martial could do it. Tian Fang could also do it.Next was Silver Moon."Uncle Hong, Qian Wuliang, do you think you have a chance to reach level six?"Li Hao sent a message.At this moment, in the great path universe, the two Dao Masters were also frantically absorbing the power of the great path. The other Silver Moon Supreme emperors were also overseeing the branch, trying their best to absorb the power of the great path and strengthen the entire great path universe.After hearing Li Hao's words, Hong Yitang thought for a while and sent a message,""It's a little difficult ... Level five and level six don't have any problems with great Dao Comprehension, but ... The dual-Dao universes consume too quickly and the consumption is huge ... We have a large number of venerable sovereigns, and the consumption to maintain them is also terrifying ..."This was also why it was much more difficult for Silver Moon to advance in rank than in other worlds. The other worlds would have long entered level six after devouring so many great Dao crystals and worlds."Then ... If I kill another level 7 to fill in the gap, will that work?""This ... Of course you can, but ..."The two Dao Masters 'expressions turned grave.Was he preparing to kill the type 7 Dragon?But once the Dragon Lord was drawn over, it would be big trouble.Li Hao also had his own judgment. After thinking for a while, he quickly sent a message,""The reason why I didn't leave is not because I can't advance to Tier 6, but because I don't want my aura to leak out and be detected by others ... I want to show my weakness to the enemy and see if I can kill that fellow ...""As for the Dragon Lord ..."Li Hao took a deep breath."The Dragon Lord should be in tianfang and the Crimson sun region right now. If he wants to descend and return, he will definitely pass through tianfang ..."He wasn't too sure about the information there, but he knew one thing. Whether the other party was fighting against light or neo martial, they must pass through tianfang world.Thinking of this, Li Hao added,"I think we should contact Dao Qi. At the critical moment, we can ask him to teleport us away ... If the Dragon Lord descends, he will be far away from tianfang. Let's see if we can teleport away during this time ...""Then ... What about the void?"Hong Yitang asked. His original plan was to take down a rank 7 world."I didn't expect a venerable sovereign to return from the dragon world either ... Of course, the best outcome would be that the Dragon Lord and new martial arts have already started a war and there's no time to return!"If that was the case, then he would not run.If he did, then he would make a time difference with the other party. At the same time the other party descended, he would run away. On the Dao chess side, he had absorbed many great Dao crystals last time and had recovered a lot. He had recovered at least the power of the seventh-grade!Before this, they had an unused teleportation opportunity. In fact, Dao chess didn't care about the teleportation opportunity at all. If Li Hao hadn't refused, they might have run away with him.However, the teleportation would consume a lot of energy from such a long distance and so many people. Li Hao had already repaid some favors ... But he would soon owe them again. But at this point, Li Hao didn't care anymore.He had to try!At this moment, Kong Ji also sent a message through the river of time,""Don't worry about me. If the Dragon Lord really descends, we'll run back to Tian Fang first! The tianfang Dao universe has yet to recover, and only Li Hao can open it. Let's hide in the Dao universe for a few days first ..."Only Li Hao could open the tianfang universe, which had yet to recover. The other people's stars of the great path were most likely in a state of Nirvana.In this case, there was still a guarantee of safety."Then it's decided!""I'll advance to rank six when the venerable sovereign of the dragon clan arrives," Li Hao said."I'll attack the Phoenix Flames and trigger the chaos lightning tribulation. When the rank seven lightning tribulation descends, I'll draw the lightning into my thousand-path sword and kill the rank seven venerable sovereign as quickly as possible!"

Chapter 3272 Entering The Sixth Step_killing The Seventh Step With_sword
Li Hao had already planned this out.He had signed an agreement with the fire Phoenix Sector that he could not attack Feng Yan and the others. If he did, he would trigger the chaos lightning tribulation ... And that was exactly what Li Hao wanted. He was currently cultivating the sword of destruction, and the lightning tribulation was just right for him.Forcing the lightning tribulation into the thousand destruction swords before killing the seventh rank venerable sovereign was also his plan.Otherwise, he wouldn't have let these people stay around Feng Yan's side.Moreover, when they signed the agreement, there was one more thing. Other than Feng Yan and the two seventh-level venerable sovereigns, the other venerable sovereigns in the fire Phoenix realm would trigger the lightning tribulation if they attacked Li Hao. So, Li Hao was not afraid of the many venerable sovereigns in the fire Phoenix realm.No matter how many, you won't dare to touch me. If you touch me, that's just right!With that in mind, Li Hao began to weave his own thousand-realm Dao domain. Meanwhile, solitary and the Silver Moon martial masters began to absorb the power of the worlds. Li Hao's last realm was directly integrated into the earth Dragon Realm.This was the filler of his last realm.As soon as the other party came, he would attack immediately and not give the other party too much time to prepare.……In the chaos.A giant dragon shuttled through the void at an extremely fast speed.At this moment, the giant dragon was also puzzled. There were much fewer small worlds nearby. At first, he thought that he had gone to see the advancement of the Earth Dragon Empyrean world ... But even when he was almost there, he did not see many worlds. There were a few on the way, but there were very few.Why was the dragon world so desolate?At this moment, he could already see a world in the distance, but ... It seemed like there was only this world. What was going on?There were many venerable sovereigns nearby.At this moment, she seemed to have seen him.All the venerable sovereigns were extremely excited. The arrival of venerable sovereign longxuan was faster than expected. He did not even need a day. He arrived in half a day."Greetings, venerable!""Greetings, venerable longxuan!"The group of venerable sovereigns quickly fluctuated the power of their great DAOs from far away. Their excitement was beyond words.It's here!This time, they were at ease.Whether there was a problem with the Earth Dragon or not, they would soon know.Sovereign longxuan's speed increased. In an instant, he teleported over from a distance. The moment he stopped, he transformed into his human form. His nose twitched and a strong smell of blood could be smelled.Strange!Where did such a strong smell of blood come from?He looked around. What about the other worlds?And ... He looked into the distance. The Earth Dragon World had always been overflowing with the aura of the Earth Dragon Thearch, but at this moment ... His eyes flashed, as if he could see through that layer of disguise. Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ Eh?Long Xuan was taken aback. This ... This wasn't an Earth Dragon. The Earth Dragon's aura seemed to have dissipated. Damn it, what was going on?Several venerable sovereigns stepped forward quickly, as if they wanted to explain the situation to him.However, at that moment, long Xuan's expression changed and he transformed into his original form. A giant dragon floated in the air and roared,""Who are you? How dare you act so atrociously in my Dragon World!"It was not an Earth Dragon! He instantly sensed that something was wrong.At this moment, a man emerged from the Earth Dragon World. He only had the aura of a rank five but his face was calm."Longxuan? The Earth Dragon has already pledged its allegiance to me, Silver Moon. I am silver Moon Li Hao!"What?Everyone was shocked, and some were at a loss.Silver Moon ... What was going on?Some people knew about Silver Moon, while others didn 't. When it came to new martial artists, everyone knew about him, but Silver Moon ... The person in front of him was only at Tier 5."It's you guys!"However, Emperor longxuan immediately understood and shouted,""How audacious!"He instantly knew that the Silver Moon King and the Forsaken desolation had joined forces to ambush the Earth Dragon. Damn it, these two bastards! A golden light flashed in his eyes as he looked around."Bright Hall, why are you hiding?"The sacred central crypt must be here!Wherever Li Hao was, the Son of God of light would definitely be there.The void split open and a destructive force filled the area. Kong Ji walked out and laughed,""Greetings, sovereign longxuan. I have changed my name to Kong Ji!""So it's you guys!""How dare you! If tianfang universe had not suddenly opened, your divine light plane would have been destroyed ..." Long Xuan was furious.Kong Ji was shocked when he heard this.Li Hao was also stunned. He was about to attack, but he suddenly stopped. His eyes flickered.The opening of tianfang universe?How come I didn't know about this?According to my judgment, even if all the major realms were to nurture it, it would be difficult to open it without a few years. Why is it so fast?"When did this happen?"Li Hao instantly asked, but long Xuan was unwilling to answer. In his anger, he directly attacked!It's none of your business when it happened!These two little B * stards actually dared to break into the core of my Dragon World!Damn it!He should be killed!The Earth Dragon might have been killed by them. These two had killed Qi Shui in the past and really launched a sneak attack. The Earth dragon's brain wasn't flexible, so he might have been killed by the sneak attack. However, he wasn't the Earth Dragon at this moment!"Let's join forces and kill them!"He didn't dare to be too careless. With a loud shout, there were many venerable sovereigns nearby, many of them at level six. And he went straight for Kong Ji!Kong Ji was a peak Tier 6 expert. Moreover, he was at the three extremes of the six paths. Many people knew about this. When he had destroyed Tian Fang last time, the news had also spread. This person could probably fight with an ordinary tier 7 expert.What a terrifying character!If he killed Kong Ji first, the Silver Moon King wouldn't be a threat.At this moment, Li Hao was overjoyed. The tianfang great Dao universe had recovered?

That's impossible ... Unless it's a trap!Who did this?He wasn't sure, but the probability was ... Neo martial?Was it?He wasn't sure either, but he knew that there was a high chance that it was fake. That meant ... There was a high chance that the Dragon Lord and the others would be trapped if they entered.The heavens are helping me!No, if it was done by new martial arts, then the heavens were helping him. It was new martial arts that thought of the same thing as him and made a big deal!This was in line with the character of the human King.But for Li Hao, this was a great opportunity."The tianfang great Dao universe has opened!"Li Hao roared, as if he was confirming, telling Kong Ji, and also venting!All of his previous worries had disappeared.If the Dragon Lord doesn't return, do you think I'm afraid of you?"Open!"With a loud roar, the heavens and earth trembled. Even the chaos was shaking. In an instant, the entire Earth Dragon World collapsed!A long river appeared in the sky.Above it, a thousand realms appeared, covering the sky and the sun. The entire chaos seemed to be filled!At this moment, Li Hao roared and attacked the venerable sovereigns indiscriminately!It wasn't strong!However, the power of the great Dao swept across the world, including Feng Yan and the others. At this moment, Feng Yan was still shocked that the Earth Dragon Thearch might be dead. Suddenly, she was stunned. At this moment, she was attacked.It was not serious.However, the next moment, she seemed to have touched something. She suddenly looked at Li Hao in disbelief ... She seemed to have touched something. Was it ... The great Dao agreement?How was that possible?I don't know him at all, so how could I have any connection with him?Such a thought flashed through his mind.A moment later, the primal Chaos tribulation lightning appeared!Seventh grade lightning tribulation!In the blink of an eye, dark clouds appeared and transformed into a human. And at the moment she was attacked, the flame Phoenix World Overlord had sensed that something was wrong. He was about to break through the void and descend ...Suddenly, his expression changed.Primal Chaos lightning tribulation?The great Dao contract had been triggered, and chaos lightning tribulation seemed to have appeared on his daughter's side. It even had some connection to the fire Phoenix realm, so where did the chaos lightning tribulation come from?Black Dog?The thought came to her mind and her expression changed. She didn't dare to descend immediately. If she descended now, she might be under the primal Chaos lightning tribulation. Damn it, did the Black Dog attack her daughter?……"You ...""Black Dog?" Supreme Emperor Phoenix Flame was also shocked. No, who is the Black Dog Emperor next to me?"She turned her head to look ... And her eyes almost popped out of her head. The Black Panther, which had been inconspicuous, suddenly attacked and tore a few venerable sovereigns nearby into pieces with a single claw!It did not sign any great Dao contract.As for the chaos lightning tribulation, it was not worried. Li Hao was already used to it.At this moment, Li Hao's long river rippled, and a thousand worlds emerged to attack Feng Yan. At the same time, he could also restrain the fluctuations of the other party's great Dao universe, preventing the fire Phoenix Sector Lord from descending.He didn't kill Feng Yan. That Fire Phoenix realmlord wouldn't risk his life to come here, right?I can't care about this!The moment the lightning tribulation appeared, Li Hao charged at it. A longsword appeared in his hand. The longsword instantly turned into a world, and the entire Earth Dragon World collapsed!As soon as he charged out, venerable longxuan, who had made contact with Kong Ji, used his mental energy to check on him. He was instantly destroyed by the lightning tribulation. He was secretly shocked. A rank seven lightning tribulation ... This Silver Moon King was truly crazy. He would often trigger Primal Chaos lightning tribulations.Was he going to advance to the sixth step?Just as he was thinking, a punch came, six divine punches!Today's Kong Ji was also extremely violent. He didn't need the Nirvana world at all. He directly merged the six DAOs and punched out. The sky collapsed and the earth cracked!Before this, he had not revealed it to anyone other than the Earth Dragon.BOOM!A huge fist appeared. The Dragon race had an extremely strong body, even stronger than the earthly Dragon beast. However, he was still hit by the opponent's fist. With a loud bang, the longxuan Thearch was knocked back and Kong Ji's aura was weak.A bloody gash appeared on the Dragon's body, and blood flowed out.Long Xuan found it unbelievable!He knew that the two of them had killed a level 7 before, but to be able to break through his defenses with a single punch, such offensive power was still somewhat shocking.He instantly turned solemn!Just as he was about to go all out to deal with Kong Ji, the lightning suddenly disappeared. How did it disappear in an instant? Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  He wanted to check it out, but Kong Ji burst out in an instant. Six divine fists were thrown out like violent Dragons. The situation was reversed. At this moment, it was as if he was the Beast of Chaos and long Xuan had become the human with a weak body.BOOM!The huge fists bombarded crazily!Long Xuan had no choice but to focus on resisting. This guy's explosive power had really reached the seventh tier and could not be underestimated. As for why the lightning tribulation disappeared in an instant, he could not be bothered to think about it.At this moment, under the shocked gazes of Feng Yan and the others, Li Hao roared and merged the worlds into one!The sword glowed with light, and a destructive energy instantly appeared.,m The destructive sword instantly swallowed the lightning tribulation. The lightning tribulation seemed to be on the verge of erupting and shattering the entire world. At this moment, time appeared and froze time and space, suppressing the lightning tribulation for an instant!It was enough.It only needed an instant.At this moment, Li Hao had reached Level 6 in one step. His aura had soared, and the Qianjie had turned into a domain of destruction. The densely packed little Jie made people's scalps tingle.The few sixth level venerable sovereigns turned pale with fright!How could he be so strong?"Thousand swords!""Break!" Li Hao shouted in a low voice. Cracks suddenly appeared on the long sword. Even the firmament sword, which had entered the fifth step, seemed unable to withstand the sudden burst of energy.

Chapter 3274 Entering The Sixth Step_killing The Seventh Step With_sword
To be on the safe side, Li Hao let out a roar and seemed to turn back time. He let out another low roar and slashed again. At this moment, the stacked ninth refinement exploded!The attachment Dao instantly followed the void and attached itself to long Xuan!The grade-6 cultivators in front of him weren't his targets, they were too weak.He wanted to kill long Xuan in an instant! He didn't give the other party any chance.The thousand swords instantly stacked together. The two swords merged into one, and the destructive lightning broke through the time freeze and exploded!The firmament sword had just leveled up not long ago, but it was starting to break again. A fifth-tier sovereign weapon was completely unable to withstand the explosion of this sword."Kill!"The sword fell!Long Xuan, who was fighting with Kong Ji, had just managed to suppress Kong Ji when his expression suddenly changed. A cold intent emerged from his back and his dragon scales stood up straight. That coldness almost froze him!What?BOOM! Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  The moment the sword was drawn, a Thunderbolt exploded. It was a seventh-grade Thunderbolt, and it was mixed with two sword intents and a thousand sword intents.It was as if 2000 Worlds had smashed into his body in an instant.2,000 realms!BOOM!The sound of an explosion reverberated through the entire chaos. The huge Dragon's body was blown apart and cut in half in an instant. A level 7 giant dragon was split into two by this sword!The physical body of a Dragon was even tougher than the earthly Dragon beast 's. However, it was still sliced apart by the sword!"Roar!"The crazy roar shook the entire Dragon World. The crazy roar of the long Xuan stunned the emissaries from the macro worlds.How could it be?A Type 7 Dragon!It was an almost invincible race among the chaos beasts. At the same level, the Dragon race was also an extremely powerful existence. However, such an existence had been cut in half by a single sword!At that moment, the universe of the great path seemed to have appeared above long Xuan's head. It was as if a wave of pressure had seeped in, but ... That pressure was suppressed back.At this moment, even though the Dragon Lord could not sense everything extremely clearly, he knew that something had happened.Longxuan had been seriously injured by someone, and his great Dao had almost been cut off.How did this happen?……He did not give the Dragon Lord any time to think, nor did he give long Xuan the chance to escape.The sword cut it in half. In the next moment, Li Hao let out a low roar, and time appeared. He held the broken sword and slashed at the chaotic great Dao that extended from the great Dao universe. His eyes were indifferent, and he slashed again. It was not as powerful as before, but it was not something a stage-six could hope for.With one sword, the Qianjie reappeared.BOOM!Loud sounds, cracking sounds, collapsing sounds, and collapsing sounds erupted in an instant under everyone's shocked eyes!The two halves of sovereign longxuan's body suddenly started to collapse.Countless great Dao crystals and Dao accumulation crystals gathered at this moment.The illusory image of longxuan appeared with a look of confusion and unwillingness. He was somewhat puzzled and shocked.I ... Was killed by a sixth-rank in an instant!'I'm a seventh rank venerable Emperor, the strongest venerable Emperor of the Dragon race in the chaos race, and I have the support of a great world ... Although I'm not a Dao master, I'm a seventh rank venerable Emperor from an eighth rank world!' However, he still couldn't block the other party's sword. His strongest body was cut off by the other party's sword, and he no longer had the chance to resist.The great Dao had collapsed!If it was any other day, the Dragon Lord would be able to descend instantly and even save him. But today ... The Dragon Lord seemed to be unable to come."Li Hao ...""Silver Moon King ..." A voice murmured,"Silver Moon King ..."He had rushed back from Tian Fang as if he had just rushed back, only to be killed by a sword and witness the rise of an expert!A seventh level venerable sovereign had been killed with a single strike. Even if the other party had used some special means, he could still dominate this chaos, this four-sided domain. He could be called the Overlord!BOOM!The image exploded, and only this loud sound could be heard in the entire world.At this moment, a universe appeared above Feng Yan's head. In an instant, a hand appeared, grabbed Feng Yan, and disappeared instantly!He didn't descend, he merely brought Feng Yan away. The Voice of the Fire Phoenix realmlord reverberated,""Li Hao, the Silver Moon King? Silver Moon King ... The Dragon field will definitely kill you with all its might!"She did not descend because she sensed that long Xuan had been killed instantly. Even if she had descended, she would have suffered a great loss.Unless he brought two stage seven experts with him ... However, if he brought two stage seven experts with him, then the lightning Master would definitely attack the fire Phoenix realm Lord. At that moment, the fire Phoenix realm Lord came to a realization. These two might be in cahoots!He had thought that this was an opportunity, but now, he realized that the fire Phoenix realm had been restrained by the Thunder realm!In fact ... There might even be a problem with the Dragon Lord's entry into tianfang universe. Otherwise, how could the Silver Moon King dare to be so impudent and kill a seventh stage venerable sovereign of the dragon world?It was a trap!Li Hao's voice resounded between heaven and earth,""The Dragon Lord isn't here, so what can you do to me?"His laughter resounded through the world!The Dragon Lord really can't come back.Hahaha!"Without an eighth-rank spirit beast, even though firephoenix and the others are strong, they can't surround and kill me ... In their dreams!"I'm coming to the Dragon field!Li Hao's aura soared. With a swing of his sword, he killed venerable sovereigns one after another. The great Dao universes fluctuated, but no one descended!In the distance, there seemed to be a wave of lightning fluctuations in the Thunder World!"Congratulations, fellow Daoist!" Thunderlord Hong's voice resounded through the heavens.Even from a distance, the other party did not forget to congratulate him. Even though he could not clearly sense it, he knew that Li Hao had killed a seventh-rank!The powerful force that erupted even swept out of the Dragon Realm.The human race had once again risen to power.The four-sided domain had once again produced a top-notch existence.As for how he killed them, that wasn't important. The power of that sword strike was something that all the grade 7 experts who sensed were extremely wary of. Otherwise, why wouldn't anyone come?At this moment, Li Hao smiled.It was extremely brilliant!It's been three years. I've been in the chaos for three years. I finally have some power to protect myself."Clean up the battlefield and devour the longxuan ... Let's go!"The long river of the great path swept across the world, and everyone disappeared in an instant.This was the only place where countless vengeful souls seemed to be wailing.The entire Dragon World had almost turned into a graveyard.

Chapter 3275 Everyone's Gone Crazy (1)
The Silver Moon King Li Hao had killed long Xuan with one strike!The Dragon field was boiling.All the rank Seven Worlds could sense it. At this moment, the Dragon field, which had been quiet for many years, started to shake.……Thunder World.The Thunderbolt master laughed out loud. The Silver Moon King had exceeded everyone's expectations. He had killed the Earth Dragon and the longxuan. It had been many years since a Type 7 expert had fallen in the dragon world. This time, two of them had died!Sure enough, this Silver Moon was indeed a descendant of the neo martial arts.In the past, they had heard that the rank Sevens who had died in the red moon region had something to do with the Silver Moon King. However, no one had believed it before. They had only thought that the Silver Moon King had caused chaos with the neo martial artists!But today ... He understood. It really wasn't the case. This group of Silver Moon cultivators was a disaster on their own!However, just as he finished laughing ...Three Grade 7 auras instantly appeared.The flame Phoenix Sector Lord had appeared.At this moment, her eyes were ice cold as she looked at the Thunderbolt master and said coldly,""You ... Have long been in cahoots with him, right?"Otherwise, how could there be such a coincidence!Did they just happen to be together?The Thunderbolt master's eyes flickered."Firephoenix, the one-month deadline isn't up yet.""Do you think I'm an idiot?"The fire Phoenix realmlord was incomparably sinister. At this moment, he still believed in the one month deadline?"Thunderlord, you are seeking your own death!""Originally, if you were to drag things out, you would still have a chance to live ... Now ... You will definitely die!""Surround and kill all the cultivators of the Thunder World!"The great path of the universe fluctuated, and the power of fire spread. At this moment, the fire Phoenix knew that this guy had no intention of fighting one-on-one at all. He was just trying to divert her attention. At this moment, how could she wait any longer?Kill the Thunderbolt master!Even if he couldn't kill him, he had to completely suppress the Thunder World!In an instant, hundreds of venerable sovereigns appeared nearby.The pressure of venerable sovereigns swept across the world.The three tier 7 existences surrounded the Thunder World. Nearby, the Tong Bao realm, Wei Hu realm, and the giant elephant realm were rapidly moving towards this place. The aura of tier 7 existences burst out from the Three Realms and surrounded the Thunder World!The Thunderbolt master cursed in his heart!In the Four Realms, the fire Phoenix realm alone had three level Seven venerable sovereigns. As for the remaining three realms, the Tiger realm had two level Seven venerable sovereigns, and the rest only had one each, making a total of seven Level Seven venerable sovereigns!The fire Phoenix was still at the peak of the seventh rank.Seven against one! He clearly couldn't win.He didn't waste any words. It was obvious that these guys couldn't tolerate his existence. He quickly took control of the big world. Half of the half-hidden thunder World was in the Thunder region. At this moment, he quickly hid in the Thunder region.If he couldn't win, he could only Dodge!However, it was too dangerous to enter the lightning territory. Fortunately, he had obtained many great Dao crystals this time, which could last for a while and neutralize the chaos tribulation lightning power in the realm. Otherwise, he would not have dared to bring the realm into the lightning territory so easily!"Fire Phoenix, come at me if you dare!"The Thunderbolt master snorted."Long Xuan is dead. The Earth Dragon is dead. I think that the Dragon Lord will not be able to gain anything from the three regions. I will wait for you to die before coming back!"BOOM!Thunder and lightning erupted, flashing across the heavens and earth. The entire Thunder World rapidly advanced towards the Thunder region.He couldn't win in a fight, so he could only run.And at this moment, the eyes of the flame Phoenix realmlord were cold as he watched silently.Thunderlord, it's been so many years. Do you really think that we've been idle and haven't done anything?Just as the Thunder World was about to completely disappear into the Thunder region, suddenly, the Thunder World seemed to have stopped for a moment. The entire region suddenly trembled violently.The Thunderbolt master, who was still at the world gate, instantly looked down at the world and the entire Thunder World. In an instant, his eyes turned red!In the realm, where the source of the world was located, a sixth rank venerable sovereign destroyed half of the source of the world with one punch, causing the entire world to shake violently and show signs of destruction.It wasn't broken, but only some of the world's origin was broken, causing the world to show signs of destruction. Destruction could be restored.The Thunder monarch's expression changed instantly. He gritted his teeth and said in disbelief,""I don't dare to trust anyone! After the Silver Moon King's warning, I even began to doubt myself, but I never suspected you ..." Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  After Li Hao reminded him that there were more spies, he had indeed become much more careful. Over the years, he had treated all the outsiders as spies.It could be said that he had already gone too far.He was even a little suspicious of the local venerable sovereigns.There was only one person that he didn't suspect, but instead, he trusted. He even had him guard near the world's origin. The world's origin was the source of life in the entire world. Once it was destroyed, the world would die.It was very important!Under normal circumstances, this was controlled by the world Master. If the Dao master and the world Master were one person, it would be controlled by the Dao master. However, the Thunder Emperor needed to face a large number of powerful enemies from the outside world to push the Thunder World into the Thunder region. It was best to have someone help him. He controlled the great path universe, and it would be faster if someone helped him control the world power.But now ... The person he trusted had destroyed the source of the world, causing the entire world to be in a state of half-destruction.He was not a Beast of Chaos and did not have the ability to devour worlds.The world came to a standstill, and he had no way of bringing the world forward to escape into the lightning territory.At this moment, the Thunderbolt master simply could not believe it. Who was this sixth stage venerable sovereign?He was considered half his master!There was a venerable sovereign who was even more senior than him. Before he had become the Thunderbolt master, this person had always helped him. But now ... He was truly in disbelief.Near the source of the world, the sixth rank venerable sovereign's face was old. He sighed and said softly,""I'm not going to say that the Thunder World can't hold on any longer, and I'm not going to say that it's to save the Thunder World ... Nor am I going to say that it'll be better if you join the primal Chaos Beast ... I just want to say ... That the Thunder World has already become your burden. Leave the great Dao universe and become an itinerant cultivator. You'll still be the invincible Thunder Emperor!"

Chapter 3276 They've All Gone Crazy (2)
The old man didn't want to say anything more.Let's go!The Thunder World no longer has any future. After being sealed off for so many years, the Thunder World can't make ends meet and has long become a burden for the Thunder master. Have you ever seen a seventh rank venerable sovereign who used his own Dao accumulation crystal in exchange for a great Dao crystal?The Thunderbolt master was one of them.Even wandering cultivators would not go so far as to do so.He had never heard of anyone using their own Dao accumulation crystal to exchange for a bit of a great Dao crystal. For a Grade 7, this was simply a huge joke.Let's go!Leaving the great path universe and giving up the Thunder realm, whether it was wandering around the three regions or going outside the Thunder region, a seventh level venerable sovereign, and a thunder element venerable sovereign at that, would be able to do well wherever he went.And here ... There was no future.The Thunderbolt master's eyes were cold,"I'll call you teacher this one time, and it'll be the last time I'll call you teacher!" You ... Can't make any decisions for me! Even if you want to do it, you have to ask me!"He was extremely furious. At this moment, he was both angry and sad.Even his own teacher was not optimistic about the future. He was in despair.Whether it was for the sake of freeing him or to seek refuge with the chaos race ... At this moment, he only felt sorrow and helplessness. He had been betrayed by his own teacher!"The Silver Moon King has killed two tier 7 experts, and the neo martial artists are still fighting the dragon Lord. Our Thunder World still has a chance!"He roared madly with boundless disappointment!He had been in a good mood just now.At this moment, he was no longer in a good mood.He felt that he still had hope.However, in everyone's eyes, there was actually ... No hope.There was no hope at all.There were seven seventh level venerable sovereigns nearby, three of whom were world Lords. The Thunder World was already extremely empty. If they entered the Thunder territory again, they would only be struggling at death's door. In that case, why not ... Surrender?Now that the fire Phoenix had surrendered, the Thunderbolt master had left the great path universe and entered the Thunder region. As a thunder element venerable sovereign, he could cross the Thunder region. The other party would not pursue him, and he would be free from this!Outside, the flame Phoenix Sector Lord laughed. His voice resounded through the heavens and earth."Thunderlord, a wise man submits to circumstances! At this moment, you have retreated. Those are your exact words. We only want the Thunder World, not your life! It's also not the lives of the humans in the Thunder World, or the venerable sovereigns!""If you want Dao crystals, monarch weapons, or worlds, we can give them to you!""If you want to destroy the entire Thunder World, those humans and venerable sovereigns of the Thunder World have fought for you and protected you for many years. Do you ... Have the heart to kill them?"The Thunderbolt master's body trembled.At that moment, he really wanted to destroy the Thunder World and not let these chaos beasts obtain it.However, at this moment, the words of the fiery phoenix realmlord were truly heart-piercing!The Thunder World!Tens of billions of humans and dozens of venerable sovereigns had followed him for countless years. They had been suffering and never had a good day ...They had been hiding all the time and didn't have any resources for venerable sovereigns to cultivate. It was easy to imagine how miserable they were. Each and every one of them suffered from the brilliance of the destructive power. After a period of time, it would erupt. Some people died, while others struggled to survive.He had destroyed the world ... But what about them?His eyes were still filled with anger, despair, and pain.At this moment, venerable sovereigns appeared one after another. Some had complicated expressions, some had angry eyes, and some roared,""I'd rather die than submit!""I won't be a captive or slave of the beast clan!"In the end, there were still people who were unwilling to live.However, there were still many venerable sovereigns who were silent.Some of them were local venerable sovereigns who had been fighting alongside the Thunder Emperor, but ... It had been too many years.It was too painful here.Without any cultivation resources, the lightning tribulation would frequently strike them and the destructive power would constantly devour them. It was a kind of destruction to their body, will, and spirit. They couldn't see any hope. Even now, they couldn 't.The Thunder Emperor looked at them and gritted his teeth. He looked at the old man beside the source of the world and said in a low voice,""If you want to surrender ... You can tell me. Why ... Are you making decisions for those of us who don't want to surrender?""Because...We knew you wouldn't agree," the old man sighed."So, you can destroy the origin of the world?"The pressure from the Thunder Emperor shook the world. The next moment, he gritted his teeth and let out a furious roar. The great path of the universe fluctuated, and with a loud rumble, the old man's expression changed slightly. Finally, he sighed.BOOM!The great Dao was broken!In front of a Dao master, the great Dao was in the Thunder World, but he chose to betray. He had no power to fight back and would die without a doubt.He wasn't Wu Shan. He wasn't as strong as Wu Shan, who could resist the killing of the daosource.At this moment, the Thunderbolt master still chose to attack!Outside, the flame Phoenix Sector Lord's expression changed slightly.The Thunderbolt master still wanted to resist! She was not afraid of resistance. What she was afraid of was that the other party would go crazy and destroy the entire Thunder World.As for the Thunder Emperor, he had directly killed that sixth stage venerable sovereign. His eyes were cold and contained some pain."If you tell me that you want to surrender ... I can let you go and make you surrender."You're my teacher. I won't stop you if you want to leave.Not only you!The local venerable sovereigns had been fighting with him for many years. They had held on for many years. He could really understand that they couldn't hold on any longer. They could leave ... If they wanted to. Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  But why ... Did he betray them?After destroying the source of the world, the Thunder World no longer had any other choice.Some of the venerable sovereigns 'faces were pale, while the Thunderbolt master sighed."Those who want to leave ... Go. Tell me, and I will move your DAOs out. Now that the Thunder World is weak, there is not much power of the great Dao for you ... Every venerable sovereign who leaves can bring 30 million great Dao crystals ..."

Chapter 3277 Everyone's Gone Crazy (3)
Some people were stunned, while others found it hard to believe.The Thunderbolt master had even killed his own teacher!This ... Would he let everyone leave?At this moment, the Thunderbolt master shouted in a clear voice,"Fire Phoenix!" I won't surrender! However ... I'm not going to stop some people from surrendering ... Let them choose whether they want to surrender to you or leave by themselves!"Outside, the fire Phoenix Thearch's eyes flickered, and a smile appeared on his face.It was a good thing!The Thunderbolt master was at his wit's end.With fewer venerable sovereigns, the great path universe would inevitably be much weaker. This was another method to weaken the Thunder master. The Thunder World was already weak, and if more venerable sovereigns left, it would become even weaker!This way, the lightning Lord's capital for a life-and-death struggle would be greatly reduced."Thunder Emperor, I've said it before. I'm not trying to kill you ... Nor am I trying to kill anyone in the Thunder World ... If they want to join the fire Phoenix realm, they can become Foreign Affairs elders. We have more than a hundred Foreign Affairs Supreme emperors and many humans ... If they want to leave, I won't stop them. But now, the four-square region is in turmoil, and the future of rogue cultivators is very uncertain ..."The Thunderbolt master sat in the sky above the Thunder World, not saying a word. His eyes were a little dead.Right now, these people were only worried about one thing. They were worried that he would destroy the entire Thunder World. Therefore, they were willing to negotiate with him. In reality, after the Thunder World became immobile, he no longer had the capital to deal with them!Seven rank seven venerable sovereigns ... Even if they were to chase him into the Thunder World together, they would still have the power to kill him.From the joy before, to the despair now.It was just a thought!The lightning Emperor laughed at himself in his heart. 'To think that I'm still full of confidence. I thought that the Silver Moon King's explosion and killing of a tier 7 would definitely cause some commotion, and my chance would come at this moment ...'And now, everything had become fleeting clouds! Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  "Those who want to leave, go!""What's the point of staying?" Thunderlord's voice resounded in all directions.The Thunder Emperor smiled faintly."All these years, you have understood me. Since you have said ... That you want to leave, I will not make things difficult for you!"At this moment, in the end, a few venerable sovereigns bowed slightly to the Thunder Emperor with complicated feelings before flying out. The great Dao had also left the Thunder World universe at this moment and regained its freedom.A torrent of Dao crystals gushed toward them.30 million great Dao crystals were a parting gift from the Thunder Emperor. He did not blame these people. He could only say that he was too weak and could not let them see hope.He had killed his teacher simply because his teacher had not asked him. He had made a decision that the entire Thunder World had no choice but to make.That was betrayal!Among the venerable sovereigns, some were in pain, some were stupefied, and some sighed ...Gradually, about half of the venerable sovereigns had left.In the vast Thunder World, a rank seven world, there were only about 20 venerable sovereigns left.Such a number was not even comparable to that of a medium-scale world or a rank-five world. Even a stronger world might have this many venerable sovereigns. When Senlan was at the sixth rank, her venerable sovereigns were in their thirties or forties.As for the Thunderbolt master, he glanced at them. At this moment, the great path universe was much weaker. He looked at the people who were left behind and laughed bitterly."Why aren't you leaving?""Why are you leaving? let's fight them to the end!""At worst, I'll just die!""This group of beasts eat people for fun. Do you want me to learn from those trash and associate with these beasts?""The Thunder World is the only human world in the Dragon field. As long as the Thunder World still exists, I will fight to the end!"“……”Some people roared, some people were unwilling!They knew that if they stayed, they would definitely die, so what?The Thunder monarch laughed and looked at the entire world. Suddenly, he sighed in his heart. 'That's right. I can still fight, but they...What about these humans?Although the Thunder World had very few people, there were still ten billion humans.These people were the people of the Thunder World.[Even if you surrender, you won't have a good ending. But ... Are you going to be destroyed with me?]Countless thoughts appeared in his mind."Fire Phoenix, you want to kill me and take the Thunder World ... I'll give you a chance!" He said after a while.He laughed out loud."Let's continue the bet. You and I will sign a life and death agreement. Let's fight to the death!" If I lose, I'll die, but I'll leave the great path universe to you!""If I win ... I won't kill you. You will give up a rank six world and let me release the people of my Thunder World. I ... Will also leave the Thunder World to you. However, you will have to let us go in accordance with the great Dao agreement!"Outside, the fire Phoenix Thearch's eyes flickered.Winning or losing, one would obtain the Thunder World.A complete Thunder World!If the other party won, they would only have one request, which was to take away all the people of the Thunder World, the ten billion human race, and the insignificant venerable sovereigns.Can I?Naturally, she wanted to completely exterminate them and get rid of any future trouble. However ... At this moment, this might be the best choice. The Thunderbolt master no longer had the ability to take the Thunder World away. He had no choice but to give up on the Thunder World.As for if he really won and took the people of the Thunder World away, what harm was there in that?Moreover, could he win?The fire Phoenix knew that the Thunderbolt master was still unwilling to give up. Perhaps he wanted to kill it in the battle!He said that he wouldn't kill him, but if he really had the chance, even if he risked the primal Chaos lightning tribulation, this guy was a lightning-type after all, so it was still possible for him to kill him ... But could the lightning Lord really kill him?She saw through the Thunderbolt master's thoughts with a single glance!The flame Phoenix Sector Lord chuckled,"alright, I'll agree to it!" If they signed a great Dao agreement, those who violated it would be punished by the level eight chaos lightning tribulation! Thunderbolt master, if you can really defeat me, kill me, and survive the eighth-grade lightning tribulation ... Even if I die, I'll accept it!"

Chapter 3278 They've All Gone Crazy
In fact, even if they didn't fight, she might agree if the Thunder Lord took these people away and gave up the great path universe as a condition ... But she would definitely hunt them down after the matter.Since the Thunderbolt master didn't say anything, it was obvious that he understood this logic. Why not give it a try? perhaps, he might be able to kill the fire Phoenix.At this moment, the fire Phoenix Thearch didn't care about anything else.She had to kill the Thunderbolt master first!Although the deaths of long Xuan and the earth Dragon had nothing to do with her, and the disappearance of countless worlds in the dragon world had nothing to do with her ... The Silver Moon King had previously impersonated the Black Dog Emperor and signed a great Dao alliance with the fire Phoenix World. When the primal Chaos lightning tribulation appeared, she knew what the problem was.Although the Dragon Lord might not punish him for this, but ... If the agreement between Feng Yan and the other party was exposed, the Dragon Lord would definitely be disappointed.This was something she could not tolerate. Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  He had to completely take down the Thunder World!In fact ... He could even kill the Thunder Emperor and eliminate all future troubles in the entire Thunder World."Thunder Emperor, I, Fire Phoenix, am not a vicious person. I can sign the great Dao agreement. I can even promise you that, regardless of the outcome, your venerable sovereigns can take these humans and control a rank six world and leave together ...""But you ... You have to stay this time!" Thearch Fire Phoenix laughed.The Thunderbolt master looked at her coldly. After a long time, he laughed."Alright!""Alright, then let's sign the agreement of the great Dao!"The fire Phoenix was also overjoyed. For hundreds of thousands of years, she had never succeeded in conquering the Thunder World. This time, she had finally succeeded in her hands.It would not have been in vain for him to have spent so much effort in the Thunder World over the years.As for the venerable sovereign who was killed by the Thunder Emperor, she had also paid a huge price. As for the so-called "for the good of the Thunder Emperor"... The fire Phoenix was too lazy to say much. In order to bribe this person, the price she had paid was beyond imagination.He had even promised him that after the matter was over, he would let him lead a rank 7 world. Of course, there was no need for that now, and it saved him a lot of trouble.……On Li Hao's side, he had just killed a rank seven, which caused a great stir in the Dragon field.The changes in the Thunder World also made the experts of the primal Chaos around the world happy.The Thunder World had been taken down!After taking down the Thunder World, the seven seventh rank venerable sovereigns would be free. At that time, it wouldn't be too late to besiege the Silver Moon King. However, if they were to take care of both sides at the moment, it would be easy for them to fail.This was actually the way the chaos race chose to give and take.It had to be said that these guys had a clear target. If a few seventh-rank powerhouses really came to kill Li Hao, the Thunderlord might still have a chance, but he wouldn't make such a choice.……In the depths of the Dragon field. At this moment, the Silvermoon world was crazily absorbing the corpse of a level Seven Dragon. Li Hao, on the other hand, was frowning slightly. He had seen and heard everything that had happened in the Thunder World because he had previously fused the Queen's great path star into his own Ethereal Plane and given it to the Thunder monarch.​ It was originally a precaution.In the end ... Li Hao didn't expect that the Thunder World, which had persisted for so many years, would be broken through from the inside at this moment. The origin of the world was half-destroyed, so it wasn't too difficult to revive it ... All he had to do was pay some great Dao crystals and an expert skilled in the way of revival.For example ... Emptiness.However, at this moment, outside the Thunder World, there were a total of seven rank seven venerable sovereigns, three of whom were world Lords ... Alright, to the primal Chaos race, the difference between world Lords was not too great. However, there was still a slight increase in power.Li Hao looked at the Silvermoon universe, which was still devouring the longxuan Galaxy, and then at the excited Kong Ji ... He smiled and suddenly said,""Brother kongji, are you confident in taking on a rank 7 by yourself?""Me?"Kong Ji fell into deep thought and shook his head."I can resist for a while, but to kill him ... I can't do it. Let's not even talk about killing him. As time passes, my recovery power will no longer be able to recover. I'll definitely lose!"He still had this bit of self-awareness.He could fight with a tier 7 and even hold on for a while, but if time passed, he would definitely lose.Li Hao nodded. He looked at the two Dao Masters who were still devouring and said,""If Silvermoon reaches Tier 6, he'll definitely be able to fight against a tier 7. If you can do the same, with me ... We'll actually be equivalent to three tier 7 experts!"Kong Ji's eyes moved slightly."If you truly advance to the seventh step ... You'll be much more powerful than an ordinary seventh step cultivator, right?""Of course!""If I can enter Level Seven," Kong Ji laughed."I'll become a six path three extreme venerable sovereign. I can't say I'm invincible among Level Seven venerable sovereigns, but I'll be able to suppress Ordinary Level Seven venerable sovereigns!"Li Hao's eyes were filled with madness."In that case ... Do you dare to try again?""What?""Seize the great world!"Which large realm?Kong Ji looked at him, but Li Hao chuckled in a low voice."Fire Phoenix!""What?""The fire Phoenix is going to fight with the Thunder Emperor! The battle between two experts at the peak of the seventh step ... The Thunder Emperor agreed to hand over the Thunder World. At this moment, the Thunder World can not move. The Thunder Emperor is determined to fight to the death with the other party!""As for us ... We should take this opportunity to break into the fire Phoenix realm. The other party still has two seventh-rank experts on guard. In addition, there are a large number of Foreign Affairs venerable sovereigns and local venerable sovereigns ... But at this moment, they are all attracted to the Thunder World. The Thunder Emperor and the fire Phoenix are fighting. Those venerable sovereigns will most likely enter the Thunder World and occupy it first. If we set up an ambush in the Thunder World ... We may have a chance to kill the seventh-rank experts!""If there's no chance ... Then I'll take the opportunity to attack the fire Phoenix!""If there's still no chance ... Then ... After the Thunder Emperor leaves, I'll devour the Thunder World!"

Chapter 3279 They're All Crazy (1)
Devouring the Thunder World?"Is ... Is this okay?" Kong Ji couldn't help but ask.This isn't appropriate, right?Li Hao was speechless."The Thunder monarch has already agreed to give up the Thunder World. If he really does give up the Thunder World ... Won't the Beasts of Chaos benefit from it?" he thought. In fact, this is the safest way. The Thunder Emperor will give it up regardless of the outcome. Since he signed the great Dao agreement, in order to protect the ten billion humans, he will probably really give it up ... In that case, since he doesn't want to break the agreement, let's help him swallow and digest it!"Kong Ji's heart moved. He had to say that this was the safest way.He didn't need to care about Thunderlord!Regardless of whether he won or lost, he would have to leave the Thunder World. During this period of time, there would definitely be an empty period. At this time, a world without an owner could be said to be the easiest to devour!No one retaliated.It was very simple, it could be devoured.At that time, the fire Phoenix would probably cry.However, Kong Ji quickly said,"I think ... If it's possible, we should still save the Thunderbolt master!" The other party has brought the Thunder World along and persisted in the Dragon field for hundreds of thousands of years. It's not entirely for his own safety. It would be much better for him to be a rogue cultivator than now. I think the Thunderbolt master really has the intention of setting a benchmark for the human race ..."The Thunderbolt master had been sealed off all these years. Actually, being an itinerant cultivator might really be much better than now.However, the other party had always been unwilling to leave the Thunder World. Obviously, the identity of the only ruler of the human race's realm in the Dragon field was one of the key reasons why the Thunderbolt master was unwilling to leave. The human race in the entire Dragon field was almost hopeless. At least, there was still some hope with the Thunder World. Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  Li Hao thought for a moment and nodded."Yes, I'll think of a way. We'll sneak into the Thunder World while no one is paying attention to us!"This was the most covert method!Otherwise, it wouldn't be easy for them to get close to the fire Phoenix realm. And the Thunder realm and the fire Phoenix realm were right together."Once Silver Moon advances ... I'll take you guys through the river of time!"At this moment, Li Hao smiled."I'll truly walk through the river of time. Or rather, I'll walk through the river of memories. Those Level 7s won't be able to discover it at all!""Then ... Let's wait and see!"Kong Ji was quite interested.At this moment, the entire Silver Moon world trembled, and the great Dao universe suddenly fluctuated. In an instant, the auras of the two Dao Masters began to rise. After devouring a level Seven expert and consuming countless resources, Silver Moon finally stepped into level six with Li Hao on this day!When he was at Tian Fang, Li Hao felt that he could make it, but it turned out that he was still far from it.Today, he had finally advanced.Li Hao was overjoyed, and so were Qian Wuliang and the others."Everyone," Li Hao quickly said,"enter the great Dao universe. The Black Panther will devour the Silver Moon and take him with us. We'll walk through the river of time and pass through my Mirage to the Thunder World!"The crowd instantly forgot about their joy and quickly became extremely serious. Li Hao said in a deep voice,'this time, whether it's devouring the Phoenix or the Thunder World, brother Kongtong has been at level six for too long. This time ... His only goal is to reach Level Seven!' Everyone will have to give it their all ... Without brother kongji's help, we wouldn't be where we are today. I won't be able to reach rank 6, and I, Silvermoon, won't be able to reach rank 6!""It's my style to repay a favor. Do you all understand?""Understood!"Everyone shouted!Repaying a debt of gratitude was the style of martial masters. Indeed, without emptiness, they would not have made it to where they were today. It would have been difficult for them to kill Li Hao, the Earth Dragon, and long Xuan by themselves.Solitary's strength, Nihilum zone, recovery power, and healing power had all helped everyone a lot.At this moment, Kong Ji was a little embarrassed.""It's not that bad, we'll help each other ..."He was a little embarrassed, but Li Hao smiled and said,""This is the legacy of a Silver Moon Martial Master, and we will always repay any kindness we receive. There's no need for you to be so humble. You're the reason why we're able to reach this stage today. If you don't advance to tier 7 this time ... We'll be too ashamed!"As the sound of his voice faded, the time star appeared. At this moment, the time star was even more powerful than before.The thousand-world encirclement!The power of the thousand worlds gathered into the stars of time. An illusionary River of memories appeared. It could also be called the river of time.Li Hao took a deep breath."Let's go! Follow me into the Thunder World!"In the Thunder World, he had left behind a Mirage.After entering, the Thunder monarch might be able to sense it. However, other than the Thunder monarch ... No one else had the ability to do so!At this point, even if the Thunder monarch sensed it, he would not say anything. Even if Li Hao's group really took away the Thunder World, the Thunder monarch would probably not care.This was also the reason why Li Hao was so bold as to directly walk through the river of time.……The group of people quickly entered a River.Huge waves surged to the sky!Some people were swaying and trembling, but Li Hao led them straight in one direction. The chaos outside seemed to have turned into an illusory world, hazy and unclear.They even saw some worlds that were pierced through by the river, but the beasts of primordial chaos were completely clueless!At this moment, everyone, including Kong Ji, was shocked!This ... The power of time was truly too miraculous.Walking along the river, Li Hao was also having a hard time. However, they were so fast that time seemed to have stopped. They moved forward and crossed worlds. Soon, they seemed to see lightning flashing in front of them!……At that moment, outside the realm gate, the Thunderbolt master, who was signing the great Dao agreement, frowned slightly.
